parallel universes is called a  multiverse   although this term can also be used to describe the possible parallel universes that constitute reality  While the terms  parallel universe  and  alternative reality  are generally synonymous and can be used interchangeably in most cases  there is sometimes an additional connotation implied with the term  alternative reality  that implies that the reality is a variant of our own  The term  parallel universe  is more general  without any connotations implying a relationship  or lack of relationship  with our own universe  A universe where the very laws of nature are different   for example  one in which there are no relativistic limitations and the speed of light can be exceeded   would in general count as a parallel universe but not an alternative reality  The correct quantum mechanical definition of parallel universes is  universes that are separated from each other by a single quantum event   Contents 1 Introduction 2 Science

Hell  Olympus  Valhalla are all  alternative universes  different from the familiar material realm  Modern fantasy often presents the concept as a series of planes of existence where the laws of nature differ  allowing magical phenomena of some sort on some planes  This concept was also found in ancient Hindu mythology  in texts such as the Puranas  which expressed an infinite number of universes  each with its own gods  1  Similarly in Persian literature   The Adventures of Bulukiya   a tale in the One Thousand and One Nights  describes the protagonist Bulukiya learning of alternative worlds universes that are similar to but still distinct from his own  2  In other cases  in both fantasy and science fiction  a parallel universe is a single other material reality  and its co existence with ours is a rationale to bring a protagonist from the author s reality into the fantasy s reality  such as in The Chronicles of Narnia by C  S  Lewis or even the beyond the reflection travel in the two main works of Lewis Carroll  Or this single other reality can invade our own  as when Margaret Cavendish s English heroine sends submarines and  birdmen  armed with  fire stones  back through the portal from The Blazing World to Earth and wreaks havoc on England s enemies  In dark fantasy or horror the parallel world is often a hiding place for unpleasant things  and often the protagonist is forced to confront effects of this other world leaking into his own  as in most of the work of H  P  Lovecraft and the Doom computer game series  or Warhammer 40K miniature and computer games  In such stories  the nature of this other reality is often left mysterious  known only by its effect on our own world  The concept also arises outside the framework of quantum mechanics  as is found in Jorge Luis Borges short story El jard n de senderos que se bifurcan   The Garden of Forking Paths    published in 1941 before the many worlds interpretation had been invented  In the story  a Sinologist discovers a manuscript by a Chinese writer where the same tale is recounted in several ways  often contradictory  and then explains to his visitor  the writer s grandson  that his relative conceived time as a  garden of forking paths   where things happen in parallel in infinitely branching ways  One of the first Sci Fi examples is John Wyndham s Random Quest about a man who  on awaking after a laboratory accident  finds himself in a parallel universe where World War II never happened with consequences for his professional and personal life  giving him information he can use on return to his own universe  While this is a common treatment in Sci Fi  it is by no means the only presentation of the idea  even in hard science fiction  Sometimes the parallel universe bears no historical relationship to any other world  instead  the laws of nature are simply different than those in our own  as in the novel Raft by Stephen Baxter  which posits a reality where the gravitational constant is much larger than in our universe   Note  however  that Baxter explains later in Vacuum Diagrams that the protagonists in Raft are descended from people who came from the Xeelee Sequence universe   One motif is that the way time flows in a parallel universe may be very different  so that a character returning to one might find the time passed very differently for those he left behind  This is found in folklore  King Herla visited Fairy and returned three centuries later  although only some of his men crumbled to dust on dismounting  Herla and his men who did not dismount were trapped on horseback  this being one folkloric account of the origin of the Wild Hunt  3 C  S  Lewis made use of this in the Chronicles of Narnia  indeed  a character points out to two skeptics that there is no need for the time between the worlds to match up  but it would be very odd for the girl who claims to have visited a parallel universe to have dreamed up such a different time flow  4  The division between science fiction and fantasy becomes fuzzier than usual when dealing with stories that explicitly leave the universe we are familiar with  especially when our familiar universe is portrayed as a subset of a multiverse  Picking a genre becomes less a matter of setting  and more a matter of theme and emphasis  the parts of the story the author wishes to explain and how they are explained  Narnia is clearly a fantasy  and the TV series Sliders is clearly science fiction  but works like the World of Tiers series or Glory Road tend to occupy a much broader middle ground  Parallel universes are considered parallel because there is no way of reaching them  All other dimensions are not parallel  but more than likely most of them are  An Einstein Rosen bridge  or Wormhole  can take you to a different dimension  Note that the journey through space time continuum could backwards age you  or wipe you from existence  More than likely  if you managed to get to the alternate dimension  then you would have no memory of how you got there  The dangers of time space travel are still being investigated  and possibilities are growing  Typically  parallel universes fall into two classifications  The first may be more accurately called a  diverging universe  whereby two versions of Earth share a common history up to a point of divergence  At this point  the outcome of some even happens differently on the two Earths and the histories continue to become more different as time elapses since that point   E g  Parallels  Star Trek  The Next Generation   The second type is where despite certain  often large  difference between the two Earths history and or culture  they maintain strong similarities  In such cases  it is common that every person in one universe will have a counterpart in the other universe with the same name  ancestry  appearance  and frequently occupation but often a very different personality   e g  Mirror  Mirror  Star Trek  The Original Series    edit  Science fiction While technically incorrect  and looked down upon by hard science fiction fans and authors  the idea of another  dimension  has become synonymous with the term  parallel universe   The usage is particularly common in movies  television and comic books and much less so in modern prose science fiction  The idea of a parallel world was first introduced in comic books with the publication of Flash  123    Flash of Two Worlds   In written science fiction   new dimensions  more commonly   and more accurately   refer to additional coordinate axes  beyond the three spatial axes with which we are familiar  By proposing travel along these extra axes  which are not normally perceptible  the traveler can reach worlds that are otherwise unreachable and invisible  Edwin A  Abbott s Flatland is set in a world of two dimensions  In 1884  Edwin A  Abbott wrote the seminal novel exploring this concept called Flatland  A Romance of Many Dimensions  It describes a world of two dimensions inhabited by living squares  triangles  and circles  called Flatland  as well as Pointland  0 dimensions   Lineland  1 dimension   and Spaceland  three dimensions  and finally posits the possibilities of even greater dimensions  Isaac Asimov  in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition  described Flatland as  The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions   In 1895  The Time Machine by H  G  Wells used time as an additional  dimension  in this sense  taking the four dimensional model of classical physics and interpreting time as a space like dimension in which humans could travel with the right equipment  Wells also used the concept of parallel universes as a consequence of time as the fourth dimension in stories like The Wonderful Visit and Men Like Gods  an idea proposed by the astronomer Simon Newcomb  who talked about both time and parallel universes   Add a fourth dimension to space  and there is room for an indefinite number of universes  all alongside of each other  as there is for an indefinite number of sheets of paper when we pile them upon each other   5  There are many examples where authors have explicitly created additional spatial dimensions for their characters to travel in  to reach parallel universes  In Doctor Who  the Doctor accidentally enters a parallel universe while attempting to repair the TARDIS console in Inferno  The parallel universe was similar to the real universe but with some different aspects  Douglas Adams  in the last book of the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy series  Mostly Harmless  uses the idea of probability as an extra axis in addition to the classical four dimensions of space and time similar to the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics  Though  according to the novel  they re not really parallel universes at all but only a model to capture the continuity of space  time and probability  Robert A  Heinlein  in The Number of the Beast  postulated a six dimensional universe  In addition to the three spatial dimensions  he invoked symmetry to add two new temporal dimensions  so there would be two sets of three  Like the fourth dimension of H  G  Wells   Time Traveller   these extra dimensions can be traveled by persons using the right equipment   edit  Hyperspace Main article  Hyperspace  science fiction  Perhaps the most common use of the concept of a parallel universe in science fiction is the concept of hyperspace  Used in science fiction  the concept of  hyperspace  often refers to a parallel universe that can be used as a faster than light shortcut for interstellar travel  Rationales for this form of hyperspace vary from work to work  but the two common elements are  at least some  if not all  locations in the hyperspace universe map to locations in our universe  providing the  entry  and  exit  points for travellers  the travel time between two points in the hyperspace universe is much shorter than the time to travel to the analogous points in our universe  This can be because of a different speed of light  different speed at which time passes  or the analogous points in the hyperspace universe are just much closer to each other  Sometimes  hyperspace  is used to refer to the concept of additional coordinate axes  In this model  the universe is thought to be  crumpled  in some higher spatial dimension and that traveling in this higher spatial dimension  a ship can move vast distances in the common spatial dimensions  An analogy is to crumple a newspaper into a ball and stick a needle straight through  the needle will make widely spaced holes in the two dimensional surface of the paper  While this idea invokes a  new dimension   it is not an example of a parallel universe  It is a more scientifically plausible use of hyperspace   See wormhole   While use of hyperspace is common  it is mostly used as a plot device and thus of secondary importance  While a parallel universe may be invoked by the concept  the nature of the universe is not often explored  So  while stories involving hyperspace might be the most common use of the parallel universe concept in fiction  it is not the most common source of fiction about parallel universes   edit  Time travel and alternate history British author H  G  Wells  1895 novel The Time Machine is an early example of time travel in modern fiction  Main articles  Time travel and Alternate history The most common use of parallel universes in science fiction  when the concept is central to the story  is as a backdrop and or consequence of time travel  A seminal example of this idea is in Fritz Leiber s novel  The Big Time where there s a war across time between two alternate futures each side manipulating history to create a timeline that results into their own world  Time travelers in fiction often accidentally or deliberately create alternate histories  such as in The Guns of the South by Harry Turtledove where the Confederate Army is given the technology to produce AK 47 rifles and ends up winning the American Civil War   However  Ward Moore reversed this staple of alternate history fiction in his Bring the Jubilee  1953   where an alternative world where the Confederate States of America won the Battle of Gettysburg and the American Civil War is destroyed after a historian and time traveller from the defeated United States of that world travels back to the scene of the battle and inadvertently changes the result so that the North wins that battle   The alternate history novel 1632 by Eric Flint explicitly states  albeit briefly in a prologue  that the time travelers in the novel  an entire town from West Virginia  have created a new and separate universe when they re transported into the midst of the Thirty Years War in 17th century Germany   This sort of thing is known as an ISOT among alternate history fans  after S M  Stirling s Island in the Sea of Time  an ISOT is when territory or a large group of people is transported back in time to another historical period or place  citation needed  Typically  alternate histories are not technically parallel universes  Though the concepts are similar  there are significant differences  In cases where characters travel to the past  they may cause changes in the timeline  creating a point of divergence  that result in changes to the present  The alternate present will be similar in different degrees to the original present as would be the case with a parallel universe  The main difference is that parallel universes co exist whereas only one history or alternate history can exist at any one moment  Another difference is that travelling to a parallel universe involves some type of inter dimensional travel whereas alternative histories involve some type of time travel   However  since the future is only potential and not actual  it is often conceived that more than one future may exist simultaneously   The concept of  sidewise  time travel  a term taken from Murray Leinster s  Sidewise in Time   is often used to allow characters to pass through many different alternate histories  all descendant from some common branch point  Often worlds that are similar to each other are considered closer to each other in terms of this sidewise travel  For example  a universe where World War II ended differently would be  closer  to us than one where Imperial China colonized the New World in the 15th century  H  Beam Piper used this concept  naming it  paratime  and writing a series of stories involving the Paratime Police who regulated travel between these alternative realities as well as the technology to do so  Keith Laumer used the same concept of  sideways  time travel in his 1962 novel Worlds of the Imperium  More recently  novels such as Frederik Pohl s The Coming of the Quantum Cats and Neal Stephenson s Anathem explore human scale readings of the  many worlds  interpretation of quantum mechanics  postulating that historical events or human consciousness spawns or allows  travel  among alternate universes  Frequent  types  of universe explored in sidewise and alternative history works include worlds in which the Nazis won the Second World War  such as in The Man in the High Castle by Philip K  Dick  SS GB by Len Deighton and Fatherland by Robert Harris  and worlds in which the Roman Empire never fell  such as in Roma Eterna by Robert Silverberg and Romanitas by Sophia McDougall  In his novel Warlords of Utopia  part of the loosely linked Faction Paradox series  Lance Parkin explored a multiverse in which every universe in which Rome never fell goes to war with every universe in which the Nazis won WWII  The series was created by Lawrence Miles  whose earlier work Dead Romance featured the concept of an artificially created universe existing within another  specifically  within a bottle   and explored the consequences of inhabitants of the  real  universe entering the Universe in a Bottle  In the His Dark Materials trilogy  the universe the protagonist starts in is a Victorian counterpart to ours  although it takes place at the same time  It also appears that the Protestant Reformation never happened  In his short story  Rumfuddle  Jack Vance invents a doorway to an infinite number of universes at any given time  so that everyone on the planet can have their own private world  Some are inhabited by humans  On some  man doesn t exist  The trouble comes when some of the Rumfuddlers  a term given to an annual gathering to see who can best mess around with what should be  play pranks on parallel world  such as switching the infant Adolf Hitler with a baby from a Jewish couple  or putting together a football team made up of all of the great men in history   edit  Counter Earth The concept of Counter Earth is typically similar to that of parallel universes but is actually a distinct idea  A counter earth is a planet that shares Earth s orbit but is on the opposite side of the Sun and therefore cannot be seen from Earth  There would be no necessity that such a planet would be like Earth in any way though typically in fiction  it is usually nearly identical to Earth  Since counter earth is always within our own universe  and our own solar system   travel to it can be accomplished with ordinary space travel  See Counter Earth for literary and film examples   edit  Convergent evolution Convergent evolution is a biological concept whereby unrelated species acquire similar traits because they adapted to a similar environment and or played similar roles in their ecosystems  In fiction  the concept is extended whereby similar planets will result in races with similar cultures and or histories  Technically this is not a type of parallel universe since such planets can be reached via ordinary space travel  but the stories are similar in some respects  In  Bread and Circuses  Star Trek  The Original Series    the enterprise encounters a planet called Magna Roma which has many physical resemblances to Earth such as its atmosphere  land to ocean ratio  and size  The landing party discovers that the planet is at roughly a late 20th century level of technology but its society is similar to the Roman Empire  It was as if the Roman Empire had not fallen but had continued to that time  There is also a reference to the Roman god Jupiter  At the end of the episode  it is discovered that their own version Jesus  referred simply as  the son   In The Omega Glory  Star Trek   the crew visit a planet on which there is a conflict between two peoples called the Yangs and the Kohms  They discover that the Yangs are like Earth s Yankees  i e  Americans  and the Kohms are like Earth s communists  The Yangs had a constitution that was word for word identical to the American constitution but at some point in the past the Kohms had taken over  In Miri  Star Trek  The Original Series   the Enterprise crew encounter a planet  later called Onlies  that is physically identical to Earth  History on the two planets were apparently identical until the 20th centuries when scientists on Onlies had accidentally created a deadly virus that killed all the adults but extended the lives of the children   edit  Convergent Evolution due to contamination As similar concept in biology is gene flow  In this case  a planet may start as different from Earth  but due to the influence of Earth culture  the planet come to resemble Earth in some way  Technically this is not a type of parallel universe since such planets can be reached via ordinary space travel  but the stories are similar in some respects  In Patterns of Force  Star Trek  The Original Series   a planet is discovered that has become very similar to Nazi Germany due to the influence of a professor that came to reside there  In A Piece of the Action  Star Trek  The Original Series   the Enterprise crew visits a planet that resembles mob ruled cities of Earth in the 1920s due to a book titled  Chicago Mobs of the Twenties  that had been left behind by previous Earth craft   edit  Fantasy  edit  Stranger in a strange land Oz and its surroundings  Fantasy authors often want to bring characters from the author s  and the reader s  reality into their created world  Before the mid 20th century  this was most often done by hiding fantastic worlds within hidden parts of the author s own universe  Peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that an ogre or other fantastical beings could live an hour away  but increasing geographical knowledge meant that such locations had to be farther and farther off  6  Characters in the author s world could board a ship and find themselves on a fantastic island  as Jonathan Swift does in Gulliver s Travels or in the 1949 novel Silverlock by John Myers Myers  or be sucked up into a tornado and land in Oz  These  lost world  stories can be seen as geographic equivalents of a  parallel universe   as the worlds portrayed are separate from our own  and hidden to everyone except those who take the difficult journey there  The geographic  lost world  can blur into a more explicit  parallel universe  when the fantasy realm overlaps a section of the  real  world  but is much larger inside than out  as in Robert Holdstock s novel Mythago Wood  After the mid 20th century  perhaps influenced by ideas from science fiction  perhaps because exploration had made many places on the map too clear to write  Here there be dragons   many fantasy worlds became completely separate from the author s world  6  A common trope is a portal or artifact that connects worlds together  prototypical examples being the wardrobe in C  S  Lewis  The Lion  the Witch  and the Wardrobe  or the sigil in James Branch Cabell s The Cream of the Jest  In Hayao Miyazaki s Spirited Away  Chihiro Ogino and her parents climb over a small stream into the spirit world  The main difference between this type of story and the  lost world  above  is that the fantasy realm can only be reached by certain people  or at certain times  or after following certain rituals  or with the proper artifact  In some cases  physical travel is not even possible  and the character in our reality travels in a dream or some other altered state of consciousness  Examples include the Dream Cycle stories by H  P  Lovecraft or the Thomas Covenant stories of Stephen R  Donaldson  Often  stories of this type have as a major theme the nature of reality itself  questioning if the dream world can have the same  reality  as the waking world  Science fiction often employs this theme  usually without the dream world being  another  universe  in the ideas of cyberspace and virtual reality   edit  Between the worlds Through the Looking Glass    and the parallel universe Alice found there Most stories in this mold simply transport a character from the real world into the fantasy world where the bulk of the action takes place  Whatever gate is used   such as the tollbooth in The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster  or the mirror in Lewis Carroll s Through the Looking Glass   is left behind for the duration of the story  until the end  and then only if the protagonists will return  However  in a few cases the interaction between the worlds is an important element  so that the focus is not on one world or the other  but on both  and their interaction  After Rick Cook introduced a computer programmer into a high fantasy world  his wizardry series steadily acquired more interactions between this world and ours  In Aaron Allston s Doc Sidhe our  grim world  is paralleled by a  fair world  where the elves live and history echoes ours  A major portion of the plot deals with preventing a change in interactions between the worlds  Margaret Ball  in No Earthly Sunne  depicts the interaction of our world with Faerie  and the efforts of the Queen of Faerie to deal with the slow drifting apart of Earth and Faerie  Poul Anderson depicts Hell as a parallel universe in Operation Chaos  and the need to transfer equivalent amounts of mass between the worlds explains why a changeling is left for a kidnapped child  Interactions between magical and scientific universes  and the protagonists  attempts to restore and maintain the balance between them  are major plot points in Piers Anthony s Apprentice Adept series  he depicts two worlds  the  SF  planet Proton and the fantasy based Phaze  such that every person born in either world has a physical duplicate on the other world  Only when one duplicate has died can the other cross between the worlds  Several of his Xanth novels also revolve around interactions between the magical realm of Xanth and  Mundania   Multiple worlds  rather than a pair  increase the importance of the relationships  In The Lion  the Witch  and the Wardrobe  there are only our world and Narnia  but in other of C  S  Lewis s works  there are hints of other worlds  and in The Magician s Nephew  the Wood between the Worlds shows many possibilities  and the plot is governed by transportation between worlds  and the effort to right problems stemming from them  In His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman  the two protagonist Lyra and Will find themselves lost amongst many worlds  and travel them looking for the other  In Andre Norton s Witch World  begun with a man from Earth being transported to this world  gates frequently lead to other worlds   or come from them  While an abundance of illusions  disguises  and magic that repels attention make certain parts of Witch World look like parallel worlds  some are clearly parallel in that time runs differently in them  and such gates pose a repeated problem in Witch World  In the radio sitcom Undone  the main character  Edna Turner  prevents people from a parallel version of London called  Undone  from moving to London and making the city too weird  There are other parallel versions of London  and one of the main plots in the series is the attempt by The Prince to unite all versions of London together  Travel between the manyworlds is the central conceit of Planesrunner  where the protagonist travels to a parallel London in a world without fossil fuels  Linking rooms of various types  not all actual rooms  can hook together any number of worlds  The characters may chose only one  but the choice is all important in determining the worlds   edit  Fantasy multiverses The idea of a multiverse is as fertile a subject for fantasy as it is for science fiction  allowing for epic settings and godlike protagonists  Among the most epic and far ranging fantasy  multiverses  is that of Michael Moorcock  Like many authors after him  Moorcock was inspired by the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics  saying  It was an idea in the air  as most of these are  and I would have come across a reference to it in New Scientist  one of my best friends was then editor       or  physicist friends would have been talking about it      Sometimes what happens is that you are imagining these things in the context of fiction while the physicists and mathematicians are imagining them in terms of science  I suspect it is the romantic imagination working  as it often does  perfectly efficiently in both the arts and the sciences  citation needed  Unlike many science fiction interpretations  Moorcock s Eternal Champion stories go far beyond alternate history to include mythic and sword and sorcery settings as well as some worlds more similar to our own  However  the Eternal Champion himself is incarnate in all of them  Roger Zelazny used a mythic cosmology in his Chronicles of Amber series  His protagonist is a member of the royal family of Amber  whose members represent a godlike pantheon ruling over a prototypical universe that represents Order  All other universes are increasingly distorted  shadows  of it  ending finally at the other extreme  Chaos  which is the complete negation of the prototype  Travel between these  shadow  universes is only possible by beings descended from the blood of this pantheon  Those  of the blood  can walk through Shadow  imagining any possible reality and then walk to it  making their environment more similar to their desire as they go  It is argued between the characters whether these  shadows  even exist before they re imagined by a member of the royal family of Amber  or if the  shadows   existence can be seen as an act of godlike creation  In the World of Tiers novels by Philip Jos  Farmer  the idea of godlike protagonists is even more explicit  The background of the stories is a multiverse where godlike beings have created a number of pocket universes that represent their own desires  Our own world is part of this series  but interestingly our own universe is revealed to be much smaller than it appears  ending at the edge of the solar system  The term  polycosmos  was coined as an alternative to  multiverse  by the author and editor Paul le Page Barnett  best known by the pseudonym John Grant  and is built from Greek rather than Latin morphemes  It is used by Barnett to describe a concept binding together a number of his works  its nature meaning that  all characters  real or fictional       have to co exist in all possible real  created or dreamt worlds        they re playing hugely different roles in their various manifestations  and the relationships between them can vary quite dramatically  but the essence of them remains the same   7  There are multiverses also in the Warcraft universe  The Chronicles of Narnia  Terry Pratchett s Discworld series  and Diana Wynne Jones s Chrestomanci  Howl s Moving Castle and Deep Secret books and standalone book A Sudden Wild Magic   edit  Fictional universe as alternative universe Main article  Fictional universe There are many examples of the meta fictional idea of having the author s created universe  or any author s universe  rise to the same level of  reality  as the universe we re familiar with  The theme is present in works as diverse as H G  Wells  Men Like Gods  Myers  Silverlock  and Heinlein s Number of the Beast  Fletcher Pratt and L  Sprague de Camp took the protagonist of the Harold Shea series through the worlds of Norse myth  Edmund Spenser s Faerie Queene  Ludovico Ariosto s Orlando Furioso  and the Kalevala 8   without ever quite settling whether writers created these parallel worlds by writing these works  or received impressions from the worlds and wrote them down  In an interlude set in  Xanadu   a character claims that the universe is dangerous because the poem went unfinished  but whether this was his misapprehension or not is not established  Some fictional approaches definitively establish the independence of the parallel world  sometimes by having the world differ from the book s account  other approaches have works of fiction create and affect the parallel world  L  Sprague de Camp s Solomon s Stone  taking place on an astral plane  is populated by the daydreams of mundane people  and in Rebecca Lickiss s Eccentric Circles  an elf is grateful to Tolkien for transforming elves from dainty little creatures  These stories often place the author  or authors in general  in the same position as Zelazny s characters in Amber  Questioning  in a literal fashion  if writing is an act of creating a new world  or an act of discovery of a pre existing world  Occasionally  this approach becomes self referential  treating the literary universe of the work itself as explicitly parallel to the universe where the work was created  Stephen King s seven volume Dark Tower series hinges upon the existence of multiple parallel worlds  many of which are King s own literary creations  Ultimately the characters become aware that they are only  real  in King s literary universe  this can be debated as an example of breaking the fourth wall   and even travel to a world   twice   in which  again  within the novel  they meet Stephen King and alter events in the real Stephen King s world outside of the books  An early instance of this was in works by Gardner Fox for DC Comics in the 1960s  in which characters from the Golden Age  which was supposed to be a series of comic books within the DC Comics universe  would cross over into the main DC Comics universe  One comic book did provide an explanation for a fictional universe existing as a parallel universe  The parallel world does  exist  and it resonates into the  real world   Some people in the  real world  pick up on this resonance  gaining information about the parallel world which they then use to write stories   edit  Elfland Main article   lfheim Elfland  or Faerie  the otherworldly home not only of elves and fairies but goblins  trolls  and other folkloric creatures  has an ambiguous appearance in folklore  On one hand  the land often appears to be contiguous with  ordinary  land  Thomas the Rhymer might  on being taken by the Queen of Faerie  be taken on a road like one leading to Heaven or Hell  This is not exclusive to English or French folklore  In Norse mythology  Elfland  Alfheim  was also the name of what today is the Swedish province of Bohusl n  In the sagas  it said that the people of this petty kingdom were more beautiful than other people  as they were related to the elves  showing that not only the territory was associated with elves  but also the race of its people  While sometimes folklore seems to show fairy intrusion into human lands    Tam Lin  does not show any otherworldly aspects about the land in which the confrontation takes place   at other times the otherworldly aspects are clear  Most frequently  time can flow differently for those trapped by the fairy dance than in the lands they come from  although  in an additional complication  it may only be an appearance  as many returning from Faerie  such as Ois n  have found that time  catches up  with them as soon as they have contact with ordinary lands  Fantasy writers have taken up the ambiguity  Some writers depict the land of the elves as a full blown parallel universe  with portals the only entry   as in Josepha Sherman s Prince of the Sidhe series or Esther Friesner s Elf Defense   and others have depicted it as the next land over  possibly difficult to reach for magical reasons   Hope Mirrlees s Lud in the Mist  or Lord Dunsany s The King of Elfland s Daughter  In some cases  the boundary between Elfland and more ordinary lands is not fixed  Not only the inhabitants but Faerie itself can pour into more mundane regions  Terry Pratchett s Discworld series proposes that the world of the Elves is a  parasite  universe  that drifts between and latches onto others such as Discworld and our own world  referred to as  Roundworld  in the novels   This

Films In Frank Capra s It s A Wonderful Life  1946   George Bailey  center  played by James Stewart  is shown by his guardian angel how the world would have been radically different for the worse if Bailey had never existed  The most famous treatment of the alternative universe concept in film could be considered The Wizard of Oz  which portrays a parallel world  famously separating the magical realm of the Land of Oz from the mundane world by filming it in Technicolor while filming the scenes set in Kansas in sepia  A later example is the Frank Capra movie  It s a Wonderful Life where the main character George Bailey is shown by a guardian angel the city of Pottersville  which was George Bailey s hometown of Bedford Falls as it would have been if he had never existed  Another notable depiction of a parallel universe in movies is in Back to the Future Part II by Robert Zemeckis  starring Michael J  Fox and Christopher Lloyd  showing an accidentally created alternative present and future  Like It s a Wonderful Life  The Big Time  and many other time travel stories using this concept  it is clear that these alternative presents futures are mutually exclusive with the protagonists  own   so  strictly speaking  the universes are not parallel in that they cannot co exist  rather they oscillate between one or the other  Another common use of the theme is as a prison for villains or demons  The idea is used in the first two Superman movies starring Christopher Reeve where Kryptonian villains were sentenced to the Phantom Zone from where they eventually escaped  An almost exactly parallel use of the idea is presented in the campy cult film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension  where the  8th dimension  is essentially a  phantom zone  used to imprison the villainous Red Lectroids  Uses in horror films include the 1986 film From Beyond  based on the H  P  Lovecraft story of the same name  where a scientific experiment induces the experimenters to perceive aliens from a parallel universe  with bad results  The 1987 John Carpenter film Prince of Darkness is based on the premise that the essence of a being described as Satan  trapped in a glass canister and found in an abandoned church in Los Angeles  is actually an alien being that is the  son  of something even more evil and powerful  trapped in another universe  The protagonists accidentally free the creature  who then attempts to release his  father  by reaching in through a reflective glass  or mirror  Some films present parallel realities that are actually different contrasting versions of the narrative itself  Commonly this motif is presented as different points of view revolving around a central  but sometimes unknowable   truth   the seminal example being Akira Kurosawa s Rashomon  Conversely  often in film noir and crime dramas  the alternative narrative is a fiction created by a central character  intentionally   as in The Usual Suspects   or unintentionally   as in Angel Heart  Less often  the alternative narratives are given equal weight in the story  making them truly alternative universes  such as in the German film Run Lola Run  the short lived British West End musical Our House and the British film Sliding Doors  More recent films that have explicitly explored parallel universes are  the 2000 film The Family Man  the 2001 cult movie Donnie Darko  which deals with what it terms a  tangent universe  that erupts from our own universe  Super Mario Bros   1993  has the eponymous heroes cross over into a parallel universe ruled by humanoids who evolved from dinosaurs  The One  2001  starring Jet Li  in which there is a complex system of realities in which Jet Li s character is a police officer in one universe and a serial

Wikipedia inclusion policy   August 2010  The idea of parallel universes have received treatment in a number of television series  usually as a single story or episode in a more general science fiction or fantasy storyline  One of the earliest television plots to feature parallel time was a 1970 storyline on soap opera Dark Shadows  Vampire Barnabas Collins found a room in Collinwood which served as a portal to parallel time  and he entered the room in order to escape from his current problems  A year later  the show again traveled to parallel time  the setting this time being 1841  A well known and often imitated example is the original Star Trek episode entitled  Mirror  Mirror   The episode introduced an alternative version of the Star Trek universe where the main characters were barbaric and cruel to the point of being evil  When the parallel universe concept is parodied  the allusion is often to this Star Trek episode  A previous episode for the Trek series first hinted at the potential of differing reality planes  and their occupants   titled  The Alternative Factor   A mad scientist from  our  universe  named Lazarus B   hunts down the sane Lazarus A   resident of an antimatter comprised continuum  His counterpart  in a state of paranoia  claims the double threatens his and the very cosmos  existence  With help from Captain Kirk  A traps B along with him in a  anti  universe  for eternity  thus bringing balance to both matter oriented realms  A similar plot was used in the Codename  Kids Next Door episode Operation  P O O L   Multiple episodes of Red Dwarf use the concept  In  Parallel Universe  the crew meet alternative versions of themselves  the analogues of Lister  Rimmer and Holly are female  while the Cat s alternate is a dog   Dimension Jump  introduces a heroic alternate Rimmer  a version of whom reappears in  Stoke Me a Clipper   The next episode   Ouroboros   makes contact with a timeline in which Kochanski  rather than Lister  was the sole survivor of the original disaster  this alternate Kochanski then joins the crew for the remaining episodes  Another example is  Spookyfish   an episode of South Park  in which the  evil  universe double of Cartman  who is pleasant and agreeable  unlike the home universe s obnoxious Cartman  sports a goatee  like the  mirror  version of Mr  Spock  Buffy the Vampire Slayer experienced a Parallel universe where she was a mental patient in Normal Again and not really  The Slayer  at all  In the end  she has to choose between a universe where her mother and father are together and alive  mother  or one with her friends and sister in it where she has to fight for her life daily  In another episode  Cordelia Chase inadvertently created a dystopian alternate reality in which Buffy had never moved from LA to Sunnydale  The animated series  Futurama  had an episode where the characters travel between  Universe A  and  Universe 1  via boxes containing each universe  and one of the major jokes is an extended argument between the two sets of characters over which set were the  evil  ones  Doctor Who often features parallel universes as the basis of a plotline  In the episode  Inferno   from Doctor Who the Doctor accidentally travels to a parallel universe where Great Britain is a republic under a fascist leader  In  Rise of the Cybermen   the TARDIS falls out of the Time Space Continuum  and dies  with the Doctor and his companions inside it  The Doctor believes them to be in the Void  the infinite empty space between the universes  where no time  space or energy exists  It turns out  however  they fell into another universe  a much more desirable option  In this universe  Britain is a lot more technically advanced  with blimps almost replacing cars  They find a way to revive the TARDIS and travel back to their own universe  According to the Doctor in  Doomsday   a new parallel universe is created by every decision made  The OC had an episode where two main characters fell into a coma  and into an alternate parallel universe  Friends had an episode in which the characters wonder how different their lives would be with different choices  Parallel universes alternate futures are also featured in Heroes  The idea of a parallel universe and the concept of deja vu was a major plot line of the first season finale of Fringe  guest starring Leonard Nimoy of Star Trek  The show has gone on to feature the parallel universe prominently  In the 2010 season of Lost  the result of characters traveling back in time to prevent the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 apparently creates a parallel reality in which the Flight never crashed  rather than resetting time itself in the characters  original timeline  The show continued to show two  sets  of the characters following different destinies  until it was revealed in the series finale that there was really only one reality created by the characters themselves to assist themselves in leaving behind the physical world and passing on to an afterlife after their respective deaths  The anime Turn A Gundam attempted to combine all the parallel Gundam universes  other incarnations of the series  with similar themes but differing stories and characters  that had played out at different times since the debut of the concept in the 1970s  of the metaseries in to one single reality  The anime and manga series Katekyo Hitman Reborn  by Akira Amano features this idea in its third main arc  known as Future arc  The anime Neon Genesis Evangelion features a parallel world in one of the final episodes  This parallel world is a sharp contrast to the harsh  dark  reality  of the show and presents a world where all the characters enjoy a much happier life  This parallel world would become the basis for

protagonists meet digital monsters  or digimon  from this world and becomes partners and friends  In the anime series Umineko no Naku Koro ni The rounds of the battle between Battler and Beatrice take

usage of  fragments   In the animated Disney series Darkwing Duck  the title character s archenemy  Negaduck  comes from a parallel dimension called the Negaverse  not to be confused with the

In Season 03  episode 4 of  Community  TV series   called  Remedial Chaos Theory   different realities are the center of the plot  even with a reference to Spock s goatee   edit  As an ongoing subplot Sometimes a television series will use parallel universes as an ongoing subplot  Star Trek  Deep Space Nine and Star Trek  Enterprise elaborated on the premise of the original series   Mirror  universe and developed multi episode story arcs based on the premise  Other examples are the science fiction series Stargate SG 1  the fantasy horror series Buffy the Vampire Slayer  Supernatural and the romance fantasy Lois  amp  Clark  The New Adventures of Superman  Following the precedent set by Star Trek  these story arcs show alternative universes that have turned out  worse  than the  original  universe  in Stargate SG 1 the first two encountered parallel realities featured Earth being overwhelmed by an unstoppable Goa uld onslaught  in Buffy  two episodes concern a timeline in which Buffy came to Sunnydale too late to stop the vampires from taking control  Lois  amp  Clark repeatedly visits an alternative universe where Clark Kent s adoptive parents  Jonathan and Martha Kent  died when he was ten years of age  and Lois Lane is also apparently dead  Clark eventually becomes Superman  with help from the  original  Lois Lane  but he is immediately revealed as Clark Kent and so has no life of his own  In addition to following Star Trek s lead  showing the  evil  variants of the main storyline gives the writers an opportunity to show what is at stake by portraying the worst that could happen and the consequences if the protagonists fail or the importance of a character s presence  The latter could also be seen as the point of the alternative reality portrayed in the movie It s a Wonderful Life   edit  Parallel universe based series There have been a few series where parallel universes were central to the series itself  Two examples are  Sliders  where a young man invents a worm hole generator that allows travel to  alternative  Earths  Several characters travel across a series of  alternative  Earths  trying to get back to their home universe  Charlie Jade

techno thriller film directed by Duncan Jones  written by Ben Ripley  starring Jake Gyllenhaal  Michelle Monaghan  Vera Farmiga  Russell Peters and Jeffrey Wright which employs the concepts of quantum reality and parallel universes   edit  Comic books Parallel universes in modern comics have become particularly rich and complex  in large part due to the continual problem of continuity faced by the major two publishers  Marvel Comics and DC Comics  The two publishers have used the multiverse concept to fix problems arising from integrating characters from other publishers into their own canon  and from having major serial protagonists having continuous histories lasting  as in the case of Superman  over 70 years  Additionally  both publishers have used new alternative universes to re imagine their own characters   See Multiverse  DC Comics  and Multiverse  Marvel Comics   Because of this  comic books in general are one of the few entertainment mediums where the concept of parallel universes are a major and ongoing theme  DC in particular periodically revisits the idea in major crossover storylines  such as Crisis on Infinite Earths and Infinite Crisis  where Marvel has a series called What If    that s devoted to exploring alternative realities  which sometimes impact the  main  universe s continuity  DC s version of  What If     is the Elseworlds imprint  Recently DC Comics series 52 heralded the return of the Multiverse  52 was a mega crossover event tied to Infinite Crisis which was the sequel to the 1980s Crisis on Infinite Earths  The aim was to yet again address

devoted to the Charlton Comics heroes of DC  Countdown and Countdown Presents  The Search for Ray Palmer and the upcoming Tales of the Multiverse stories expand upon this new Multiverse  Marvel has also had many large crossover events which depicted an alternative universe  many springing from events in the X Men books  such as Days of Future Past  the seminal Age Of Apocalypse  and 2006 s House Of M  In addition the Squadron Supreme is a DC inspired Marvel Universe that has been used several times  often crossing over into the mainstream Universe in the Avengers comic  Exiles is an offshoot
