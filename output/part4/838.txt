and artist co writer Steve Ditko  he first appeared in Space Adventures  33  March 1960   1  Captain Atom was created for Charlton Comics but was later acquired by DC Comics and revised for DC s post Crisis continuity  In 2011  DC Comics relaunched its superhero comics and restarted the histories of some characters from scratch  including Captain Atom  giving him a new origin  appearance and slightly altered powers  The character of Captain Atom was the inspiration for the character Doctor Manhattan who was featured in the graphic novel series  and later live action film adaptation  Watchmen  In all incarnations  the character initially worked for the military  In the Charlton Comics continuity  he was a scientist named Allen Adam and gained his abilities by accident when he was seemingly  atomized  and then somehow reformed his body  now existing as an atomic powered being  In both DC Comics incarnations  he is Air Force pilot Nathaniel Adam who was used as a test subject in a scientific experiment and wound up seemingly disintegrated in the process  only to reappear later as Captain Atom  now blessed with superhuman abilities  2  Throughout the years  the character has been featured in several moderate to short lived eponymous series  and has been a member of several different versions of DC s flagship superhero team Justice League  In the new continuity of DC s relaunched universe  Captain Atom has never been a member of the Justice League and the team views him with distrust  Contents 1 Fictional character biography 1 1 Charlton Comics  Silver Age  1 2 DC

debut  Cover art by Steve Ditko  The Charlton Comics version of Captain Atom was Allen Adam  The character s origin had Adam working as a technician in a special experimental rocket when it accidentally launched with him trapped inside  Adam was atomized when the rocket exploded while entering the upper atmosphere  However  he somehow gained superpowers that included the ability to reform his body safely on the ground  He was outfitted in a red and yellow costume that was designed to shield people from the radiation of his nuclear powers  When he  powered up   his hair changed to silver white  Later  in his own title  he replaced his original red and gold costume with a liquid metal outfit that was under his skin and which transformed when he powered up  Captain Atom s powers were similar to such other nuclear powered superheroes as Gold Key s Doctor Solar and Dell Comics  Nukla  Captain Atom was first published in a series of short stories in the anthology series Space Adventures   33 40  March 1960 June 1961  and  42  October 1961   Charlton began reprinting his short adventures in the anthology Strange Suspense Stories beginning with  75  June 1965   renaming the title Captain Atom with  78  December 1965  and giving the hero full length stories and supervillain antagonists such as Dr  Spectro   previous stories involved Cold War anti Communist missions or dealing with aliens   Captain Atom later teamed with the superhero Nightshade  The superhero Blue Beetle starred in the initial backup feature  later replaced by a Nightshade backup series  Captain Atom was canceled with issue  89  December 1967   In 1975  the unfinished Ditko art for issue  90 was inked by John Byrne and published in the first two issues of the official Charlton fanzine  Charlton Bullseye  as the 10 page  Showdown In Sunuria   writer  Jon G  Michels  and the 11 page  Two Against Sunuria   writer  Roger Stern   Captain Atom next appeared in issue  7  May 1982  of the new talent showcase comic also called Charlton Bullseye  in a story by writer Benjamin Smith and artist co writer Dan Reed  which for some reason returned him to his original red yellow outfit  The character s last pre DC appearance was in AC Comics  one shot Americomics Special  1  August 1983   in a story teaming the Charlton  Action Heroes  Blue Beetle  Captain Atom  Nightshade  and The Question as the Sentinels of Justice  This last story had originally been done for Charlton before the company folded  The actual Charlton characters made their first reappearance in DC s Crisis on Infinite Earths  which introduced Earth Four as the native reality of Captain Atom and the world where all the Charlton Comics adventures had taken place  By the story s end  Earth Four  and the Charlton characters  was incorporated into the Post Crisis DC Universe  its history merging with that of the mainstream reality  The last appearance of this Charlton era Captain Atom was in DC Comics Presents  90  February 1986    edit  DC Comics  Post Crisis  A new  post Crisis version of the character was introduced in March 1987 with the launch of a monthly comic written by Cary Bates  long time writer of The Flash and Superman   co written by Greg Weisman and drawn by Pat Broderick  3  This modern captain s name is established as Nathaniel Christopher Adam  a United States Air Force officer of the Vietnam War era  Adam has been framed for a crime he did not commit and sentenced to death under the watch of Col  Wade Eiling in 1968  As an alternative to execution  he is invited to participate in Project  Captain Atom  a military experiment with little chance of survival  in exchange for a presidential pardon  The experiment involves testing the hull of a crashed alien ship s durability by placing a human being  Adam  within the metal s protection and then exploding a nuclear weapon under it  The weapon went off and Adam  along with the metal  was seemingly disintegrated  18 years later  Adam reappeared  the alien metal now bonded around his body and giving him incredible abilities  It was revealed that the alien metal could absorb energy but that after a certain limit was reached  any excess energy absorption would force it to jump forward in time  how far forward depended on how much extra energy was taken in   Now bonded to the metal  Nathaniel Adam now had powers that resulted from the metal s ability to tap into the  Quantum Field   2  4  Now alive in 1986  Adam finds himself a man out of his time and in the hands of Eiling  now a general and the second husband of Adam s now deceased wife Angela  Everyone had assumed that Nathaniel Adam had died on the day of the experiment  so his presidential pardon was never issued and the current government refuses to acknowledge the previous administration s promised pardon  Seizing the opportunity at hand  Eiling uses the outstanding murder treason charges against Adam to blackmail him into acting as a government controlled superhero codenamed Captain Atom  The events of the Charlton stories are referenced and established as a cover story for Adam  a fabricated past to convince the world that he has secretly been a superhero for years and thus quickly gain trust and a reputation  For his non superhero activities  Nathaniel is the alias of Cameron Scott  an Air Force intelligence operative  It was during this time he meets the superpowered terrorist  Plastique  who becomes a recurring part of Nathaniel s life  Early conflicts involve him coming to terms with his lost time with his children  who are now close to his current age as a result of the time jump   the death of his wife  her marriage to Eiling  and the overall ramifications of his newly acquired powers  Later on  he learns that the Captain Atom project had been repeated  creating the villain Major Force  Major Force is a bloodthirsty man who has no problem performing illegal operations for the U S  government and doesn t share any of Captain Atom s morality  Atom Adam serves under Eiling reluctantly while befriending research scientist Dr  Megala of Project Atom  who helps Nathaniel discover more about his powers  Captain Atom later succeeds in clearing his name of the original treason charge and eventually rebels against Eiling  resigning from the Air Force and becoming an actual superhero  Captain Atom joins the Justice League at the request of the U S  government  eventually serving as leader of Justice League Europe  During his career  he has a brief romance with Catherine Cobert  develops a friendly  rivalry  with Firestorm  whose nickname is  the nuclear man    becomes involved with and eventually marries Plastique  ironically  a one time Firestorm foe   learns basic heroics from Batman when he briefly loses access to the Quantum Field  and commands the metahuman forces during the Invasion storyline where Earth was under attack by an alliance of alien forces   Captain Atom   was canceled as of  57 in 1991 because Atom was slated to become the hero turned villain Monarch in DC s Armageddon 2001 crossover event  however  when word of this leaked out  DC changed the ending at the last minute  Atom and the Monarch character continue battling through time in Armageddon  The Alien Agenda limited series  until he is returned to his own time at the conclusion  Captain Atom then returns to the League  involved in the Zero Hour Crisis in 1994  5  founding an offshoot team  Extreme Justice in 1995  6  While leading Extreme Justice  Captain Atom comes across another version of Monarch  this one claiming to be the real Nathaniel Adam  Later in 1999  he is a member of the poorly received team known as the Living Assault Weapons or L A W   the members of whom are all previously Charlton Comics characters  In 2003  he again teams up with several former members of the Justice League as the  Super Buddies  in the humorous limited series Formerly Known as the Justice League  Around this time  various stories reintroduce Atom s conflict between his role in the superhero community and his responsibilities as a government agent  At some point  Atom s marriage to Plastique ends in divorce  Apart from a brief mention of her at the beginning of L A W   the marriage appears to be forgotten  Plastique has reappeared in 2006 as a villainess again  undoing her reformation into a heroine  A later confirmation is brought in by the Captain Atom  Armageddon miniseries in which  after falling in love with Angela Spica of The Authority  Captain Atom reminisces about his short marriage with Plastique  and attributes their divorce to their irreconcilable views about world and politics  since Nathaniel  even in his spousal life  could not stop being a loyal soldier of the U S A   and Plastique could not simply put aside her life as a terrorist  Later in 2003  writer Jeph Loeb returns Captain Atom to his roots as he went back to work for the government  this time for President Lex Luthor in the first story arc of the Superman Batman series  Atom seemingly sacrifices his life to save Superman and Earth by piloting a starship to destroy a kryptonite meteor  but as it had previously been established that this type of accident could not kill him  he soon returns to life and to the background of the DC Universe  In a 2005 issue of Superman Batman it is made clear that Captain Atom survived the collision with the kryptonite meteor  but has absorbed massive amounts of radiation and become a super villain described as a  Kryptonite Man   The radiation is siphoned out of Captain Atom using a device made by Hiro Okamura  the new Toyman  which returns Captain Atom to his usual self  if somewhat confused    edit   Armageddon  and WorldStorm In 2005 2006  Captain Atom appears in a nine part limited series entitled Captain Atom  Armageddon under DC s Wildstorm imprint  Captain Atom s sacrifice in Superman Batman sends him to the WildStorm universe for the duration of the series  In this title  he wears a yellow red outfit that was first seen in the 1996 Kingdom Come limited series  At the moment of his apparent death  Captain Atom experiences a time shift coinciding with his 2005 appearance in Superman Batman  resulting in his arrival in the Wildstorm Universe  He quickly gets into a fight with an overzealous Mister Majestic and the fight ends with Majestic soundly defeated  Seeing the frightened reactions of onlookers  and puzzling over his own altered appearance  he realizes that he has somehow become trapped on an alternate Earth  one where superheroes are feared by the general populace  Mistaken by the local superheroes as the force destined to destroy their universe  he is in fact an instrument used ultimately by Nikola Hanssen  new host for half the essence of the Void  to reclaim her whole power  partially lodged in his own body  and cause of his altered appearance  and use it to trigger the reboot of the WildStorm universe  in the WorldStorm event   edit  Monarch Main article  Monarch  comics  Captain Atom s ultimatum  art by Dan Jurgens  Captain Atom returns to the DC Universe in Infinite Crisis  7 when Superboy Prime punctured Breach  who wields similar energy manipulating abilities  The end of Armageddon has him reappear in the devastated Bl dhaven  A year later  Captain Atom is revealed to be contained inside Bl dhaven and used to administer radiation treatments to metahumans  Apparently Void  able to finally let him go home  is unable to ensure his safety  and multiple damages to his radiation shielding skin had left him comatose and unable to keep down his body radiation to safe levels  this forces the Atomic Knights to keep him constantly contained  In 2008 s Countdown  8  it is learned that these ruptures were caused as part of a greater plan by Solomon the Monitor  in his plans to  recreate the Monarch  as part of a larger scheme to force the assimilation of the other Monitors  After being fitted with an updated version of the Monarch armor  Armageddon 2001  to contain his radiation  the Captain awakens  Seeming to be mentally unstable  he breaks free  apparently kills the rampaging Major Force  and then releases a vast amount of energy  obliterating what was left of Bl dhaven  He remains missing until Kyle Rayner  then known as Ion  discovers him in The Bleed  a place between dimensions  The Captain indicates that he is traveling through The Bleed in order to operate outside the gaze of the Monitors  He discusses his time in the Wildstorm Universe  and his desire to visit other alternate worlds  7   edit  Countdown Main article  Countdown to Final Crisis In the last panel of Countdown  45  Monarch is shown observing Forerunner  The following issue  Countdown  44  bears a cover by Ed Benes with the Monarch armor  8  and features Monarch swaying Forerunner to his side  turning her against the Monitors  Monarch argues that the Monitors are genocidal overlords who must be defeated  however  the Monitors assert that Monarch is a supervillain whose plan is to cause a Multiversal war that will leave him the ruler of the unified Earth remaining in its wake  Monarch creates an army of foot soldiers  including the Extremists of Earth 8  the JL Axis of Earth 10  and the Crime Society of Earth 3  and disposes of Forerunner when he reveals his plans for a multiversal arena tournament  The 4 issue miniseries Countdown  Arena features Monarch battling alternate versions of characters throughout the Multiverse to compile the strike team for his new Multiverse army  2  specifically one Superman  one Batman  a Wonder Woman  a Green Lantern  a Flash  a Blue Beetle  a Nightshade  a Starman  and a Ray  9  Monarch s behavior becomes increasingly violent  notably in the form of his killing all residents of the Eve of Shadows  country in retribution for her attempt to violate the Monarch s rule of  no escaping   10  Monarch is now paranoid  and unwilling to share details of his past to his  subordinates   However  the Red Son Superman and Liberty Files Batman discern that under the Monarch armor lies another Captain Atom  and so they employ his other counterparts Breach  Tim Zanetti  and Quantum Storm  Ronnie Raymond  to assemble an army of Captain Atoms from the different dimensions to fight back  In Arena  s conclusion  Monarch reveals that Breach is his brainwashed accomplice and that he has lured his 51 counterparts in order to murder them and absorb their power  With his team of Eve

against the exposed Monitors  12  In a protracted fight against Superman Prime  his suit is damaged  releasing a chain reaction that apparently destroys the entire universe of Earth 51 aside from its Monitor  13  It was later revealed that the Monitor Solomon had attacked Captain Atom in Bl dhaven  rupturing his skin and setting into motion his transformation into Monarch  14   edit  Project 7734 During Jimmy Olsen s investigation about Project 7734  the secret black op commanded by Sam Lane to fight extraterrestrial menaces on Earth  including Kryptonians   it is discovered that an amnesiac and brainwashed Captain Atom is now one of the prized possessions of Sam Lane  Project Breach refers to his capture and brainwashing into a weapon  with Lane wanting to stress the similarities between Adams and Tim Zanetti  or Planet Breaker  Captain Atom refers to his name and rank as  Codename  Captain Atom   15  Captain Atom returns in a co feature in Action Comics  879 and appears in his normal costume instead of the Monarch armor he was last seen wearing  He is shown to reside in a mystical  medieval reminiscent realm  attacking a highly fortified castle for unknown reasons other than  as he states   his mission   After obliterating the castle s defenses  he has a brief flashback to a moment with the Justice League  then falls to the ground disoriented  No explanation is given for his return to his original appearance  his whereabouts since Countdown to Final Crisis  or why he has reverted to his heroic persona rather than that of the conquest seeking Monarch  In Action Comics  880 it is revealed that Captain Atom has little or no memory of who he is other than his name  It is revealed that this mysterious realm is connected to Project 7734 and is part of his conditioning  Later  he is attacked by Major Force  an enemy believed to have been destroyed by Captain Atom himself when he first became Monarch  16 Mon El appears and helps Captain Atom escape  taking him to the Justice League s satellite  where the League members declare that they are going to bring him to justice for his actions as Monarch  17  After a struggle with the League  Captain Atom tells them what he can remember  The League reminds him he was a hero who once saved the planet  He feels he has changed from the man he once was  and that he needs to go back to the magic world to make right what he has done  The Shadowpact are called on to join him on his quest and provide a way for him to reach Sorcerers  World  18   edit  Generation Lost Captain Atom appears as one of the central characters in Justice League  Generation Lost  a maxi series that takes place during the wider Brightest Day event  At the start of the series  Captain Atom is recruited as part of a massive group of superheroes tasked with hunting down the JLI s founder and Ted Kord s murderer  Maxwell Lord  During an encounter with Max at the Justice League s former New York headquarters  Captain Atom is rendered unconscious alongside Fire  Ice  and Booster Gold  The former Justice League members awake to discover that Lord has used his mental abilities to erase his existence from the minds of every single human on the planet  save for those present at the embassy  and the others  19  Afterwards  Captain Atom discovers that Max has mentally influenced the US army into believing that he had betrayed them  20  Captain Atom shares with the group that when he absorbed a nuclear bomb Max had set off  he found himself thrown through time to the future of 24th century  an Earth that had fallen into chaos through metahuman wars and backward in technology  Atom found a woman elderly and grotesque  who turned out to be an aged Power Girl  telling him it was Maxwell Lord who was responsible for all of this  Atom is then pulled back into the present  and tells the rest of the team that the world needs them to stop the instigated Max  21  After find out the OMACs was dismembered droid  Captain Atom was struck by Magog who simply scoffs at the notion and states that he has come to kill Captain Atom at the behest of Max  22  In their battle  Captain Atom manages to convince Magog he is being manipulated by Max  Magog stops the attacks as he remembers Max s existence and Captain Atom is prepared to help him  However  Max is on hand and forces Magog to kill himself with his spear  Max uses his powers to manipulate everyone into believing that Captain Atom has killed Magog before leaving  Captain Atom realizes Magog s spear is about to explode with energy  Captain Atom tries to absorb as much as he can  thrusting him into the time stream again as a crater is left behind  23  Captain Atom is propelled through time again to 112 years in the future  where a metahuman war against the OMACs had devastated the planet  Captain Atom battled for survival alongside the future versions of the Justice League  however they all are eventually contaminated by a new nanovirus version of the OMACs and one by one become OMACs themselves  As a dying Power Girl tells him that the catalyst for all this was the death of Wonder Woman by Max s hands  Captain Atom is returned into the present but not before Batman orders him to terminate the OMAC project to stop Max s plan  24  During the final battle against the new OMAC known as OMAC Prime  Captain Atom allows OMAC Prime to absorb his energy  before reabsorbing the energy and overloading his powers  resulting in him being thrown into the time stream once again  Just before this occurred  Captain Atom grabbed Max and threatened to pull him into the time stream as well  unless Max undid the global mindwipe of his existence  Max complied and everyone on the planet had their memories of him restored before Captain Atom was pulled away to a time and space unknown  Max later released a statement onto the internet exonerating Captain Atom of the deaths in Chicago  saying far worse would have happened if he had not intervened  25   edit  The New 52 Following the rewriting of history due to the Flashpoint event  the mainstream DC Universe is altered considerably  Captain Atom is reintroduced with altered powers  appearance and origin  He is still USAF pilot Nathaniel Adam  In the new reality  Adam volunteers to participate in an experiment conducted by a research facility called the Continuum  At this facility  Dr  Megala s research is focused on the quantum field and on  dimensional transfer through M Theory   Adam is asked to pilot the dimensional transfer vessel but is seemingly atomized during the experiment  Soon afterwards  he reappears  now an energy based life form  According to Dr  Megala  Captain Atom s abilities are largely nuclear in nature and involve tapping into the strong nuclear force  the energy that binds protons and neutrons in the nucleus  Adam s physical atoms are constantly splitting apart  giving him incredible power  His body maintains integrity by instantly re merging these atoms  but extreme use of his powers can interfere with this process and cause Captain Atom s form to become unstable  This leads to a fear that at some point Captain Atom s brain might lose its molecular stability and he won t be able to fix it before it impairs his consciousness or causes him to suffer some form of brain death  26  In the new reality  Nathaniel Adam has only been Captain Atom for a few months and is still exploring his abilities  constantly learning new facets to them such as his ability to perceive wireless transmissions from cell phones and computers  27  He frequently returns to the Continuum so that Dr  Megala and the staff can help him further understand his abilities and occasionally so they can stabilize his body when he seems to be having problems  The world at large looks on Captain Atom with suspicion due to uncertainty about his agenda and the nature of his abilities  Some fear that he is leaking radiation and potentially poisoning those he comes into contact with  Several have remarked that the Justice League may have rejected Captain Atom for membership due to suspicion of how dangerous he is  28  Despite this  Nathaniel chooses to try and use his powers to help others on Earth  clandestinely if need be   edit  Powers and Abilities In the DC Relaunch universe  Captain Atom is a being whose atoms are constantly splitting  releasing massive amounts of energy  and then reforming just as quickly  This massive amount of energy can be manipulated in a number of ways such as flight and the ability to transmute physical matter  Captain Atom has been seen to transform lava into snow by willing it and has been able to remove cancer from a human being  He can also absorb massive amounts of energy  Captain Atom s abilities are largely nuclear in nature and involve tapping into the strong nuclear force  the energy that binds protons and neutrons in the nucleus  Excessive or intense use of his abilities has resulted in Captain Atom temporarily losing his own molecular stability  It is not yet known if he will be able to conquer this weakness with practice or not  As an energy based life form  Captain Atom s senses now operate on different levels than a normal person  He is able to sense and perceive radio signals  cell phone signals and other similar transmissions  He can also see the energy of certain molecules  such as when he notes the energy signature of the hero called the Flash and remarks that his molecules seem to be sparking with fire or lightning  28   edit  Former Powers In the Post Crisis DC Comics Universe  Captain Atom s Dilustel skin is tied into the Quantum Field  which enables him to absorb and manipulate theoretically infinite amounts of energy  limited by his willpower and imagination  This energy can be used for flight  which is generally faster than the speed of sound in Earth s atmosphere and up to half light speed in the vacuum of space   super strength  shown at times to be on par with Martian Manhunter  though another source   the DC Heroes Roleplaying Game   defines his level of strength second only to Superman s among the heroes of the DC universe  though as Monarch he was capable of effortlessly overwhelming three versions of Superman   durability  he has survived exploding nuclear weapons  and even energy sufficient to wipe out all life within the Universe of Earth 51   although this was his own energy  self sustenance and life support  allowing him to live and even speak in space   and controlling energy of any form  In addition to high speed flight he has been shown to possess enhanced reflexes  Atom s abilities stem from his link to the Quantum Field  which provides a virtually infinite source of Quantum Energy  which can be used for a vast number of effects  He commonly manipulates his energy into force field bubbles  or explosive  bombs   but the most common form is a simple energy blast  Atom has been shown to be capable of manipulating even exotic energies such as magic  and has a high degree of resistance to such attacks  Over the years  Captain Atom has become an expert at energy manipulation and he can fire energy blasts from any point on his body  although he usually uses his hands for better aim  He can fire in multiple directions at once or from every point of his body at once  Several times he has  detonated   releasing a massive amount of energy at once  destroying objects within a certain radius  as demonstrated by his destruction of Bludhaven  On more than one occasion  he has used his ability to manipulate all forms of energy to prevent a foe using their own powers  such as the Ray and Firestorm  If Atom absorbs too much energy at once  the energy transports him uncontrollably through time  Depending on the type of energy absorbed  he either goes forward or backward in time  though he also possesses the ability to voluntarily move forward in the time stream  Captain Atom states that through concentration  he can briefly travel ahead in time   about a week or so    The process is exhausting and the period he can interact in the future appears to be limited to a few minutes before he returns to the present  In the case of involuntary quantum jumping  he is typically shown as being stuck in the time stream for as long as it takes his body to process any absorbed energy  Captain Atom can also convert energy to matter in the same manner he manipulates energy  Originally  he needed a pair of gloves invented by Blue Beetle to do so  but he has since learned to do so without them  He is capable of manipulating matter on an atomic or sub atomic level at a limited scale  He has used his atomic transmutation powers to turn both Maul and Engineer back to their human forms  This power can be used instinctively or through concentration  though Atom has conceded he is not very good at it  In the same way  he learned to access weak force energy  As a consequence of his energy manipulation abilities  he is able to telepathically interface with computer networks  He has on occasion used this to repel telepathic intrusions by downloading information directly into other telepaths  With focus and effort  Captain Atom can increase any of his abilities to match his current willpower  up to an unknown level  As Monarch prior to absorbing the Captain Atom Brigade his powers and abilities were increased to such a level that he was capable of effortlessly containing several versions of powerful heroes such as Superman  Wonder Woman and several Green Lanterns  Atom has shown the capacity to absorb matter  as well as energy   typified by his absorption of the Captain Atom Brigade  As Monarch he possessed all of his inherent abilities   at much higher levels   as well as teleportation  awareness of and access to different realities  He was capable of storing enough energy  that upon its release  was capable of wiping all life from the alternate Earth 51   except for its Monitor and a single plant  Recently  writers and editors have introduced a radioactive aspect of Captain Atom s physical makeup  This seems to contradict the quantum nature of Atom s powers as originally introduced  as he previously did not emit radiation when his skin was cut open  Towards the end of his series  run  it was speculated that Captain Atom is an Elemental  Quantum Elemental  along with Swamp Thing  Earth   Red Tornado  Air   Firestorm  Fire   and Naiad  Water   In addition to his superhuman abilities  Nathaniel Adam is also an experienced United States Air Force pilot  It is notable that he is one of the few superheroes with a  Captain  appellation that corresponds to a military rank he has actually held  He is especially skilled in combat piloting and is also trained in military weaponry  strategy  and hand to hand combat  Adam also has strong survival instincts derived from his experiences during the Vietnam War   edit  Dilustel Captain Atom s metallic shell  or  skin   is composed of a portion of the alien being known as Silver Shield  and is called Dilustel  Pieces of the alien s metal body were used in Project Atom  and on later subjects like Major Force and Bombshell  Nathaniel is able to coat himself with the metal  either partially or totally  Atom s symbiosis with the metal is such that even partially armored he is able to access the Quantum Field  The metal is almost totally indestructible  resistant to various degrees of damage from energy  heat  lasers  etc  Only X Ionizer technology can cut the metal  as established when the Captain Atom Project uses it to remove the Silver Shield s skin  The katana wielded by the  Cambodian  that once sliced through Atom s side was also X Ionized  The magical guns of the Crimson Avenger were able to crack his skin  Breaking through it causes Captain Atom to Quantum Jump as if he has absorbed too much energy   edit  X Ionizer The X Ionizer is a molecular hardening technology invented by Doctor Heinrich Megala of Project Atom  introduced in the Cary Bates run of the DC Comics published Captain Atom  Because of the nearly invulnerable nature of the alien metal discovered  the scientists needed some way to cut it in order to perform experiments  Doctor Heinrich Megala of Project Atom developed a device that would make the molecular lattices of an object knit together in such a way that it became superdense and compact  in effect  making the object nearly indestructible  Also  any edge on an X Ionized object would attain the sharpness of a monofilament edge  enabling the object to cut finer and cleaner than the most advanced blade or laser  Once transformed  the object would then be able to cut through virtually any material  including the Dilustel  quantum metal  skin of the Silver Shield which was used to empower Captain Atom  Major Force  and Bombshell  29  A mercenary known as the Cambodian wore a suit of X Ionized armor  and uses an X ionized katana to cut through Captain Atom s skin in

sequences of Alex Ross and Mark Waid s 1996 graphic novel Kingdom Come  printed under DC Comics   Elseworlds  imprint  His death at the hands of the villain Parasite  and the irradiation of Kansas

Comics in the early 1980s  Originally  these Charlton characters were to be reintroduced in writer Alan Moore s limited series Watchmen  however  this was deemed to render the characters unusable for future stories  and characters inspired by the Charlton originals were used instead  31  32 Watchmen s Doctor Manhattan is based on Captain Atom  and like Captain Atom  gained similar powers through a similar scientific mishap  33   edit  Breach Main article  Breach  comics  In 2004  DC launched an ongoing series called Breach  The series was originally planned as a revamp of the Captain Atom concept  but Breach was subsequently re conceived as a completely new character  The 2005 mini series Infinite Crisis revealed that Breach would have been a native of Earth Eight if the Multiverse had continued to exist after Crisis on Infinite Earths as his world s counterpart to Captain Atom  34  The 2007 series Countdown  Arena at first suggests that a new Breach was created on the Earth 8 of the new Multiverse  although whether this indeed happened is called into question when the Breach featured in the miniseries is revealed to be the same mainstream Breach featured in the eponymous limited series  Breach is killed when absorbed into Monarch in the last issue of Countdown  Arena   edit  52 Multiverse Main article  52  comics  In the final issue of 52  a new Multiverse is revealed  originally consisting of 52 identical realities  Among the parallel realities shown is one designated  Earth 4   As a result of Mister Mind  eating  aspects of this reality  it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre Crisis Earth 4  including Captain Atom and the other Charlton characters  The names of the characters are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear  but the Captain Atom is visually similar to Charlton s original version of the character  35  However  according to comments by Grant Morrison  this alternate universe is not the pre Crisis Earth 4  36  2007 s

is a general who never went through with the dilustel experiment  and is consequently much older than in the original timeline  General Adam controls the body and physical actions of Project Six s

Unlimited  Captain Atom appears in the animated television series Justice League Unlimited voiced by George Eads in his first appearance and by Chris Cox in all subsequent ones  The JLU version of the character speaks with a slight Texas accent  and his true identity is  Captain Nathaniel Adams   a former member of the U S  Air Force  In this series  Captain Atom is a disembodied mass of energy contained within a special suit  similar to Wildfire of the Legion of Super Heroes  Like his comic counterpart  he can manipulate all forms of radiation  but his containment suit can only store a set amount of energy  which  if exceeded  causes him to explode like a nuclear bomb  He serves as a mildly antagonistic political foil for Green Arrow  who says to Captain Atom   I think you re what I marched against back in college    in much the same way the Silver Age Hawkman did in the comics  that is  the military officer and the former peace activist maintain their political differences through bickering during downtime  although this type of conflict has not been developed since the pair made peace in their first mission together  When  Task Force X   the series version of the Suicide Squad  infiltrates the Watchtower  it is when the Captain is one of the few on duty  Ironically  he is unable to save Plastique from the explosion the Task Force uses to cover their escape  During the Cadmus arc  Captain Atom is briefly turned against the Justice League by his superiors in the U S  Air Force  who at the time are acting on instructions from Project Cadmus   Question Authority    He challenges Superman in an effort to uphold his orders to keep the Question in Cadmus custody  using  Red Sun Radiation  as a means of fighting him  Despite this he only hinders Superman briefly before being beaten after an extended battle  He returns to the League following this  His appearances throughout the rest of the series are fairly minor  His last appearance is in the finale  where he is seen in the  curtain call  with fellow Ditko creations the Question  the Creeper  Hawk and Dove  Captain Atom appears in the Young Justice animated series  40  He is seen as a member of the Justice League in the hour long pilot episode   Independence Day   and later makes a cameo appearance in  Schooled   where Amazo is shown utiliizing Captain Atom s abilities during a battle with Superboy  He is also featured in the tie in comic  where he gets the team to investigate the crime he supposedly committed  His surname is also  Adams  in this version  Captain Atom appears in the Batman  The Brave and the Bold episode  Powerless    voiced by Brian Bloom  This version is introduced as  Nathaniel Christopher Adams aka Allen Adams aka Cameron Scott   an arrogant  pompous  egocentric hero who is fond of making public service announcements  After joining the Justice League International  he berates Batman due to his lack of any special powers and displays little respect for him  unlike other heroes who see Batman as an authority   However during a fight with Major Force  Captain Atom is drained of his powers and loses confidence in himself  With the help of Aquaman  he learns to be a hero without his old abilities and in the end  Captain Atom takes down Major Force on his own and regains his powers  However the episode ends with a gag suggesting that Captain Atom didn t learn his lesson and still has very little respect for people without powers   edit  Film Captain Atom appears in the animated movie Superman Batman  Public Enemies  where he is played by Xander Berkeley  He leads a team of superpowered individuals working for the government under the command of President Lex Luthor  consisting of Power Girl  Major Force  Black Lightning  Starfire  Katana and later Captain Marvel and Hawkman  He and his team try to convince Superman to join them  but he refuses to get involved with anyone working for Luthor  Later  Captain Atom and The Justice League defeat the assembled villains and try to arrest Superman and Batman for the murder of Metallo  During the battle  Captain Atom and Major Force defeat Superman  Just as Major Force is about to kill Superman  Captain Atom stops him  Superman defeated Captain Atom and Major Force as well as the entire team  After knocking out the others  he escapes with Power Girl and Batman  Later  Luthor berates Captain Atom for failing and orders him to finish the job  Captain Atom s team finds Batman  Superman and Power Girl and fight them again  Just as Superman defeats Captain Atom  Captain Atom sneaks away and overhears an argument between Batman and Major Force  While listening to the argument  he learns from Batman that Luthor had Major Force kill Metallo to frame Superman  Realizing the truth  he changes sides and destroys Major Force after Power Girl and the rest weaken him  however in the process  Captain Atom is struck with sufficient force to send him into a coma  After Batman destroys the Kryptonite meteor that was heading for Earth  Superman defeats Luthor  who is then taken into custody by Captain Atom and his team  41   edit  Video games Captain Atom appears in
