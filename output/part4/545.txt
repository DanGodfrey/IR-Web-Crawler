  Politics portal v t e The Iraq War  or the War in Iraq  also referred to as the Occupation of Iraq  the Second Gulf War  or Operation Iraqi Freedom by the United States military   was a conflict that occurred in Iraq from March 20  2003 41  42  to December 18  2011  43  though sectarian violence continues since and caused hundreds of fatalities  Prior to the war  the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom claimed that Iraq s alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction  WMD  posed a threat to their security and that of their coalition regional allies  44  45  46  In 2002  the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1441 which called for Iraq to completely cooperate with UN weapon inspectors to verify that Iraq was not in possession of WMD and cruise missiles  The United Nations Monitoring  Verification and Inspection Commission  UNMOVIC  found no evidence of WMD  but could not verify the accuracy of Iraq s weapon declarations  47  48  49  50  Lead weapons inspector Hans Blix advised the UN Security Council that while Iraq was cooperating in terms of access  Iraq s declarations with regards to WMD still could not be verified  47  51  After investigation following the invasion  the U S  led Iraq Survey Group concluded that Iraq had ended its nuclear  chemical  and biological programs in 1991 and had no active programs at the time of the invasion  but that they intended to resume production if the Iraq sanctions were lifted  52  Although some degraded remnants of misplaced or abandoned chemical weapons from before 1991 were found  they were not the weapons which had been the one of the main arguments for the invasion  53  Some US officials also accused Iraqi President Saddam Hussein of harboring and supporting al Qaeda  54  but no evidence of a meaningful connection was ever found  55  56  Other proclaimed reasons for the invasion included Iraq s financial support for the families of Palestinian suicide bombers  57  Iraqi government human rights abuses  58  and an effort to spread democracy to the country  59  60  The invasion of Iraq led to an occupation and the eventual capture of President Hussein  who was later tried in an Iraqi court of law and executed by the new Iraqi government  Violence against coalition forces and among various sectarian groups soon led to the Iraqi insurgency  strife between many Sunni and Shia Iraqi groups  and the emergence of a new faction of Al Qaeda in Iraq  61  62  In June 2008  U S  Department of Defense officials claimed security and economic indicators began to show signs of improvement in what they hailed as significant and fragile gains  63  Iraq was fifth on the 2008 Failed States Index  64  and sixth on the 2009 list  65  As public opinion favoring troop withdrawals increased and as Iraqi forces began to take responsibility for security  member nations of the Coalition withdrew their forces  66  67  In late 2008  the U S  and Iraqi governments approved a Status of Forces Agreement effective through January 1  2012  68  The Iraqi Parliament also ratified a Strategic Framework Agreement with the U S   69  aimed at ensuring cooperation in constitutional rights  threat deterrence  education  70  energy development  and other areas  71  In late February 2009  newly elected U S  President Barack Obama announced an 18 month withdrawal window for combat forces  with approximately 50 000 troops remaining in the country  to advise and train Iraqi security forces and to provide intelligence and surveillance   72  73  General Ray Odierno  the top U S  military commander in Iraq  said he believes all U S  troops will be out of the country by the end of 2011  74  while UK forces ended combat operations on April 30  2009  75  Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki has said he supports the accelerated pullout of U S  forces  76  In a speech at the Oval Office on 31 August 2010 Obama declared  the American combat mission in Iraq has ended  Operation Iraqi Freedom is over  and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country   77  78  79  Beginning September 1  2010  the American operational name for its involvement in Iraq changed from  Operation Iraqi Freedom  to  Operation New Dawn   The remaining 50 000 U S  troops were designated as  advise and assist brigades  assigned to non combat operations while retaining the ability to revert to combat operations as necessary  Two combat aviation brigades also remain in Iraq  80  In September 2010  the Associated Press issued an internal memo reminding its reporters that  combat in Iraq is not over   and  U S  troops remain involved in combat operations alongside Iraqi forces  although U S  officials say the American combat mission has formally ended   81  82  On October 21  2011  President Obama announced that all U S  troops and trainers would leave Iraq by the end of the year  bringing the U S  mission in Iraq to an end  83  On December 15  2011  U S  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta officially declared the Iraq War over  at a flag lowering ceremony in Baghdad  84  The last U S  troops left Iraqi territory on December 18  2011 at 4 27 UTC  43  Since U S  withdrawal  a new wave of sectarian violence erupted across Iraq  raising concerns over a full blown civil war between the main factions of Iraq  most notably the

and 2002 in Iraq UN weapons inspections resume The issue of Iraq s disarmament reached a crisis in 2002 2003  when Bush demanded a complete end to alleged Iraqi production of weapons of mass destruction and full compliance with UN Security Council Resolutions requiring UN weapons inspectors unfettered access to suspected weapons production facilities  The UN had prohibited Iraq from developing or possessing such weapons after the Gulf War and required Iraq to permit inspections confirming compliance  During inspections in 1999  Iraq alleged that UN inspectors included U S  intelligence agents that supplied the U S  with a direct feed of conversations between Iraqi security agencies as well as other information  This was confirmed by the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal  85  During 2002  Bush repeatedly warned of military action unless inspections were allowed to progress unfettered  In accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1441 Iraq reluctantly agreed to new inspections in late 2002  A third weapons inspection team in 2003 led by David Kelly  weapons expert  viewed and photographed with the cooperation of Iraqis two alleged mobile weapons laboratories which were facilities for the production of hydrogen gas to fill balloons  Shortly before the invasion Hans Blix  the lead weapons inspector  advised the UN Security Council that Iraq was cooperating with inspections and that the confirmation of disarmament through inspections could be achieved in a short period of time if Iraq remained cooperative  51  Alleged weapons of mass destruction Yellowcake uranium A UN weapons inspector in Iraq Before the Gulf War  in 1990  Iraq had stockpiled 550 short tons  500 t  of yellowcake uranium at the Tuwaitha nuclear complex about 20 kilometres  12 mi  south of Baghdad  86  In late February 2002  the CIA sent former Ambassador Joseph Wilson to investigate reports  later found to be forgeries  that Iraq was attempting to purchase additional yellowcake from Niger  Wilson returned and informed the CIA that reports of yellowcake sales to Iraq were  unequivocally wrong   The Bush administration  however  continued to allege Iraq s attempts to obtain additional yellowcake were a justification for military action  most prominently in the January 2003  State of the Union address  in which President Bush declared that Iraq had sought uranium  citing British intelligence sources  87  2003 State of the Union Address given by President George W  Bush In response  Wilson wrote a critical New York Times op ed piece in June 2003 stating that he had personally investigated claims of yellowcake purchases and believed them to be fraudulent  88  After Wilson s op ed  Wilson s wife Valerie Plame was publicly identified as an undercover CIA analyst by a columnist  This led to a Justice Department investigation into the source of the leak  On May 1  2005  the  Downing Street memo  was published in The Sunday Times  It contained an overview of a secret July 23  2002  meeting among British government  Ministry of Defence  and British intelligence figures who discussed the build up to the Iraq war including direct references to classified U S  policy of the time  The memo stated   Bush wanted to remove Saddam  through military action  justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD  But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy   89  In September 2002  the Bush administration  the CIA and the DIA said attempts by Iraq to acquire high strength aluminum tubes that were prohibited under the UN monitoring program and which they said pointed to a clandestine effort to make centrifuges to enrich uranium for nuclear bombs  90  This analysis was opposed by the United States Department of Energy  DOE  and INR  which was significant because of DOE s expertise in such gas centrifuges and nuclear weapons programs  The DOE and INR argued that the Iraqi tubes were poorly suited for centrifuges and that while it was technically possible with additional modification  conventional military uses were more plausible  91  A report released by the Institute for Science and International Security in 2002 reported that it was highly unlikely that the tubes could be used to enrich uranium  92  An effort by the DOE to correct this detail in comments prepared for United States Secretary of State Colin Powell s UN appearance was rebuffed by the administration 92  93  and Powell  in his address to the UN Security Council just before the war  referenced the aluminum tubes  stating that while experts disagreed on whether or not the tubes were destined for a centrifuge program  the specifications of the tubes were unusually tight  94  Powell later admitted he had presented what turned out to be an inaccurate case to the UN on Iraqi weapons  and the intelligence he was relying on was  in some cases   deliberately misleading   95  96  97  After the United States presidential election  2008  and the election of Democratic party nominee Barack Obama  president Bush stated that   my  biggest regret of all the presidency has to have been the intelligence failure in Iraq   98  Poison gas The CIA had contacted Iraq s foreign minister  Naji Sabri  who was being paid by the French as an agent  Sabri informed them that Saddam had hidden poison gas among Sunni tribesmen  had ambitions for a nuclear program but that it was not active  and that no biological weapons were being produced or stockpiled  although research was underway  99  According to Sidney Blumenthal  George Tenet briefed Bush on September 18  2002  that Sabri had informed them that Iraq did not have WMD  Bush dismissed this top secret intelligence from Hussein s inner circle which was approved by two senior CIA officers  The information was never shared with Congress or CIA agents examining whether Saddam had such weapons  100  Tenet  left  in pink tie  in the Oval Office with President George W  Bush  Biological weapons Based on reports obtained by the German intelligence service from an Iraqi defector codenamed  Curveball   Colin Powell presented evidence to the United Nations security council that Iraq had an active biological weapons programme  On February 15  2011  the defector a scientist identified as Rafid Ahmed Alwan al Janafi admitted to journalists working for The Guardian newspaper that he lied to the Bundesnachrichtendienst in order to strengthen the case against Saddam Hussein  whom he wished to see removed from power  101  Result In December 2009  former Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that he  would still have thought it right to remove  Saddam Hussein   regardless of whether Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction or not  102  Preparations for Iraq war President George Bush  surrounded by leaders of the House and Senate  announces the Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq  October 2  2002  During 2002 the amount of ordnance used by British and American aircraft patrolling the no fly zones of Iraq increased compared to the previous years 103  and by August had  become a full air offensive   Tommy Franks  the allied commander  later stated that the bombing was designed to  degrade  the Iraqi air defense system before an invasion  104  In October 2002  a few days before the U S  Senate voted on the Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq  about 75 senators were told in closed session that Iraq had the means of attacking the Eastern Seaboard of the U S  with biological or chemical weapons delivered by unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs   45  On February 5  2003  Colin Powell presented further evidence in his Iraqi WMD program presentation to the UN Security Council that UAVs were ready to be launched against the U S  At the time  there was a vigorous dispute within the U S  military and intelligence communities as to whether CIA conclusions about Iraqi UAVs were accurate 105  and other intelligence agencies suggested that Iraq did not possess any offensive UAV capability  saying the few they had were designed for surveillance and intended for reconnaissance  106  The Senate voted to approve the Joint Resolution with the support of large bipartisan majorities on October 11  2002  providing the Bush administration with a legal basis for the U S  invasion under U S  law  The resolution granted the authorization by the Constitution of the United States and the United States Congress for the President to command the military to fight anti United States violence  Citing the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998  the resolution reiterated that it should be the policy of the United States to remove the Hussein regime and promote a democratic replacement  The authorization was signed by President George W  Bush on October 16  2002  Chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix remarked in January 2003 that  Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance not even today of the disarmament  which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace   107  Among other things he noted that 1 000 short tons  910 t  of chemical agent were unaccounted for  information on Iraq s VX nerve agent program was missing  and that  no convincing evidence  was presented for the destruction of 8 500 litres  1 900 imp gal  2 200 US gal  of anthrax that had been declared  107  United States Secretary of State Colin Powell holding a model vial of anthrax while giving a presentation to the United Nations Security Council In the 2003 State of the Union address  President Bush said  we know that Iraq  in the late 1990s  had several mobile biological weapons labs   On February 5  2003  Secretary of State Colin Powell appeared before the UN to present American evidence that Iraq was hiding unconventional weapons  108  The French government also believed that Saddam had stockpiles of anthrax and botulism toxin  and the ability to produce VX  109  In March  Blix said progress had been made in inspections  and no evidence of WMD had been found  47  Iraqi scientist Rafid Ahmed Alwan al Janabi codenamed  Curveball   admitted in February 2011  that he lied to the CIA about biological weapons in order to get the US to attack and remove Hussein from power  110  In early 2003  the U S   British  and Spanish governments proposed the so called  eighteenth resolution  to give Iraq a deadline for compliance with previous resolutions enforced by the threat of military action  This proposed resolution was subsequently withdrawn due to lack of support on the UN Security Council  In particular  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  members France  Germany and Canada and non NATO member Russia were opposed to military intervention in Iraq  due to the high level of risk to the international community s security  and defended disarmament through diplomacy  111  112  A meeting between George W  Bush and Tony Blair took place on January 31  2003  in the White House  A secret memo of this meeting purportedly showed that the Bush administration had already decided on the invasion of Iraq at that point  Bush was allegedly floating the idea of painting a U 2 spyplane in UN colors and letting it fly low over Iraq to provoke Iraqi forces into shooting it down  thereby providing a pretext for the U S  and Britain to invade  Bush and Blair made a secret deal to carry out the invasion regardless of whether WMD were discovered by UN weapons inspectors  in direct contradiction with statements Blair made to the British House of Commons afterwards that the Iraqi regime would be given a final chance to disarm  In the memo  Bush is paraphrased as saying   The start date for the military campaign was now pencilled in for 10 March  This was when the bombing would begin    113  Bush said to Blair that he  thought it unlikely that there would be internecine warfare between the different religious and ethnic groups  in Iraq after the war  Opposition to invasion Further information  criticism of the Iraq War  legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq  and legality of the Iraq War In October 2002 former U S  President Bill Clinton warned about possible dangers of pre emptive military action against Iraq  Speaking in the UK on a Labour Party conference he said   As a preemptive action today  however well justified  may come back with unwelcome consequences in the future    I don t care how precise your bombs and your weapons are  when you set them off  innocent people will die   114  115  Anti War protest in London  2002 On January 20  2003  French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin declared  we believe that military intervention would be the worst solution   116  Meanwhile anti war groups across the world organised public protests  According to French academic Dominique Reyni   between January 3 and April 12  2003  36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3 000 protests against war in Iraq  with demonstrations on February 15  2003  being the largest and most prolific  117  In February 2003  the U S  Army s top general  Eric Shinseki  told the Senate Armed Services Committee that it would take  several hundred thousand soldiers  to secure Iraq  118  Two days later  U S  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the post war troop commitment would be less than the number of troops required to win the war  and that  the idea that it would take several hundred thousand U S  forces is far from the mark   Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said Shineski s estimate was  way off the mark   because other countries would take part in an occupying force  119  In March 2003  Hans Blix reported that  No evidence of proscribed activities have so far been found  in Iraq  saying that progress was made in inspections which would continue  He estimated the time remaining for disarmament being verified through inspections to be  months   47  But the U S  government announced that  diplomacy has failed   and that it would proceed with a coalition of allied countries named the  coalition of the willing  to rid Iraq of its alleged WMD  The U S  government abruptly advised UN weapons inspectors to leave Baghdad immediately  There were serious legal questions surrounding the launching of the war against Iraq and the Bush Doctrine of preemptive war in general  On September 16  2004  Kofi Annan  the Secretary General of the United Nations  said of the invasion   I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN Charter  From our point of view  from the Charter point of view  it was illegal   In November 2008 Lord Bingham  the former British Law Lord  described the war a serious violation of international law  and accused Britain and the U S  of acting like a  world vigilante   He also criticized the post invasion record of Britain as  an occupying power in Iraq   Regarding the treatment of Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib  Bingham said   Particularly disturbing to proponents of the rule of law is the cynical lack of concern for international legality among some top officials in the Bush administration   120  In July 2010  Deputy Prime Minister of the UK Nick Clegg  in an official PMQs session in Parliament  condemned the invasion of Iraq as illegal  121  Theorist Francis Fukuyama has argued that  the Iraq war and the close association it created between military invasion and democracy promotion tarnished

entered Iraq on July 10  2002  123  This team was composed of members of the CIA s Special Activities Division and was later joined by members of the U S  military s elite Joint Special Operations Command  JSOC   124  Together  they prepared for the invasion of conventional forces  These efforts consisted of persuading the commanders of several Iraqi military divisions to surrender rather than oppose the invasion  and to identify all of the initial leadership targets during very high risk reconnaissance missions  124  Most importantly  their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to become the northern front of the invasion  Together this force defeated Ansar al Islam in Iraqi Kurdistan before the invasion and then defeated the Iraqi army in the north  124  125  The battle against Ansar al Islam led to the death of a substantial number of militants and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat  123  126  At 5 34 a m  Baghdad time on March 20  2003  9 34 p m   March 19 EST  the military invasion of Iraq began  127  The 2003 invasion of Iraq  led by U S  army General Tommy Franks  began under the codename  Operation Iraqi Liberation   128  later renamed  Operation Iraqi Freedom   the UK codename Operation Telic  and the Australian codename Operation Falconer  Coalition forces also cooperated with Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the north  Approximately forty other governments  the  U S  led coalition against Iraq   participated by providing troops  equipment  services  security  and special forces  with 248 000 soldiers from the United States  45 000 British soldiers  2 000 Australian soldiers and 194 Polish soldiers from Special Forces unit GROM sent to Kuwait for the invasion  129  The invasion force was also supported by Iraqi Kurdish militia troops  estimated to number upwards of 70 000  130  The stated objectives of the invasion were  end the Hussein regime  eliminate whatever weapons of mass destruction could be found  eliminate whatever Islamist militants could be found  obtain intelligence on militant networks  distribute humanitarian aid  secure Iraq s petroleum infrastructure  and assist in creating a representative but compliant government as a model for other Middle East nations  The invasion was a quick and decisive operation encountering major resistance  though not what the U S   British and other forces expected  The Iraqi regime had prepared to fight both a conventional and irregular war at the same time  conceding territory when faced with superior conventional forces  largely armored  but launching smaller scale attacks in the rear using fighters dressed in civilian and paramilitary clothes  This achieved some temporary successes and created unexpected challenges for the invading forces  especially the U S  military  Coalition troops launched air and amphibious assault on the Al Faw peninsula to secure the oil fields there and the important ports  supported by warships of the Royal Navy  Polish Navy  and Royal Australian Navy  The United States Marine Corps  15th Marine Expeditionary Unit  attached to 3 Commando Brigade and the Polish Special Forces unit GROM attacked the port of Umm Qasr  while the British Army s 16 Air Assault Brigade secured the oilfields in southern Iraq  Polish commandos captured offshore oil platforms near the port  preventing their destruction  U S  Marines from 1st

S  3rd Infantry Division moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad  while the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force moved more easterly along Highway 1 through the center of the country  and 1  UK  Armoured Division moved northward through the eastern marshland  The U S  1st Marine Division fought through Nasiriyah in a battle to seize the major road junction and nearby Talil Airfield  The United States Army 3rd Infantry Division defeated Iraqi forces entrenched in and around the airfield and bypassed the city to the west in its drive up north through western Iraq  With the Nasiriyah and Talil Airfields secured in its rear  the 3rd Infantry Division supported by 101st Airborne Division continued its attack north toward Najaf and Karbala  but a severe sand storm slowed the coalition advance and there was a halt to consolidate and make sure the supply lines were secure  When they started again they secured the Karbala Gap  a key approach to Baghdad  then secured the bridges over the Euphrates River  and the American forces poured through the gap on to Baghdad  In the middle of Iraq  the 1st Marine Division fought its way to the eastern side of Baghdad  and prepared for the attack into Badhdad to seize it  131  In the north  OIF 1 used the largest special operations force since the successful attack on the Taliban government of Afghanistan just over a year earlier  The Iraqi army was quickly overwhelmed in each engagement it faced with U S  forces  with the elite Fedayeen Saddam putting up strong  sometimes suicidal  resistance before melting

fall of Baghdad was accompanied by a widespread outpouring of gratitude toward the invaders  but also massive civil disorder  including the looting of public and government buildings and drastically increased crime  135  136  According to the Pentagon  250 000 short tons  230 000 t   of 650 000 short tons  590 000 t  total  of ordnance was looted  providing a significant source of ammunition for the Iraqi insurgency  The invasion phase concluded when Tikrit  Hussein s home town  fell with little resistance to the U S  Marines of Task Force Tripoli and on April 15 the coalition declared the invasion effectively over  In the invasion phase of the war  March 19 April 30   9 200 Iraqi combatants were killed along with 7 299 civilians  primarily by U S  air and ground forces  137  Coalition

former U S  military officer  but his appointment lasted only until May 11  2003  when President Bush appointed L  Paul Bremer  Bremer served until the CPA s dissolution in July 2004  Another group created by the multinational force in Iraq post invasion was the 1 400 member international Iraq Survey Group who conducted a fact finding mission to find Iraqi weapons of mass destruction  WMD

insurgency and Iraq War insurgent attacks On May 1  2003  President Bush staged a dramatic visit to the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln operating a few miles west of San Diego  California  The visit climaxed at sunset with Bush s now well known  Mission Accomplished  speech  In this nationally televised speech  delivered before the sailors and airmen on the flight deck  Bush effectively declared victory due to the defeat of Iraq s conventional forces  However  Saddam remained at large and significant pockets of resistance remained  After President Bush s speech  coalition forces noticed a gradually increasing flurry of attacks on its troops in various regions  especially in the  Sunni Triangle   141  The initial Iraqi insurgents were supplied by hundreds of weapons caches created before the invasion by the Iraqi army and Republican Guard  Initially  Iraqi resistance  described by the coalition as  Anti Iraqi Forces   largely stemmed from fedayeen and Hussein Ba ath Party loyalists  but soon religious radicals and Iraqis angered by the occupation contributed to the insurgency  The three provinces with the highest number of attacks were Baghdad  Al Anbar  and Salah Ad Din  Those three provinces account for 35  of the population  but as of December 5  2006 were responsible for 73  of U S  military deaths and an even higher percentage of recent U S  military deaths  about 80    142  Insurgents used guerrilla tactics including  mortars  missiles  suicide attacks  snipers  improvised explosive devices  IEDs   car bombs  small arms fire  usually with assault rifles   and RPGs  rocket propelled grenades   as well as sabotage against the petroleum  water  and electrical infrastructure  Seabees of NMCB 15  Naval Mobile Construction Battalion   on a convoy in

compliant democratic state capable of defending itself from non coalition forces  as well as overcoming internal divisions  143  144  Meanwhile  coalition military forces launched several operations around the Tigris River peninsula and in the Sunni Triangle  A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle  Toward the end of 2003  the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase  A sharp surge in guerrilla attacks ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the  Ramadan Offensive   as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan  To counter this offensive  coalition forces begin to use air power and artillery again for the first time since the end of the invasion by striking suspected ambush sites and mortar launching positions  Surveillance of major routes  patrols  and raids on suspected insurgents were stepped up  In addition  two villages  including Hussein s birthplace of al Auja and the small town of Abu Hishma were surrounded by barbed wire and carefully monitored  U S  President George W  Bush with U S  troops at the Bob Hope Dining Facility on Thanksgiving 2003 at Baghdad airport  Capturing former government leaders See also  Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal and Trial of Saddam Hussein In the summer of 2003  the multinational forces focused on capturing the remaining leaders of the former government  On July 22  a raid by the U S  101st Airborne Division and soldiers from Task Force 20 killed Hussein s sons  Uday and Qusay  along with one of his grandsons  In all  over 300 top leaders of the former government were killed or captured  as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel  Most significantly  Saddam Hussein himself was captured on December 13  2003  on a farm near Tikrit in Operation Red Dawn  145  The operation was conducted by the United States Army s 4th Infantry Division and members of Task Force 121  Intelligence on Saddam s whereabouts came from his family members and former bodyguards  146  With the capture of Hussein and a drop in the number of insurgent attacks  some concluded the multinational forces were prevailing in the fight against the insurgency  The provisional government began training the new Iraqi security forces intended to police the country  and the United States promised over  20 billion in reconstruction money in the form of credit against Iraq s future oil revenues  Oil revenue was also used for rebuilding schools and for work on the electrical and refining infrastructure  Shortly after the capture of Hussein  elements left out of the Coalition Provisional Authority began to agitate for elections and the formation of an Iraqi Interim Government  Most prominent among these was the Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani  The Coalition Provisional Authority opposed allowing democratic elections at this time  147  The insurgents stepped up their activities  The two most turbulent centers were the area

Qaeda in Iraq  an affiliated al Qaeda group   led by Abu Musab al Zarqawi helping to drive the insurgency  As the insurgency grew there was a distinct change in targeting from the coalition forces towards the new Iraqi Security Forces  as hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police were killed over the next few months in a series of massive bombings  An organized Sunni insurgency  with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations  was becoming more powerful throughout Iraq  The Shia Mahdi Army also began launching attacks on coalition targets in an attempt to seize control from Iraqi security forces  The southern and central portions of Iraq were beginning to erupt in urban guerrilla combat as multinational forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive  The most serious fighting of the war so far began on March 31  2004  when Iraqi insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a Blackwater USA convoy led by four U S  private military contractors who were providing security for food caterers Eurest Support Services  149  The four armed contractors  Scott Helvenston  Jerko Zovko  Wesley Batalona  and Michael Teague  were killed with grenades and small arms fire  Subsequently  their bodies were dragged from their vehicles by local people  beaten  set ablaze  and their burned corpses hung over a bridge crossing the Euphrates  150  Photos of the event were released to news agencies worldwide  causing a great deal of indignation and moral outrage in the United States  and prompting an unsuccessful  pacification  of the city  the First Battle of Fallujah in April 2004  US Marines fight in the city of Fallujah during Operation Phantom Fury Operation Al Fajr  New Dawn  in November 2004  The offensive was resumed in November 2004 in the bloodiest battle of the war so far  the Second Battle of Fallujah  described by the U S  military as  the heaviest urban combat  that they had been involved in  since the battle of Hue City in Vietnam   151  During the assault  U S  forces used white phosphorus as an incendiary weapon against insurgent personnel  attracting controversy  The 46 day battle resulted in a victory for the coalition  with 95 U S  soldiers killed along with approximately 1 350 insurgents  Fallujah was totally devastated during the fighting  though civilian casualties were low  as they had mostly fled before the battle  152  Another major event of that year was the revelation of widespread prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib which received international media attention in April 2004  First reports of the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse  as well as graphic pictures showing U S  military personnel taunting and abusing Iraqi prisoners  came to public attention from a 60 Minutes II news report  April 28  and a Seymour M  Hersh article in The New Yorker  posted online on April 30   153  Military correspondent Thomas Ricks claimed that these revelations dealt a blow to the moral justifications for the occupation in the eyes of many people  especially Iraqis  and was a turning point in the war  154  2004 also marked the beginning of Military Transition Teams in Iraq  which were teams of U S  military advisors

insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the prior average of 70  Hopes for a quick end to the insurgency and a withdrawal of U S  troops were dashed in May  Iraq s bloodiest month since the invasion  Suicide bombers  believed to be mainly disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs  Syrians and Saudis  tore through Iraq  Their targets were often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations of Shias  As a result  over 700 Iraqi civilians died in that month  as well as 79 U S  soldiers  The summer of 2005 saw fighting around Baghdad and at Tall Afar in northwestern Iraq as U S  forces tried to seal off the Syrian border  This led to fighting in the autumn in the small towns of the Euphrates valley between the capital and that border  156  A referendum was held on October 15 in which the new Iraqi

in the Iraqi city of Samarra  on February 22  2006  The explosion at the mosque  one of the holiest sites in Shi a Islam  is believed to have been caused by a bomb planted by al Qaeda  Although no injuries occurred in the blast  the mosque was severely damaged and the bombing resulted in violence over the following days  Over 100 dead bodies with bullet holes were found on February 23  and at least 165 people are thought to have been killed  In the aftermath of this attack the U S  military calculated that the average homicide rate in Baghdad tripled from 11 to 33 deaths per day  In 2006 the UN described the environment in Iraq as a  civil war like situation   158  On March 6  five United States Army soldiers of the 502nd Infantry Regiment  raped the 14 year old Iraqi girl Abeer Hamza al Janabi  and then murdered her  her father  her mother Fakhriya Taha Muhasen and her six year old sister  The soldiers then set fire to the girls body to conceal evidence of the crime  159  Four of the soldiers were convicted of rape and murder and the fifth was convicted of lesser crimes for the involvement in the war crime  that became known as the Mahmudiyah killings  160  161  On June 6  2006 The US was successful in tracking Abu Musab al Zarqawi  the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq who was killed in a targeted killing  while attending a meeting in an isolated safehouse approximately 8 km

without the approval of the Iraqi parliament  170  Pressures on U S  troops were compounded by the continuing withdrawal of coalition forces  In early 2007  British Prime Minister Blair announced that following Operation Sinbad British troops would begin to withdraw from Basra Governorate  handing security over to the Iraqis  171  In July Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen also announced the withdrawal of 441 Danish troops from Iraq  leaving only a unit of nine soldiers manning four observational helicopters  172  Planned troop reduction In a speech made to Congress on September 10

in Iraq was reported curtailed by 40 80   according to a Pentagon report  175  Independent reports 176  177  raised questions about those assessments  An Iraqi military spokesman claimed that civilian deaths since the start of the troop surge plan were 265 in Baghdad  down from 1 440 in the four previous weeks  The New York Times counted more than 450 Iraqi civilians killed during the same 28 day period  based on initial daily reports from Iraqi Interior Ministry and hospital officials  Historically  the daily counts tallied by the NYT have underestimated the total death toll by 50  or more when compared to studies by the United Nations  which rely upon figures from the Iraqi Health Ministry and morgue figures  178  The rate of U S  combat deaths in Baghdad nearly doubled to 3 14 per day in the first seven weeks of the  surge  in security activity  compared to previous period  Across the rest of Iraq it reduced slightly  179  180  An Iraqi woman looks on as U S  soldiers search the

Nearly 800 civilians were killed by a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks on the northern Iraqi settlement of Qahtaniya  More than 100 homes and shops were destroyed in the blasts  U S  officials blamed al Qaeda  The targeted villagers belonged to the non Muslim Yazidi ethnic minority  The attack may have represented the latest in a feud that erupted earlier that year when members of the Yazidi community stoned to death a teenage girl called Du a Khalil Aswad accused of dating a Sunni Arab man and converting to Islam  The killing of the girl was recorded on camera mobiles and the video was uploaded onto the internet 181  182  183  184  On September 13  2007  Abdul Sattar Abu Risha was killed in a bomb attack in the city of Ramadi  185  He was an important U S  ally because he led the  Anbar Awakening   an alliance of Sunni Arab tribes that opposed al Qaeda  The latter organisation claimed responsibility for the attack  186  A statement posted on the Internet by the shadowy

levels since the first year of the American invasion   189  These  and several other positive developments  were attributed to the surge by many analysts  190  Data from the Pentagon and other U S  agencies such as the Government Accountability Office  GAO  found that daily attacks against civilians in Iraq remained  about the same  since February  The GAO also stated that there was no discernible trend in sectarian violence  191  However  this report ran counter to reports to Congress  which showed a general downward trend in civilian deaths and ethno sectarian violence since December 2006  192  By late 2007  as the U S  troop surge began to wind down  violence in Iraq had begun to decrease from its 2006 highs  193  Entire neighborhoods in Baghdad were ethnically cleansed

according to which the U S   surge  was not the primary reason for the drop in violence in 2007 2008  Instead  according to that view  the reduction of violence was due to newer covert techniques by U

World  book  A local memorial in North Carolina in December 2007  U S  casualty count can be seen in the background  308  The Bush Administration s rationale for the Iraq War has faced heavy criticism from an array of popular and official sources both inside and outside the United States  with many U S  citizens finding many parallels with the Vietnam War  309  For example  the Center for Public Integrity alleges that the Bush administration made a total of 935 false statements between 2001 and 2003 about Iraq s alleged threat to the United States  310  Both proponents and opponents of the invasion have also criticized the prosecution of the war effort along a number of other lines  Most significantly  critics have assailed the U S  and its allies for not devoting enough troops to the mission  not adequately planning for post invasion Iraq  and for permitting and perpetrating widespread human rights abuses  As the war has progressed  critics have also railed against the high human and financial costs  The court martial of Ehren Watada  the first U S  officer to refuse to serve in Iraq  ended in a mistrial because the Judge Advocate General s Corps would not consider the question of whether orders could be illegal  A federal district court judge ruled that Watada cannot face double jeopardy on three of his five charges  but abstained from ruling on whether the two remaining charges of conduct unbecoming an officer may still go forward  311  Another criticism of the initial intelligence leading up to the Iraq war comes from a former CIA officer who described the Office of Special Plans as a group of ideologues who were dangerous to U S  national security and a threat to world peace  and that the group lied and manipulated intelligence to further its agenda of removing Saddam  312  Subsequently  in 2008  the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity  a group partially funded by George Soros has enumerated a total of 935 allegedly false statements made by George W  Bush and six other top members of his administration in what it termed a  carefully launched campaign of misinformation  during the two year period following 9 11 attacks  in order to rally support for the invasion of Iraq  313  314    States participating in the invasion of Iraq   States in support of an invasion   States in opposition to an invasion   States with an uncertain or no official standpoint Criticisms include  Legality of the invasion 315  316  Human casualties Insufficient post invasion plans  in particular inadequate troop levels  a RAND study stated that 500 000 troops would be required for success  317  Financial costs with approximately  612 billion spent as of 4 09 the CBO has estimated the total cost of the war in Iraq to U S  taxpayers will be around  1 9 trillion  318  Adverse effect on U S  led global  war on terror  319  320  Damage to U S   traditional alliances and influence in the region  especially Israel 321  and Saudi Arabia  322  Endangerment and ethnic cleansing of religious and ethnic minorities 195  323  324  325  326  Disruption of Iraqi oil production and related energy security concerns  the price of oil has quadrupled since 2002  327  328  After President Barack Obama was inaugurated in 2009  some anti war groups decided to stop protesting even though the war was still going on  Some of them decided to stop because they felt they should give the new President time to establish his administration  and others stopped because they believed that Obama would end the war  329  Financial cost The financial cost of the war has been more than  4 55 billion   9 billion  to the UK  330  and over  845 billion to the U S   with the total cost to the U S  economy estimated at  3 trillion  331  A CNN report noted that the U S  led interim government  the Coalition Provisional Authority lasting until 2004 in Iraq had lost  8 8 billion in the Development Fund for Iraq  In June 2011  it was reported by CBS News that six billion in neatly packaged blocks of US  100 bills was literally air lifted into Iraq by the George W  Bush administration  which flew it into Baghdad aboard C 130 military cargo planes  In total  the Times says  12 billion in cash was flown into Iraq in 21 separate flights by May 2004  all of which has disappeared  An inspector general s report mentioned that   Severe inefficiencies and poor management  by the Coalition Provisional Authority would leave no guarantee that the money was properly used   said Stuart W  Bowen Jr   director of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction   The CPA did not establish or implement sufficient managerial  financial and contractual controls to ensure that funds were used in a transparent manner   332  Bowen told the Times the missing money may represent  the largest theft of funds in national history   333  Humanitarian crises More than half of Iraqi Christians have fled to neighboring countries since the start of the war  334  In FY 2007  the U S  resettled 1 608 Iraqi refugees  335  Main articles  Humanitarian crises of the Iraq War and Refugees of Iraq Malnutrition rates have risen from 19  before the U S  led invasion to a national average of 28  four years later  336  Some 60 70  of Iraqi children are suffering from psychological problems  337  68  of Iraqis have no access to safe drinking water  A cholera outbreak in northern Iraq is thought to be the result of poor water quality  338  As many as half of Iraqi doctors have left the country since 2003  339  The Foreign Policy Association reported that  Perhaps the most perplexing component of the Iraq refugee crisis    has been the inability for the U S  to absorb more Iraqis following the 2003 invasion of the country  To date  the U S  has granted less than 800 Iraqis refugee status  just 133 in 2007  By contrast  the U S  granted asylum to more than 100 000 Vietnamese refugees during the Vietnam War    340  Human rights abuses Main articles  Human rights in post invasion Iraq and Suicide bombings in Iraq since 2003 Throughout the entire Iraq war there have been human rights abuses on all sides of the conflict  Iraqi

Public opinion on the war Main article  Public opinion on the Iraq War International opinion According to a January 2007 BBC World Service poll of more than 26 000 people in 25 countries  73  of the global population disapproved of U S  handling of the Iraq War  363  A September 2007 poll conducted by the BBC found that two thirds of the world s population believed the U S  should withdraw its forces from Iraq  364  According to an April 2004 USA Today CNN Gallup Poll  only a third of the Iraqi people believed that  the American led occupation of their country is doing more good than harm  and a solid majority support an immediate military pullout even though they fear that could put them in greater danger   365  In 2006 it was found that majorities in the UK and Canada believed that the war in Iraq was  unjustified  and   in the UK   were critical of their government s support of U S  policies in Iraq  366  According to polls conducted by the Arab American Institute  four years after the invasion of Iraq  83  of Egyptians had a negative view of the U S  role in Iraq  68  of Saudi Arabians had a negative view  96  of the Jordanian population had a negative view  70  of the population of the United Arab Emirates and 76  of the Lebanese population also described their view as negative  367  The Pew Global Attitudes Project reports that in 2006 majorities in the Netherlands  Germany  Jordan  France  Lebanon  China  Spain  Indonesia  Turkey  Pakistan  and Morocco believed the world was safer before the Iraq War and the toppling of Hussein  Pluralities in the U S  and India believe the world is safer without Hussein  368  Iraqi opinion This article is outdated  Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information  Please see the talk page for more information   September 2010  A woman pleads with an Iraqi army soldier from 2nd Company  5th Brigade  2nd Iraqi Army Division to let a suspected insurgent free during a raid near Tafaria  Iraq From 2005 to 2007  polls consistently showed that a majority of Iraqis opposed the U S  invasion  369  370  371  Relation to the U S  Global War on Terrorism Main article  Iraq War and U S  Global War on Terror Further information  Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda  Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda timeline  and Criticism of the War on Terrorism Former President George W  Bush consistently referred to the Iraq war as  the central front in the War on Terror   and argued that if the U S  pulled out of Iraq   terrorists will follow us here   372  373  374  While other proponents of the war have regularly echoed this assertion  as the conflict has dragged on  members of the U S  Congress  the U S  public  and even U S  troops have questioned the connection between Iraq and the fight against anti U S  terrorism  In particular  a consensus has developed among intelligence experts that the Iraq war has increased terrorism  Counterterrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna frequently refers to the invasion of Iraq as a  fatal mistake   375  London s conservative International Institute for Strategic Studies concluded in 2004 that the occupation of Iraq had become  a potent global recruitment pretext  for mujahideen and that the invasion  galvanised  al Qaeda and  perversely inspired insurgent violence  there  376  The U S  National Intelligence Council concluded in a January 2005 report that the war in Iraq had become a breeding ground for a new generation of terrorists  David Low  the national intelligence officer for transnational threats  indicated that the report concluded that the war in Iraq provided terrorists with  a training ground  a recruitment ground  the opportunity for enhancing technical skills     There is even  under the best scenario  over time  the likelihood that some of the jihadists who are not killed there will  in a sense  go home  wherever home is  and will therefore disperse to various other countries   The Council s chairman Robert Hutchings said   At the moment  Iraq is a magnet for international terrorist activity   377  And the 2006 National Intelligence Estimate  which outlined the considered judgment of all 16 U S  intelligence agencies  held that  The Iraq conflict has become the  cause celebre  for jihadists  breeding a deep resentment of U S  involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement   378  Iranian involvement This article may be unbalanced towards certain viewpoints  Please improve the article by adding information on neglected viewpoints  or discuss the issue on the talk page   March 2012  Although some military intelligence analysts have concluded there is no concrete evidence  U S  Major General Rick Lynch has claimed that Iran has provided training  weapons  money  and intelligence to Shiite insurgents in Iraq and that up to 150 Iranian intelligence agents  plus members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard are believed to be active in Iraq at any given time  379  380  Lynch thinks that members of the Iranian Quds Force and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard have trained members of the Qazali terror network in explosives technology and also provided the network with arms  munitions  and military advisors  Many explosive devices  including improvised explosives  IEDs  and armor piercing penetrators  EFPs   used by insurgents are claimed by Lynch to be Iranian made or designed  In January 2008  Multi National Force   Iraq  MNFI  initiated Task Force Troy to identify Iranian made weapons  Their report was delivered in July 2008  Of 4 600 weapons caches discovered  only 98 contained at least one Iranian made weapon with these representing less than one half percent of the total number of weapons recovered  No Iranian weapons were discovered in Karbala or Basra and of the 350 armor piercing explosively formed penetrators  EFPs  found  none were of Iranian origin  Despite frequent claims that Iran is supplying weapons to insurgents  the MNFI report criticized official U S  claims on Iranian weapons  stating   Iranian munitions found in Iraq were likely purchased on the open market   381  According to two unnamed U S  officials  the Pentagon is examining the possibility that the Karbala provincial headquarters raid  in which insurgents managed to infiltrate an American base  kill five U S  soldiers  wound three  and destroy three humvees before fleeing  was supported by Iranians  In a speech on 31 January 2007  Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki stated that Iran was supporting attacks against Coalition forces in Iraq 382  and some Iraqis suspect that the raid may have been perpetrated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps s Qods Force in retaliation for the detention of five Iranian officials by U S  forces in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil on 11 January  383  384  Popular culture This section requires expansion  The Iraq War is referred to in the Dropkick Murphys song  Last Letter Home   which references a series of letters written by Marine Sergeant Andrew K  Farrar Jr  who died in Iraq on 28 January 2005  385  Part of the movie The Men Who Stare at Goats is set in Iraq  and includes a true incident when two rival groups of American contractors engage in a gunfight against each other in Ramadi  386  The movie Battle for Haditha is set in Haditha and tries to see the Iraq War through the viewpoint of US Marines  Iraqi insurgents  and Iraqi civilians  while exploring the Haditha killings  387  In 2008  a Marine near Haditha was filmed throwing a puppy off a cliff in a viral video that was circulated around YouTube and the Internet  and resulted in the Marine being dishonorably discharged from the military  388  In 2009 Konami announced plans to release a tactical shooter computer game titled Six Days in Fallujah  based on the Second Battle of Fallujah and played from the perspective of a squad from 3rd Battalion 1st Marines  389  See also Iraq portal Military of the
