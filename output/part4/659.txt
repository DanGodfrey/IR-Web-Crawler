 parts of this kingdom persisted until the 18th century  while others were part of the Portuguese Empire  Portuguese Guinea was known also  from its main economic activity  as the Slave Coast  Early reports of Europeans reaching this area include those of the Venetian Alvise Cadamosto s voyage of 1455  the 1479 1480 voyage by Flemish French trader Eustache de la Fosse  and Diogo C o who in the 1480s reached the Congo River and the lands of Bakongo  setting up thus the foundations of modern Angola  some 1200 km down the African coast from Guinea Bissau  Although the rivers and coast of this area were among the first places colonized by the Portuguese  since the 16th century  the interior was not explored until the 19th century  The local African rulers in Guinea  some of whom prospered greatly from the slave trade  had no interest in allowing the Europeans any further inland than the fortified coastal settlements where the trading took place  African communities that fought back against slave traders had even greater incentives to distrust European adventurers and would be settlers  The Portuguese presence in Guinea was therefore largely limited to the port of Bissau and Cacheu  although isolated European farmer settlers established farms along Bissau s inland rivers  Portuguese held  green   disputed  yellow  and rebel held areas  red  in Portuguese Guinea and other colonies 1970 For a brief period in the 1790s  the British attempted to establish a rival foothold on an offshore island  at Bolama  But by the 19th century the Portuguese were sufficiently secure in Bissau to regard the neighbouring coastline as their own special territory  also up north in part of present South Senegal  An armed rebellion beginning in 1956 by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde  PAIGC  under the leadership of Am lcar Cabral gradually consolidated its hold on then Portuguese Guinea  Unlike guerrilla movements in other Portuguese colonies  the PAIGC rapidly extended its military control over large portions of the territory  aided by the jungle like terrain  its easily reached borderlines with neighbouring allies and large quantities of arms from Cuba  China  the Soviet Union  and left leaning African countries  Cuba also agreed to supply artillery experts  doctors and technicians  4  The PAIGC even managed to acquire a significant anti aircraft capability in order to defend itself against aerial attack  By 1973  the PAIGC was in control of many parts of Guinea  although the movement suffered a setback in January 1973 when Cabral was assassinated  5   edit  Independence Independence was unilaterally declared on 24 September 1973  Recognition became universal following the 25 April 1974 socialist inspired military coup in Portugal which overthrew Lisbon s Estado Novo regime  Lu s Cabral  brother of Am lcar and co founder of PAIGC  was appointed the first President of Guinea Bissau  Following independence local black soldiers that fought along with the Portuguese Army against the PAIGC guerrillas were slaughtered by the thousands  Some managed to escape and settled in Portugal or other African nations  One of the massacres occurred in the town of Bissor   In 1980 the PAIGC admitted in its newspaper  N  Pintcha   dated 29 November 1980  that many were executed and buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of Cumer   Portogole and Mansab   The country was controlled by a revolutionary council until 1984  The first multi party elections were held in 1994  but an army uprising in 1998 led to the president s ousting and the Guinea Bissau Civil War  Elections were held again in 2000 and Kumba Ial  was elected president  In September 2003  a coup took place in which the military arrested Ial  on the charge of being  unable to solve the problems   After being delayed several times  legislative elections were held in March 2004  A mutiny of military factions in October 2004 resulted in the death of the head of the armed forces  and caused widespread unrest   edit  The Vieira years Map of Guinea Bissau In June 2005  presidential elections were held for the first time since the coup that deposed Ial   Ial  returned as the candidate for the PRS  claiming to be the legitimate president of the country  but the election was won by former president Jo o Bernardo Vieira  deposed in the 1999 coup  Vieira beat Malam Bacai Sanh  in a runoff election  but Sanh  initially refused to concede  claiming that tampering occurred in two constituencies including the capital  Bissau  Despite reports that there had been an influx of arms in the weeks leading up to the election and reports of some  disturbances during campaigning  including attacks on government offices by unidentified gunmen foreign election monitors labelled the election as  calm and organized   6  PAIGC won a strong parliamentary majority  with 67 of 100 seats  in the parliamentary election held in November 2008  In November 2008  President Vieira s official residence was attacked by members of the armed forces  killing a guard but leaving the president unharmed  7  On 2 March 2009  however  Vieira was assassinated by what preliminary reports indicated to be a group of soldiers avenging the death of the head of joint chiefs of staff  General Batista Tagme Na Wai  Tagme died in an explosion on Sunday  1 March 2009 in an assassination  Military leaders in the country have pledged to respect the constitutional order of succession  National Assembly Speaker Raimundo Pereira was appointed as an interim president until a nationwide election on 28 June 2009  8  which was won by Malam Bacai Sanh    edit  2010 Guinea Bissau military unrest Main article  2010 Guinea Bissau military unrest Military unrest occurred in Guinea Bissau on 1 April 2010  Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Junior was placed under house arrest by soldiers  who also detained Army Chief of Staff Zamora Induta  Supporters of Gomes and his party  PAIGC  reacted to the move by demonstrating in the capital  Bissau  Antonio Indjai  the Deputy Chief of Staff  then warned that he would have Gomes killed if the protests continued  9  The EU ended its mission to reform the country s security forces 4 August 2010  a risk that may further embolden powerful generals and drug traffickers in the army and elsewhere  The EU mission s spokesman in Guinea Bissau  Miguel Souza  said the EU had to suspend its programme when the mastermind of the mutiny  Gen Antonio Indjai  became army chief of staff   The EU mission thinks this is a breach in the constitutional order  We can t work with him   10   edit  Angolan Military Mission in Guinea Bissau  MISSANG  On 10 September 2010  Angola and Guinea Bissau signed a protocol in which Angola will assist the Guinean Armed and Police Forces during two years  Approximately 200 Angolan Armed Forces personnel will support the Angolan Military Mission in Guinea Bissau  MISSANG  which was formally launched on 21 March 2011  11  Officials in Angola said the goal was to help Guinea Bissau end the military coups and drug trafficking that have plagued the tiny west African state for decades  12   edit  Drug trade The multitude of small offshore islands and a military able to sidestep government with impunity has made Guinea Bissau a favourite trans shipment point for drugs to Europe  Plane drops are made on or near the islands  and speedboats pick up bales to go direct to Europe or onshore  13  UN chief Ban Ki moon has called for sanctions against those involved in Guinea Bissau s drugs trade  14  Air force head Ibraima Papa Camara and former navy chief Jose Americo Bubo Na Tchuto have been named  drug kingpins   15  On 24 September 2011  Guinea Bissau s Prime Minister took to the podium at the General Assembly to ask the United States and the members of the European Union to help the impoverished West African country control its maritime borders against drug traffickers  16   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Guinea Bissau Ministry of Justice  Bissau Guinea Bissau is a republic  In the past  the government had been highly centralized  and multiparty governance has been in effect since mid 1991  The president is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government  At the legislative level  there is a unicameral  Assembleia Nacional Popular   National People s Assembly  made up of 100 members  They are popularly elected from multi member constituencies to serve a four year term  At the judicial level  there is

was President of Guinea Bissau  Elected in 2005 as an independent candidate  being declared winner of the second round by the CNE  Comit  Nacional de Elei  es   Vieira returned to power in 2005 after winning the presidential election only six years after being ousted from office during a civil war  Previously  he held power for 19 years after taking power in 1980 in a bloodless coup  In that action  he toppled the government of Lu s Cabral  He was killed on 2 March 2009  possibly by soldiers in retaliation for the killing of the head of the joint chiefs of staff  General Batista Tagme Na Waie  17  This did not trigger additional violence  but there were signs of turmoil in the country  according to the advocacy group swisspeace  18  In 2012  President Rachide Sambu balde Malam Bacai Sanh  died  He belonged to PAIGC  Partido Africano para a Independ ncia da Guin  e Cabo Verde    one of two major political parties in Guinea Bissau along with the PRS  Partido Renova  o Social  and

on earth  More than two thirds of the population lives below the poverty line  The economy depends mainly on agriculture  fish  cashew nuts and ground nuts are its major exports  A long period of political instability has resulted in depressed economic activity  deteriorating social conditions  and increased macroeconomic imbalances  Guinea Bissau has started to show some economic advances after a pact of stability was signed by the main political parties of the country  leading to an IMF backed structural reform program  The key challenges for the country in the period ahead would be to achieve fiscal discipline  rebuild public administration  improve the economic climate for private investment  and promote economic diversification  After becoming independent from Portugal in 1974 due to the Portuguese Colonial War and the Carnation Revolution  the exodus of the Portuguese civilian  military and political authorities brought tremendous damage to the country s economic infrastructure  social order and standard of living  After several years of economic downturn and political instability  in 1997  Guinea Bissau entered the CFA franc monetary system  bringing about some internal monetary stability  The civil war that took place in 1998 and 1999 and a military coup in September 2003 again disrupted economic activity  leaving a substantial part of the economic and social infrastructure in ruins and intensifying the already widespread poverty  Following the parliamentary elections in March 2004 and presidential elections in July 2005  the country is trying to recover from the long period of instability despite a still fragile political situation  Bula  Guinea Bissau Beginning around 2005  drug traffickers based in Latin America began to use Guinea Bissau  along with several neighboring West African nations  as a transshipment point to Europe for cocaine  The nation was described by a United Nations official as being at risk for becoming a  narco state  The government and the military did almost nothing to stop this business  In 2009 nearly all transports via Guinea Bissau have been stopped and translocated to Mali  19  20  Guinea Bissau is a member

languages  customs  and social structures  Guinea Bissauans can be divided into the following ethnic groups  Fula and the Mandinka speaking people  who comprise the largest portion of the population and are concentrated in the north and northeast  the Balanta and Papel people  who live in the southern coastal regions  and the Manjaco and Mancanha  who occupy the central and northern coastal areas  Most of the remainder are mesti os of mixed Portuguese and African descent  including a Cape Verdean minority  Portuguese natives comprise a very small percentage of Guinea Bissauans  This deficit was directly caused by the exodus of Portuguese settlers that took place after Guinea Bissau gained independence  The country has also a tiny Chinese population  including those of mixed Portuguese and Chinese ancestry from Macau  a former Asian Portuguese colony   edit  Language Main article  Languages of Guinea Bissau Only 14  of the population speaks the official language  Portuguese  44

Throughout the 20th century  most Bissau Guineans practiced some form of Animism  Recently  many have adopted Islam  which is currently practiced by 35 percent of the country s population  most of Guinea Bissau s Muslims practice Sunni Islam  Approximately 10 percent of the country s population belong to the Christian community  and 55 percent continue to hold Indigenous beliefs  These statistics can be misleading  however  as both Islamic and Christian practices may be largely influenced and enriched by syncretism with traditional African beliefs  22  23   edit  Health The WHO estimates that there are fewer than 5 physicians per 100 000 persons in the country  24  down from 12 per 100 000 in 2007  25  The prevalence of HIV infection among the adult population is 1 8   26

universities  to which an institutionally autonomous Faculty of Law as well as a Faculty of Medicine 34  have to be added  Life expectancy at birth has climbed since 1990  but remains short  the WHO s estimate of life expectancy for a child born in 2008 was 49 years  and only 47 years for a boy   35   edit  Culture See also  List of African writers  by country  Guinea Bissau  edit  Music Main article  Music of Guinea Bissau The music of Guinea Bissau is usually associated with the polyrhythmic gumbe genre  the country s primary musical export  However  civil unrest and other factors have combined over the years to keep gumbe  and other genres  out of mainstream audiences  even in generally syncretist African countries  The calabash is the primary musical instrument of Guinea Bissau  and is used in extremely swift and rhythmically complex dance music  Lyrics are almost always in Guinea Bissau Creole  a Portuguese based creole language  and are often humorous and topical  revolving around current events and controversies  especially AIDS  The word gumbe is sometimes used generically  to refer to any music of the country  although it most specifically refers to a unique style that fuses about ten of the country s folk music traditions  Tina and tinga are other popular genres  while extent folk traditions include ceremonial music used in funerals  initiations and other rituals  as well as Balanta brosca and kussund   Mandinga djambadon  and the kundere sound of the Bissagos Islands   edit  Film Flora Gomes is an internationally renowned film director  his most
