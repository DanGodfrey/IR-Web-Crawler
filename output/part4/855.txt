formally known as the Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council and the Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of Saint Stephen  was a constitutional monarchic union between the crowns of the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary in Central Europe  The union was a result of the Austro Hungarian Compromise of 1867  under which the House of Habsburg agreed to share power with the separate Hungarian government  dividing the territory of the former Austrian Empire between them  The Austrian and the Hungarian lands became independent entities enjoying equal status  4  Austria Hungary was a multinational realm and one of the world s great powers at the time  The dual monarchy existed for 51 years until it dissolved on 31 October 1918 before a military defeat on the Italian

Austro Hungarian Compromise of 1867  which inaugurated the empire s dual structure in place of the former unitary Austrian Empire  1804 67   originated at a time when Austria had declined in strength and in power both in the Italian Peninsula  as a result of the Second Italian War of Independence of 1859  and among the states of the German Confederation  where it had been replaced by Prussia as the dominant German power following the Austro Prussian War  also named the German War  of 1866   Other factors in the constitutional changes were continued Hungarian dissatisfaction with rule from Vienna and increasing national consciousness on the part of other nationalities of the Austrian Empire  Hungarian dissatisfaction arose partly from Austria s suppression  with Russian support  of the Hungarian liberal revolution of 1848 1849  However  dissatisfaction with Austrian rule had grown for many years within Hungary  and had many other causes  By the late 1850s  however  a large number of Hungarians who had supported the 1848 49 revolution were willing to accept the Habsburg monarchy  They argued that while Hungary had the right to full internal independence  under the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 foreign affairs and defense were  common  to both Austria and Hungary  After the Austrian defeat at K niggr tz  reconciliation with Hungary was needed to regain status of a great power  and the new foreign minister Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust wanted to conclude the stalemated negotiations with the Hungarians  To shore up support for the monarchy  Emperor Franz Joseph began negotiations for a compromise with the Hungarian nobility to ensure their support  In particular  Hungarian leaders demanded and received the Emperor s coronation as King of Hungary  and the re establishment of a separate parliament at Budapest with powers to enact laws for the lands of the Hungarian crown  From 1867 onwards  the abbreviations heading the names of official institutions in Austria Hungary reflected their responsibility  K  u  k    kaiserlich und k niglich  or Imperial and Royal  was the label for institutions common to both parts of the Monarchy  e g  the k u k  Kriegsmarine  War Fleet  and  during the war  the k u k  Armee  Army   There were only three k u k  ministries   The Imperial and Royal Ministry of the Exterior and the Imperial House The Imperial and Royal War Ministry The Imperial and Royal Ministry of Finance The last of these was responsible only for financing the Imperial and Royal household  the diplomatic service  the common army and the common war fleet  All other state functions were to be handled separately by each of the two states  From 1867 onwards  common expenditure was allocated 70  to Austria and 30  to Hungary  This split had to be negotiated every 10 years  and  by 1907  the Hungarian share had risen to 36 4   13  The negotiations in 1917 ended with the dissolution of the Dual Monarchy  The common army changed its label from k k  to k u k  only in 1889  at the request of the Hungarian government  K  k   kaiserlich k niglich  or Imperial Royal was the label for institutions of Cisleithania  Austria    royal  in this label referred to the crown of Bohemia  K  u   k niglich ungarisch  or M  k   Magyar kir lyi    Hungarian Royal   referred to Transleithania  the lands of the Hungarian crown  Politics and government Government See also  Imperial Council  Austria  and Diet of Hungary Three distinct elements ruled the Austro Hungarian Empire  common foreign  military and joint financial policy under the monarch the  Austrian  or Cisleithanian government the Hungarian government Hungary and Austria maintained separate parliaments  each with its own prime minister  Linking co ordinating the two fell to a government under a monarch  wielding power absolute in theory but limited in practice  The monarch s common government had responsibility for the army  for the navy  for foreign policy  and for the customs union  A common Ministerial Council ruled the common government  it comprised the three ministers for the joint responsibilities  joint finance  military  and foreign policy   the two prime ministers  some Archdukes and the monarch  Two delegations of representatives  60 60 members   one each from the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments  met separately and voted on the expenditures of the Common Ministerial Council  giving the two governments influence in the common administration  However  the ministers ultimately answered only to the monarch  and he had the final decision on matters of foreign and military policy  Overlapping responsibilities between the joint ministries and the ministries of the two halves caused friction and inefficiencies  The armed forces suffered particularly from overlap  Although the unified government determined overall military direction  the Austrian and Hungarian governments each remained in charge of  the quota of recruits  legislation concerning compulsory military service  transfer and provision of the armed forces  and regulation of the civic  non military affairs of members of the armed forces   Each government could have a strong influence over common governmental responsibilities  Each half of the Dual Monarchy proved quite prepared to disrupt common operations to advance its own interests  Relations over the half century after 1867 between the two parts of the Empire featured repeated disputes over shared external tariff arrangements and over the financial contribution of each government to the common treasury  Under the terms of the  Austro Hungarian Compromise of 1867   an agreement  renegotiated every ten years  determined these matters  There was political turmoil during the build up to each renewal of the agreement  The disputes between the two parts of the Empire culminated in the mid 1900s in a prolonged constitutional crisis triggered by disagreement over the language of command in Hungarian army units  and deepened by the advent to power in Budapest  April 1906  of a Hungarian nationalist coalition  Provisional renewals of the common arrangements occurred in October 1907 and in November 1917 on the basis of the status quo  Politics See also  Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen Legally  besides the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 there were no common laws in Austria Hungary  All laws  even the ones with identical content like the compromise of 1867  had to pass the parliaments both in Vienna and Budapest and were published in the respective official medium  in the Austrian half it was called Reichsgesetzblatt and was issued in eight languages   To conclude on identical texts  the two parliaments elected delegations of 60 of their members each  which discussed motions of the Imperial  amp  Royal ministries separately and tried to find a compromise  The first prime minister of Hungary after the Compromise was Count Gyula Andr ssy  The old Hungarian Constitution was restored  and Franz Joseph was crowned as King of Hungary  During this time Austria Hungary was geographically the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire  621 537 km2  239 977 sq mi    and the third most populous  after Russia and the German Empire   The Empire relied increasingly on a cosmopolitan bureaucracy   in which Czechs played an important role   backed by loyal elements  including a large part of the German  Hungarian  Polish and Croat aristocracy  14  Political struggles in the Empire The political opponents of the  conservative liberal  aristocracy and gentry class

Austria and Hungary  and proclamation of the republics in Vienna and Budapest citation needed   Like the German Empire  the Austro Hungarian Empire frequently employed liberal economic policies and practices  From the 1860s liberal businessmen succeeded in industrializing parts of the Empire  and prosperous members of the bourgeoisie erected conspicuously large homes  giving themselves a prominence in urban life that rivaled the aristocracy s  They persuaded the government to search out foreign investment to build up infrastructure such as railroads in the early period of the Empire  The influence of liberals in Austria  most of them ethnic Germans  weakened under the leadership of Count Edouard von Taaffe  Austrian prime minister from 1879 1893  Taaffe used a coalition of clergy  conservatives and Slavic parties to weaken the liberals  In Bohemia for example  he designated Czech as an official language of the bureaucracy and school system  thus breaking the German speakers  monopoly on holding office  Reforms motivated other ethnic groups to push for even greater autonomy  By playing nationalities off one another  the government ensured the monarchy s central role in holding together competing interest groups in an era of rapid change  Elections v t e Elections in Austria Hungary Cisleithania 1848 1861 1867 1870 1871 1873 1879 1885 1891 1897 1900 01 1907 1911

rise of new national powers  With the decline and failed reforms of the Ottoman Empire  Slavic opposition in the occupied Balkans grew  and Russia and Austria Hungary saw an opportunity to expand in this region  In 1876  Russia offered to partition the Balkans  but Andr ssy declined for Austria Hungary was already a  saturated  state and it could not cope with additional territories  15  The whole monarchy was thus drawn into a new style of diplomatic brinkmanship  first conceived of by Andr ssy  centering on the province of Bosnia and Herzegovina  a predominantly Slavic area of the Ottoman Empire  which was transferred to Austro Hungarian control in 1878  by the Congress of Berlin  This brinkmanship led to war following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria at Sarajevo in 1914  Economy Main article  Economy of Austria Hungary A 20 crown banknote of the Dual Monarchy Andr ssy Avenue  Budapest  1875  The Austro Hungarian economy changed dramatically during the Dual Monarchy  The capitalist way of production spread throughout the Empire during its 50 year existence replacing medieval institutions  Technological change accelerated industrialization and urbanization  The gross national product per capita grew roughly 1 76  per year from 1870 1913  That level of growth compared very favorably to that of other European nations such as Britain  1    France  1 06    and Germany  1 51    16  However  in a comparison with Germany and Britain  the Austro Hungarian economy as a whole still lagged considerably  as sustained modernization had begun much later  In 1873  the old Hungarian capital Buda and  buda  Ancient Buda  were officially merged with the third city  Pest  thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest  The dynamic Pest grew into Hungary s administrative  political  economic  trade and cultural hub  Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period  Economic growth centered on Vienna and Budapest  the Austrian lands  areas of modern Austria   the Alpine region and the Bohemian lands  In the later years of the 19th century  rapid economic growth spread to the central Hungarian plain and to the Carpathian lands  As a result  wide disparities of development existed within the empire  In general  the western areas became more developed than the eastern  However  by the end of the 19th century  economic differences gradually began to even out as economic growth in the eastern parts of the Empire consistently surpassed that in the western  The strong agriculture and food industry of the Kingdom of Hungary with the center of Budapest became predominant within the empire and made up a large proportion of the export to the rest of Europe  Meanwhile  western areas  concentrated mainly around Prague and Vienna  excelled in various manufacturing industries  This division of labour between the east and west  besides the existing economic and monetary union  led to an even more rapid economic growth throughout Austria Hungary by the early 20th century  The most important trading partner was Germany  1910  48  of all exports  39  of all imports   followed by Great Britain  1910  almost 10  of all exports  8  of all imports   Trade with the geographically neighboring Russia  however  had a relatively low weight  1910  3  of all exports  mainly machinery for Russia  7  of all imports  mainly raw materials from Russia   Transport Railways Main article  Imperial Austrian State Railways Main article  Hungarian State Railways Rail transport expanded rapidly in the Austro Hungarian Empire  Its predecessor state  the Habsburg Empire  had built a substantial core of railways in the west  originating from Vienna  by 1841  At that point  the government realized the military possibilities of rail and began to invest heavily in construction  Pozsony  Bratislava   Budapest  Prague  Krak w  Graz  Laibach  Ljubljana  and Venedig  Venice  became linked to the main network  By 1854  the empire had almost 2 000 km  1 200 mi  of track  about 60 70  of it in state hands  The government then began to sell off large portions of track to private investors to recoup some of its investments and because of the financial strains of the 1848 Revolution and of the Crimean War  From 1854 1879  private interests conducted almost all rail construction  What would become Cisleithania gained 7 952 km  4 941 mi  of track  and Hungary built 5 839 km  3 628 mi  of track  During this time  many new areas joined the railway system and the existing rail networks gained connections and interconnections  This period marked the beginning of widespread rail transportation in Austria Hungary  and also the integration of transportation systems in the area  Railways allowed the empire to integrate its economy far more than previously possible  when transportation depended on rivers  After 1879  the Austrian and the Hungarian governments slowly began to renationalize their rail networks  largely because of the sluggish pace of development during the worldwide depression of the 1870s  Between 1879 1900  more than 25 000 km  16 000 mi  of railways were built in Cisleithania and Hungary  Most of this constituted  filling in  of the existing network  although some areas  primarily in the far east  gained rail connections for the first time  The railway reduced transportation costs throughout the empire  opening new markets for products from other lands of the Dual Monarchy  In 1914  of a total of 22 981 km  14 279 73 mi  of railway tracks on Austrian part of the Empire  18 859  82   were state owned  By 1910  the total length of the rail networks of Hungarian Kingdom reached 22 000 km  13 670 mi   the Hungarian network contained more than 1 490 railway stations  See also  Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways and Hungarian State Railways Navigation The SS Wien  Vienna   7 367 t  was one of the largest passenger ships of the Austrian Lloyd and was used for trips to the Orient  The SS Kaiser Franz Joseph I  12 567 t  of the Austro Americana was the largest passenger ship ever built in Austria  Because of the Austrian possessions at the Littorals in many European countries and huge parts of the Balkan  Austria had several seaports  The most significant seaport was Trieste  today part of Italy   where the Austrian merchant navy with their two most important navigation companies  Austrian Lloyd and Austro Americana  and with several shipyards was settled  The k u k  navy used the port also for constructing new naval ships  The upturn started with the decline of Venice  which additionally could not be a rivalry for the Austrians from 1815 until 1866  because it was part of the monarchy  The merchant navy could not reach significance by the time Venice had been such a strong competitor  Also the navy became very significant during the time of the k u k  monarchy  For long time a navy was not established because the Habsburg family lacked the funds to do so  The most important seaport for the Hungarian part of the k u k  was Fiume  where the Hungarian navigation companies like the famous Adria were operating from  The largest Hungarian shipbuilding company was the Ganz Danubius  Another significant seaport was Pola   especially for the navy  In 1889 the Austrian merchant navy counted 10 022 ships  with 7 992 fishing vessels  Both 1 859 sailboats with crews of 6 489 men and a load capacity of 140 838 tons were used for the coast and sea trade and 171 steamers with a load capacity of 96 323 tons and a crew of 3 199 men  The first Danubian steamer company  Donau Dampfschifffahrt Gesellschaft  DDSG  was the largest inland shipping company in the world until the collapse of the k u k  The Austrian Lloyd was one of the biggest ocean shipping companies of those time with voyages to the Orient and since the construction of the Suez Canal also to Asia  Until the beginning of the World War I the company owned 65 middle sized and big steamers  The Austro Americana owned one third of them and the biggest Austrian passenger ship  the SS Kaiser Franz Joseph I  In comparison to the Austrian Lloyd the Austro American concentrated on destinations in North and South America  17  18  19  20  21  22  Ethnic relations See also  United States of

rights in the world   The next such laws were in Switzerland   But these were overturned after the Russian and Austrian armies crushed the Hungarian Revolution  When Hungary made a compromise with the dynasty in 1867 one of the first acts of the restored Parliament was to pass a Law on Nationalities  Act Number XLIV of 1868   It was a liberal piece of legislation  and offered rather extensive language and cultural rights  but refused to recognize the non Hungarians as state forming elements with territorial autonomy  23  The  Austro Hungarian Compromise of 1867  created semi independent states of Hungary and Austria linked by personal union  and entailed the rise of an assertive Magyar identity within the Kingdom of Hungary  Nationalism prevalent in the Empire of Austria also created tension between ethnic Germans and ethnic Czechs  In addition  the emergence of national identity in newly independent Romania and Serbia also contributed to ethnic issues in the empire  Article 19 of the 1867  Basic State Act   Staatsgrundgesetz   valid only for the Cisleithanian  Austrian  part of Austria Hungary  24  said  All races of the empire have equal rights  and every race has an inviolable right to the preservation and use of its own nationality and language  The equality of all customary languages   landes bliche Sprache   in school  office and public life  is recognized by the state  In those territories in which several races dwell  the public and educational institutions are to be so arranged that  without applying compulsion to learn a second country language   Landessprache    each of the races receives the necessary means of education in its own language  The implementation of this principle led to several disputes  as it was not clear which languages could be regarded as  customary   The Germans  the traditional bureaucratic  capitalist and cultural elite  demanded the recognition of their language as a customary language in every part of the empire  Italian was regarded as an old  culture language   Kultursprache  by German intellectuals and had always been granted equal rights as an official language of the Empire  but the Germans had difficulty in accepting the Slavic languages as equal to German  On one occasion Count A  Auersperg  Anastasius Gr n  entered the diet of Carniola carrying what he claimed to be the whole corpus of Slovene literature under his arm to provide evidence that the Slovene language could in his view not be substituted for German as a medium of higher education  Nevertheless the following years saw an emancipation of several languages  at least in Cisleithania  From 1867  laws awarded Croatian equal status with Italian in Dalmatia  From 1882  there was a Slovene majority in the diet of Carniola and in the capital Laibach  Ljubljana   which replaced German as the dominant official language  Polish was introduced instead of German in 1869 in Galicia as the normal language of government  The Poles themselves systematically disregarded the large Ukrainian minority in the country  and Ukrainian was not granted the status of an official language  The language disputes were most fiercely fought in Bohemia where the Czech speakers formed a majority and sought equal status for their language  German speakers lost their majority in the Bohemian diet in 1880 and their dominating position in the cities of Prague and Pilsen  while retaining a slight numerical majority in the city of Brno  Br nn   and found themselves in an unfamiliar minority position  The old Charles University in Prague  hitherto dominated by the German speakers  was divided into German and Czech parts in 1882  At the same time  Hungarian dominance faced challenges from the local majorities of Romanians in Transylvania and in the eastern Banat  of Slovaks in today s Slovakia  of Croats and Serbs in the crown lands of Croatia and of Dalmatia  today s Croatia   in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the provinces known as the Vojvodina  today s northern Serbia   The Romanians and the Serbs also looked to union with their fellow nationalists in the newly founded states of Romania  1859 78  and Serbia  Hungary s leaders were generally less willing than their Austrian counterparts to share power with their subject minorities  but they granted a large measure of autonomy to the Croatia in 1868  paralleling to some extent their own accommodation within the Empire the previous year  The Croatian government  in spite of nominal autonomy  was in fact an economic and administrative arm of Hungary  which the Croatians resented  Language was one of the most contentious issues in Austro Hungarian politics  All governments faced difficult and divisive hurdles in deciding on the languages of government and of instruction  The minorities sought the widest opportunities for education in their own language  as well as in the  dominant  languages Hungarian and German  On one notable occasion  the  Ordinance of 5 April 1897   the Austrian Prime Minister Count Kasimir Felix Badeni gave Czech equal standing with German in the internal government of Bohemia  leading to a crisis because of nationalist German agitation throughout the empire  Badeni was dismissed  The Hungarian Minority Act of 1868 gave the minorities  Slovaks  Romanians  Serbs  et al   individual  but not also communal  rights to use their language in offices  schools  although in practice often only in those founded by them and not by the state   courts and municipalities  if 20  of the deputies demanded it   From June 1907  all public and private schools in Hungary were obliged to ensure that after the fourth grade the pupils could express themselves fluently in Hungarian  which led to the closing of several minority schools  mostly Slovak and Rusyn  It was not rare for the two kingdoms to divide spheres of influence  According to Misha Glenny  The Balkans  1804 1999   the Austrians responded to Hungarian persecution of Czechs by supporting the Croatian national movement in Zagreb  Emperor Franz Joseph realised that he reigned in a multiethnic country  and spoke German  Hungarian and Czech fluently  and Polish and Italian to some degree  The situation of Jews  who numbered about two million in 1914  was ambiguous  Antisemitic parties and movements existed  but Vienna and Budapest did not initiate pogroms or implement official antisemitic policies   mainly for fear that such ethnic violence could ignite other ethnic minorities and result in violence that could spin out of control  The antisemitic parties remained on the periphery of political sphere due to their low popularity among voters in the parliamentary elections  The majority of Jews lived in small towns in Galicia and rural areas in Hungary and Bohemia  although there were large communities in Vienna  Budapest  Prague and other large cities  Of the pre World War military forces of the major European powers  the Austro Hungarian army was almost alone in its regular promotion of Jews to positions of command  25  While the Jewish population of the lands of the Dual Monarchy was about five percent  Jews made up nearly eighteen percent of the reserve officer corps  26  Linguistic distribution In the Austrian Empire 36 8  of the total population spoke German as a mother tongue and more than 71  of the inhabitants spoke some German  In the Kingdom of Hungary 54 4  of the total population spoke Hungarian as a mother tongue  Not counting autonomous Croatia  more than 64  of the inhabitants of the

needed  and so pressured the tsar s government that Russia declared war on Turkey in 1877 in the name of protecting Orthodox Christians  Unable to mediate between Turkey and Russia over the control of Serbia  Austria Hungary declared neutrality when the conflict between the two powers escalated into a war  15  With help from Romania and Greece  Russia defeated the Ottomans and by the Treaty of San Stefano created a large pro Russian citation needed  Bulgaria  This treaty sparked an international uproar that almost resulted in a general European war  Austria Hungary and Britain feared that an enlarged Bulgaria would become a Russian satellite that would enable the tsar to dominate the Balkans  British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli moved warships into position against Russia in order to halt the advance of Russian influence in the eastern Mediterranean so close to Britain s route through the Suez Canal  Local market in Bosnia  c  1906 The Congress of Berlin rolled back the Russian victory  by partitioning the large Bulgarian state that Russia had carved out of Ottoman territory  and denying any part of Bulgaria full independence from the Ottomans  Austria occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina as a way of gaining clout in the Balkans  Serbia and Montenegro became fully independent  Nonetheless the Balkans remained a site of political unrest  teeming ambition for independence and great power rivalries  At the Congress of Berlin in 1878  Gyula Andr ssy  Minister of Foreign Affairs  managed to force Russia to retreat from further demands in the Balkans  As a result  Great Bulgaria was broken up and Serbian independence was guaranteed  15  In that year  with Britain s support  Austria Hungary stationed troops in Bosnia  to prevent the Russians from expanding into nearby Serbia  In another measure to keep the Russians out of the Balkans  Austria Hungary formed an alliance  the Mediterranean Entente  with Britain and Italy in 1887 and concluded mutual defence pacts  with Germany in 1879 and with Romania in 1883  against possible Russian attack  30  Following the Congress of Berlin the European powers attempted to guarantee stability through a complex series of alliances and treaties  Anxious about Balkan instability and Russian aggression  and to counter French interests in Europe  Austria Hungary forged a defensive alliance with Germany in October 1879 and in May 1882  In October 1882  Italy joined this partnership in the Triple Alliance largely because of Italy s imperial rivalries with France  Tensions between Russia and Austria Hungary remained high  so Bismarck replaced the League of the Three Emperors with the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia to keep the Habsburgs from recklessly starting a war over Pan Slavism citation needed   On the heels of the Great Balkan Crisis  Austro Hungarian forces occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in August 1878 and the monarchy eventually annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1908 as a common holding of Cis  and Transleithania under the control of the Imperial  amp  Royal finance ministry  rather than attaching it to either territorial government  This occupation was a response to Russia s advances into Bessarabia  The annexation in 1908 led some in Vienna to contemplate combining Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croatia to form a third  Slavic component of the Empire  The deaths of Franz Joseph s brother  Maximilian  1867   and only son  Rudolf  made the Emperor s nephew  Franz Ferdinand  heir to the throne  The Archduke was rumoured to have been an advocate for this trialism  as a means to limit the power of the Magyar aristocracy  Decision for war On 28 June 1914  Franz Ferdinand visited the Bosnian capital  Sarajevo  where Bosnian Serb militants of the nationalist group Mlada Bosna  supplied by the Serbian militant group Black Hand  ambushed his convoy and assassinated him  There were several members of the Black Hand in Sarajevo that day  Before Franz was shot  somebody had already tried to kill him and his wife  A member of the Black Hand threw a grenade at the car  but missed  It injured some people nearby and Franz Ferdinand made sure they were given medical attention before the convoy could carry on  The convoy took a wrong turn into a street where Gavrilo Princip was  Princip took a pistol from his pocket and shot and killed Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie  The reaction among the Austrian common people was mild  almost indifferent  As historian Z A B  Zeman later wrote   the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever  On Sunday and Monday  June 28 and 29   the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine  as if nothing had happened   31  The empire s military spending had not even doubled since the 1878 Congress of Berlin  while German spending had risen fivefold  and British  Russian  and French threefold  The empire had lost ethnic Italian areas to Piedmont because of nationalist movements sweeping through Italy  and many Austro Hungarians perceived as imminent the threat of losing to Serbia the southern territories inhabited by Slavs  Serbia had recently gained considerable territory in the Second Balkan War of 1913  causing much distress in government circles in Vienna and Budapest  Some members of the government  such as Count Franz Conrad von H tzendorf  had wanted to confront the resurgent Serbian nation for some years in a preventive war  but the Emperor  84 years old and enemy of all adventures  disapproved  But now the leaders of Austria Hungary  especially General Count Leopold von Berchtold  backed by its ally Germany  decided to confront Serbia militarily before it could incite a revolt  using the assassination as an excuse  they presented a list of ten demands called the July Ultimatum  32  expecting Serbia would never accept  When Serbia accepted nine of the ten demands but only partially accepted the remaining one  Austria Hungary declared war  Franz Joseph I finally followed the urgent counsel of his top advisors  Over the course of July and August 1914  these events caused the start of World War I  as Russia mobilized in support of Serbia  setting off a series of countermobilizations  Italy initially remained neutral  although it had an alliance with Austria Hungary  In 1915  it switched to the side of the Entente powers  hoping to gain territory from its former ally  Main events General von H tzendorf was the Chief of the Austro Hungarian General Staff  Franz Joseph I  who was much too old to command the army  appointed Archduke Friedrich von  sterreich Teschen as Supreme Army Commander  Armeeoberkommandant   but asked him to give Von H tzendorf freedom to take any decisions  The latter remained in effective command of the military forces until Emperor Karl I took the supreme command himself in late 1916 and dismissed Conrad von H tzendorf in 1917  Serbian front At the start of the war  the army was divided in two  the smaller part attacked Serbia while the larger part fought against the formidable Russian army  The invasion of Serbia in 1914 was a disaster  by the end of the year  the Austro Hungarian Army had taken no territory but had lost 227 000 out of a total force of 450 000 men  see Serbian Campaign  World War I    However in autumn 1915  the Serbian Army was defeated by the Central Powers  which led to the occupation of Serbia  Near the end of 1915  in a massive rescue operation involving more than 1 000 trips made by Italian  French and British steamers  260 000 Serb soldiers were transported to Corfu  where they waited for the chance of the victory of Allied Powers to reclaim their country  Corfu hosted the Serbian government in exile after the collapse of Serbia  and served as a supply base to the Greek front  In April 1916 a large number of Serbian troops were transported in British and French naval vessels from Corfu to mainland Greece  The contingent numbering over 120 000 relieved a much smaller army at the Thessaloniki front and fought alongside British and French troops  33  Russian front On the Eastern front  things started out equally poorly  The Austro Hungarian Army was defeated at the Battle of Lemberg and the great fortress city of Przemy l was besieged and fell in March 1915  The Gorlice Tarn w Offensive started as a minor German offensive to relieve the pressure of the Russian numerical superiority on the Austro Hungarians  but the cooperation of the Central Powers resulted in huge Russian losses and the total collapse of the Russian lines  and their 100 km long retreat into Russia  The Russian Third Army perished  In summer 1915  the Austro Hungarian Army  under a unified command with the Germans  participated in the successful Gorlice Tarn w Offensive  From June 1916  the Russians focused their attacks on the Austro Hungarian army in the Brusilov Offensive  recognizing the numerical inferiority of the Austro Hungarian army  By the end of September 1916  Austria Hungary could mobilise and concentrate new divisions  and the successful Russian advance was halted and slowly repelled  but the Austrian armies took heavy losses  about 1 million men  and never recovered  However the huge losses in men and material inflicted on the Russians during the offensive contributed greatly to their two revolutions of 1917  and it caused an economic crash in the Russian Empire  Italian Front A memorial to soldiers killed in World War I  In May 1915  Italy joined the Triple Entente and attacked Austria Hungary  Italy was the only military opponent of the Empire which had similar degree of industrialization and economic level  The bloody but indecisive fighting on the Italian Front would last for the next three and a half years  It was only on this front that the Austrians proved effective in war  managing to hold back the numerically superior Italian armies in the Alps and at the Isonzo river  through alternating phases  until the last month of war  In 1917  the Battle of Caporetto was a decisive victory of the Central Powers  the Austro Hungarian and German forces advanced more than 100 km  62 14 mi  in the direction of Venice  but could not cross the Piave River  The military and economic crisis of Italy was resolved by also with the supports from the Allied powers  by 1918  amounts of war materials and American  British  and French divisions arrived in the Italian battle zone to aid the Italian army to stop the advance of the empire  Romanian front On 27 August 1916  Romania proclaimed war against Austria Hungary  The Romanian army crossed the borders of Eastern Hungary  Transylvania   By November 1916  the Central Powers had defeated the Romanian army and occupied the southern and eastern parts of Romania  On 6 December the Central Powers captured Bucharest  the Romanian capital city  The Austro Hungarian war effort became more and more subordinated to the direction of German planners  The Austrians viewed the German army favorably  but by 1916 the general belief in Germany was that it was  shackled to a corpse   The operational capability of the Austro Hungarian army was seriously affected by supply shortages  low morale and a high casualty rate  and by the army s composition of multiple ethnicities with different languages and customs  The last two successes for the Austrians  the Romanian Offensive and the Caporetto Offensive  were German assisted operations  As the Dual Monarchy became more politically unstable  it became more and more dependent on German assistance  The majority of its people  other than Hungarians and German Austrians  became increasingly restless  Role of Hungary War memorial in Cs kp lfalva  today P uleni Ciuc  Romania  Austria Hungary held on for years  as the Hungarian half provided sufficient supplies for the military to continue to wage war  15  This was shown in a transition of power after which the Hungarian prime minister  Count Istv n Tisza  and foreign minister  Count Istv n Buri n  had decisive influence over the internal and external affairs of the monarchy  15  By late 1916  food supply from Hungary became intermittent and the government sought an armistice with the Entente powers  However  this failed as Britain and France no longer had any regard for the integrity of the empire because of Austro Hungarian support for Germany  15  Analysis of defeat The setbacks that the Austrian army suffered in 1914 and 1915 can be attributed to a large extent to Austria Hungary becoming a military satellite of Imperial Germany from the first day of the war  They were made worse by the incompetence of the Austrian high command  15  After attacking Serbia  its forces soon had to be withdrawn to protect its eastern frontier against Russia s invasion  while German units were engaged in fighting on the Western Front  This resulted in a greater than expected loss of men in the invasion of Serbia  15  Furthermore it became evident that the Austrian high command had had no plans for a possible continental war and that the army and navy were also ill equipped to handle such a conflict  15  Former ambassador and foreign minister Count Alois Aehrenthal had assumed that any future war would be in the Balkan region  In 1917  the Eastern front of the Allied  Entente  Powers completely collapsed  The Austro Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries  Despite great eastern successes  Germany suffered complete defeat in the more decisive western front  By 1918  the economic situation had deteriorated  Leftist and pacifist political movements organized strikes in factories  and uprisings in the army had become commonplace  During the Italian battles  the Czechoslovaks and Southern Slavs declared their independence  On 31 October Hungary ended the personal union officially dissolving the Austro Hungarian state  At the last Italian offensive Austro Hungarian Army took to the field without any food and munition supply  and fought without any political supports for a de facto non existent empire  On the end of the decisive joint Italian  British and French offensive at Vittorio Veneto  the disintegrated Austria Hungary signed a general armistice in Padua on 3 November 1918  Dissolution The Communists ruled multiethnic Budapest from 21 March 1919 to 1 August 1919  The statues of the Heroes Square of Budapest are covered with Communist symbols for May Day  At the basement of the original obelisk a new statue was erected  Marx with a worker and a peasant  The statues of historic heroes were toppled  Hungarian national symbols were banned in the name of internationalism  In the autumn of 1918  the Austro Hungarian Monarchy collapsed  In the capital cities of Vienna and Budapest the leftist and liberal movements and politicians  the opposition parties  strengthened and supported the separatism of ethnic minorities  These leftist or left liberal pro Entente maverick parties opposed the monarchy as a form of government and considered themselves internationalist rather than patriotic  Eventually  the German defeat and the minor revolutions in Vienna and Budapest gave political power to the left liberal political parties  As it became apparent that the Allied powers of the British Empire  France  Italy and the United States would win World War I  nationalist movements which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for various areas started pressing for full independence  As one of his Fourteen Points  U S  president Woodrow Wilson demanded that the nationalities of the empire have the  freest opportunity to autonomous development   In response  Karl I agreed to reconvene the imperial parliament in 1917 and allow the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self governance  However the leaders of these national groups no longer trusted Vienna and were now determined to get independence  On 14 October 1918 Foreign Minister Baron Istv n Buri n von Rajecz 34  asked for an armistice based on the Fourteen Points  In an apparent attempt to demonstrate good faith  Karl I issued a proclamation   Imperial Manifesto of 16 October 1918   two days later which would have significantly altered the structure of the Austrian half of the monarchy  The Polish majority regions of Galicia and Lodomeria were granted independence  and it was understood that they would join their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in forming a Polish state  The rest of Cisleithania was transformed into a federal union composed of four parts German  Czech  South Slav and Ukrainian  Each of these was to be governed by a national council that would negotiate the future of the empire with Vienna  and Trieste was to receive a special status  No such proclamation could be issued in Hungary  where Magyar aristocrats still believed they could subdue other nationalities and maintain the  Holy Kingdom of St  Stephen   It was all in vain  four days later  on 18 October United States Secretary of State Robert Lansing replied that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs  Slovaks and South Slavs  Therefore  Lansing said  autonomy for the nationalities   the tenth of the Fourteen Points   was no longer enough and Washington could not deal on the basis of the Fourteen Points any more  In fact  a Czechoslovak provisional government had joined the Allies on 14 October  The leaders of the South Slavs had already declared in favor of uniting with Serbia in a large South Slav state by way of the 1917 Corfu Declaration signed by members of the Yugoslav Committee  The Lansing note was  in effect  the death certificate of Austria Hungary  The national councils had already begun acting more or less as provisional governments of independent countries  With defeat in the war imminent after the Italian offensive in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto on 24 October Czech politicians peacefully took over command in Prague on 28 October  later declared the birthday of Czechoslovakia  and followed up in other major cities in the next few days  On 30 October  the Slovaks followed in Martin  On 29 October  the Slovenes declared their independence from Austria and joined the State of Slovenes  Croats and Serbs as had the Croatians  who had been ignoring orders from Budapest since the beginning of October  The Hungarian government terminated the personal union with Austria by 31 October  officially dissolving the Austro Hungarian state  There was now nothing left of the Habsburg realm except its majority German Alpine and Danubian provinces  Consequences The last Habsburg Emperor King  Charles  Karl I in Austria and K roly IV in Hungary   was persuaded by his Austrian prime minister  Heinrich Lammasch  that he was in an impossible situation  By this time  the German Austrian state council was challenging his authority in the German speaking areas of his realm  On 11 November  he issued a proclamation which recognized Austria s right to determine the form of the state and renounced the right to participate in Austrian affairs of state  He also released the officials in the Austrian half of the empire from their oath of loyalty to him  Two days later  he issued a similar proclamation for Hungary  However  he did not abdicate  remaining available in the event the people of either state should recall him  In Austria and Hungary  republics were declared at the end of the war in November  The Treaty of Saint Germain en Laye  between the victors of World War I and Austria  and the Treaty of Trianon  between the victors and Hungary  regulated the new borders of Austria and Hungary  The Allies assumed without question that the minority nationalities wanted to leave Austria and Hungary  and also allowed them to annex significant blocks of German  and Hungarian speaking territory  As a result  the Republic of German Austria lost roughly 60  of the old Austrian Empire s territory  It also had to drop its plans for union with Germany  as it was not allowed to unite with Germany without League approval  The Hungarian Democratic Republic lost roughly 72  of the pre war territory of the Kingdom of Hungary  The decisions of the nations of the former Austria Hungary and of the victors of the Great War  contained in the heavily one sided treaties  had devastating political and economic effects  The previously rapid economic growth of the Dual Monarchy ground to a halt because the new borders became major economic barriers  All the formerly well established industries were designed to satisfy the needs of an extensive realm  As a result  the emerging countries were forced to make considerable sacrifices to transform their economies  The treaties created major political unease  As a result of these economic difficulties  extremist movements gained strength  and there was no regional superpower in central Europe  The new Austrian state was  at least on paper  on shakier ground than Hungary  While what was left of Austria had been a single unit for over 700 years  it was united only by loyalty to the Habsburgs  By comparison  Hungary had been a nation and a state for over 900 years  However  after a brief period of upheaval and the Allies  foreclosure of union with Germany  Austria established itself as a federal republic  Despite the temporary Anschluss with Nazi Germany  it still survives today  Hungary  however  was severely disrupted by the loss of 72  of its territory  64  of its population and most of its natural resources  The Hungarian Democratic Republic was short lived and was temporarily replaced by the communist Hungarian Soviet Republic  Romanian troops ousted B la Kun and his communist government during the Hungarian Romanian War of 1919  In March 1920  a monarchist revival resulted in the restoration of the Kingdom of Hungary  Royal powers were entrusted to a regent  Mikl s Horthy  who had been the last commanding admiral of the Austro Hungarian Navy and had helped organize the counter revolutionary forces  In March and again in October 1921  ill prepared attempts by K roly IV  Karl I in Austria  to regain the throne in Budapest collapsed  The initially wavering Horthy  after receiving threats of intervention from the Allied Powers and neighboring countries  refused his cooperation  Subsequently  the British took custody of Karl and removed him and his family to the Portuguese island of Madeira  where he died the following year  Successor states Main articles  Treaty of Trianon and Treaty of Saint Germain The following successor states were formed  entirely or in part  on the territory of the former Austria Hungary  German Austria and First Austrian Republic Hungarian Democratic Republic  Hungarian Soviet Republic  and Kingdom of Hungary Czecho Slovakia   Czechoslovakia  from 1920 to 1938  State of Slovenes  Croats and Serbs and Kingdom of Serbia  joined on 1 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs  Croats and Slovenes  later Kingdom of Yugoslavia  Second Polish Republic  West Ukrainian People s Republic Austro Hungarian lands were also ceded to the Kingdom of Romania and the Kingdom of Italy  The Principality of Liechtenstein  which had formerly looked to Vienna for protection  formed a customs and defense union with Switzerland  and adopted the Swiss currency instead of the Austrian  In April 1919  Vorarlberg   the westernmost province of Austria   voted by a large majority to join Switzerland  however  both the Swiss and the Allies disregarded this result  New hand

1878 while formally part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912  Possessionss of the Austro Hungarian Monarchy The empire was unable to gain and maintain large colonies owing to its geographical position  Its only pssession outside of Europe was its concession in Tianjin  China  which it was granted in return for supporting the Eight Nation Alliance in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion  However although the city was only an Austro Hungarian possession for 16 years  the Austro Hungarians left their mark on that area of the city  in the form of architecture that still stands in the city  35  Other parts of Europe had been part of the Habsburg monarchy once but had left it before its dissolution in 1918  Prominent examples are the regions of Lombardy and Veneto in Italy  Silesia in Poland  most of Belgium and Serbia  and parts of northern Switzerland and southwestern Germany  Like the German Empire  that of Austria Hungary frequently employed liberal economic policies and practices  From the 1860s liberal businessmen succeeded in industrializing parts of the empire and the prosperous middle classes erected conspicuously large homes  thus gaining a prominence in urban life that rivalled that of the aristocracy  They persuaded the government to search out foreign investment to build up infrastructure such as railroads  Despite these measures  Austria Hungary remained resolutely monarchist and authoritarian  Liberals in Austria  most of them ethnic Germans  saw their influence weaken under the leadership of Count Edouard von Taaffe  Austrian prime minister from 1879 1893  Building a coalition of clergy  conservatives and Slavic parties  Taaffe used its power to weaken the liberals  In Bohemia  for example  he designated Czech as an official language of the bureaucracy and school system  thus breaking the German speakers  monopoly on office holding  These reforms outraged the ethnic groups that lost out  while those who won concessions  such as Czechs  clamored for even greater autonomy  By playing nationalities off one against another  the government preserved the monarchy s central role in holding together competing interest groups in an era of rapid change  Russian Pan Slavic organizations sent aid to the Balkan rebels and so pressured the tsar s government that Russia declared war on Turkey in 1877 in the name of protecting Orthodox Christians  With help from Romania and Greece  Russia defeated the Ottomans and by the Treaty of San Stefano created a large pro Russian Bulgaria  This treaty sparked an international uproar that almost resulted in a general European war  Austria Hungary and Britain feared that an enlarged Bulgaria would become a Russian satellite that would enable the tsar to dominate the Balkans  Austrian officials worried about an uprising of their own restless Slavs  British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli moved warships into position against Russia in order to halt the advance of Russian influence in the eastern Mediterranean  so close to Britain s route through the Suez Canal  The public was drawn into foreign policy  the music halls and newspapers of England echoed a new jingoism or political sloganeering that throbbed with sentiments of war   We don t want to fight but by Jingo if we do   We ve got the ships  we ve got the men  We ve got the money too   The other great powers  however  did not want a Europe wide war and in 1878 they attempted to revive the concert of Europe by meeting at Berlin under the auspices of Bismarck  who was a calming presence on the diplomatic scene  Military Main
