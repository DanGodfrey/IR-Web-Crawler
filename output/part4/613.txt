historical role of religion  see History of religion in the United States  Part of a series on the Culture of the United States History People Languages Traditions Mythology and Folklore Cuisine

States is characterized by both a wide diversity in religious beliefs and practices  and by a high adherence level  According to recent surveys  83 percent of Americans identify with a religious denomination  40 percent state that they attend services nearly every week or more  and 58 percent say that they pray at least weekly  1  A majority of Americans report that religion plays a  very important  role in their lives  a proportion unique among developed nations  2  Many faiths have flourished in the United States  including both later imports spanning the country s multicultural immigrant heritage  as well as those founded within the country  these have led the United States to become one of the most religiously diverse countries in the world  3  The majority of Americans  60  to 76   identify themselves as Christians  mostly within Protestant and Catholic denominations  accounting for 51  and 25  of the population respectively  4  Non Christian religions  including Judaism  Islam  Buddhism  Hinduism etc    collectively make up about 3 9  to 5 5  of the adult population  4  5  6  Another 15  of the adult population identifies as having no religious belief or no religious affiliation  4  When asked  about 5 2  said they did not know  or refused to reply  4  According to the American Religious Identification Survey  religious belief varies considerably across the country  59  of Americans living in Western states  the  Unchurched Belt   report a belief in God  yet in the South  the  Bible Belt   the figure is as high as 86   4  7  However  despite this seemingly high level of religiosity  only 9  of Americans in a 2008 poll said religion was the most important thing in their life  compared with 45  who said family was paramount in their life and 17  who said money and their career was paramount  8  Also  Americans have significantly less confidence in their religious leaders than they did a generation ago and more than two thirds would prefer they not dabble in politics  according to Mark Chaves  a Duke University professor of sociology  religion and divinity  The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington  D C   is the largest Catholic church in the United States  Text of the First Amendment to the country s Constitution   Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof  or abridging the freedom of speech  or of the press  or the right of the people peaceably to assemble  and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances   It guarantees the free exercise of religion  The Supreme Court has interpreted this as preventing the government from having any authority in religion  From the early colonial days  when English and German settlers came in search of religious freedom  America has been profoundly influenced by religion  9  That influence continues in American culture  social life  and politics  10  Several of the original Thirteen Colonies were established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion within a community of like minded people  the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established by English Puritans  Congregationalists   Pennsylvania by British Quakers  Maryland by English Catholics  and Virginia by English Anglicans  Contents 1 Freedom of religion 2 Main religious preferences of

Although some New England states continued to use tax money to fund local Congregational churches into the 1830s  the United States was the first nation to have no official state endorsed religion  11  Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom  the framers of the Constitution rejected any religious test for office  and the First Amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise  thus protecting any religious organization  institution  or denomination from government interference  The decision was mainly influenced by European Rationalist and Protestant ideals  but was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them  12   edit  Main religious preferences of Americans The U S  Census does not ask about religion  Various groups have conducted surveys to determine approximate percentages of those affiliated with each religious group  Some surveys ask people to self identify  while others calculate church memberships  The first table below represents the ranges that have been found  Christianity   59 9  13  to 76 0  4   Unaffiliated  including atheist or agnostic

in 2008 4    From those queried  roughly 51 3  of Americans are Protestants  25  are Catholics  1 7  are Mormons  the name commonly used to refer to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints   and 1 7  of various other Christian denominations  16  Christianity was introduced during the period of European colonization  By the 2011 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches  from which members in the United States are combined with Canadian members  and of the National Council of Churches  the five largest denominations are  17  The Catholic Church  68 503 456 members The Southern Baptist Convention  16 160 088 members The United Methodist Church  7 774 931 members The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  6 058 907 members The Church of God in Christ  5 499 875 members Due to its large population and history  the United States has numerically more Christians  and more Protestants  than any other country in the world  Other countries  however  have higher percentages of Christians  and of Protestants  within their total populations  Northern European peoples introduced Protestantism  Among Protestants  Anglicans  Baptists  Puritans  Presbyterians  Lutherans  Quaker  and Moravians were the first to settle to the US  spreading their faith in the new country  The Spanish  French and English introduced Catholicism  Many Catholics came with the Hispanics Latinos  Irish  Highland Scots  Italians  Dutch  Flemish  Polish  French  Hungarians  German  and Lebanese immigrants  Greek  Ukrainian  Russian  Central and Eastern European  Middle Eastern  Ethiopian  and South Indian immigrants brought Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy to the United States  These branches of Christianity have since spread beyond the boundaries of ethnic immigrant communities and now include multi ethnic membership and parishes  Since then  American Christians developed in their own path  During the Great Awakenings interdenominational evangelicalism and Pentecostalism emerged  along with new Protestant denominations such as Adventism  and non Protestant movements such as the Restoration Movement  which over time separated into the Churches of Christ  the Christian churches and churches of Christ  and the Christian Church  Disciples of Christ    the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society  commonly referred to as Jehovah s Witnesses  and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  also commonly referred to as Mormonism  Today  with 16 6 million adherents  5 3  of the total population   the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest of more than 200 18  distinctly named Protestant denominations  19  Of the total population  Evangelicals comprise 26 3   and Mainline Protestants 16   20  The strength of various sects varies greatly in different regions of the country  with rural parts of the South  except Louisiana and the Gulf Coast  and the Hispanic community  which both consist mainly of Catholics   having many evangelicals but very few Catholics  while urbanized areas of the north Atlantic states and Great Lakes  as well as many industrial and mining towns  are heavily Catholic  though still quite mixed  especially due to the heavily Protestant African American communities  As of 1990  nearly 72  of the population of Utah was Mormon  as well as 26  of neighboring Idaho  21  Lutheranism is most prominent in the Upper Midwest  with North Dakota having the highest percentage  35  according to a 2001 survey  22  Despite its status as the most widespread and influential religion in the US  Christianity has undergone a continuous relative decline in demographics  While the absolute number of Christians rose from 1990 to 2008 as the overall population increased  the actual percentage of Christians dropped from 86 2  to 76 0   4  A nationwide telephone interview of 1 002 adults conducted by The Barna Group found that 70  of American adults believe that God is  the all powerful  all knowing creator of the universe who still rules it today   and that 9  of all American adults and 0 5  young adults hold to what the survey defined as a  biblical worldview   23   edit  No religion   unaffiliated Main article  Irreligion in the United States A 2001 survey directed by Dr  Ariela Keysar for the City University of New York indicated that  amongst the more than 100 categories of response   no religious identification  had the greatest increase in population in both absolute and percentage terms  This category included atheists  agnostics  humanists  and others with no theistic religious beliefs or practices  Figures are up from 14 3 million in 1990 to 34 2 million in 2008  representing a proportionate increase from 8  of the total in 1990 to 15  in 2008  4  Another nation wide study puts the figure of unaffiliated persons at 16 1   24  In a 2006 nationwide poll  University of Minnesota researchers found that despite an increasing acceptance of religious diversity  atheists were generally distrusted by other Americans  who rated them below Muslims  recent immigrants and other minority groups in  sharing their vision of American society   They also associated atheists with undesirable attributes such as criminal behavior  rampant materialism  and cultural elitism  25  26  However  the same study also reported that  The researchers also found acceptance or rejection of atheists is related not only to personal religiosity  but also to one s exposure to diversity  education and political orientation  with more educated  East and West Coast Americans more accepting of atheists than their Midwestern counterparts   27   edit  Judaism Main article  American Jews Beth El Temple in Birmingham  Alabama After Christianity and no religion  Judaism is the third largest religious affiliation in the US  though this identification is not necessarily indicative of religious beliefs or practices  4  A significant number of people identify themselves as American Jews on ethnic and cultural grounds  rather than religious ones  For example  19  of self identified American Jews believe God does not exist  28  The 2001 ARIS study projected from its sample that there are about 5 3 million adults in the American Jewish population  2 83 million adults  1 4  of the U S  adult population  are estimated to be adherents of Judaism  1 08 million are estimated to be adherents of no religion  and 1 36 million are estimated to be adherents of a religion other than Judaism  29  30  ARIS 2008 estimated about 2 68 million people  1 2   in the country identify Judaism as their faith  4  Jews have been present in what is now the US since the 17th century  though large scale immigration did not take place until the 19th century  largely as a result of persecutions in parts of Eastern Europe  The CIA Fact Book estimates about 2  of Americans belong to this group  5  Approximately 25  of this population lives in New York City  31  A 2009 study estimated the Jewish population  including both those who define themselves as Jewish by religion and those who define themselves as Jewish in cultural or ethnic terms  to be between 6 0 and 6 4 million  32  According to a study done in 2000 there were an estimated 6 141 325 Jewish people in the country  about 2  of the population  13  According to the 2001 National Jewish Population Survey  33  4 3 million American Jewish adults have some sort of strong connection to the Jewish community  whether religious or cultural  Jewishness is generally considered an ethnic identity as well as a religious one  Among the 4 3 million American Jews described as  strongly connected  to Judaism  over 80  have some sort of active engagement with Judaism  ranging from attendance at daily prayer services on one end of the spectrum to attending Passover Seders or lighting Hanukkah candles on the other  The survey also discovered that Jews in the Northeast and Midwest are generally more observant than Jews in the South or West  Reflecting a trend also observed among other religious groups  Jews in the Northwestern United States are typically the least observant  In recent years  there has been a noticeable trend among previously secular American Jews  called baalei teshuva   returners   see also Repentance in Judaism   returning to a more religious  in most cases  Orthodox  style of observance  citation

from Central and Eastern Europe  and their US born descendants  There are  however  small numbers of older  and some recently arrived  communities of Sephardi Jews with roots tracing back to 15th century Iberia  Spain  Portugal  and North Africa   There are Mizrahi Jews  from the Middle East  Caucasia and Central Asia   as well as much smaller numbers of Ethiopian Jews  Indian Jews  Kaifeng

transported to the United States were Muslim  34  Most  however  became Christians  and significant Muslim numbers awaited the arrival of immigrant populations from Arabic and East Asian Muslim areas  35  Islam gained a higher profile through the Nation of Islam  a religious group that appealed to black Americans after the 1940s  its prominent converts included Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali  36  37  The first Muslim elected in Congress was Keith Ellison in 2006  38  followed by Andre Carson in 2008  39  The Islamic Center of America in Michigan is the largest mosque in the United States Research indicates that Muslims in the US are generally more assimilated and prosperous than Muslims in Europe  40  41  Surveys also suggest  however  that they are less assimilated than other American subcultural and religious communities  especially after the 9 11 terrorist attacks  42  Like other subcultural and religious communities  the Islamic community has generated its own political organizations and charity organizations   edit  Buddhism Main article  Buddhism in the United States Hsi Lai Temple  lit  Coming West Temple   a Buddhist monastery in Los Angeles  California Buddhism

the 19th century  The second half  by contrast  saw the emergence of new approaches  and the move of Buddhism into the mainstream making itself a mass and social religious phenomenon  Many foreign associations and teachers such as Soka Gakkai and Tenzin Gyatso the 14th Dalai Lama citation needed   for Tibetan Buddhism  started to organize missionary activities  while US converts established the

Protestants  56    Catholics  71    and the religiously unaffiliated  62   all agree that religion is losing influence on American life  53  of the total public says this is a bad thing while just 10  see it as a good thing  61  Politicians frequently discuss their religion when campaigning  and Fundamentalist and Black Protestants are highly politically active  However  to keep their status as tax exempt organizations they must not officially endorse a candidate  Historically Catholics were heavily Democrats before the 1970s  while mainline Protestants comprised the core of the Republican Party  Those patterns have faded away Catholics  for example  now split about 50 50  However  white evangelicals since 1980 have made up a solidly Republican group that favors conservative candidates  Secular voters are increasingly Democratic  62  Only three presidential candidates for major parties have been Catholics  all for the Democratic party  Alfred E  Smith in presidential election of 1928 was hammered with anti Catholic rhetoric  which seriously hurt him in the Baptist areas of the South and Lutheran areas of the Midwest  but he did well in the Catholic urban strongholds of the Northeast  John F  Kennedy secured the Democratic presidential nomination in 1960  In the 1960 election  Kennedy faced accusations that as a Roman Catholic President he would do as the Pope would tell him to do  a charge that Kennedy refuted in a famous address to Protestant ministers  John Kerry won the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004  In the 2004 election religion was hardly an issue  and most Catholics voted for his Protestant opponent  63  Joe Biden is the first Catholic vice president  64  The only Jewish major party candidate was Joe Lieberman in the Gore Lieberman campaign of 2000  although John Kerry and Barry Goldwater both had Jewish ancestry   In 2006 Keith Ellison of Minnesota became the first Muslim elected to Congress  when re enacting his swearing in for photos  he

February November 2008 and collected answers from 54 461 respondents who were questioned in English or Spanish  The American population self identifies as predominantly Christian but Americans are slowly becoming less Christian  86  of American adults identified as Christians in 1990 and 76  in 2008  The historic Mainline churches and denominations have experienced the steepest declines while the non denominational Christian identity has been trending upward particularly since 2001  The challenge to Christianity in the U S  does not come from other religions but rather from a rejection of all forms of organized religion  34  of American adults considered themselves  Born Again or Evangelical Christians  in 2008  The U  S  population continues to show signs of becoming less religious  with one out of every seven Americans failing to indicate a religious identity in 2008  The  Nones   no stated religious preference  atheist  or agnostic  continue to grow  though at a much slower pace than in the 1990s  from 8 2  in 1990  to 14 1  in 2001  to 15 0  in 2008  Asian Americans are substantially more likely to indicate no religious identity than other racial or ethnic groups  One sign of the lack of attachment of Americans to religion is that 27  do not expect a religious funeral at their death  Based on their stated beliefs rather than their religious identification in 2008  70  of Americans believe in a personal God  roughly 12  of Americans are atheist  no God  or agnostic  unknowable or unsure   and another 12  are deistic  a higher power but no personal God   America s religious geography has been transformed since 1990  Religious switching along with Hispanic immigration has significantly changed the religious profile of some states and regions  Between 1990 and 2008  the Catholic population proportion of the New England states fell from 50  to 36  and in New York it fell from 44  to 37   while it rose in California from 29  to 37  and in Texas from 23  to 32   Overall the 1990 2008 ARIS time series shows that changes in religious self identification in the first decade of the 21st century have been moderate in comparison to the 1990s  which was a period of significant shifts in the religious composition of the United States   edit  Ethnicity The table below shows the religious affiliations among the ethnicities in the United States  according to the Pew Forum 2007 survey  69  People of Black ethnicity were most likely to be part of a formal religion  with 85  percent being Christians  Protestant denominations make up the majority of the
