mutant  More so than most  Rogue considers her powers a curse  she involuntarily absorbs and sometimes also removes the memories  physical strength  and  in the case of superpowered persons  the

Marvel  25  1979   and artwork for the first half of the story was completed   citation needed  but the book s abrupt cancellation left her original introduction story unpublished for over a decade  before seeing print in Marvel Super Heroes  11 in 1992  Rogue s first published appearance was in Avengers Annual  10  1981   She made her first X Book appearance in Uncanny X Men  158  1982  and joined the X Men in Uncanny X Men  171  1983   Rogue has also had two miniseries and one ongoing title  Rogue s real name and early history were not revealed until more than twenty years after her introduction  Until the back story provided by Robert Rodi in the ongoing Rogue series  begun in September 2004  Rogue s background was only hinted at  This resulted in Rodi s version of Rogue s origins inadvertently conflicting with earlier information  In X Men Unlimited  4  Scott Lobdell indicates that Rogue ran away from her father after her mutant powers manifested  but in Uncanny X Men  182  Rogue reflects that she never knew her father because he d left before she was born  and several issues  including Uncanny X Men  178 and X Men  93  indicate that Rogue was taken in by Mystique and Destiny before her mutation became active   edit  Fictional character biography  edit  Early life Her parents  Owen and Priscilla  married early in their relationship and lived in a back to nature hippie commune in Caldecott County  Mississippi  8  Born as Anna Marie  she also enjoyed the attentions of her Aunt Carrie  on her mother s side  Anna Marie was raised speaking colloquial English and French  common to the Mississippi bayou area  9  The commune s failed attempt to use Native American mysticism to reach the  Far Banks  resulted in Priscilla s disappearance  Carrie took over Anna s care  and in her grief at the loss of her sister  was a strict and authoritarian guardian  Anna Marie was a rebellious child 8  and at some point  the exact event or reasons still unclear  she ran away from home as a young teenager  This also prompted the nickname  Rogue   Not long after  she was approached by Mystique  who sought her out on the advice of her precognitive partner Destiny  Mystique ultimately takes Rogue in as a daughter  volume  amp  issue needed  At some point  Rogue grew close to a boy named Cody Robbins  During their flirtation  she impulsively kissed Cody  at which point her latent mutant power to absorb the life energy and psyche of others with skin to skin contact emerged  Rogue was traumatized by the experience  and Cody was left in a permanent coma  Hence  Rogue wore body concealing clothing that eliminated the possibility of accidental skin contact  She wished she  did not have to cover up so much around folks   to protect them from her  She thought her power was a curse  volume  amp  issue needed  In time  however  Mystique turned Rogue s loneliness  envy  bitterness  and despair into anger  thus recruiting her into the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Brotherhood of Evil Mutants After Rogue s mutation emerged  Mystique began coaxing Rogue into taking part in her terrorist activities as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  Rogue was initially not interested  wanting only a normal life  but after an incident 10  in which she absorbed and knocked out the young boy named Cody when he dared her to kiss him  she seemed to give up on normality and began taking part in Mystique s plans  During this period  Rogue and Mystique associated briefly with a mutant named Blindspot  whose power to erase the memories of others by touch somehow counteracts Rogue s mutation enough to allow them to make physical contact safely  Blindspot and Rogue become good friends  but when Mystique decided to sever professional ties with Blindspot  Blindspot erased all memory of her from both Mystique and Rogue in order to protect herself  volume  amp  issue needed  When Mystique debuted her Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  Pyro  Blob  and Avalanche   Destiny advised her to keep Rogue out of the action  advice which proved important when several members of the new Brotherhood   including Destiny herself   were arrested and imprisoned  Rogue ultimately confronted Ms  Marvel on her front doorstep as she was returning home from grocery shopping and deliberately absorbed her powers  Something went wrong as Ms  Marvel fought too hard and too long  The transfer of psyche and all powers became permanent  The shock of absorbing such a formidable persona drove Rogue insane and she attempted to kill Ms  Marvel by throwing her off the Golden Gate Bridge  Unbeknownst to Rogue  Ms  Marvel was saved from the fall by the original Spider Woman  Jessica Drew  Ms  Marvel was comatose for a short period of time before her memories without the emotional attachments were restored by Professor Charles Xavier of the X Men  Rogue later felt tremendous guilt over the incident and it still haunts her to this day  However  she battled the Avengers as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil mutants using her newly acquired powers  11  Later  with Mystique and Destiny  Rogue attacked Angel and Dazzler  but Rogue was overpowered by Dazzler  Rogue developed a grudge against Dazzler for her controllable mutation and her relationship with Angel of the X Men  Mystique intended for Rogue to absorb Angel   the only X Man whose identity is publicly known at the time   in order to learn the team s whereabouts but Rogue balked  afraid of the effect of absorbing a physical mutation like Angel s wings  Rogue defeated Dazzler  but was herself defeated by Power Man and Iron Fist  before fleeing  Rogue was defeated by Dazzler a few times before Dazzler is publicly revealed to be a mutant and goes into hiding  12  She also battled the X Men at the Pentagon  13   edit  X Men The more Rogue used her mutant power  the more her mind became filled with fragmentary psychic echoes of the people she absorbed  Carol Danvers  psyche was nearly a completely distinct personality within her mind who would sometimes take over when Rogue s will was weak  It became harder and harder for Rogue to hold on to her own personality and she feared that her powers would drive her insane  unbeknownst to her or Mystique  the process was also helped along by Mastermind  who subtly exacerbated Rogue s already severe psychological distress as a means of revenge against Mystique volume  amp  issue needed    Desperate  Rogue turned to Professor Charles Xavier and the X Men and asked for admission to the X Men to learn how to control her powers  The Professor was unable to do a satisfactory psychic scan of her  due to the clashing human and Kree portions of her psyche  Still  Xavier s charity towards all mutants led him to welcome her into his home and the X Men  regardless of his team having previously fought Rogue and in spite of the X Men s own strong objections  The X Men even threatened to disband themselves and leave the school should Rogue be accepted  It was only Xavier s argument that all mutants deserve a chance for redemption that prevented the dissolution of the X Men  14  Immediately afterward  Rogue clashed with Carol Danvers  as Binary  who was unwilling to accept the idea of Rogue among her friends  Her initial months with the team were rough as she was seen as a latent threat  a Brotherhood mole within the X Men  When the team met up with Wolverine in Tokyo where he was preparing for his marriage to Mariko Yashida  15  he gave her a chilly reception Wolverine having been a good friend and professional partner to Carol Danvers  However  after the rest of the team accepted Rogue  Storm and Wolverine were incapacitated by poison  and Rogue was forced to work with Wolverine in order to find the culprit  The plot was traced back to the second Viper and her lover  the Silver Samurai  Rogue nearly died during the battle by taking a prolonged laser blast from the Viper to shield Mariko  who had shown her genuine trust and kindness  Wolverine  after the battle and over Rogue s own objections  kissed her to transfer his healing powers to her  She had gained his trust and respect for her efforts to protect his fianc e  Soon after  she gained the full trust of the rest of the team by again risking her life to save Colossus  who had been superheated by Pyro and then rapidly cooled  She absorbed Colossus  powers  leaving her in the same rigid  melted form as he was to allow the Morlock Healer to heal the damage done to Colossus  16  Rogue  under domination of Carol Danvers  persona  invaded the S H I E L D  Helicarrier to rescue Michael Rossi and was framed for the murder of a S H I E L D  agent  17  These charges were eventually dropped  Rogue vs  the Ms  Marvel persona on the cover of Uncanny X Men  269  Art by Jim Lee   edit  In the Outback During the Fall of the Mutants  the X Men battled a mystical entity known as the Adversary  who was bent on destroying and remaking the multiverse  In the final battle  the X Men s physical and spiritual essences were used as fuel for Forge s energy star  which closed the doorway to the Adversary s plane of existence and saved the multiverse  They  in effect  died  Roma  a prisoner of the Adversary and guardian of the multiverse  used her powers to recreate the fallen X Men from scratch  making her own minor alterations  Now invisible to cameras and all forms of detection equipment  the X Men resettled to Australia  defeating the Reavers and claiming their base in the Outback as a new base of operations  18  The X Men used their new status to attack anti mutant threats around the world  which also brought them in conflict with the island nation of Genosha  Their own super powered agents  the Press Gang  captured Rogue and Wolverine  and thanks to a special form of digitalized teleportation  both arrived naked in the prison of Genosha  Then  the unthinkable happened as Wipeout fully canceled their abilities  For the first time in years  Rogue was able to experience skin to skin contact without detriment  Although  it now happened against her will and with her powerless to stop it as the guards  took a few liberties  with  rude hands    ruder glances   and  promises of worse to come  when they put her into a cell  19  Immediately following this harrowing event  Rogue completely withdrew into her subconscious  In there  she found out that some psychic residue had remained of all people she had absorbed  and now  these phantoms tried to overwhelm her  As Rogue was fighting for sanity and control within her mind  unexpected help was provided by the permanently absorbed personality of Carol Danvers  She was stronger than psychic residue  and in fact  she was as solid and real as Rogue  Carol suggested that Rogue allow her to take over her body seeing as how with her spy training  she was more suited for escaping from the prison without any superpowers  Rogue agreed  and from then on  Carol and Rogue settled on a new  modus vivendi    the two personalities would actually share the body with each having their times of dominance  or acting as back up when one was rendered unconscious  It also seemed that Carol had no trouble to keep the absorption power under control  While she was using the body  she touched Psylocke s bare skin without any effect  Evidently  Rogue s lack of control was strictly psychological in nature  20  Among the X Men  Rogue s life improved  but she continued to struggle with Carol Danvers  residual personality  The Danvers personality eventually grew so strong that Carol had replaced Rogue s standard X Men costume with Ms  Marvel s former superhero uniform during battle as well a redecorating Rogue s room to her own tastes without her permission  which angered Rogue when she would finally regain control of her body again  21   edit  Return Eventually  Rogue was pulled through the mystical gateway known as the Siege Perilous  where she was judged by other dimensional forces with the promise of a  new life   22  Returned to Earth  Rogue was purged of the remaining portions of Carol s personality  truly becoming her own woman again but was also temporarily stripped of her powers for a time  However  after Rogue emerged from the Siege  she found herself back in the abandoned ghost town in Australia the X Men had taken up residence in after the Fall of the Mutants storyline  She was confronted by not only the Reavers  but by Carol Danvers herself  whose disembodied psyche had been reintegrated by passing through the Siege and being separated from Rogue  Rogue fled from Carol as she battled the Reavers and absorbed the powers of the mutant  Gateway  in order to teleport herself to safety  Carol arrived before she could escape and plunged through the portal Rogue had summoned and both of them disappeared  23  Rogue  as it turned out  ended up powerless in the Savage Land  but Carol had been teleported to Muir Island where she came into conflict with some of the X Men s allies who had fallen under the mental enslavement of the Shadow King  Carol fought him but his vast psionic powers overwhelmed and corrupted her  He then sent her to the Savage Land to find Rogue and the two battled fiercely  During the fight  there was not enough life force between the two to sustain both Rogue and Carol physically as a result of the separation  Just as Rogue was on the verge of being drained completely  Magneto suddenly intervened and destroyed the Ms  Marvel persona  saving Rogue s life  24  Rogue and Magneto then joined forces with Ka zar and Nick Fury to battle Zaladane who was trying to conquer the Savage Land  Rogue and Magneto had a brief moment of romantic tension during this war  25  When Zaladane was defeated and helpless  Magneto chose to kill her  against Rogue and Fury s protests  and in doing so  parted ways with the X Men s ideals and methods before flying away  26  Rogue then flew to Muir Island to rejoin the rest of the X Men with her powers fully returned  27  The X Men later divided into two teams to make better use of their large number of active members  Rogue was assigned to the Blue Team  under the leadership of Cyclops and alongside new X Man  and love interest  Gambit  Upon his arrival  Remy flirted with each of the female members of the team  however Rogue immediately caught his eye  and Remy made no secret of his romantic desire for her  28  Rogue and Gambit were immediately attracted to each other  but the development of their relationship was slow and rocky  partly as a result of her inability to control her powers and partly as a result of long term issues  including secrecy and dishonesty  with previous relationships on Gambit s part  Through their many break ups and make ups  Gambit and Rogue have one of the longest and most popular relationships in the X Men series  volume  amp  issue needed  As an act of penance  Rogue continued to visit Cody Robbins  hospital bed annually  a decade after she placed him in a coma  He was later killed by assassins sent by Gambit s ex lover  Bella Donna Boudreaux  as part of a revenge plot against Rogue  Through a spiritual leader  Rogue was able to make amends with Cody s spirit  Cody held no hard feelings against her  knowing what happened was an accident and urged her to move on before he departed for the afterlife  29  It was eventually revealed that Mystique had two sons  the now deceased anti mutant politician Graydon Creed and Rogue s long time teammate  Nightcrawler  30  Rogue and Nightcrawler consider themselves to be siblings  although the revelation has not particularly altered their friendship  volume  amp  issue needed  Following the supposed  death  of Cyclops  the X Men team underwent major changes  amongst them Rogue being made the team s new field commander  Her even temper and years of X Men service made her an ideal leader and she continued to lead the team until Storm returned  31  When the Galactic Council transformed Earth into a maximum security penal colony for hundreds of extraterrestrial criminals  Rogue absorbed the attributes of Z Cann   a mutant  telepathic Skrull who had joined Cadre K  Xavier s Skrull equivalent to the X Men  Z Cann purposely touched Rogue to activate the mutant s abilities as the two evaded bounty hunters  Z Cann used her telepathy to amplify Rogue s capacity to assimilate memories  causing her powers to mutate  32  Henceforth  Rogue was then able to  recall  previous powers absorbed imprinted that were supposedly lost after initial transfer  volume  amp  issue needed  but also found it increasingly difficult to control which powers manifested when  typically possessing Wolverine s healing factor and claws and Cyclops s optic blasts along with her usual strength   edit  X Treme X Men team Rogue was part of the X Treme X Men team led by Storm  The team s first mission was in search of Destiny s Diaries  which prophesied future events   During an invasion of Khan  an alien conqueror from another dimension  of an isle nation Madripoor  Rogue requested that Sage use her power jump starting abilities to evolve Rogue to a point where she could control all of the various powers that she has ever imprinted  Sage agreed  and Rogue became a one woman army  able to use the powers of anyone she had absorbed in the past all at once  33  During Khan s invasion  Rogue was also confronted by Vargas who was said to be  a new species altogether   Vargas foresaw himself being killed by Rogue in Destiny s diaries and  despite his belief in the prophecies  attempted to stop this eventuality from happening  Thus  in the midst of the invasion battle  Vargas ambushed Rogue as she was trying to rescue Gambit  see X Treme X Men   spearing both Rogue and Gambit with his blade before escaping  Rogue survived due to possessing both Wolverine s and Hulk s powers  Returning to the city shortly after the battle to recover his sword  Vargas was surprised in turn by Rogue dressed in Psylocke s costume  Vargas having killed Psylocke earlier for sport   After a lengthy battle  Rogue  fulfilled her destiny  by seemingly finishing Vargas off with his own weapon  Returning to Gambit  Rogue  with the help of Jean Grey  forced him from near death  34  Following the repulsion of the invasion  Rogue realized that Destiny s Prophecies were only possibilities and that trying to follow them was more dangerous than ignoring them  She also learned that she had inherited a mansion in New Orleans from Destiny  as well as a sizable fortune  and the X Treme X Men team retired there to recuperate  Rogue soon left the team with Gambit  since they both emerged powerless from their ordeals and wanted to explore their relationship further  35  After life on the road with Gambit  Rogue ended up living in a beach house in Valle Soleada  a town where mutants and humans coexisted peacefully  She subsequently received a visit from Bishop and Sage and  after a series of events involving an investigation into the murder of a human girl s family  Rogue and Gambit signed up with Bishop and Sage to help Storm s X Treme X Men stop Sage s enemy and former boss Elias Bogan  After the battle  Rogue asked Sage to restore Gambit s abilities  which she did  Gambit asked if the same could be done for Rogue s powers  but it was never revisited after Rogue quickly dismissed his comment  36   edit  Back to the X Men Rogue and Gambit returned to the X Men as part of Marvel s ReLoad  Over time  Rogue s own abilities returned  although exactly how and when was never revealed or discussed  However  she no longer possessed the abilities she had absorbed from Ms  Marvel  Rogue and Gambit were both put on Havok s team and participated in various missions  37  As described in her own miniseries  Rogue then traveled down south to save a young mutant girl from her powers  While there  she met Campbell St  Ange  a young man who was immune to Rogue s lethal touch  Also while there  Rogue forcibly absorbed knowledge from her Aunt Carrie that explained that Rogue s mother had traveled to the Far Banks  a dream realm  to stop her father from getting there himself  Rogue encountered the incorporeal spirit of her mother therein  and absorbed her memories  After the reunion  her mother s trapped spirit could finally move on  Rogue subsequently went back to her Aunt Carrie and made amends with her  38  Rogue then returned to the X Men and confronted the monstrous Golgotha   large space creatures with telepathic abilities that induce insanity in some by bringing out and  to some extent  amplifying people s emotions  During this ordeal  as the result of Golgotha influence  Rogue and Gambit got into a fight about the reality of their relationship with Rogue s uncontrollable powers and Gambit claimed they would ve parted long ago if they were always able to touch  that Rogue would ve been  just another one night stand   Gambit left  and Wolverine  his hidden emotions also coming out amplified under the influence of Golgotha  then revealed to Rogue he desired her in a romantic sexual way  and that he in fact always had  He and Rogue then started passionately kissing each other until her power began to affect him and Emma Frost telepathically interrupted  39  While on a trip to Japan to investigate an incriminating photo of her and Sunfire engaged in criminal activities  both Rogue and Sunfire learned that Rogue s former friend and teammate of the Brotherhood  Blindspot  has erased both their memories of the event  In this storyline  Rogue accidentally and permanently absorbed Sunfire s fire abilities  who has lost his legs to Lady Deathstrike and did not want to live   40  Back at the X Mansion  Emma Frost tried to help Rogue and Gambit by providing telepathic relationship counseling  but their relationship continued to be problematic  Rogue then discovered that Gambit was being seduced by the student called Foxx  It is later revealed  however  that Mystique  displeased with Rogue s choice of lovers  infiltrated the Xavier Institute by shapeshifting into Foxx and joined Gambit s squad in an attempt to ruin his relationship with Rogue  After Gambit resisted her charms  Mystique reverts to her true form and offered Gambit something more difficult to refuse  she transformed into Rogue and offered Gambit a Rogue with whom he could have a physical relationship  Whether or not they actually engaged in a sexual relationship is uncertain  although Gambit insists that nothing happened   Rogue eventually discovered her foster mother s presence in the school and her attempts to seduce Gambit  becoming furious with both parties  Because Gambit failed to tell Rogue of Mystique s presence in the Institute  their relationship developed the exact rift Mystique was hoping for and allowed her to set up her daughter with her accomplice  Pulse  After being discovered  Mystique asked the X Men for permission to stay at the Mansion  The X Men vote and Mystique was allowed to be a probationary member of the X Men  a decision neither Rogue nor Gambit were happy with  41   edit  Blood of Apocalypse In the events that followed M Day  the mutant Apocalypse was reawakened  Gambit  seeking redemption from Rogue and his fellow X Men  volunteered to be transformed into his horseman  Death  Gambit believed he could control whatever Apocalypse would do to him  in hopes of only gaining more power to protect Rogue and the X Men from the villain  42  However  having been brain washed  Gambit tried to kill Rogue  the only part of Gambit s past life that remains   After Apocalypse s defeat  Sunfire  who was granted new legs and transformed into the horseman Famine   and Gambit left the X Men  43   edit  Endangered Species  Rogue s X Men As Professor Xavier went into space with Havok and several other X Men to go after the villain Vulcan  Cyclops gave Rogue the authority to form her own team  complimenting her inspired improvisation in battle situations  She was hesitant at first  because of Gambit s recent disappearance with Sunfire  but accepted the position  saying that when he comes back  she d still be at the school  She chose Iceman  Cannonball  Cable  Sabretooth  Lady Mastermind  Karima Shapandar  Omega Sentinel   and Mystique  a line up Cyclops did not agree with  44  Mystique seemingly tried to repair her relationship with Rogue  but is rebuffed  Rogue s team defeated the group known as the Children of the Vault  Afterward  Rogue declared her team would leave the X Mansion  Rogue was hospitalized after a battle with Pandemic  Cable  desiring Rogue s help in defeating the Hecatomb  forced Rogue awake  Pandemic infected Rogue with a virus  Strain 88  altering her powers by amplifying them into an instantaneous death touch  In defeating Hecatomb  Rogue absorbed psyches of eight billion entities that had been stored inside it  45  The team moved to Rogue s hometown of Caldecott for Rogue to recover  As Cyclops and Emma Frost arrived to help Rogue cope with the immensity of the voices in her mind  Marauders arrived  seeking the Destiny diaries  As part of the attack  it was revealed that Mystique was working with the Marauders and for Mister Sinister  Mystique shot Rogue and took her back to Mr  Sinister s base  who only kept Rogue alive because she held all the information of Destiny s Diaries within her mind  46  Gambit  who had joined the Marauders and Mr  Sinister again  was protective of Rogue and accused Mystique of being too careless in how she captured her  Gambit was shown standing over Rogue trying to get her to wake up  after she had fallen into a trance overcome by the minds she absorbed   and expressed his apologies for what he had done before rejoining Sinister  Rogue had flashes of memories  both of she and Gambit during the time that they had known each other  and of the millions of minds she absorbed  while in her coma like state before she briefly woke up and recognized Gambit  She told him she had a nightmare  before spouting incoherent words and mysterious coordinates  47   edit  Messiah Complex Main article  X Men  Messiah Complex The X Men attacked the Marauders  Antarctic base in order to rescue Rogue and the mysterious mutant baby who was at the center of Messiah Complex  However the baby eventually took precedence and the X Men did not recover  or even see  Rogue  volume  amp  issue needed  Mister Sinister  now in possession of the mutant baby  relocated the Marauders to Muir Island  While standing by Rogue s bedside  Mystique was visited by Mister Sinister who told her that there will be no cure for Rogue and she will eventually die  Without warning  Mystique ambushed Sinister and shoved his face onto Rogue s  The instant contact seemingly killed Sinister  volume  amp  issue needed  Mystique  in keeping with the words of the Destiny Diaries  placed the baby s face in direct contact with Rogue s  with the understanding that Rogue would awaken from her comatose state  The baby was not affected by Rogue s power  and Rogue awakens shortly after  Realizing what Mystique had done at the risk of killing the baby  Rogue said she s tired of people s lives being destroyed by Mystique and grabbed Mystique s face barehanded  fully absorbing her powers and consciousness  Mystique was left on the floor incapacitated as Rogue told Gambit that when the baby touched her  it removed all the psyches of everybody she has ever touched and that only herself and Mystique are left in her mind  She said she needed to be alone and told Gambit not to follow her  48   edit  Being cured Rogue takes some time out from the X Men and travels around the Australian outback on a motorcycle  49  She returns to the X Men s former headquarters in Maynards Plains  Australia  Once there  she has a conversation with Mystique  a part of Rogue s psyche   telling her that no one else can help her with her powers and that it was down to her to figure out how to control them  One day  a woman appears in town claiming to be an anthropologist from Melbourne University  Rogue made it clear she could stay as long as she wants  but to keep out of her way  The anthropologist approached Rogue with questions about some of the remains she has found in the town  Rogue said she does not know anything about the remains and to leave her alone  The anthropologist follows Rogue and explains she actually has a different identity  The anthropologist was then targeted by a low flying Shi ar spaceship and revealed that she was actually Danger in disguise  She informs Rogue she planned to get revenge on Professor Xavier by using her as a conduit  50  Danger created an amalgamation of several past events in the X Men s history prominently involving Rogue in the town using her hard light capabilities  As Professor Xavier and Gambit searched for her  Rogue evaded old versions of the X Men and the Marauders that were part of Danger s creation  She was finally cornered by the Marauders  and refused to let Mystique s psyche take control of Rogue s body and save her as the fake Marauder Scalphunter shot at her  Mystique then took over Rogue s body to save her and fought off the Marauders  then returned control of Rogue s body to her  51  Rogue then wandered to the fake Tokyo Tower and tried to find the Institute  deducing that the projections around her were changing at ten minute intervals  altering the environment around her  However  Rogue did not get far as she ended up in Antarctica  witnessing the moment she abandoned Gambit after his trial  She regretted her decisions there  telling Mystique that she really had not moved on  It was at that point that Cody Robbins appeared before Rogue  repeating his greeting from the night her powers manifested  Rogue just stared at him in shock  52  Eventually the Professor  Gambit and a group of Shi ar pirates managed to shut down Danger  However  the Professor reactivated her and she defeated the pirates in turn  After this  it was revealed that Rogue s powers never truly developed past their initial  nascent  stage  which was the reason why her powers never functioned properly  The Professor  now aware of this fact  used his telepathy to tear down the mental walls that kept Rogue s powers from developing  the walls were created as a side effect every time she absorbed other people starting with Cody  and even more so with Ms  Marvel   and removed the mental echo of Mystique  Finally Rogue kissed Gambit  with no ill side effect  revealing that she was finally in control of her absorption power  53   edit  Utopia Rogue  Gambit  and Danger decide to go to San Francisco in order to regroup with the other X Men  On their way there they are intercepted by Pixie who teleports them into the city  which is in a state of chaos due to the anti mutant and pro mutant movements  Cyclops sends all three out in order to locate several missing students and bring them home  During their mission Rogue faces off against the new Ms  Marvel  finding that she cannot touch her opponent  Rogue resorts to a trick and flees the site  Later on she joins Gambit  who has been injured by Ares  along with Danger  Ares does not take her seriously and dismisses her both as an opponent and her attempts to calm things down  Rogue grabs Ares and absorbs his powers  Ares is dismissive of her attempt and claims that she cannot absorb him  a boast that proves wrong as she weakens him enough for Gambit to blast him bloody and stunned  Having for the moment absorbed some of Ares  power she easily dispatches a small group of H A M M E R  agents with superhuman strength and proceeds to steal their tank  along with Gambit and Danger  in order to find the rest of the students  54  Rogue finds Trance as her powers are flaring out of control creating powerful uncontrollable bio electric blasts  Rogue tries to help calm Trance and help her gain control when Ms  Marvel appears  After taking out Gambit and Danger  Rogue and Ms  Marvel fight  Rogue is losing until Trance regains control and jumps in to help Rogue  Trance learns that her astral form is able to punch Ms  Marvel when they are both intangible  After Gambit stuns Ms  Marvel  they teleport back to base where Trance receives medical attention  55   edit  Nation X As Utopia has become a safe haven for mutants  the entire population had to be on high alert following an attack on the X Men by Emplate  who feeds on mutant bone marrow for sustenance  The X Men instruct everyone to stay close to each other and report anything out of the ordinary  Bling goes to check out an old amphitheatre on her own when Emplate captures her to use as a food source  Unable to enter Emplate s cross dimensional base  Rogue absorbs Trance s astral projection ability to save Bling  As she investigates his home for clues to Bling s whereabouts  Rogue was attacked by psychoplasmic ghosts  After fighting them off  she rescues Bling from Emplate  56  Rogue also protects the students during an attack by a herd of Predator X s by absorbing the powers of multiple students  57   edit  Necrosha In an attempt to finally achieve godhood  Selene along with her servant Eli Bard  resurrected many of the X Men s greatest deceased allies and villains under her control  Among the resurrected is Rogue s foster mother  Destiny  who attempts to contact Rogue but instead contacts Blindfold  58  However  Proteus had possessed Destiny when she came back  When she makes contact  he leaves her to possess the body of Blindfold  so he can trick her into convincing a team of X Men to go to Muir Island  where he hopes to kill them  59  Eventually Rogue and a team of X Men manage to defeat Proteus and Rogue tearfully says goodbye to her foster mother as Destiny once more dies  60   edit  Post Siege Following the Siege of Asgard  Rogue was present at Sentry s memorial  where it was suggested he was immune to her power and that a time in the past when she knew no other physical contact  she had at least one encounter with him of some physically intimate nature  61  However  it was established in Sentry  4 that Sentry and Rogue never met  62   edit  Second Coming During the event in which Cable and Hope return to the present timeline Rogue is able to sense Hope s presence  like Destiny prophesied  although neither she nor Emma Frost can explain it  After a short confrontation with some of Bastion s men the X Men and Cable decide for a diversionary tactic  Cable along with some of the X Men stays behind  since it was him they were tracking  while Rogue  Nightcrawler  and Hope leave in order to protect the girl  To that end Rogue absorbs the power sets of Colossus  Wolverine  X 23  Archangel  and Psylocke  63  For a while their tactic works  leaving Cable along with some of the X Men to fend off Bastion s troops  In the mean time Kurt  along with Rogue and Hope  teleports across the United States towards Utopia  This however exerts him to such a degree that he has to rest for a moment  they are soon confronted by Bastion himself  Seeing no alternative Rogue attacks him hoping to buy enough time for Kurt and Hope to flee   but Bastion is able to hit Kurt with an energy blast that knocks him out  Channelling Colossus s strength  further enhancing it with Betsy s telekinesis and using the individual claw sets of Logan and X 23 along with their healing factors  Rogue is able to inflict massive damage to Bastion  However  Bastion is able to repair himself and overpower Rogue with an energy discharge which briefly incapacitates her  Unable to do anything she watches with horror as Bastion fatally impales Kurt with his arm  64  Rogue is appointed Hope s protector while on Utopia and allows her to participate in the final battle  where Hope eventually destroys Bastion  Her actions and choices put Hope in danger and ultimately results in Cyclops suspending Rogue from active duty  She will  however  remain as Hope s protector and accompanies her to Alaska in search of her real family  65   edit  Post  Age of X  After the events of Age of X  Rogue becomes torn between her feeling for Gambit and Magneto  Gambit states that she has to be ready for him for good before he could be with her again  and that he would be waiting for her when she is ready  After Rogue confronts Magneto about his past  she spends a night with him  promising nothing else  66  Afterwards  Rogue joins Professor X  Frenzy  Legion  Magneto and Gambit on a mission to capture several of Legion s personalities that escaped after Age of X  The final battle with Legion s personality Styx results in Rogue temporarily absorbing many of Legion s powers  which led her to finding the location of Havok  Polaris and Marvel Girl  the mutants that were left in space after the X Men s mission to stop Vulcan  67  After the events of  SCHISM   Rogue chooses to be on Wolverine s team  They return to Westchester  New York to start the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning  68   edit  Powers and abilities This section relies on references to primary sources or sources affiliated with the subject  rather than references from independent authors and third party publications  Please add citations from reliable sources   December 2010  This section describes a work or element of fiction in a primarily in universe style  Please help rewrite it to explain the fiction more clearly and provide non fictional perspective   December 2010  Due to the nature of her unique mutant powers  Rogue has had several different abilities over the years   edit  Mutant powers Rogue possesses the mutant ability to absorb the psyche and abilities of another human being  or members of some sentient alien races  through skin contact  Rogue can absorb the memories  knowledge  talents  personality  and physical abilities  whether superhuman or not  of the person she touches  as well as occasionally duplicating in herself physical characteristics of her victim  The victim s abilities and memories are absorbed for a one to 60 ratio of time of contact  The victim loses those abilities and memories for exactly the amount of time that Rogue possesses them  This absorption usually leaves the victim weakened  and sometimes renders them unconscious  Their powers may also be temporarily weakened or removed  Rogue s power is constantly active  rendering her incapable of touching others without the absorption process taking place  However  evidence suggests that Rogue s inability to control her powers is psychological in nature  During the times when the Ms  Marvel personality would overtake her psyche  she was able to touch people freely  69  This fact has since been corroborated by the discovery that Rogue s absorption power never developed beyond the stage of its original manifestation  53  Xavier later rectified this by telepathically removing the psychological barriers stunting it  53  The transfer of abilities is usually temporary  lasting for a period of time relative to how long contact is maintained  but if Rogue holds on to her victim for too long  the transfer may become permanent  leaving the victim nearly dead  as was the case with Ms  Marvel  However  it must also be noted that Ms  Marvel fought the transfer process  which Rogue attested to sometime after the incident occurred  Most often this process happens instantly when Rogue touches someone  but certain extraordinarily powerful beings have proven resistant to Rogue s power  and she may only share part of their memories and power  as was the case when Rogue once attempted to absorb power from the alien Magus  However  in the process of doing so she gained an immunity to the Technarch transmode virus  70  71  As Rogue is absorbing the total psyche of a person  there is a risk of a personality overwhelming her and taking control of her body  It has also been shown that even though the memories she has absorbed eventually fade when a psyche returns to its body  remnants  or  echoes   of the personalities of victims whose memories she has absorbed remain buried in her subconscious indefinitely  and while there is little to no risk of those personalities overwhelming her like the Ms  Marvel personality could  they can occasionally make their presences known   edit  Fully developed mutant powers Following the conclusion of Messiah Complex  Rogue s slate was wiped clean  The mutant baby s touch mysteriously erased all of the previous memories and abilities Rogue had absorbed  including those of the Hecatomb  It also cured her of the Strain 88 virus  Rogue s touch now simply steals the memories and abilities of individuals she comes in direct skin to skin contact with  The longer the contact  the longer Rogue retains the absorbed information  Although she can now control her powers at her will  she can still make her touch lethal if she activates it as her will to make it lethal on her enemies  and make her touch not lethal on her friends  volume  amp  issue needed  Following the events of X Men  Legacy  Rogue appears to be able to activate her powers at will  as opposed to them being constantly active  as demonstrated when she kisses Gambit without incident  Her inability to control her powers stemmed from mental blocks within her mind which formed each time she used her abilities  crippling the development of her powers from their nascent stage  When Professor Xavier removes the blocks  her powers are allowed to develop normally  53  With this new control  Rogue demonstrates the ability to absorb and collectively utilize all the powers of the New X Men  in order to defeat a rogue Predator X  with no apparent harm to either them or herself  57   edit  Ms  Marvel powers As a young woman  Rogue permanently absorbed certain superhuman powers and the psyche of the original Ms  Marvel  Carol Danvers   11  This provided her with superhuman strength  stamina  durability  and the ability of flight  She was able to repel bullets and achieve supersonic flight  She could also survive unprotected in outer space  Rogue also gained a precognitive  seventh sense  that enables her to predict an enemy s move subconsciously during battle  She used this ability to predict where Nightcrawler would teleport and from which direction Magus of the Technarchy would attack  70  When she possessed Carol Danvers  psyche  her  double  consciousness made her highly resistant to telepathic probes  even those of Charles Xavier  which was said to have been a byproduct of two minds existing in one body and or Carol Danvers  Kree physiology  Rogue could also draw upon the combat and espionage training of Carol Danvers by allowing her alternate personality  a duplicate of Danvers   to dominate her conscious mind  When Rogue later lost all of her superhuman abilities for a time  citation needed  her Ms  Marvel powers vanished for quite some time and did not return until later when Rogue absorbed an injured Cadre K girl named Z Cann  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  X Treme powers During the Maximum Security miniseries  Rogue absorbed an injured Cadre K girl named Z Cann  The girl held on longer than necessary  using her mind control to boost the process and because of this  perhaps because she had absorbed a fluid Skrull physiology  Rogue mutated further  gaining the ability to  recall  the powers of anyone she had ever absorbed before  though she could not control when or which of these powers surfaced  For a short time Rogue also had a Skrull appearance  scanned as though she had Skrull DNA  and had their shapeshifting powers  but these soon faded and she returned to her normal appearance  Through meditation  Rogue learned how to suppress the random manifestations of most of these abilities  but found herself with Wolverine s claws and healing factor  and Cyclops  optic blasts for a time  she had to wear ruby quartz glasses   while also still retaining her mutant and Ms  Marvel powers  Later  Sage used her own mutant abilities to  jump start  Rogue s power  giving her the control to manifest any ability she had ever absorbed  whenever she wished to  It is generally accepted that after regaining her powers after X Treme X Men  she has lost this ability  Though Z Cann was a telepath  Rogue never displayed this power  though she did manifest telepathy  it was with the Phoenix energy form  so it was most likely an echo of Jean Grey s powers    edit  Powerless For a time Rogue lost all of her powers  including her original mutant ones  after she was fatally injured in a fight with the mysterious warrior Vargas  volume  amp  issue needed  During this period  she displayed exceptional fighting skills and agility  though it was said these were not superhuman in nature  She also still possessed a  fluid genome  that enabled Sage to use her as a conduit through which to channel the mutant powers of the X Treme X Men team in a fight against Bogan   edit  Sunfire powers In her short lived ongoing series  2004 2005   Rogue absorbed a large portion of the mutant Sunfire s solar absorption based powers  In addition to her own natural mutant abilities Rogue could then project intense heat and flame  envelop her body in a fiery aura  fly by focusing her power downwards in a tight stream to propel her like a rocket  focus her power inward to increase her strength  though not at her Ms  Marvel levels   exercise immunity to heat and radiation  and see the infra red spectrum  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Rogue s real name Rogue was one of the few comic book characters whose real name had never been revealed  until decades after her first appearance  This was a controversial topic for years  citation needed  In the films X Men  X2  X Men United  and X Men  The Last Stand  Rogue s real name is Marie and she lives with a couple with the surname of D Ancanto  In the comics  her chosen name  according to X Treme X Men  31  is Anna Raven when her powers are inactive  Raven Darkholme is Mystique s name   The readers came close to finding out her name in X Men  24  when she was about to reveal it to Gambit on a date   but the Cajun stopped her before she could finish her sentence  In the  Going Rogue  arc of her 2004 ongoing series 8   Rogue s real name is finally established as Anna Marie  Rogue reaches back her childhood home of Caldecott County  where her surviving maternal aunt and the shamanistic incarnation of her mother repeatedly refer to her as  Anna Marie   Gambit also refers to her as  Anna  instead of using the traditional  Rogue   and uses a complete name of  Anna Raven  when asking a motel employee for Rogue  though it could be an instance where Rogue has chosen the surname  Raven  as an alias  Regardless  Rogue learns her true given name at birth was  Anna Marie  from the absorbed memories of her aunt  who helped raise Rogue with Rogue s father after Rogue s mother vanished from their home  Rogue acknowledges the name uttering    Anna Marie  Th that s my name      right after a shamanistic doppelg nger of Rogue mentions it  and later she says   I It s me  Anna   once after finding Gambit in the dream world  8 Uncanny X Men 517 and 526  57  65  uses the complete name of  Anna Marie  Rogue repetitively  respectively when describing her fighting against Predator 006 at Utopia and before a mission aboard the X Jet to Alaska  X Force 26  64  also does so  and Secrets of the House of M 72  states for Rogue s file the first name of  Anna Marie  and the last name of Darkholme  although the latter again is referring to Mystique s last name  Furthermore  her profile in the latest edition vague  of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe lists her real name as Anna Marie  citation needed  Chris Claremont has also used the name  Anna Marie Raven  in reference to Rogue in X Men Forever  73  although it is not clear whether or not the team knows her name  as they do uniformly refer to her as
