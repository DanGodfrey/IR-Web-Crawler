September 11th or 9 11  nb 1  were a series of four coordinated suicide attacks upon the United States in New York City and the Washington  D C  areas on September 11  2001  On that Tuesday morning  19 terrorists from the Islamist militant group Al Qaeda hijacked four passenger jets  The hijackers intentionally crashed two planes  American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City  both towers collapsed within two hours  Hijackers crashed American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon in Arlington  Virginia  The fourth jet  United Airlines Flight 93  crashed into a field near Shanksville  Pennsylvania after passengers attempted to take control before it could reach the hijackers  intended target in Washington  D C  Nearly 3 000 people died in the attacks  Suspicion quickly fell on al Qaeda  and in 2004  the group s leader Osama bin Laden  who had initially denied involvement  claimed responsibility for the attacks  1  Al Qaeda and bin Laden cited U S  support of Israel  the presence of U S  troops in Saudi Arabia  and sanctions against Iraq as motives for the attacks  The United States responded to the attacks by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban  which had harbored Al Qaeda  Many countries strengthened their anti terrorism legislation and expanded law enforcement powers  In May 2011  after years at large  bin Laden was found and killed  The destruction of the Twin Towers caused serious damage to the economy of Lower Manhattan and had a significant impact on global markets  Cleanup of the World Trade Center site was completed in May 2002  and the Pentagon was repaired within a year  Numerous memorials were constructed  including the National September 11 Memorial  amp  Museum in New York  the Pentagon Memorial  and the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania  Adjacent to the National Memorial  the 1 776 foot tall  541 m  One World Trade Center is expected to be completed in 2013  2  Contents 1 Attacks 1 1 Events 1 2 Casualties 1 3 Damage 1 4 Rescue and recovery 2 Attackers and their background 2 1 Al Qaeda 2 2 Osama bin Laden 2

hijacked planes used in the terrorist attacks on September 11  2001 Early on the morning of September 11  2001  19 hijackers took control of four commercial airliners  two Boeing 757s and two Boeing 767s  en route to San Francisco or Los Angeles after takeoffs from Boston  Massachusetts  Newark  New Jersey  and Washington  D C  3  Planes with long flights were intentionally selected for hijacking because they would be heavily fueled  4  The four flights involved were  American Airlines Flight 11  Left Boston s Logan Airport at 7 59 a m  enroute to Los Angeles with a crew of 11 and 76 passengers  not including five hijackers  The hijackers flew the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8 46 a m  United Airlines Flight 175  Left Logan Airport at 8 14 a m  enroute to Los Angeles with a crew of nine and 51 passengers  not including five hijackers  The hijackers flew the plane into the South Tower of the World Trade Center at 9 03 a m  American Airlines Flight 77  Left Washington Dulles International Airport in Northern Virginia at 8 20 a m  enroute to Los Angeles with a crew of six and 53 passengers  not including five hijackers  The hijackers flew the plane into the Pentagon at 9 37 a m  United Airlines Flight 93  Left Newark International Airport at 8 42 a m  enroute to San Francisco  with a crew of seven and 33 passengers  not including four hijackers  After the passengers revolted the hijackers crashed the plane into the ground near Shanksville  Pennsylvania at 10 03 a m  Media coverage was intense during the attacks and aftermath  beginning moments after the first crash into the World Trade Center  5  Events United Airlines Flight 175 being flown into the south face of Two World Trade Center At 8 46 a m   five hijackers crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the World Trade Center s North Tower  1 WTC   and at 9 03 a m   another five hijackers crashed United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower  2 WTC   6  7  Five hijackers flew American Airlines Flight 77 into the The Pentagon at 9 37 a m  8  A fourth flight  United Airlines Flight 93  under the control of four hijackers  crashed near Shanksville  Pennsylvania  southeast of Pittsburgh  at 10 03 a m  after the passengers fought the hijackers  Flight 93 s ultimate target is believed to have been either the Capitol or the White House  4  Flight 93 s cockpit voice recorder revealed crew and passengers attempted to seize control of the plane from the hijackers after learning through phone calls that similarly hijacked planes had been crashed into buildings that morning  9  Once it became evident to the hijackers that the passengers might regain control of the plane  the hijackers rolled the plane and intentionally crashed it  10  11  The north face of Two World Trade Center  south tower  immediately after being struck by United Airlines Flight 175 Some passengers and crew members who were able to make phone calls from the aircraft using the cabin airphone service and mobile phones provided details that there were several hijackers aboard each plane  that mace  tear gas  or pepper spray was used and that some people aboard had been stabbed  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  Reports indicated hijackers stabbed and killed pilots  flight attendants  and one or more passengers  3  19  In their final report  the 9 11 Commission found the hijackers had recently purchased multi function hand tools and assorted knives and blades  20  21  A flight attendant on Flight 11  a passenger on Flight 175  and passengers on Flight 93 said the hijackers had bombs  but one of the passengers also said he thought the bombs were fake  The FBI found no traces of explosives at the crash sites  and the 9 11 Commission concluded the bombs were probably fake  3  Three buildings in the World Trade Center Complex collapsed due to structural failure  22  The South Tower collapsed at 9 59 a m  after burning for 56 minutes in a fire caused by the impact of United Airlines Flight 175  22  The North Tower collapsed at 10 28 a m  after burning for 102 minutes  22  When the North Tower collapsed  debris fell on the nearby 7 World Trade Center building  7 WTC   damaging it and starting fires  These fires burned for hours  compromising the building s structural integrity  and 7 WTC collapsed at 5 21 p m  23  24  The Pentagon also sustained major damage  Security camera footage of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon  25  The plane hits the Pentagon approximately 86 seconds after the beginning of this recording  At 9 40 a m   the FAA grounded all aircraft within the continental U S   and aircraft already in flight were told to land immediately  All international civilian aircraft were either turned back or redirected to airports in Canada or Mexico  and all international flights were banned from landing on U S  soil for three days  26  The attacks created widespread confusion among news organizations and air traffic controllers  Among the unconfirmed and often contradictory news reports aired throughout the day  one of the most prevalent said a car bomb had been detonated at the U S  State Department s headquarters in Washington  D C  27  Another jet Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 was suspected of having been hijacked  but the aircraft responded to controllers and landed safely in Cleveland  Ohio  28  In a September 2002 interview  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al Shibh  who are believed to have organized the attacks  said Flight 93 s intended target was the United States Capitol  not the White House  29  During the planning stage of the attacks  Mohamed Atta  the hijacker and pilot of Flight 11  thought the White House might be too tough a target and sought an assessment from Hani Hanjour  who would later hijack and pilot Flight 77  30  Mohammed also said al Qaeda initially planned to target nuclear installations rather than the World Trade Center and the Pentagon  but decided against it  fearing things could  get out of control   31  Final decisions on targeting  according to Mohammed  were left in the hands of the pilots  30  Casualties See also  Casualties of the September 11 attacks and New York City Fire Department casualties of the September 11 attacks The remains of 6 World Trade Center  7 World Trade Center  and 1 World Trade Center on September 17  2001 The attacks resulted in the death of 2 996 people  including the 19 hijackers and 2 977 victims  32  The victims included 246 on the four planes  from which there were no survivors   2 606 in New York City in the towers and on the ground  and 125 at the Pentagon  33  34  Nearly all of the victims were civilians  55 military personnel were among those killed at the Pentagon  35  More than 90  of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact  36  In the North Tower 1 355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation  fell or jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames  or were killed in the building s eventual collapse  A further 107 people below the point of impact did not survive  36  In the South Tower one stairwell remained intact  allowing 18 people to escape from above the point of impact  37  In the South Tower 630 people died  fewer than half the number killed in the North Tower  36  Casualties in the South Tower were significantly reduced by the decision of some occupants to start evacuating when the North Tower was struck  37  The remaining lower part of the World Trade Center in New York City At least 200 people fell or jumped to their deaths from the burning towers  as exemplified in the photograph The Falling Man   landing on the streets and rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below  38  Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue  but the roof access doors were locked  No plan existed for helicopter rescues  and the thick smoke and intense heat would have prevented helicopters from approaching  39  A total of 411 emergency workers died as they tried to rescue people and fight fires  The New York City Fire Department  FDNY  lost 341 firefighters and 2 paramedics  40  The New York City Police Department  NYPD  lost 23 officers  41  The Port Authority Police Department lost 37 officers  42  Eight emergency medical technicians  EMTs  and paramedics from private emergency medical services units were killed  43  44  Cantor Fitzgerald L P   an investment bank on the 101st 105th floors of the North Tower  lost 658 employees  considerably more than any other employer  45 Marsh Inc   located immediately below Cantor Fitzgerald on floors 93 100  lost 358 employees  46  47  and 175 employees of Aon Corporation were also killed  48  The National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  estimated that about 17 400 civilians were in the World Trade Center complex at the time of the attacks though turnstile counts from the Port Authority suggest 14 154 people were typically in the Twin Towers by 8 45 a m  49  50  The vast majority of people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings  51  Deaths

  19 After New York  New Jersey lost the most state citizens  with the city of Hoboken sustaining the most deaths  58  More than 90 countries lost citizens in the attacks on the World Trade Center  59  Two people were later added to the official death toll after dying from health conditions linked to exposure to dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center  60  61  Weeks after the attack  the death toll was estimated to be over 6 000  more than twice the number of deaths eventually confirmed  62  The city was only able to identify remains for about 1 600 of the World Trade Center victims  The medical examiner s office collected  about 10 000 unidentified bone and tissue fragments that cannot be matched to the list of the dead   63  Bone fragments were still being found in 2006 by workers who were preparing to demolish the damaged Deutsche Bank Building  In 2010  a team of anthropologists and archaeologists searched for human remains and personal items at the Fresh Kills Landfill  where seventy two more human remains were recovered  bringing the total found to 1 845  DNA profiling continues in an attempt to identify additional victims  64  As of August 2011  1 631 victims have been identified  while 1 122  41   of the victims remained unidentified  65  66  The remains are being held in storage in Memorial Park  outside the New York City Medical Examiner s facilities  It is expected that the remains will be moved in 2013 to a repository behind a wall at the 9 11 museum  As of July 2011  a team of scientists at the Office of Chief Medical Examiner continues to try to identify remains  in the hope that improved technology will allow them to identify other victims  66  Damage The Pentagon was damaged by fire and partly collapsed Along with the 110 floor Twin Towers  numerous other buildings at the World Trade Center site were destroyed or badly damaged  including WTC buildings 3 through 7 and St  Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church  67  The North Tower  South Tower  the Marriott Hotel  3 WTC  and 7 WTC were completely destroyed  The U S  Customs House  6 World Trade Center   4 World Trade Center  5 World Trade Center  and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged  The Deutsche Bank Building on 130 Liberty Street was partially damaged and demolished later  68  69  The two buildings of the World Financial Center also suffered damage  68  The Deutsche Bank Building across Liberty Street from the World Trade Center complex was later condemned as uninhabitable because of toxic conditions inside the office tower  and was deconstructed  70  71  The Borough of Manhattan Community College s Fiterman Hall at 30 West Broadway was condemned due to extensive damage in the attacks  and is being rebuilt  72  Other neighboring buildings including 90 West Street and the Verizon Building suffered major damage but have been restored  73 World Financial Center buildings  One Liberty Plaza  the Millenium Hilton  and 90 Church Street had moderate damage and have since been restored  74  Communications equipment on top of the North Tower was also destroyed  but media stations were quickly able to reroute signals and resume broadcasts  67  75  The Pentagon  in Arlington  Virginia  across the Potomac River from Washington  D C   was severely damaged by the impact of American Airlines Flight 77 and ensuing fires  causing one section of the building to collapse  76  As it approached the Pentagon  the airplane s wings knocked over light poles and its right engine smashed into a power generator before crashing into the western side of the building  killing all 53 passengers  5 hijackers  and 6 crew  77  78  The plane hit the Pentagon at the first floor level  The front part of the fuselage disintegrated on impact  while the mid and tail sections kept moving for another fraction of a second  79  Debris from the tail section penetrated furthest into the building  breaking through 310 feet  94 m  of the three outermost of the building s five rings  79  80  Rescue and recovery See also  Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks An injured victim of the Pentagon attack is evacuated The New York City Fire Department quickly deployed 200 units  half of the department  to the site  Their efforts were supplemented by numerous off duty firefighters and emergency medical technicians  81  82  83  The New York City Police Department sent Emergency Service Units and other police personnel  and deployed its aviation unit  Once on the scene  the FDNY  NYPD  and Port Authority police did not coordinate efforts and ended up performing redundant searches for civilians  81  84  As conditions deteriorated  the NYPD aviation unit relayed information to police commanders  who issued orders for its personnel to evacuate the towers  most NYPD officers were able to safely evacuate before the buildings collapsed  84  85  With separate command posts set up and incompatible radio communications between the agencies  warnings were not passed along to FDNY commanders  After the first tower collapsed  FDNY commanders issued evacuation warnings  however  due to technical difficulties with malfunctioning radio repeater systems  many firefighters never heard the evacuation orders  9 1 1 dispatchers also received information from callers that was not passed along to commanders on the scene  82  Within hours of the attack  a substantial search and rescue operation was launched  After months of around the clock operations the World Trade Center site was cleared by the end of May 2002  86  Attackers and their background See also  Responsibility for the September 11 attacks  Hijackers in the September 11 attacks  Trials related to the September 11 attacks  and 20th hijacker Al Qaeda See also  Al Qaeda The origins of al Qaeda can be traced to 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan  Soon after  Osama bin Laden traveled to Afghanistan and helped organize Arab mujahideen to resist the Soviets  87  Under the guidance of Ayman al Zawahiri  bin Laden became more radical  88  In 1996 bin Laden issued his first fatw   calling for American soldiers to leave Saudi Arabia  89  In a second fatw  in 1998  bin Laden outlined his objections to American foreign policy with respect to Israel  as well as the continued presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War  90  Bin Laden used Islamic texts to exhort Muslims to attack Americans until the stated grievances are reversed  and according to bin Laden  Muslim legal scholars   have throughout Islamic history unanimously agreed that the jihad is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the Muslim countries   90  Osama bin Laden See also  Osama bin Laden  Death of Osama bin Laden  and Videos of Osama bin Laden 1997 picture of Osama bin Laden Bin Laden  who orchestrated the attacks  initially denied but later admitted involvement  1  91  92 Al Jazeera broadcast a statement by bin Laden on September 16  2001  stating   I stress that I have not carried out this act  which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation   93  In November 2001  U S  forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in Jalalabad  Afghanistan  In the tape  bin Laden is seen talking to Khaled al Harbi and admits foreknowledge of the attacks  94  On December 27  2001  a second bin Laden video was released  In the video  he states   Terrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice  aimed at forcing America to stop its support for Israel  which kills our people   but he stopped short of admitting responsibility for the attacks  95  Shortly before the U S  presidential election in 2004  in a taped statement  bin Laden publicly acknowledged al Qaeda s involvement in the attacks on the U S  and admitted his direct link to the attacks  He said that the attacks were carried out because   we are free     and want to regain freedom for our nation  As you undermine our security we undermine yours   96  Bin Laden said he had personally directed his followers to attack the World Trade Center  92  97  Another video obtained by Al Jazeera in September 2006 shows bin Laden with Ramzi bin al Shibh  as well as two hijackers  Hamza al Ghamdi and Wail al Shehri  as they make preparations for the attacks  98  The U S  never formally indicted bin Laden for the 9 11 attacks but he was on the FBI s Most Wanted List for the bombings of the U S  Embassies in Dar es Salaam  Tanzania  and Nairobi  Kenya  99  100  After a nearly 10 year manhunt  bin Laden was killed by American forces in Abbottabad  Pakistan on May 1  2011  101  102  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed See also  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed after his capture in Pakistan in 2003 The journalist Yosri Fouda of the Arabic television channel Al Jazeera reported that in April 2002  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed admitted his involvement  along with Ramzi bin al Shibh  103  104  105  The 9 11 Commission Report determined that the animosity towards the United States felt by Mohammed  the principal architect of the 9 11 attacks  stemmed from his  violent disagreement with U S  foreign policy favoring Israel   106  Mohammed was also an adviser and financier of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the uncle of Ramzi Yousef  the lead bomber in that attack  107  108  Mohammed was arrested on March 1  2003 in Rawalpindi  Pakistan by Pakistani security officials working with the CIA  then transported to Guantanamo Bay and interrogated using methods including waterboarding  109  110  During U S  hearings at Guantanamo Bay in March 2007  Mohammed again confessed his responsibility for the attacks  stating he  was responsible for the 9 11 operation  from A to Z  and that his statement was not made under duress  105  111  Other al Qaeda members In  Substitution for Testimony of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  from the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui  five people are identified as having been completely aware of the operation s details  They are bin Laden  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  Ramzi bin al Shibh  Abu Turab al Urduni and Mohammed Atef  112  To date  only peripheral figures have been tried or convicted for the attacks  On September 26  2005  the Spanish high court sentenced Abu Dahdah to 27 years in prison for conspiracy on the 9 11 attacks and being a member of the terrorist organization al Qaeda  At the same time  another 17 al Qaeda members were sentenced to penalties of between six and eleven years  113  114  On February 16  2006  the Spanish Supreme Court reduced the Abu Dahdah penalty to 12 years because it considered that his participation in the conspiracy was not proven  115  Also in 2006  Moussaoui  who some originally suspected might have been the assigned 20th hijacker  was convicted for the lesser role of conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism and air piracy  He is serving a life sentence without parole  116  117 Mounir el Motassadeq  an associate of the Hamburg based hijackers  is serving 15 years for his role in helping the hijackers prepare for the attacks  118  Motives See also  Motives for the September 11 attacks Wikinews has related news  Wikileaks obtains 10 years of messages  interviews from Osama bin Laden translated by CIA Osama bin Laden s declaration of a holy war against the United States  and a fatw  signed by bin Laden and others calling for the killing of American civilians in 1998  are seen by investigators as evidence of his motivation  119  In various pronouncements before and after the attacks  120  121  al Qaeda explicitly cited three motives for its activities against Western countries  the presence of U S  troops in Saudi Arabia  121  122  123 U S  support of Israel  124  125  and sanctions against Iraq  126  After the attacks  bin Laden and al Zawahiri released additional video tapes and audio tapes  some of which repeated those reasons for the attacks  Two particularly important publications were bin Laden s 2002  Letter to America   127  and a 2004 video tape by bin Laden  128  Bin Laden interpreted the Prophet Muhammad as having banned the  permanent presence of infidels in Arabia   129  In 1996  bin Laden issued a fatw  calling for American troops to get out of Saudi Arabia  In 1998  Al Qaeda wrote   for over seven years the United States has been occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of places  the Arabian Peninsula  plundering its riches  dictating to its rulers  humiliating its people  terrorizing its neighbors  and turning its bases in the Peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring Muslim peoples   130  In a December 1999  interview  bin Laden said he felt that Americans were  too near to Mecca   and considered this a provocation to the entire Muslim world  131  In his November 2002  Letter to America   bin Laden cited the United States  support of Israel as a motivation   The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes  and you are the leaders of its criminals  And of course there is no need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel  The creation of Israel is a crime which must be erased  Each and every person whose hands have become polluted in the contribution towards this crime must pay its price  and pay for it heavily   127  In 2004 and 2010  bin Laden again connected the September 11 attacks with U S  support of Israel  132  133  134  Bin Laden claimed in 2004 that the idea of destroying the towers had first occurred to him in 1982  when he witnessed Israel s bombardment of high rise apartment buildings during the invasion of Lebanon  135  136  Several analysts  including Mearsheimer and Walt  also say one motivation for the attacks was U S  support of Israel  125  131  In the 1998 fatw   al Qaeda identified the Iraq sanctions as a reason to kill Americans  condemning the  protracted blockade  130  among other actions constituting a declaration of war against  Allah  his messenger  and Muslims   130  In addition to those cited by bin Laden and Al Qaeda  analysts have suggested other motives  including western support of non Islamist authoritarian regimes in Saudi Arabia  Iran  Iraq  Pakistan and northern Africa  and western troups in some of these countries  137  Other authors suggest that humiliation resulting from the Islamic world falling behind the Western world   this discrepancy made especially visible by recent globalization  138  139  and a desire to provoke the U S  into a broader war against the Islamic world  in the hope of motivating more allies to support al Qaeda  140  Events prior to the attacks Planning of the attacks See also  Planning of the September 11 attacks Map showing the attacks on the World Trade Center  the planes are not drawn to scale  Diagram showing the attacks on the World Trade Center The idea for the attacks came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  who first presented it to Osama bin Laden in 1996  141  At that time  bin Laden and al Qaeda were in a period of transition  having just relocated back to Afghanistan from Sudan  142  The 1998 African Embassy bombings and bin Laden s 1998 fatw  marked a turning point  as bin Laden became intent on attacking the United States  142  In late 1998 or early 1999  bin Laden gave approval for Mohammed to go forward with organizing the plot  A series of meetings occurred in early 1999  involving Mohammed  bin Laden  and his deputy Mohammed Atef  142  Atef provided operational support for the plot  including target selections and helping arrange travel for the hijackers  142  Bin Laden overruled Mohammed  rejecting some potential targets such as the U S  Bank Tower in Los Angeles because   there was not enough time to prepare for such an operation   143  144  Bin Laden provided leadership and financial support for the plot  and was involved in selecting participants  145  Bin Laden initially selected Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar  both experienced jihadists who had fought in Bosnia  Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived in the United States in mid January 2000  In spring 2000  Hazmi and Mihdhar took flying lessons in San Diego  California  but both spoke little English  did poorly with flying lessons  and eventually served as secondary   or  muscle    hijackers  146  147  In late 1999  a group of men from Hamburg  Germany arrived in Afghanistan  including Mohamed Atta  Marwan al Shehhi  Ziad Jarrah  and Ramzi bin al Shibh  148  Bin Laden selected these men because they were educated  could speak English  and had experience living in the west  149  New recruits were routinely screened for special skills and al Qaeda leaders consequently discovered that Hani Hanjour already had a commercial pilot s license  150  Hanjour arrived in San Diego on December 8  2000  joining Hazmi  151  They soon left for Arizona  where Hanjour took refresher training  Marwan al Shehhi arrived at the end of May 2000  while Atta arrived on June 3  2000  and Jarrah arrived on June 27  2000  Bin al Shibh applied several times for a visa to the United States  but as a Yemeni  he was rejected out of concerns he would overstay his visa and remain as an illegal immigrant  Bin al Shibh stayed in Hamburg  providing coordination between Atta and Mohammed  The three Hamburg cell members all took pilot training in South Florida  In spring 2001  the secondary hijackers began arriving in the United States  152  In July 2001  Atta met with bin al Shibh in Spain  where they coordinated details of the plot  including final target selection  Bin al Shibh also passed along bin Laden s wish for the attacks to be carried out as soon as possible  153  Warnings See also  September 11 intelligence prior to the attacks The September 11 attacks were preceded by a number of previous events that indicated al Qaeda was trying to strike the United States  In December 1998  the CIA s Counterterrorist Center reported to President Bill Clinton that al Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the U S  that might include hijacking aircraft  154  155  Another warning came from Ahmad Shah Massoud in April 2001  in a speech before the European Parliament in Brussels  Massoud told the parliament that his intelligence agents had gained limited knowledge about a large scale terrorist attack on U S  soil being imminent   156  In July 2001  communications intercepts and other top secret intelligence showed the increasing likelihood that al Qaeda would soon attack the United States but no specific plans   157  158  In August 2001  the President s Daily Briefing  warned that bin Laden was planning to exploit his operatives  access to the U S  to mount a terrorist strike but not

 Reactions to the September 11 attacks  and U S  military response during the September 11 attacks At 8 32 a m   Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  officials were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and they in turn notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command  NORAD   NORAD scrambled two F 15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8 53 a m  161  Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials  NORAD had 9 minutes  notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked  and no notice about any of the other flights before they crashed  161  After both of the Twin Towers had already been hit  more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9 30 a m  161  At 10 20 a m  Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked  However  these instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action  161  162  163  164  Some fighters took to the air without live ammunition  knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets  the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes  possibly ejecting at the last moment  165  For the first time in history SCATANA was invoked  establishing an ATC Zero condition  closing all airspace and immediately grounding all non emergency civilian aircraft in the United States  Canada  and several other countries  166  and so stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the world  167  The Federal Aviation Administration closed American airspace to all international flights  causing about five hundred flights to be turned back or redirected to other countries  Canada received 226 of the diverted flights and launched Operation Yellow Ribbon to deal with the large numbers of grounded planes and stranded passengers  168  The 9 11 attacks had immediate and overwhelming effects upon the American people  169  Police and rescue workers from around the country took leaves of absence  traveling to New York City to help recover bodies from the twisted remnants of the Twin Towers  170  Blood donations across the U S  surged in the weeks after 9 11  171  172  The deaths of adults who were killed in the attacks or died in rescue operations resulted in over 3000 children losing a parent  173  Subsequent studies documented children s reactions to these actual losses and to feared losses of life  the protective environment in the aftermath of the attacks  and effects on surviving caregivers  174  175  176  Military operations following the attacks See also  War on Terror U S  soldiers in Afghanistan At 2 40 p m  in the afternoon of September 11  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was issuing rapid orders to his aides to look for evidence of Iraqi involvement  According to notes taken by senior policy official Stephen Cambone  Rumsfeld asked for   Best info fast  Judge whether good

all up  Things related and not   178  179  The NATO council declared the attacks on the United States were an attack on all NATO nations which satisfied Article 5 of the NATO charter  This marked the first invocation of Article 5  which had been written during the Cold War with an attack by the Soviet Union in mind  180 Australian Prime Minister John Howard invoked Article IV of the ANZUS treaty  The Bush administration announced a War on Terror  with the stated goals of bringing bin Laden and al Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks  These goals would be accomplished by imposing economic and military sanctions against states perceived as harboring terrorists  and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing  On September 14  2001 a joint resolution was passed by the United States Congress authorizing US Presidents to fight terrorists and the nations that harbor them called the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists  On October 7  2001  the War in Afghanistan began when U S  and British forces initiated aerial bombing campaigns targeting Taliban and Al Qaeda camps  then later invaded Afghanistan with ground troops of the Special Forces  The overthrow of the Taliban rule of Afghanistan by a U S  led coalition was the second biggest operation of the U S  Global War on Terrorism outside of the United States  and the largest directly connected to terrorism  Conflict in Afghanistan between the Taliban insurgency and the ISAF is ongoing  The Philippines and Indonesia  among other nations with their own internal conflicts with Islamic terrorism  also increased their military readiness  181  182  Domestic response President Bush addresses a joint session of Congress on September 20  2001 Following the attacks  President Bush s approval rating soared to 90   183  On September 20  2001 he addressed the nation and a joint session of the United States Congress regarding the events of September 11 and the subsequent nine days of rescue and recovery efforts  and described his intended response to the attacks  New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani s highly visible role won him high praise in New York and nationally  184  Many relief funds were immediately set up to assist victims of the attacks  with the task of providing financial assistance to the survivors of the attacks and to the families of victims  By the deadline for victim s compensation on September 11  2003  2 833 applications had been received from the families of those who were killed  185  Statement by the American President in his Address to the Nation George W  Bush s address to the people of the United States  September 11  2001  8 30 p m  EDT  Problems listening to this file  See media help  Contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders were also implemented almost immediately after the attacks  167  However  Congress was not told that the United States had been under a continuity of government status until February 2002  186  In the largest restructuring of the U S  government in contemporary history  the United States enacted the Homeland Security Act of 2002  creating the Department of Homeland Security  Congress also passed the USA PATRIOT Act  saying it would help detect and prosecute terrorism and other crimes  187  Civil liberties groups have criticized the PATRIOT Act  saying it allows law enforcement to invade the privacy of citizens and that it eliminates judicial oversight of law enforcement and domestic intelligence  188  189  190  In an effort to effectively combat future acts of terrorism  the National Security Agency  NSA  was given broad powers  NSA commenced warrantless surveillance of telecommunications which was sometimes criticized since it permitted the agency  to eavesdrop on telephone and e mail communications between the United States and people overseas without a warrant   191  Hate crimes Numerous incidents of harassment and hate crimes against Muslims and South Asians were reported in the days following the 9 11 attacks  192  193  194 Sikhs were also targeted because Sikh males usually wear turbans  which are stereotypically associated with Muslims  There were reports of verbal abuse  attacks on mosques and other religious buildings  including the firebombing of a Hindu temple   and assaults on people  including one murder  Balbir Singh Sodhi  a Sikh mistaken for a Muslim  was fatally shot on September 15  2001 in Mesa  Arizona  194  According to an academic study  people perceived to be Middle Eastern were as likely to be victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time  The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people who may have been perceived as Muslims  Arabs and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin  195  A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together  documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and September 17  Various crimes such as vandalism  arson  assault  shootings  harassment  and threats in numerous places were documented  196  197  Muslim American reaction Muslim organizations in the United States were swift to condemn the attacks and called   upon Muslim Americans to come forward with their skills and resources to help alleviate the sufferings of the affected people and their families   198  These organizations included the Islamic Society of North America  American Muslim Alliance  American Muslim Council  Council on American Islamic Relations  Islamic Circle of North America  and the Shari a Scholars Association of North America  Along with monetary donations  many Islamic organizations launched blood drives and provided medical assistance  food  and shelter for victims  199  200  201  International response See also  Reactions to the September 11 attacks Vladimir Putin and his wife attending a commemoration service for the victims of the September 11 attacks  16 November 2001 The attacks were denounced by mass media and governments worldwide  Across the globe  nations offered pro American support and solidarity  202  Leaders in most Middle Eastern countries  and Afghanistan  condemned the attacks  Iraq was a notable exception  with an immediate official statement that   the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity   203  While the government of Saudi Arabia officially condemned the attacks  privately many Saudis favored bin Laden s cause  204  205  As in the United States  the aftermath of the attacks saw tensions increase in other countries between Muslims and non Muslims  206  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368 condemned the attacks  and expressed readiness to take all necessary steps to respond and combat all forms of terrorism in accordance with their Charter  207  Numerous countries introduced anti terrorism legislation and froze bank accounts they suspected of al Qaeda ties  208  209  Law enforcement and intelligence agencies in a number of countries arrested alleged terrorists  210  211  Tens of thousands of people attempted to flee Afghanistan following the attacks  fearing a response by the United States  Pakistan  already home to many refugees from previous conflicts  closed its border with Afghanistan on September 17  2001  Approximately one month after the attacks  the United States led a broad coalition of international forces to overthrow the Taliban regime from Afghanistan for their harboring of al Qaeda  212  Though Pakistani authorities were initially reluctant to align themselves with the United States against the Taliban  they permitted the coalition access to their military bases  and arrested and handed over to the U S  over 600 suspected al Qaeda members  213  214  The U S  set up the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to hold inmates they defined as  illegal enemy combatants   The legitimacy of these detentions has been questioned by the European Union and human rights organizations  215  216  217  Long term effects Economic aftermath The 9 11 attacks had a major effect on the economy of New York City See also  Economic effects arising from the September 11 attacks The attacks had a significant economic impact on United States and world markets  218  The stock exchanges did not open on September 11 and remained closed until September 17  Reopening  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  fell 684 points  or 7 1   to 8921  a record setting one day point decline  219  By the end of the week  the DJIA had fallen 1 369 7 points  14 3    at the time its largest one week point drop in history  220  In 2001 dollars  U S  stocks lost  1 4 trillion in valuation for the week  220  In New York City  about 430 000 job months and  2 8 billion dollars in wages were lost in the three months after the attacks  The economic effects were mainly on the economy s export sectors  221  The city s GDP was estimated to have declined by  27 3 billion for the last three months of 2001 and all of 2002  The U S  government provided  11 2 billion in immediate assistance to the Government of New York City in September 2001  and  10 5 billion in early 2002 for economic development and infrastructure needs  222  U S  deficit and debt increases 2001 2008  Also hurt were small businesses in Lower Manhattan near the World Trade Center  18 000 of which were destroyed or displaced  resulting in lost jobs and their consequent wages  Assistance was provided by Small Business Administration loans  federal government Community Development Block Grants  and Economic Injury Disaster Loans  222  Some 31 900 000 square feet  2 960 000 m2  of Lower Manhattan office space was damaged or destroyed  223  Many wondered whether these jobs would return  and if the damaged tax base would recover  224  Studies of the economic effects of 9 11 show the Manhattan office real estate market and office employment were less affected than first feared  because of the financial services industry s need for face to face interaction  225  226  North American air space was closed for several days after the attacks and air travel decreased upon its reopening  leading to a nearly 20  cutback in air travel capacity  and exacerbating financial problems in the struggling U S  airline industry  227  The September 11 attacks also led indirectly to the U S  wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  228  as well as additional homeland security spending  totaling at least  5 trillion  229  Health effects See also  Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks Survivors were covered in dust after the collapse of the towers The thousands of tons of toxic debris resulting from the collapse of the Twin Towers contained more than 2 500 contaminants  including known carcinogens  230  231  Subsequent debilitating illnesses among rescue and recovery workers are said to be linked to exposure to these carcinogens  232  233  The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality in the aftermath of the attacks  citing national security  however  the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre September 11 levels until June 2002  234  Health effects also extended to residents  students  and office workers of Lower Manhattan and nearby Chinatown  235  Several deaths have been linked to the toxic dust  and the victims  names will be included in the World Trade Center memorial  236  Approximately 18 000 people have been estimated to have developed illnesses as a result of the toxic dust  237  There is also scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products in the air may have negative effects on fetal development  A notable children s environmental health center is currently analyzing the children whose mothers were pregnant during the WTC collapse  and were living or working nearby  238  A study of rescue workers released in April 2010 found that all those studied had impaired lung functions  and that 30 40  were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack  239  Years after the attacks  legal disputes over the costs of illnesses related to the attacks were still in the court system  On October 17  2006  a federal judge rejected New York City s refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers  allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city  240  Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks  Christine Todd Whitman  administrator of the EPA in the aftermath of the attacks  was heavily criticized by a U S  District Judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe  241  Mayor Giuliani was criticized for urging financial industry personnel to return quickly to the greater Wall Street area  242  Government policies toward terrorism As a result of the attacks  many governments across the world passed legislation to combat terrorism  243  In Germany  where several of the 9 11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country s liberal asylum policies  two major anti terrorism packages were enacted  The first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in Germany  The second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence and law enforcement  244  Canada passed the Canadian Anti Terrorism Act  that nation s first anti terrorism law  245  The United Kingdom passed the Anti terrorism  Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005  246  247  Similarly  New Zealand enacted the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002  248  In the United States  the Department of Homeland Security was created to coordinate domestic anti terrorism efforts  The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers  including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge  to monitor telephone communications  e mail  and Internet use by terror suspects  and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions  The Federal Aviation Administration ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes  and assigned sky marshals to flights  Further  the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government  rather than airports  responsible for airport security  The law created a federal security force to inspect passengers and luggage  causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy  249  Cultural impact See also  List of cultural references to the September 11 attacks The impact of 9 11 extends beyond the political arena into society and culture in general  Immediate responses to 9 11 included greater focus on home life and time spent with family  higher church attendance  and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of flags  250  The radio industry responded by removing certain songs from playlists  and the attacks have subsequently been used as background  narrative or thematic elements in film  television  music and literature  Already running television shows as well as programs developed after 9 11 have reflected post 9 11 cultural concerns  251 9 11 conspiracy theories have become social phenomena  despite negligible support for such views from expert scientists  engineers  and historians  252  Investigations FBI investigation See also  PENTTBOM Mohamed Atta  an Egyptian national  was the ringleader of the hijackers  Immediately after the attacks  the Federal Bureau of Investigation started PENTTBOM  the largest criminal inquiry in the history of the United States  At its height  more than half of the FBI s agents worked on the investigation and followed a half million leads  253  The FBI concluded that there was  clear and irrefutable  evidence linking al Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks  254  The FBI was able to quickly identify the hijackers  including leader Mohamed Atta  when his luggage was discovered at Boston s Logan Airport  Due to a mix up  the luggage failed to make it aboard American Airlines Flight 11 as planned  The luggage contained the hijackers  names  assignments and al Qaeda connections   It had all these Arab language  sic  papers that amounted to the Rosetta stone of the investigation   said one FBI agent  255  Within hours of the attacks  the FBI released the names and in many cases the personal details of the suspected pilots and hijackers  256  257  By midday  the U S  National Security Agency and German intelligence agencies had intercepted communications pointing to Osama bin Laden  258  259  On September 27  2001  the FBI released photos of the 19 hijackers  along with information about possible nationalities and aliases  260  Fifteen of the men were from Saudi Arabia  two from the United Arab Emirates  one  Atta  from Egypt  and one from Lebanon  261  9 11 Commission See also  9 11 Commission The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States  9 11 Commission   chaired by former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean  was formed in late 2002 to prepare a thorough account of the circumstances surrounding the attacks  including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks  262  On July 22  2004  the 9 11 Commission issued the 9 11 Commission Report  The report detailed the events of 9 11  found the attacks were carried out by members of al Qaeda  and examined how security and intelligence agencies were inadequately coordinated to prevent the attacks  Formed from an independent bipartisan group of mostly former Senators  Representatives  and Governors  the commissioners explained   We believe the 9 11 attacks revealed four kinds of failures  in imagination  policy  capabilities  and management   263  The commission made numerous recommendations on how to prevent future attacks  and in 2011 was dismayed that several of its recommendations had yet to be implemented  264  Collapse of the World Trade Center See also  Collapse of the World Trade Center The north tower continues to burn after the collapse of the south tower The exterior support columns from the lower level of the south tower remained standing after the building collapsed The U S  National Institute of Standards and Technology investigated the collapses of the Twin Towers and 7 WTC  The investigations examined why the buildings collapsed  what fire protection measures were in place and evaluated how fire protection systems might be improved in future construction  265  The investigation into the collapse of 1 WTC and 2 WTC was concluded in October 2005 but that of 7 WTC wasn t finalized until August 2008  266  The NIST found that the fireproofing on the Twin Towers  steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that  had this not occurred  the towers would likely have remained standing  267  A study published by researchers of Purdue University confirmed that  if the thermal insulation on the core columns were scoured off and column temperatures were elevated to approximately 700  C  1 292  F   the fire would have been sufficient to initiate collapse  268  269  The director of the original investigation stated that   the towers really did amazingly well  The terrorist aircraft didn t bring the buildings down  it was the fire which followed  It was proven that you could take out two thirds of the columns in a tower and the building would still stand   270  The fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors  making the floors sag  The sagging floors pulled on the exterior steel columns causing the exterior columns to bow inward  With the damage to the core columns  the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings  causing them to collapse  Additionally  the report found the towers  stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide adequate emergency escape for people above the impact zones  271  NIST concluded that uncontrolled fires in 7 WTC caused floor beams and girders to heat and subsequently  caused a critical support column to fail  initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down   266  Internal review of the CIA The Inspector General of the CIA conducted an internal review of the CIA s pre 9 11 performance and was harshly critical of senior CIA officials for not doing everything possible to confront terrorism  He criticized their failure to stop two of the 9 11 hijackers  Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar  as they entered the United States and their failure to share information on the two men with the FBI  272  In May 2007  senators from both major U S  political parties drafted legislation to make the review public  One of the backers  Senator Ron Wyden said   The American people have a right to know what the Central Intelligence Agency was doing in those critical months before 9 11   273  In the President s Daily Brief  dated August 6  2001  a CIA memo mentions uncorroborated reporting from a foreign intelligence service suggesting that Bin Laden was  Determined To Strike in US  and may want to hijack an airplane to secure the release of Islamic extremist prisoners  Rebuilding One World Trade Center under construction in January 2012 See also  World Trade Center site and One World Trade Center On the day of the attacks  New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani proclaimed   We will rebuild  We re going to come out of this stronger than before  politically stronger  economically stronger  The skyline will be made whole again   274  The damaged section of the Pentagon was rebuilt and occupied within a year of the attacks  275  The temporary World Trade Center PATH station opened in late 2003 and construction of the new 7 World Trade Center was completed in 2006  Work on rebuilding the main World Trade Center site was delayed until late 2006 when leaseholder Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agreed on financing  276 One World Trade Center is currently under construction at the site and at 1 776 ft  541 m  upon completion in 2013  will become the tallest building in North America  277  On the World Trade Center site  three more office towers are expected to be built one block east of where the original towers stood  Though initial construction has commenced on all three of these towers  they are expected to be completed after the completion of One World Trade Center  278  Memorials The Tribute in Light on September 11  2011  on the tenth

11 attacks In the days immediately following the attacks  many memorials and vigils were held around the world  In addition  people posted photographs of the dead and missing all around Ground Zero  A witness described being unable to  get away from faces of innocent victims who were killed  Their pictures are everywhere  on phone booths  street lights  walls of subway stations  Everything reminded me of a huge funeral  people quiet and sad  but also very nice  Before  New York gave me a cold feeling  now people were reaching out to help each other   279  One of the first memorials was the Tribute in Light  an installation of 88 searchlights at the footprints of the World Trade Center towers  280  In New York  the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition was held to design an appropriate memorial on the site  281  The winning design  Reflecting Absence  was selected in August 2006  and consists of a pair of reflecting pools in the footprints of the towers  surrounded by a list of the victims  names in an underground memorial space  282  Plans for a museum on the site have been put on hold  following the abandonment of the International Freedom Center in reaction to complaints from the families of many victims  283  The Pentagon Memorial was completed and opened to the public on the seventh anniversary of the attacks in 2008  284  285  It consists of a landscaped park with 184 benches facing the Pentagon  286  When the Pentagon was repaired in 2001 2002  a private chapel and indoor memorial were included  located at the spot where Flight 77 crashed into the building  287  In Shanksville  a permanent Flight 93 National Memorial is planned to include a sculpted grove of trees forming a circle around the crash site  bisected by the plane s path  while wind chimes will bear the names of the victims  288  A temporary memorial is located 500 yards  457 m  from the crash site  289  New York City firefighters donated a cross made of steel from the World Trade Center and mounted on top of a platform shaped like the Pentagon  290  It was installed outside the firehouse on August 25  2008  291  Many other permanent memorials are being constructed elsewhere  and scholarships and charities have been established by the victims  families  along with many other organizations and private figures  292  On every anniversary  in New York City  the names of the victims who died there are read out against a background of somber music  The President of the United States attends a memorial service at the Pentagon  293  and also asks Americans to observe a moment of silence in observance of Patriot Day  Smaller services are held in Shanksville  Pennsylvania  which are usually attended by the President s spouse  See also September 11 attacks
