Turkmenistan  and also borders on a significant part of the Caspian Sea  Although Kazakhstan does not share a border with Mongolia  its most easterly point is only 38 kilometres  24 mi  from Mongolia s western tip  The terrain of Kazakhstan ranges from flatlands  steppes  taigas  rock canyons  hills  deltas  and snow capped mountains to deserts  With 16 6 million people  2011 estimate  8  Kazakhstan has the 62nd largest population in the world  though its population density is less than 6 people per square kilometre  15 per sq  mi    The capital was moved in 1998 from Almaty  Kazakhstan s largest city  to Astana  For most of its history  the territory of modern day Kazakhstan has been inhabited by nomadic tribes  By the 16th century  the Kazakhs emerged as a distinct group  divided into three J z  The Russians began advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century  and by the mid 19th century all of Kazakhstan was part of the Russian Empire  Following the 1917 Russian Revolution  and subsequent civil war  the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganized several times before becoming the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936  a part of the USSR  Kazakhstan declared itself an independent country on December 16  1991  the last Soviet republic to do so  Its communist era leader  Nursultan Nazarbayev  became the country s first president  a position he retains today  President Nazarbayev maintains strict control over the country s politics  Since independence  Kazakhstan has pursued a balanced foreign policy and worked to develop its economy  especially its hydrocarbon industry  9  The post Soviet era has also been characterized by increased involvement with many international organizations  including the United Nations  the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council  the Commonwealth of Independent States  and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation  Kazakhstan is also one of six post Soviet states who have implemented an Individual Partnership Action Plan with NATO  Kazakhstan is ethnically and culturally diverse  in part due to mass deportations of many ethnic groups to the country during Stalin s rule  Kazakhstan has a population of 16 6

           Qazaqstand qtar  Russian               kazakhstantsy  was coined to describe all citizens of Kazakhstan  including non Kazakhs  11  The word  Kazakh  is generally used to refer to people of ethnic Kazakh descent  including those living in China  Afghanistan  Turkey  Uzbekistan and other countries   The ethnonym  Kazakh  is derived from an ancient Turkic word meaning  independent  a free spirit   It is the result of Kazakhs  nomadic horseback culture  The Persian  See Indo Iranian languages  suffix   stan  means  land  or  place of   so  Kazakhstan  is  land of the Kazakhs   History Main article  History of Kazakhstan Kazakh Khanate Kazakhstan has been inhabited since the Neolithic Age  the region s climate and terrain are best suited for nomads practicing pastoralism  Archaeologists believe that humans first domesticated the horse in the region s vast steppes  Central Asia proper was originally inhabited by Indo Iranians  The best known of those groups was the nomadic Scythians  12  The Turkic people began encroaching on the Iranians starting at least in the 5th century AD  possibly before  They became the dominant ethnic component of Central Asia  While ancient cities Taraz  Aulie Ata  and Hazrat e Turkestan had long served as important way stations along the Silk Road connecting East and West  real political consolidation only began with the Mongol invasion of the early 13th century  Under the Mongol Empire  administrative districts were established  and these eventually came under the emergent Kazakh Khanate  Kazakhstan   Artistic depiction of medieval Taraz situated along the Silk Road Throughout this period  traditionally nomadic life and a livestock based economy continued to dominate the steppe  In the 15th century  a distinct Kazakh identity began to emerge among the Turkic tribes  a process which was consolidated by the mid 16th century with the appearance of a distinctive Kazakh language  culture  and economy  Nevertheless  the region was the focus of ever increasing disputes between the native Kazakh emirs and the neighbouring Persian speaking peoples to the south  By the early 17th century  the Kazakh Khanate was struggling with the impact of tribal rivalries  which had effectively divided the population into the Great  Middle and Little  or Small  Hordes  j z   Political disunion  tribal rivalries  and the diminishing importance of overland trade routes between East and West weakened the Kazakh Khanate  Inside a Kazakh yurt During the 17th century Kazakhs fought Oirats  a federation of western Mongol tribes  including Dzungars  13  The beginning of the 18th century marked the zenith of the Kazakh Khanate  During this period the Little Horde participated in the 1723 1730 war against the Dzungars  following their  Great Disaster  invasion of Kazakh territories  The Dzungars seized the pastures of the defeated Kazakhs  taking many captives  and slaughtering entire clans  14  Under the leadership of Abul Khair Khan  the Kazakhs won major victories over the Dzungar at the Bulanty River in 1726  and at the Battle of Anrakay in 1729  15 Ablai Khan participated in the most significant battles against the Dzungars from the 1720s to the 1750s  for which he was declared a  batyr    hero   by the people  Kazakhs were also victims of constant raids carried out by the Volga Kalmyks  Russian Empire In the 19th century  the Russian Empire began to expand into Central Asia  The  Great Game  period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the Anglo Russian Convention of 1907  The tsars effectively ruled over most of the territory belonging to what is now the Republic of Kazakhstan  Traditional Kazakh wedding dress The Russian Empire introduced a system of administration and built military garrisons and barracks in its effort to establish a presence in Central Asia in the so called  Great Game  between it and the British Empire  The first Russian outpost  Orsk  was built in 1735  Russia enforced the Russian language in all schools and governmental organizations  Russian efforts to impose its system aroused the resentment by the Kazakh people  and by the 1860s  most Kazakhs resisted Russia s annexation largely because of the influence it wrought upon the traditional nomadic lifestyle and livestock based economy  and the associated hunger that was rapidly wiping out some Kazakh tribes  The Kazakh national movement  which began in the late 19th century  sought to preserve the native language and identity by resisting the attempts of the Russian Empire to assimilate and stifle them  Russian settlers near Petropavlovsk From the 1890s onwards  ever larger numbers of settlers from the Russian Empire began colonising the territory of present day Kazakhstan  in particular the province of Semirechye  The number of settlers rose still further once the Trans Aral Railway from Orenburg to Tashkent was completed in 1906  and the movement was overseen and encouraged by a specially created Migration Department                              in St  Petersburg  During the 19th century about 400 000 Russians immigrated to Kazakhstan  and about one million Slavs  Germans  Jews  and others immigrated to the region during the first third of the 20th century  16  Vasile Balabanov was the administrator responsible for the resettlement during much of this time  The competition for land and water that ensued between the Kazakhs and the newcomers caused great resentment against colonial rule during the final years of Tsarist Russia  with the most serious uprising  the Central Asian Revolt  occurring in 1916  The Kazakhs attacked Russian and Cossack settlers and military garrisons  The revolt resulted in a series of clashes and in brutal massacres committed by both sides  17  Both sides resisted the communist government until late 1919  Kazakh SSR Main article  Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic Although there was a brief period of autonomy  Alash Autonomy  during the tumultuous period following the collapse of the Russian Empire  many uprisings were brutally suppressed  and the Kazakhs eventually succumbed to Soviet rule  In 1920  the area of present day Kazakhstan became an autonomous republic within the Soviet Union  Almaty  the Soviet era capital of Kazakhstan Soviet repression of the traditional elite  along with forced collectivization in the late 1920s 1930s  brought mass hunger and led to unrest  see also  Soviet famine of 1932 1933   18  19  Between 1926 and 1939  the Kazakh population declined by 22  due to starvation and mass emigration  Estimates today suggest that the population of Kazakhstan would be closer to 20 million if there had been no starvation or migration of Kazakhs  During the 1930s  many renowned Kazakh writers  thinkers  poets  politicians and historians were slaughtered on Stalin s orders  both as part of the repression and as a methodical pattern of suppressing Kazakh identity and culture  Soviet rule took hold  and a Communist apparatus steadily worked to fully integrate Kazakhstan into the Soviet system  In 1936 Kazakhstan became a Soviet republic  Kazakhstan experienced population inflows of millions exiled from other parts of the Soviet Union during the 1930s and 1940s  many of the deportation victims were deported to Siberia or Kazakhstan merely due to their ethnic heritage or beliefs  and were in many cases interned in some of the biggest Soviet labour camps  including ALZHIR camp outside Astana  which was reserved for the wives of men considered  enemies of the people   20   see also  Population transfer in the Soviet Union  Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union   The Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic contributed five national divisions to the Soviet Union s World War II effort  In 1947  two years after the end of the war  the Semipalatinsk Test Site  the USSR s main nuclear weapon test site  was founded near the city of Semey  Young Pioneers at a Young Pioneer camp in Kazakh SSR  World War II marked an increase in industrialisation and increased mineral extraction in support of the war effort  At the time of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin s death  however  Kazakhstan still had an overwhelmingly agricultural based economy  In 1953  Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev initiated the ambitious  Virgin Lands  program to turn the traditional pasture lands of Kazakhstan into a major grain producing region for the Soviet Union  The Virgin Lands policy brought mixed results  However  along with later modernizations under Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev  it accelerated the development of the agricultural sector  which remains the source of livelihood for a large percentage of Kazakhstan s population  By 1959  Kazakhs made up 30  of the population  Ethnic Russians accounted for 43   21  Growing tensions within Soviet society led to a demand for political and economic reforms  which came to a head in the 1980s  A factor that contributed to this immensely was Lavrentii Beria s decision to test a nuclear bomb on the territory of Kazakh SSR in Semey in 1949  This had a catastrophic ecological and biological effect that was felt generations later  and Kazakh anger toward the Soviet system escalated  In December 1986  mass demonstrations by young ethnic Kazakhs  later called Jeltoqsan riot  took place in Almaty to protest the replacement of the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR Dinmukhamed Konayev with Gennady Kolbin from the Russian SFSR  Governmental troops suppressed the unrest  several people were killed and many demonstrators were jailed  In the waning days of Soviet rule  discontent continued to grow and find expression under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev s policy of glasnost  Independence The Bayterek tower in Astana  the capital of Kazakhstan Caught up in the groundswell of Soviet republics seeking greater autonomy  Kazakhstan declared its sovereignty as a republic within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in October 1990  Following the August 1991 aborted coup attempt in Moscow and the subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union  Kazakhstan declared independence on December 16  1991  It was the last of the Soviet republics to declare independence  The years following independence have been marked by significant reforms to the Soviet style economy and political monopoly on power  Under Nursultan Nazarbayev  who initially came to power in 1989 as the head of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and was eventually elected President in 1991  Kazakhstan has made significant progress toward developing a market economy  Politics Main articles  Government of Kazakhstan and Politics of Kazakhstan Political system Kazakhstan is officially a presidential

agrarian industrial bloc AIST and the Asar Party  founded by President Nazarbayev s daughter  won most of the remaining seats  Opposition parties  which were officially registered and competed in the elections  won a single seat during elections that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said fell short of international standards  In 1999  Kazakhstan applied for observer status at the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly  The official response of the Assembly was that Kazakhstan could apply for full membership  because it is partially located in Europe  but that they would not be granted any status whatsoever at the Council until their democracy and human rights records improved  On December 4  2005  Nursultan Nazarbayev was reelected in a landslide victory  The

Asar Party  Civil Party of Kazakhstan and Agrarian Party  won every seat with 88  of the vote  None of the opposition parties have reached the benchmark 7  level of the seats  This has led some in the local media to question the competence and charisma of the opposition party leaders  Opposition parties made accusations of serious irregularities in the election  23  24  On April 3  2011  in presidential elections Nursultan Nazarbayev was reelected to a five year term as Kazakhstan s President  In 2010 President Nazarbayev rejected a call from constituents to hold a referendum to keep him

25  2011  The new religion law now restricts religious freedom in Kazakhstan  Islam is the largest religion in Kazakhstan followed by Russian Orthodox Christianity  After decades of religious suppression by the Soviet Union  the coming of independence witnessed a surge in expression of ethnic identity  partly through religion  The free practice of religious beliefs and the establishment of

in the 15th century  the religion was not fully assimilated until much later  As a result  it coexisted with earlier elements of Tengriism  Traditional Kazakh belief held that separate spirits inhabited and animated the earth  sky  water and fire  as well as domestic animals  To this day  particularly honored guests in rural settings are treated to a feast of freshly killed lamb  Such guests are sometimes asked to bless the lamb and to ask its spirit for permission to partake of its flesh  Besides lamb  many other traditional foods retain symbolic value in Kazakh culture  Abay Qunanbayuli  Kazakh poet  composer and philosopher In the national cuisine  livestock meat can be cooked in a variety of ways and is usually served with a wide assortment of traditional bread products  Refreshments often include black tea and traditional milk derived drinks such as ayran  shubat and kymyz  A traditional Kazakh dinner involves a multitude of appetisers on the table  followed by a soup and one or two main courses such as pilaf and beshbarmak  They also drink their national beverage  which consists of fermented mare s milk  Because livestock was central to the Kazakhs  traditional lifestyle  most of their nomadic practices and customs relate in some way to livestock  Kazakhs have historically been very passionate about horse riding  Traditional curses and blessings invoked disease or fecundity among animals  and good manners required that a person ask first about the health of a man s livestock when greeting him and only afterward inquire about the human aspects of his life  Even today  many Kazakhs express interest in equestrianism and horse racing  Kazakhstan is home to a large number of prominent contributors to literature  science and philosophy  Abay

cycling federation  but his suspension was increased to the internationally mandated two years by the UCI  International Cycling Federation   In addition  Kashechkin was also found guilty of blood doping and was also suspended for two years  and Astana was subsequently banned from the 2008 Tour de France  At that time  Vinokourov announced his retirement  The Astana Cycling team proceeded under new management and continued to include Kazakhstan riders in the Grand Tours of cycling  although race leadership of the team passed to the Spaniard Alberto Contador and the Americans Lance Armstrong
