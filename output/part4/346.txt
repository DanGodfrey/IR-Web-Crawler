s plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed  Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise   November 2010  Curtis Connors was born in Coral Gables  Florida  He was a gifted surgeon who enlisted in the U S  Army and was sent off to war  He performed emergency battlefield surgery on wounded GIs  but his right arm was injured in a blast and had to be amputated  2  3  After his return to civilian life as a research technologist  Connors became obsessed with uncovering the secrets of reptilian limb regeneration and studied reptilian biology extensively  Working from his home in the Florida Everglades with the help of war buddy Ted Sallis  he finally developed an experimental serum taken from reptilian DNA  3  He successfully regrew the missing limb of a rabbit and then  despite the warnings of his wife Martha  chose to test it on himself  Connors ingested the formula and his missing arm did indeed grow back  The formula had a side effect  Connors was subsequently transformed into a reptilian humanoid monster  Spider Man discovered this situation during a trip to Florida to investigate newspaper reports of the Lizard after the Bugle challenged him  Spider Man was then able to use Connors  notes to create an antidote to restore him to his human form and mentality  2  Another attempt to develop this serum for safe use again resulted in Connors transforming into the Lizard  but on this occasion he was saved thanks to his former colleague Professor Charles Xavier and his first team of X Men  Beast and Angel tracking the Lizard down in the swamps so that Iceman could send him into hibernation long enough to develop a cure  4  Later  Curt Connors relocated to New York City  He was able to repay Spider Man by developing a formula to save May Parker s life after Peter Parker had given his aunt his radioactive blood during a transfusion  unintentionally putting her in mortal peril  5  It later became clear that the success of Connors  apparent cure from the Lizard persona was short lived  A repeating pattern occurred  with stress or a chemical reaction turning Connors into the Lizard  Spider Man fighting him  and then forming some kind of temporary cure to reverse the transformation until the next time  A second personality had formed with the Lizard  one with the familiar goal shared by many villains of taking over the world  The Lizard envisioned a world where all humans had been transformed into  or replaced by  super reptiles like himself  Despite the Lizard s overall hatred of humans  he was often shown to be unwilling to harm his wife Martha or young son Billy  As Connors  he aided Spider Man in defeating the Rhino by developing a formula to dissolve the Rhino s costume  but accidentally transformed himself into the Lizard due to exposure to the chemicals needed to create the formula   some of which had been used to create the Lizard serum   and was restored by Spider Man  6  Connors was later kidnapped and forced to create a rejuvenation serum for Silvermane  7  However  the stress from this caused Connors to transform  the Lizard battled Spider Man and the Human Torch  and was then restored to normal once again by Spider Man  8  During another encounter with Spider Man after Peter s attempts to remove his powers resulted in him growing four extra arms  a bite from Morbius endowed the Lizard with Connors  personality via the infection of a strange enzyme  Connors then synthesized an antidote for himself and Spider Man using the Morbius enzyme  9  Curt Connors later aided Spider Man  Ka Zar  and the Black Panther against Stegron  10  After the apparent death of the Jackal  Dr  Connors determined that Spider Man was not a clone  11  Later  the Lizard battled with Stegron and Spider Man after Stegron kidnapped Billy Connors  12  For a time  Peter Parker worked as a teaching assistant to Dr  Connors at Empire State University  although Connors had no idea that Peter was actually Spider Man  13  14  During the first of the Secret Wars  the Lizard refused to participate on either side of the conflict  Although he was collected by the Beyonder along with other villains  he broke away from the main group after the first battle to settle in a swamp  where he befriended the Wasp  who had helped him treat an injury he sustained in the first battle  After the Lizard was blasted by the magic of the Enchantress  he reverted back to human form  15  After Connors  return from this event  his wife took their son Billy and separated from Curt  The Lizard had apparently been affected by inter dimensional teleportation so that Connors  mind presided over the Lizard  and battled the Owl alongside Spider Man  16  However  mystical activity during the Inferno crisis once again brought the Lizard s bestial nature to the fore  and Spider Man cured him again  17  Connors then tried to straighten out his life and control the Lizard  with some degree of success  This ended when the villain Calypso used her voodoo magic to take control of the Lizard  during the Torment storyline  for her own purposes  reducing him to a mindless savage state  After a series of bloody battles  the Lizard and Calypso were defeated by Spider Man  and Spider Man assumed that he perished under Calypso s spell  18  Connors once again gained control of the Lizard s mind and body  although it was very weak  Curt carried out a plan to cure himself temporarily  19  after which he voluntarily submitted to incarceration in the supervillain prison  the Vault  20  When Calypso forced the transformation and attempted to control the Lizard once again  the creature killed her and escaped from the Vault  After this escape  the Lizard fell into a quicksand pit during a battle with Spider Man and the bounty hunter Warrant and was believed to have died  21  This would soon be proven incorrect  Shortly after Connors  apparent death in quicksand during the Lizard s battle with Spider Man and Warrant  a huge bestial Lizard appeared  22  Spider Man  Ben Reilly  realized that not only had the Lizard survived  but this new monstrous transformation seemed to be permanent and the personality of Curt Connors appeared completely lost  However  when this savage mindless Lizard later unexpectedly encountered Dr  Connors himself  Curt became the true Lizard once again and saved his family by killing the  Lizard clone   It was revealed that the Lizard clone was a scientific accident resulting from an experimental formula being tested on a piece of the original Lizard s tail  which had then grown into a fully formed second creature  23  Although reunited after Curt s apparent death  tragedy later struck again in the Connors family   this time for Martha and Billy  Both mother and son were diagnosed with cancer after years exposed to carcinogens from living near an industrial lab of the Monnano Corporation in Florida  Spider Man assisted Curt in successfully forcing Monnano to admit their environmental culpability  However  Martha succumbed to the cancer and died  24  Billy recovered but remained bitter towards his father  Curt s guilt and internalized anger at these events eventually led him to become the Lizard and attack Spider Man once again  After reverting back to his human form  Curt purposefully attempted a bank robbery so he would be sent to prison  25  Curt s stint in prison was short lived  he was released and transformed into the Lizard once again as part of a scheme by Norman Osborn  also known as the Green Goblin  to form the  Sinister Twelve  to kill Spider Man  The Sinister Twelve were defeated and captured by the combined forces of Daredevil  the Fantastic Four  and certain members of the Avengers  26  The Lizard later resurfaced to face Spider Man with the aid of a smaller twin of himself  who was revealed to be none other than his son  Billy  Curt had injected Billy with the Lizard formula while under the influence of a mysterious meteorite that caused savage behavior in those within range of its radiation  27  Both the Lizard and  Lizard Junior  were eventually captured and transformed back to human form  but the fact that Billy can also transform into a lizard has never been mentioned since  A heretofore unseen version of the Sinister Six including the Lizard appeared briefly during the superhero Civil War  but were stopped by Captain America and his Secret Avengers  28  Since the Lizard was never a member of the original Sinister Six  the circumstances of his involvement with this short lived group of villains has yet to be revealed  Post Civil War  Doctor Curt Connors aided Spider Man in developing a cure for the victims of Calvin Zabo  also known as Mister Hyde  who were mutated with unstable versions of Spider Man s powers  29  Dr  Connors has also monitored the progress of the hero Komodo  a female grad student who stole a sample of Connors  Lizard formula  She modified the formula for her own DNA to grow back her missing legs and to give herself reptilian powers  30  Dr  Curt Connors appeared in the Brand New Day comic storyline  but not as the Lizard  Connors was shown experimenting with animal stem cells as well as aiding forensic specialist Carlie Cooper  31  A new villain named Freak mistok Connors stem cells experiment for drugs  So Curt helped Spider Man defeat him during their second encounter  volume  amp  issue needed  During The Gauntlet storyline  Connors is shown working for the pharmaceutical company Phelcorp working for executive Brian King  who often antagonistically berates Connors in his lab  Connors has also lost custody of his son  Billy  who has also become emotionally distant from his father   As his life has gone into a downward spiral  he sometimes hears a bestial inner monologue  telling him to violently take what is his  The last straw is when his lab assistant that he s attracted to ends up sleeping with Brian King  Connors runs into his office to get a green vial  Brian King accuses Connors of trying to take his Lizard serum  so he prevents him from taking it  Connors tells King that it is actually a Lizard suppressant before he transforms into the Lizard and eats Brian King  32  When Peter Parker calls up Carlie Cooper for a date  she declines stating that the Lizard is on a rampage  Peter changes into his Spider Man costume and goes after the Lizard  knowing that he will go after Billy  He swings to the house of Billy Connors and starts to fight Lizard  but the Lizard unexpectedly just leaves  with Connors  inner voice pleading for Spider Man to follow him   making Spider Man check on Billy  However  Billy was kidnapped  and his foster parents attacked by Ana Kravinoff  The Lizard finds Billy  left in an alley by Ana  and eats his own child  utterly destroying the presence of Dr  Connors in the process  which is implied to be part of the Kravinoff s plans  33  Spider Man gets EMTs to the foster parents  and then heads off for the Lizard  finding Billy s body  He then finds the Lizard  who has shed his skin and has a new form  This form is leaner  sporting spikes on its right forearm  having what appears to be long brown hair  is smarter than any previous form of the Lizard  and has new telepathic abilities allowing him to connect to the  lizard part  of the human brain demonstrating this by making Spider Man think he s prey  and running away  While hiding in the sewers  the Lizard then makes a group of people in the city act on their  lizard  part of the brain  taking what they want mindlessly  34  Spider Man returns from Curt s lab with the formula Connors was using to keep the Lizard in control and drinks it making himself immune to the Lizard s new powers  He also spits some of it in the Lizard s mouth and injects the Lizard with two more vials of it  He then attempts to convince the Lizard this is wrong  but he is attacked by the civilians under the Lizard s control  Suddenly  he is pulled out by the Lizard  who then reveals he regrets what he has done and that he believes there is more in life than just killing  the sudden change of perspective is revealed to happen because when he destroyed Dr  Curt Connors  personality  some emotions were passed to him  He then leaves into the night  35  During the Origin of the Species storyline  Lizard is among the supervillains invited to join Doctor Octopus  supervillain team  where he promises them a reward in exchange for securing some specific items for him  36  When Spider Man caught Chameleon at the Kravinoff Mansion after he had stolen Menace s baby  Chameleon reveals that the Lizard had stolen the baby before it could be passed off to Dr  Octopus  37  When Doctor Octopus and Spider Man fight within Lizard s hideout  the Lizard attacks Spider Man  Spider Man threatens to attack the Lizard with the Lizard serum if he doesn t give him the baby  Lizard agrees and reveals that he got a blood sample from the baby and found out that Norman Osborn is not the father  The Lizard then gives the baby to Spider Man  saying that if Osborn is not the father  then the baby is of no use to him  Doctor Octopus then attacks the Lizard while Spider Man escapes with the baby  38  While investigating recent kidnappings in New York  the X Men find themselves working with Spider Man after they discover that the abductor is the Lizard  who has been taking victims of bullying or abuse off the streets to turn them into others like him  as well as maintaining his control over the city s preexisting reptile population  39  The X Men and Spider Man soon discover that Lizard is being used by the Dark Beast  who has found a way to enhance the Lizard s control of the reptilian part of the human brain to mutate those within range into lizard like creatures  40  Although Gambit  Storm  and Wolverine are all mutated by this process  Emma Frost and Spider Man escape being affected by the machinery used   Emma Frost was in her diamond form and Spider Man was outside the shielded room that the other X Men were in when the process was triggered   allowing them to release the Lizard and use him to defeat his captor  the Lizard subsequently retreating into the sewers while the X Men and Spider Man reverse the process and take Dark Beast into custody  41  The Lizard has since been revealed to be apparently working with Morbius to develop a cure to their respective conditions  42   edit  Powers and abilities Doctor Curtis Connors gave himself superhuman powers as a result of exposure to mutagenic chemicals  allowing him to transform into the Lizard  In human form  he has none of his superhuman powers  but he is highly intelligent and a well known scientist in fields of genetics  biochemistry  and herpetology  When Connors is transformed into the Lizard  his strength is increased to superhuman levels  Likewise  his speed  stamina  agility  and reflexes are also raised to a level equivalent to that of Spider Man  He can also scale walls using a combination of his sharp claws and micro scales on his hands and feet that create molecular friction like those of a gecko lizard  He is highly resistant to injury due to his thick scaly hide  allowing him to resist punctures and lacerations from ordinary weapons and lower caliber firearms  In addition  the Lizard has highly enhanced healing abilities which allow him to quickly recover from grievous wounds  including regenerating lost limbs  He also has a powerful tail which he can whip at high speeds  The Lizard has razor sharp teeth set in muscular jaws that can deal a lethal bite  Like a reptile  he has cold blooded characteristics and is therefore sensitive to drops in temperature  a sufficiently cold environment will cause his metabolism to slow drastically and become dormant if he is exposed to cold temperatures for too long  The Lizard can mentally communicate and command all reptiles within a mile of himself via limited telepathy  He has also on at least one occasion secreted powerful pheromones which caused nearby humans to behave violently  Post Brand New Day  a further enhancement of his telepathy granted him the power of telepathically compelling humans to act out their primal urges  by suppressing emotional control in their amygdala  the  lizard brain    volume  amp  issue needed  Based on various physiological and environmental factors  the Lizard s intelligence can range from bestial and animalistic to normal human intelligence  The Lizard personality has most often manifested with human intelligence  capable of speech and higher reasoning  although some versions have been more feral than others  During the Secret Wars in particular  he appeared less ruthless than his normal portrayal  showing concern for Volcana 43  and the Wasp 44  after they showed him kindness despite his usual disdain for humans  However  the Lizard is rarely as intelligent as Dr  Connors is in human form  showing on many occasions an inability to understand his human self s work and use it to further his own ends despite his best efforts  45  The Lizard has apparently  destroyed  the Curt Connors persona  but has subsequently begun to display some of Connors s human emotions  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Continuity In a 2004 story arc entitled Lizard s Tale  written by Paul Jenkins in the Spectacular Spider Man comic book  it was revealed that the Lizard persona was not a separate personality from Dr  Connors after all   Curt had been consciously controlling his reptilian alter ego all along  Furthermore  Connors was shown to know that Peter Parker was Spider Man  despite the discovery of the secret identity never being explained or depicted  The story ended with Dr  Connors deliberately getting himself sent to prison and hoping the Lizard wouldn t be unleashed again  The Lizard s next appearance after this was as a member of the Sinister Twelve  where he showed no indication of being controlled by the mind of Dr  Connors  To date  there have been no subsequent comic storylines referencing the claim that Connors himself was responsible for the Lizard s villainy  and post Brand New Day appearances explicitly present the two personalities as separate  Another continuity related issue involves Connors  son Billy  Unlike many other Marvel Comics children  he had not appreciably grown up since the comics  stories of the 1960s  Billy s visible age also seemed to waver back and forth between approximately eight and thirteen years old  depending on the particular comic artist drawing the character   edit  Other versions  edit  Ultimate Lizard Ultimate Lizard appears in a dream sequence  as drawn by Mark Bagley in Ultimate Spider Man  60  The one comic storyline to date featuring the Ultimate Marvel universe version of the Lizard appeared in Ultimate Marvel Team Up   10  The character has appeared in a few subsequent issues of Ultimate Spider Man  but only in flashbacks and dream sequences  Ultimate Lizard appears to be based on a basilisk lizard in design and has been presented as being less intelligent than the original Marvel universe Lizard  In the Ultimate universe  in addition to becoming the Lizard  Dr  Curt Connors unintentionally created the Ultimate version of the supervillain Carnage using DNA from Spider Man and based on an analysis of Richard Parker s work on the Venom suit  Due to the ensuing chaos  he was arrested and Stark Industries canceled their financial support of his experiments  He was last seen in Ultimate Spider Man  127  where he  along with Tony Stark  were interviewing Gwen Stacy   Stacy Experiment   which was in fact the new Carnage   when the Triskellion was blown apart by Norman Osborn  upon his escape   edit  Exiles The reality hopping heroic team  the Exiles  once found themselves on an alternate earth where Connors  experiment  in this world for a left arm rather than a right  had taken a different turn  Finding himself as the Lizard  Curt felt the need to  reproduce  by immediately injecting the Lizard formula into other people  He infected his family and they infected others  all feeling the urge to spread the transformation into Lizard men  The forces of this particular world eventually managed to restrain the infected reptile people behind miles long  man made walls  46   edit  Marvel 1602 In this reality  Curtis Connors is a philosopher who was infected with the bubonic plague  He created an elixir that transformed him into a reptilian creature that resembled a Velociraptor  but retained his mind  He worked with Baron Victor Octavius to capture the Spider  He is this world s Lizard  47   edit  Marvel Noir In the Marvel Noir reality  Curt Connors is an assistant to Dr  Otto Octavious  48   edit  Marvel Zombies In Marvel Zombies  the Lizard  like almost every other hero and villain  has become a zombie  This particular incarnation of the Lizard is apparently destroyed when he is blasted apart by several cosmic powered heroes while fighting Galactus  49   edit  MC2 The Connors Family appear in the first story of the Mr  and Mrs  Spider Man series  set in the MC2 universe  Mary Jane comforts a distraught Martha when Curt goes missing again  whilst Peter  now a parent to his infant daughter May   Mayday    is more hesitant than before to become Spider Man  He is eventually encouraged by his wife to track down and prevent the Lizard s latest rampage  50   edit  In other media  edit  Television The Lizard appears in the 1967 Spider Man episode  Where Crawls the Lizard   voiced by Gillie Fenwick  The animated Lizard in this episode was referred to as  Lizard Man   and the family is named  Conner  instead of  Connors   Also  Dr  Connors is depicted as having both of his arms in the episode  most likely to avoid the topic of amputation in a children s cartoon  his serum was intended to cure  swamp fever    Dr  Curt Conner later appears in  Fountain of Terror   where he finds the Fountain of Youth and ends up held prisoner by someone that looks like Juan Ponce de Le n before Spider Man appears and the Fountain of Youth is accidentally destroyed  Spider Man managed to rescue him after defeating Harley Clivendon  In  Conner s Reptiles   the Lizard appears again  This time  it s not Dr  Curt Conner  but one of his experimental alligators with increased intelligence that abducted Curt Conner  This episode only uses footage from  Where Crawls the Lizard   just changing the order of scenes and the voices  The Lizard appeared in the 1981 Spider Man cartoon series episode  Lizards  Lizards  Everywhere   voiced by Corey Burton  However  there was no mention of Dr  Curt Connors in the episode and the Lizard is presented as a monster villain with no alter ego  The Lizard in the  Night of the Lizard  episode of Spider Man  The Animated Series  The Lizard first appears in the Spider Man  The Animated Series episode  Night of the Lizard   voiced by Joseph Campanella  Here  the Lizard was portrayed as possessing a genius level of intelligence but also having the savage mindset from the comics  In his first appearance  Dr  Connors transforms into the Lizard after using himself as a test subject with lizard DNA to regrow his arm  He then abducted his wife Margaret and carried her into the sewers in order to help complete his plan to turn New York into lizards  but he was defeated by Spider Man and returned to his human form  Curt Connors had many other appearances throughout this series as a supporting character  In  Tablet of Time  and  The Ravages of Time   Dr  Connors turned into the Lizard again during the point when Silvermane obtained the Tablet of Time  In  The Final Nightmare   Connors objected to Farley Stillwell s destruction on the database  as he needs it for a cure at the time when Spider Man was fighting Scorpion and Vulture  When Farley Stillwell asks what cure  Curt Connors turns into the Lizard and attacks Farley  only to be knocked down by Spider Man  In  The Lizard King   some of Curt Connor s chemicals mutated some sewer lizards into humanoid lizards that plot to abduct Curt Connors  When Curt Connors turns into the Lizard  they make him their king causing Margaret and Mary Jane to turn to Debra Whitman to help create a cure  A mutated lizard named Gila didn t want to go by the lizardmen s goals anymore and was able to set off the device restoring Lizard and the Lizardmen to their true forms  In the three part episode  Secret Wars   Beyonder abducted Lizard as one of the villains to be placed on a peaceful alien planet  When Spider Man assembled the Fantastic Four  Captain America  Iron Man  and Storm  Lizard attacked the base and was repelled only for Lizard to be attacked by the local giant sandworms  When Lizard was rendered unconscious by the attack and the base was repowered by Storm s lightning  Iron Man and Mister Fantastic managed to use a machine to activate the dormant part of Lizard s mind enabling the Curt Connors part of the mind to be awakened  The Lizard also appeared in the Spider Man  The New Animated Series episode  Law of the Jungle   voiced by rock musician filmmaker Rob Zombie  The Lizard s physical appearance in this series was much more animalistic and saurian than the comic book version  In this episode  Connors is revealed to have lost his arm as a result of an Oscorp Industries weapons testing accident  Wide Area Explosive Fragmentation Round aka WAFER   This version of Dr  Connors is more serious and colder than other versions  When he transforms into the Lizard  he becomes aggressive and feral but maintains his ability to talk  He goes after Harry Osborn as revenge for the loss of his arm  During the battle between him and Spider Man  his arm is again cut off  At one point  Spider Man dangles the Lizard from a web while attached to a helicopter  Spidey tries to reason with him but the Lizard strikes out  cutting the web and causing the reptilian menace to fall to his apparent death  The Lizard in The Spectacular Spider Man animated series  The Lizard first appears in The Spectacular Spider Man episode  Natural Selection   with Dr  Curt Connors and Lizard voiced by Dee Bradley Baker  In the Lizard s first appearance on the third episode he can t talk  yet he was also acting purely on animalistic instincts  The Lizard  however  is extremely aggressive  shown attacking with little or no provocation  and even coming close to biting Billy  One key difference from usual media is that Dr  Connors has a fully functioning  mechanical prosthetic arm  Being a research technologist at the lab at the university Eddie Brock attends  Connors is obsessed with uncovering the secrets of reptilian limb regeneration and creates a serum made of modified lizard DNA  injecting himself with it frequently to help re grow his arm  In a previous battle between Spider Man and Electro  one of the vials is hit by Electro s electricity  amplifying the DNA within the serum  As a result of injecting the altered serum  Connors  arm re grows as he hoped  However  Connors is subsequently transformed into the Lizard over time  An antidote developed by Martha Connors  who is also a scientist in this version  manages to restore Curt to his human form and mentality  In the episode  Blueprints   the science department gains Miles Warren as a new member when Norman Osborn funds the research  In the episode  Subtext   Conners discovers that Warren has been conducting mutagenic experiments on human test subjects  he threatens to inform the school board only for Warren to blackmail him with his own lizard experiments  In the episode  Final Curtain   Curt and Martha decide to leave New York for Florida   edit  Films Dr  Connors appears in the 2002 2007 Spider Man film trilogy  Dr  Connors was mentioned briefly in the film Spider Man  2002  as Peter s laboratory supervisor who fired him for being late  Connors appeared in the sequels Spider Man 2  2004  and Spider Man 3  2007   where he was played by actor Dylan Baker  Dr  Connors did not become the Lizard in this franchise  In the films  he is missing his right arm as in the comic book  In Spider Man 2  Connors is depicted as a Columbia University physics professor concerned for Peter Parker s well being and academic performance in his quantum mechanics course  Peter is seen studying with several textbooks for this course  two of which can be made out as quantum mechanics and photonics books  Curt s friend  Doctor Otto Octavius  recalls Peter s name and tells Peter that Connors considers him  brilliant  but lazy   Otto chuckles about his friend s assumption regarding Peter s laziness once he finds out Peter is also Spider Man  Baker reprises his role in Spider Man 3  In the film  Peter turns to Connors to analyze the substance of the Venom symbiote and Connors informs him that it makes one more aggressive and that it has a particular liking for him  At one point during this scene  Connors says   I m a physicist  not a biologist   which contradicts the origins of Connors  lizard

role in the game  trapped behind a cage in the NYC sewers  A group of lizardmen that he created serves as antagonists  and the Lizard reveals that Venom had taken control over them and imprisoned him

supposed to have been included in this particular video game and was even prominently featured in some promotional materials before being suddenly removed  However  there are some hints that the Lizard was still going to be in the game  such as the use of green  his alter ego s color  in his lab  Doctor Octopus breaking Dr  Connors arm  and the reptile like creatures that appear in the Fight Area  possibly these creatures were going to be the Lizard s version of thugs   The Hex Editor shows there is a skin named Lizard  There is even a sewer entrance which looks like it could be entered  There was speculation that the character had been removed from the game because at the time he was being considered for use in the future Spider Man 3 film  but this was never confirmed  This is jokingly referred to in one of the hint icons in the game  The Lizard did appear as a level boss in the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game  where his appearance in cutscenes matches his Ultimate version  though his in game sprite resembles his traditional appearance  It should be noted that Lizard s supposed minions found in the boss arena are also hinted in Mysterio s fun house
