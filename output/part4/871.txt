facility  Universal Studios Hollywood  which is a working film and television studio that became a tourist attraction and theme park  Universal Studios Florida was designed as both a theme park and a studio from the start  It was also the first time that Universal Studios had constructed an amusement park  from the ground up   The previous entrance to the  Jaws  ride was a popular photo spot at the time  This attraction was located in the park s former  Amity  area from 1990 until 2012  A major component of the original park in Hollywood is its studio tour  which featured several special effects exhibits and encounters built into the tour  such as an attack by the great white shark from the film Jaws  For its Florida park  Universal Studios took the concepts of the Hollywood tour scenes and developed them into larger  stand alone attractions  As an example  in Hollywood  the studio tour trams travel close to a shoreline and are  attacked  by Jaws before they travel to the next part of the tour  In Florida  guests entered the  Jaws  attraction and would board a boat touring the fictitious Amity Harbor  where they encountered the shark  then exited back into the park at the conclusion of the attraction  Universal Studios Florida originally had a Studio Tour attraction that visited the production facilities  but that tour has since been discontinued  Over the years  Universal Studios Florida has not limited itself to attractions based on its own vast film library  It has occasionally licensed popular characters from other rival studios  many of whom did not operate theme parks themselves  Some examples include the Ghostbusters and the Men in Black  from Sony s Columbia Pictures   Jimmy Neutron  from Viacom s Nickelodeon   The Simpsons  20th Century Fox   and Shrek  from DreamWorks Animation  now part of Paramount Pictures   Many of the park s past and present attractions were developed with the actual creators of the films they were based on  and feature the original stars as part of the experience  Steven Spielberg  a co founder for the park  helped create E T  Adventure and was a creative consultant for Back to the Future  The Ride  Twister   Ride it Out  An American Tail Theatre  Jaws and Men in Black  Alien Attack  Many of the original stars reprised their film roles including Christopher Lloyd and Thomas F  Wilson in Back to the Future  The Ride  Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt in Twister   Ride it Out  Rip Torn and Will Smith in Men in Black  Alien Attack  Brendan Fraser for Revenge of the Mummy  The Ride  Christopher Walken and Dwayne Johnson in Disaster   the cast from Shrek returned for Shrek 4 D  various Nicktoons voice actors reprised their roles in Jimmy Neutron s Nicktoon Blast  Roy Scheider recorded a voice over for the conclusion of Jaws  William Hanna and Joseph Barbera made appearances in The Funtastic World of Hanna Barbera while Hanna Barbera voice actors reprised their roles in the same ride  Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins appeared in Alfred Hitchcock  The Art of Making Movies  Arnold Schwarzenegger  Edward Furlong and Linda Hamilton reprised their roles for Terminator 2  3 D Battle Across Time and even Charlton Heston made an appearance in the pre show for Earthquake  The Big One   edit  Timeline 1980 1989  1982  The first concepts for Universal Studios Florida  including a King Kong based ride
