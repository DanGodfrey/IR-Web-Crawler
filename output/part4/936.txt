Puberty From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search  Pubescent  redirects here  For the botanical term  see Leaf Surface  For animal puberty  see Sexual maturity  Puberty is the process of physical changes by which a child s body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction to enable fertilisation  It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads  the ovaries in a girl  the testes in a boy  In response to the signals  the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth  function  and transformation of the brain  bones  muscle  blood  skin  hair  breasts  and sexual organs  Physical growth height and weight accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when the child has developed an adult body  Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities  the pre pubertal  physical differences between boys and girls are the genitalia  the penis and the vagina  The major landmark of puberty for males is the first ejaculation  which occurs on average at age 13  1  For females  it is menarche  the onset of menstruation  which occurs on average between ages 12 and 13  2  3  4  5  In the 21st century  the average age at which children reach puberty is lower compared to the 19th century  when it was 15 for girls and 16 for boys  This is possibly due to chemicals in food items or a better nutrition  6  Notable among the morphologic changes in size  shape  composition  and functioning of the pubertal body  is the development of secondary sex characteristics  the  filling in  of the child s body  from girl to woman  from boy to man  Derived from the Latin puberatum  age of maturity   the word puberty describes the physical changes to sexual maturation  not the psychosocial and cultural maturation denoted by the term  adolescent development  in Western culture  wherein adolescence is the period of mental transition from childhood to adulthood  which overlaps much of the body s period of puberty

boys are the age at which it begins  and the major sex steroids involved  Approximate outline of development periods in child and teenager development  Puberty is marked in green at right  Although there is a wide range of normal ages  girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11  boys at age 12 or 13  8  9  Girls usually complete puberty by ages 15 17  9  10  11  while boys usually complete puberty by ages 16 18  9  10  12  Any increase in height beyond the post pubertal age is uncommon  Girls attain reproductive maturity about 4 years after the first physical changes of puberty appear  11  In contrast  boys accelerate more slowly but continue to grow for about 6 years after the first visible pubertal changes  13  1 Follicle stimulating hormone   FSH 2 Luteinizing hormone   LH 3 Progesterone 4 Estrogen 5 Hypothalamus 6 Pituitary gland 7 Ovary 8 Pregnancy   hCG  Human chorionic gonadotropin  9 Testosterone 10 Testicle 11 Incentives 12 Prolactin   PRL For boys  an androgen called testosterone is the principal sex hormone  While testosterone produces all boys  changes characterized as virilization  a substantial product of testosterone metabolism in males is estradiol  though levels rise later and more slowly than in girls  The male  growth spurt  also begins later  accelerates more slowly  and lasts longer before the epiphyses fuse  Although boys are on average 2 cm shorter than girls before puberty begins  adult men are on average about 13 cm  5 2 inches  taller than women  Most of this sex difference in adult heights is attributable to a later onset of the growth spurt and a slower progression to completion  a direct result of the later rise and lower adult male levels of estradiol  14  The hormone that dominates female development is an estrogen called estradiol  While estradiol promotes growth of breasts and uterus  it is also the principal hormone driving the pubertal growth spurt and epiphyseal maturation and closure  15  Estradiol levels rise earlier and reach higher levels in women than in men  Puberty onset The onset of puberty is associated with high GnRH pulsing  which precedes the rise in sex hormones  LH and FSH  16  Exogenous GnRH pulses cause the onset of puberty  17  Brain tumors which increase GnRH output may also lead to premature puberty  18  The cause of the GnRH rise is unknown  Leptin might be the cause of the GnRH rise  Leptin has receptors in the hypothalamus which synthesizes GnRH  19  Individuals who are deficient in leptin fail to initiate puberty  20  The levels of leptin increase with the onset of puberty  and then decline to adult levels when puberty is completed  The rise in GnRH might also be caused by genetics  A study 21  discovered that a mutation in genes encoding both Neurokinin B as well as the Neurokinin B receptor can alter the timing of puberty  The researchers hypothesized that Neurokinin B might play a role in regulating the secretion of Kisspeptin  a compound responsible for triggering direct release of GnRH as well as indirect release of LH and FSH  Physical changes in boys This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help

testicular enlargement is the first physical manifestation of puberty  and is termed gonadarche   22 Testes in prepubertal boys change little in size from about 1 year of age to the onset of puberty  averaging about 2 3 cm in length and about 1 5 2 cm in width  Testicular size continues to increase throughout puberty  reaching maximal adult size about 6 years after the onset of puberty  After the boy s testicles have enlarged and developed for about one year  the length and then the breadth of the shaft of the penis will increase and the glans penis and corpora cavernosa will also start to enlarge to adult proportions  23  While 18 20 cm3 is an average adult size  there is wide variation in testicular size in the normal population  24  The testes have two primary functions  to produce hormones and to produce sperm  The Leydig cells produce testosterone  which in turn produces most of the male pubertal changes  Most of the increasing bulk of testicular tissue is spermatogenic tissue  primarily Sertoli and Leydig cells   Sperm can be detected in the morning urine of most boys after the first year of pubertal changes  and occasionally earlier citation needed   On average  potential fertility in boys is reached at 13 years old  but full fertility will not be gained until 14 16 years of age citation needed   During puberty  a male s scrotum will become larger and begin to dangle or hang below the body as opposed to being up tight  This is to accommodate the testicles to hang lower whereby the testicles need a certain temperature to be fertile and produce sperm  This is more commonly known as  balls dropping   Morning wood and random or unwanted erections Erections during sleep or when waking up are medically known as nocturnal penile tumescence and more commonly known as morning wood  25  The penis can regularly get erect during sleep and men or boys often wake up with an erection  26  Once a boy reaches his teenage years  erections occur much more frequently due to puberty  27  Erections can occur spontaneously at any time of day  and if clothed may cause a bulge or  hump   This can be disguised or hidden by wearing close fitting underwear  a long shirt and baggier clothes  28  Male erections are common for children and infants  and can even occur before birth  29  Spontaneous erections are also known as involuntary or unwanted erections and are normal  Such erections can be embarrassing if they happen in public  such as a classroom or living room  30  31  Foreskin retraction During puberty  if not before  the tip and opening of a boy s foreskin becomes wider  progressively allowing for retraction down the shaft of the penis and behind the glans  which ultimately should be possible without pain or difficulty  The membrane that bonds the inner surface of the foreskin with the glans disintegrates and releases the foreskin to separate from the glans  The foreskin then gradually becomes retractable  32  Research in 1968 by Danish pediatrician Jakob  ster found that with the onset and continuation of puberty  the proportion of boys able to pull back their foreskins increased  At ages 12 13   ster found that only 60  of boys were able to retract their foreskins  this increased to 85  at ages 14 15  and 95  by 16 17 years old  He also found that only 1  of those unable to fully retract suffered from phimosis at ages 14 17  the remainder were partially able to  33  The findings were supported by further research by Japanese doctor Hiroyuki Kayaba et al in 1996  on a sample of over 600 boys  34  and in 2004 Ishikawa and Kawakita found that by age 15  77  of their sample of boys could retract their foreskins  35  Once a boy is able to retract his foreskin  penile hygiene should become an important feature of his routine body care  Although the American Academy of Pediatrics states there is  little evidence to affirm the association between circumcision status and optimal penile hygiene   36  various studies suggest that uncircumcised boys are educated about the role of hygiene  including retracting the foreskin while urinating and rinsing underneath it and around the glans at each bathing opportunity  Regular washing under the foreskin was found  in a 1986 study by Krueger and Osborn  to reduce the risk of numerous penile disorders  37  Pubic hair Pubic hair often appears on a boy shortly after the genitalia begin to grow  The pubic hairs are usually first visible at the dorsal  abdominal  base of the penis  The first few hairs are described as stage 2  Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6 12 months  when the hairs are too many to count  By stage 4  the pubic hairs densely fill the  pubic triangle   Stage 5 refers to the spread of pubic hair to the thighs and upward towards the navel as part of the developing abdominal hair  Body and facial hair Facial hair of a male  In the months and years following the appearance of pubic hair  other areas of skin that respond to androgens may develop androgenic hair  The usual sequence is  underarm  axillary  hair  perianal hair  upper lip hair  sideburn  preauricular  hair  periareolar hair  and the beard area  9  As with most human biological processes  this specific order may vary among some individuals  Arm  leg  chest  abdominal  and back hair become heavier more gradually  There is a large range in amount of body hair among adult men  and significant differences in timing and quantity of hair growth among different racial groups  8  Facial hair is often present in late adolescence  but may not appear until significantly later  38  39  Facial hair will continue to get coarser  darker and thicker for another 2 4 years after puberty  38  Some men do not develop full facial hair for up to 10 years after the completion of puberty  38  Chest hair may appear during puberty or years after  8  Not all men have chest hair  Voice change and Adam s apple  Squeaky voiced teen  redirects here  For the fictional character  see Squeaky Voiced Teen  The Simpsons   Main article  Voice break Under the influence of androgens  the voice box  or larynx  grows in both sexes  This growth is far more prominent in boys  causing the male voice to drop and deepen  sometimes abruptly but rarely  over night   about one octave  because the longer and thicker vocal folds have a lower fundamental frequency  Before puberty  the larynx of boys and girls is about equally small  40  Occasionally  voice change is accompanied by unsteadiness of vocalization in the early stages of untrained voices  Most of the voice change happens during stage 3 4 of male puberty around the time of peak growth  Full adult pitch is attained at an average age of 15 years citation needed   It usually precedes the development of significant facial hair by several months to years  Male musculature and body shape By the end of puberty  adult men have heavier bones and nearly twice as much skeletal muscle  Some of the bone growth  e g  shoulder width and jaw  is disproportionately greater  resulting in noticeably different male and female skeletal shapes  The average adult male has about 150  of the lean body mass of an average female  and about 50  of the body fat  This muscle develops mainly during the later stages of puberty  and muscle growth can continue even after boys are biologically adult  The peak of the so called  strength spurt   the rate of muscle growth  is attained about one year after a male experiences his peak growth rate  Often  the fat pads of the male breast tissue and the male nipples will develop during puberty  sometimes  especially in one breast  this becomes more apparent and is termed gynecomastia  It is usually not a permanent phenomenon  Body odor and acne Rising levels of androgens can change the fatty acid composition of perspiration  resulting in a more  adult  body odor  As in girls  another androgen effect is increased secretion of oil  sebum  from the skin and the resultant variable amounts of acne  Acne can not be prevented or diminished easily  but it typically fully diminishes at the end of puberty  However  it is not unusual for a fully grown adult to suffer the occasional bout of acne  though it is normally less severe than in adolescents  Some may desire using prescription topical creams or ointments to keep acne from getting worse  or even oral medication  due to the fact that acne is emotionally difficult and can cause scarring  Physical changes in girls Breast development The first physical sign of puberty in girls is usually a firm  tender lump under the center of the areola of one or both breasts  occurring on average at about 10 5 years of age  41  This is referred to as thelarche  By the widely used Tanner staging of puberty  this is stage 2 of breast development  stage 1 is a flat  prepubertal breast   Within six to 12 months  the swelling has clearly begun in both sides  softened  and can be felt and seen extending beyond the edges of the areolae  This is stage 3 of breast development  By another 12 months  stage 4   the breasts are approaching mature size and shape  with areolae and papillae forming a secondary mound  In most young women  this mound disappears into the contour of the mature breast  stage 5   although there is so much variation in sizes and shapes of adult breasts that stages 4 and 5 are not always separately identifiable  42  Pubic hair Pubic hair is often the second noticeable change in puberty  usually within a few months of thelarche  43  It is referred to as pubarche  The pubic hairs are usually visible first along the labia  The first few hairs are described as Tanner stage 2  42  Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6 12 months  when the hairs are too numerous to count and appear on the pubic mound as well  By stage 4  the pubic hairs densely fill the  pubic triangle   Stage 5 refers to spread of pubic hair to the thighs and sometimes as abdominal hair upward towards the navel  In about 15  of girls  the earliest pubic hair appears before breast development begins  43  Vagina  uterus  ovaries The mucosal surface of the vagina also changes in response to increasing levels of estrogen  becoming thicker and duller pink in color  in contrast to the brighter red of the prepubertal vaginal mucosa   44  Whitish secretions  physiologic leukorrhea  are a normal effect of estrogen as well  41  In the two years following thelarche  the uterus  ovaries  and the follicles in the ovaries increase in size  45  The ovaries usually contain small follicular cysts visible by ultrasound  46  47  Menstruation and fertility The first menstrual bleeding is referred to as menarche  and typically occurs about two years after thelarche  43  The average age of menarche is 12 5 in the United States  3  Most American girls experience their first period at 11  12 or 13  but some experience it earlier than their 11th birthday and others after their 14th birthday  In fact  anytime between 8 and 16 is normal  In Canada  the average age of menarche is 12 72  4  and in the United Kingdom it is 12 9  5  The time between menstrual periods  menses  is not always regular in the first two years after menarche  48 Ovulation is necessary for fertility  but may or may not accompany the earliest menses  49  In postmenarchal girls  about 80  of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche  50  in the third year and 10  in the sixth year  48  Initiation of ovulation after menarche is not inevitable  A high proportion of girls with continued irregularity in the menstrual cycle several years from menarche will continue to have prolonged irregularity and anovulation  and are at higher risk for reduced fertility  50  Nubility is used to designate achievement of fertility  Body shape  fat distribution  and body composition During this period  also in response to rising levels of estrogen  the lower half of the pelvis and thus hips widen  providing a larger birth canal   42  51  Fat tissue increases to a greater percentage of the body composition than in males  especially in the typical female distribution of breasts  hips  buttocks  thighs  upper arms  and pubis  Progressive differences in fat distribution as well as sex differences in local skeletal growth contribute to the typical female body shape by the end of puberty  On average  at 10 years  girls have 6  more body fat than boys  52  Body odor and acne Rising levels of androgens can change the fatty acid composition of perspiration  resulting in a more  adult  body odor  This often precedes thelarche and pubarche by one or more years  Another androgen effect is increased secretion of oil  sebum  from the skin  This change increases the susceptibility to acne  a skin condition that is characteristic of puberty  53  Acne varies greatly in its severity  53  Variations This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   May 2008  Timing of the onset of puberty The definition of the onset of puberty may depend on perspective  e g   hormonal versus physical  and purpose  establishing population normal standards  clinical care of early or late pubescent individuals  etc    A common definition for the onset of puberty is physical changes to a person s body  54  These physical changes are the first visible signs of neural  hormonal  and gonadal function changes  The age at which puberty begins varies between individuals  usually  puberty begins between 10 and 13 years of age  The age at which puberty begins is affected by both genetic factors and by environmental factors such as nutritional state and social circumstances  8  55  An example of social circumstances is the Vandenbergh effect  a juvenile female who has significant interaction with adult males will enter puberty earlier than juvenile females who are not socially overexposed to adult males  56  The average age at which puberty begins may be affected by race as well  For example  the average age of menarche in various populations surveyed has ranged from 12 3  4  5  to 18 years  The earliest average onset of puberty is for African American girls and the latest average onset for high altitude subsistence populations in Asia  However  much of the higher age averages reflect nutritional limitations more than genetic differences and can change within a few generations with a substantial change in diet  The median age of menarche for a population may be an index of the proportion of undernourished girls in the population  and the width of the spread may reflect unevenness of wealth and food distribution in a population  Researchers have identified an earlier age of the onset of puberty  However  they have based their conclusions on a comparison of data from 1999 with data from 1969  In the earlier example  the sample population was based on a small sample of white girls  200  from Britain   The later study identified as puberty as occurring in 48  of African American girls by age nine  and 12  of white girls by that age  57  Historical shift The average age at which the onset of puberty occurs has dropped significantly since the 1840s  58  59  60  This was dubbed  the secular trend  by J M  Tanner  In every decade from 1840 to 1950 there was a drop of four months in the average age of menarche among Western European females  In Norway  girls born in 1840 had their menarche at an average age of 17 years  In France  the average in 1840 was 15 3 years  In England  the average in 1840 was 16 5 years  In Japan the decline happened later and was then more rapid  from 1945 to 1975 in Japan there was a drop of 11 months per decade  A 2006 study in Denmark found that puberty  as evidenced by breast development  started at an average age of 9 years and 10 months  a year earlier than when a similar study was done in 1991  Scientists believe the phenomenon could be linked to obesity or exposure to chemicals in the food chain  and is putting girls at greater long term risk of breast cancer  61  Genetic influence and environmental factors Various studies have found direct genetic effects to account for at least 46  of the variation of timing of puberty in well nourished populations  62  63  64  65  The genetic association of timing is strongest between mothers and daughters  The specific genes affecting timing are not yet known  62  Among the candidates is an androgen receptor gene  66  Researchers 67  have hypothesized that early puberty onset may be caused by certain hair care products containing estrogen or placenta  and by certain chemicals  namely phthalates  which are used in many cosmetics  toys  and plastic food containers  If genetic factors account for half of the variation of pubertal timing  environment factors are clearly important as well  One of the first observed environmental effects is that puberty occurs later in children raised at higher altitudes  The most important of the environmental influences is clearly nutrition  but a number of others have been identified  all which affect timing of female puberty and menarche more clearly than male puberty  Hormones and steroids There is theoretical concern  and animal evidence  that environmental hormones and chemicals may affect aspects of prenatal or postnatal sexual development in humans  68  Large amounts of incompletely metabolized estrogens and progestagens from pharmaceutical products are excreted into the sewage systems of large cities  and are sometimes detectable in the environment  Sex steroids are sometimes used in cattle farming but have been banned in chicken meat production for 40 years  Although agricultural laws regulate use to minimize accidental human consumption  the rules are largely self enforced in the United States  Significant exposure of a child to hormones or other substances that activate estrogen or androgen receptors could produce some or all of the changes of puberty  Harder to detect as an influence on puberty are the more diffusely distributed environmental chemicals like PCBs  polychlorinated biphenyl   which can bind and trigger estrogen receptors  More obvious degrees of partial puberty from direct exposure of young children to small but significant amounts of pharmaceutical sex steroids from exposure at home may be detected during medical evaluation for precocious puberty  but mild effects and the other potential exposures outlined above would not  Bisphenol A  BPA  is a chemical used to make plastics  and is frequently used to make baby bottles  water bottles  sports equipment  medical devices  and as a coating in food and beverage cans  Scientists are concerned about BPA s behavioral effects on fetuses  infants  and children at current exposure levels because it can affect the prostate gland  mammary gland  and lead to early puberty in girls  BPA mimics and interferes with the action of estrogen an important reproduction and development regulator  It leaches out of plastic into liquids and foods  and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  found measurable amounts of BPA in the bodies of more than 90 percent of the U S  population studied  The highest estimated daily intakes of BPA occur in infants and children  Many plastic baby bottles contain BPA  and BPA is more likely to leach out of plastic when its temperature is increased  as when one warms a baby bottle or warms up food in the microwave  69  Nutritional influence Nutritional factors are the strongest and most obvious environmental factors affecting timing of puberty  62  Girls are especially sensitive to nutritional regulation because they must contribute all of the nutritional support to a growing fetus  Surplus calories  beyond growth and activity requirements  are reflected in the amount of body fat  which signals to the brain the availability of resources for initiation of puberty and fertility  Much evidence suggests that for most of the last few centuries  nutritional differences accounted for majority of variation of pubertal timing in different populations  and even among social classes in the same population  Recent worldwide increased consumption of animal protein  other changes in nutrition  and increases in childhood obesity have resulted in falling ages of puberty  mainly in those populations with the higher previous ages  In many populations the amount of variation attributable to nutrition is shrinking  Although available dietary energy  simple calories  is the most important dietary influence on timing of puberty  quality of the diet plays a role as well  Lower protein intakes and higher dietary fiber intakes  as occur with typical vegetarian diets  are associated with later onset and slower progression of female puberty  Obesity influence and exercise Scientific researchers have linked early obesity with an earlier onset of puberty in girls  They have cited obesity as a cause of breast development before nine years and menarche before twelve years  70  Early puberty in girls can be a harbinger of later health problems  71  The average level of daily physical activity has also been shown to affect timing of puberty  especially in females  A high level of exercise  whether for athletic or body image purposes  or for daily subsistence  reduces energy calories available for reproduction and slows puberty  The exercise effect is often amplified by a lower body fat mass and cholesterol  Physical and mental illness Chronic diseases can delay puberty in both boys and girls  Those that involve chronic inflammation or interfere with nutrition have the strongest effect  In the western world  inflammatory bowel disease and tuberculosis have been notorious for such an effect in the last century  while in areas of the underdeveloped world  chronic parasite infections are widespread  Mental illnesses occur in puberty  The brain undergoes significant development by hormones which can contribute to mood disorders such as Major depressive disorder  bipolar disorder  dysthymia and schizophrenia  Girls aged between 15 and 19 make up 40  of anorexia nervosa cases  72  Stress and social factors This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Some of the least understood environmental influences on timing of puberty are social and psychological  In comparison with the effects of genetics  nutrition  and general health  social influences are small  shifting timing by a few months rather than years  Mechanisms of these social effects are unknown  though a variety of physiological processes  including pheromones  have been suggested based on animal research  The most important part of a child s psychosocial environment is the family  and most of the social influence research has investigated features of family structure and function in relation to earlier or later female puberty  Most of the studies have reported that menarche may occur a few months earlier in girls in high stress households  whose fathers are absent during their early childhood  who have a stepfather in the home  who are subjected to prolonged sexual abuse in childhood  or who are adopted from a developing country at a young age  Conversely  menarche may be slightly later when a girl grows up in a large family with a biological father present  More extreme degrees of environmental stress  such as wartime refugee status with threat to physical survival  have been found to be associated with delay of maturation  an effect that may be compounded by dietary inadequacy  Most of these reported social effects are small and our understanding is incomplete  Most of these  effects  are statistical associations revealed by epidemiologic surveys  Statistical associations are not necessarily causal  and a variety of covariables and alternative explanations can be imagined  Effects of such small size can never be confirmed or refuted for any individual child  Furthermore  interpretations of the data are politically controversial because of the ease with which this type of research can be used for political advocacy  Accusations of bias based on political agenda sometimes accompany scientific criticism  Another limitation of the social research is that nearly all of it has concerned girls  partly because female puberty requires greater physiologic resources and partly because it involves a unique event  menarche  that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler than male  More detail is provided in the menarche article  Variations of sequence The sequence of events of pubertal development can occasionally vary  For example  in about 15  of boys and girls  pubarche  the first pubic hairs  can precede  respectively  gonadarche and thelarche by a few months  Rarely  menarche can occur before other signs of puberty in a few girls  These variations deserve medical evaluation because they can occasionally signal a disease  Conclusion In a general sense  the conclusion of puberty is reproductive maturity  Criteria for defining the conclusion may differ for different purposes  attainment of the ability to reproduce  achievement of maximal adult height  maximal gonadal size  or adult sex hormone levels  Maximal adult height is achieved at an average age of 15 years for an average girl and 18 years for an average boy  Potential fertility  sometimes termed nubility  usually precedes completion of growth by 1 2 years in girls and 3 4 years in boys  Stage 5 typically represents maximal gonadal growth and adult hormone levels  Neurohormonal process The endocrine reproductive system consists of the hypothalamus  the pituitary  the gonads  and the adrenal glands  with input and regulation from many other body systems  True puberty is often termed  central puberty  because it begins as a process of the central nervous system  A simple description of hormonal puberty is as follows  The brain s hypothalamus begins to release pulses of GnRH  Cells in the anterior pituitary respond by secreting LH and FSH into the circulation  The ovaries or testes respond to the rising amounts of LH and FSH by growing and beginning to produce estradiol and testosterone  Rising levels of estradiol and testosterone produce the body changes of female and male puberty  The onset of this neurohormonal process may precede the first visible body changes by 1 2 years  Components of the endocrine reproductive system The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus is the driver of the reproductive system  It has neurons which generate and release pulses of GnRH into the portal venous system of the pituitary gland  The arcuate nucleus is affected and controlled by neuronal input from other areas of the brain and hormonal input from the gonads  adipose tissue and a variety of other systems  The pituitary gland responds to the pulsed GnRH signals by releasing LH and FSH into the blood of the general circulation  also in a pulsatile pattern  The gonads  testes and ovaries  respond to rising levels of LH and FSH by producing the steroid sex hormones  testosterone and estrogen  The adrenal glands are a second source for steroid hormones  Adrenal maturation  termed adrenarche  typically precedes gonadarche in mid childhood  Major hormones Neurokinin B  a tachykinin peptide  and kisspeptin  a neuropeptide   both present in the same hypothalamic neurons  are critical parts of the control system that switches on the release of GnRH at the start of puberty  73  GnRH  gonadotropin releasing hormone  is a peptide hormone released from the hypothalamus which stimulates gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary  LH  luteinizing hormone  is a larger protein hormone secreted into the general circulation by gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland  The main target cells of LH are the Leydig cells of testes and the theca cells of the ovaries  LH secretion changes more dramatically with the initiation of puberty than FSH  as LH levels increase about 25 fold with the onset of puberty  compared with the 2 5 fold increase of FSH  FSH  follicle stimulating hormone  is another protein hormone secreted into the general circulation by the gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary  The main target cells of FSH are the ovarian follicles and the Sertoli cells and spermatogenic tissue of the testes  Testosterone is a steroid hormone produced primarily by the Leydig cells of the testes  and in lesser amounts by the theca cells of the ovaries and the adrenal cortex  Testosterone is the primary mammalian androgen and the  original  anabolic steroid  It acts on androgen receptors in responsive tissue throughout the body  Estradiol is a steroid hormone produced by aromatization of testosterone  Estradiol is the principal human estrogen and acts on estrogen receptors throughout the body  The largest amounts of estradiol are produced by the granulosa cells of the ovaries  but lesser amounts are derived from testicular and adrenal testosterone  Adrenal androgens are steroids produced by the zona reticulosa of the adrenal cortex in both sexes  The major adrenal androgens are dehydroepiandrosterone  androstenedione  which are precursors of testosterone   and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate which is present in large amounts in the blood  Adrenal androgens contribute to the androgenic events of early puberty in girls  IGF1  insulin like growth factor 1  rises substantially during puberty in response to rising levels of growth hormone and may be the principal mediator of the pubertal growth spurt  Leptin is a protein hormone produced by adipose tissue  Its primary target organ is the hypothalamus  The leptin level seems to provide the brain a rough indicator of adipose mass for purposes of regulation of appetite and energy metabolism  It also plays a permissive role in female puberty  which usually will not proceed until an adequate body mass has been achieved  Endocrine perspective The endocrine reproductive system becomes functional by the end of the first trimester of fetal life  The testes and ovaries become briefly inactive around the time of birth but resume hormonal activity until several months after birth  when incompletely understood mechanisms in the brain begin to suppress the activity of the arcuate nucleus  This has been referred to as maturation of the prepubertal  gonadostat   which becomes sensitive to negative feedback by sex steroids  The period of hormonal activity until several months after birth  followed by suppression of activity  may correspond to the period of infant sexuality  followed by a latency stage  which Sigmund Freud described  74  Gonadotropin and sex steroid levels fall to low levels  nearly undetectable by current clinical assays  for approximately another 8 to 10 years of childhood  Evidence is accumulating that the reproductive system is not totally inactive during the childhood years  Subtle increases in gonadotropin pulses occur  and ovarian follicles surrounding germ cells  future eggs  double in number  Normal puberty is initiated in the hypothalamus  with de inhibition of the pulse generator in the arcuate nucleus  This inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is an ongoing active suppression by other areas of the brain  The signal and mechanism releasing the arcuate nucleus from inhibition have been the subject of investigation for decades and remain incompletely understood  Leptin levels rise throughout childhood and play a part in allowing the arcuate nucleus to resume operation  If the childhood inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is interrupted prematurely by injury to the brain  it may resume pulsatile gonadotropin release and puberty will begin at an early age  Neurons of the arcuate nucleus secrete gonadotropin releasing hormone  GnRH  into the blood of the pituitary portal system  An American physiologist  Ernst Knobil  found that the GnRH signals from the hypothalamus induce pulsed secretion of LH  and to a lesser degree  FSH  at roughly 1 2 hour intervals  The LH pulses are the consequence of pulsatile GnRH secretion by the arcuate nucleus that  in turn  is the result of an oscillator or signal generator in the central nervous system   GnRH pulse generator    75  In the years preceding physical puberty  Robert M  Boyar discovered that the gonadotropin pulses occur only during sleep  but as puberty progresses they can be detected during the day  76  By the end of puberty  there is little day night difference in the amplitude and frequency of gonadotropin pulses  Some investigators have attributed the onset of puberty to a resonance of oscillators in the brain  77  78  79  80  By this mechanism  the gonadotropin pulses that occur primarily at night just before puberty represent beats  81  82  83  An array of  autoamplification processes  increases the production of all of the pubertal hormones of the hypothalamus  pituitary  and gonads citation needed   Regulation of adrenarche and its relationship to maturation of the hypothalamic gonadal axis is not fully understood  and some evidence suggests it is a parallel but largely independent process coincident with or even preceding central puberty  Rising levels of adrenal androgens  termed adrenarche  can usually be detected between 6 and 11 years of age  even before the increasing gonadotropin pulses of hypothalamic puberty  Adrenal androgens contribute to the development of pubic hair  pubarche   adult body odor  and other androgenic changes in both sexes  The primary clinical significance of the distinction between adrenarche and gonadarche is that pubic hair and body odor changes by themselves do not prove that central puberty is underway for an individual child  Hormonal changes in boys This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Early stages of male hypothalamic maturation seem to be very similar to the early stages of female puberty  though occurring about 1 2 years later  LH stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes to make testosterone and blood levels begin to rise  For much of puberty  nighttime levels of testosterone are higher than daytime  Regularity of frequency and amplitude of gonadotropin pulses seems to be less necessary for progression of male than female puberty  However  a significant portion of testosterone in adolescent boys is converted to estradiol  Estradiol mediates the growth spurt  bone maturation  and epiphyseal closure in boys just as in girls  Estradiol also induces at least modest development of breast tissue  gynecomastia  in a large proportion of boys  Boys who develop mild gynecomastia or even developing swellings under nipples during puberty are told the effects are temporary in some male teenagers due to high levels of estradiol  Another hormonal change in males takes place during the teenage years for most young men  At this point in a males life the testosterone levels slowly rise  and most of the effects are mediated through the androgen receptors by way of conversion dihydrotestosterone in target organs  especially that of the bowels   Hormonal changes in girls This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  As the amplitude of LH pulses increases  the theca cells of the ovaries begin to produce testosterone and smaller amounts of progesterone  Much of the testosterone moves into nearby cells called granulosa cells  Smaller increases of FSH induce an increase in the aromatase activity of these granulosa cells  which converts most of the testosterone to estradiol for secretion into the circulation  Rising levels of estradiol produce the characteristic estrogenic body changes of female puberty  growth spurt  acceleration of bone maturation and closure  breast growth  increased fat composition  growth of the uterus  increased thickness of the endometrium and the vaginal mucosa  and widening of the lower pelvis  As the estradiol levels gradually rise and the other autoamplification processes occur  a point of maturation is reached when the feedback sensitivity of the hypothalamic  gonadostat  becomes positive  This attainment of positive feedback is the hallmark of female sexual maturity  as it allows the mid cycle LH surge necessary for ovulation  Levels of adrenal androgens and testosterone also increase during puberty  producing the typical androgenic changes of female puberty  pubic hair  other androgenic hair as outlined above  body odor  acne  Growth hormone levels rise steadily throughout puberty  IGF1 levels rise and then decline as puberty ends  Growth finishes and adult height is attained as the estradiol levels complete closure of the epiphyses  Stages adrenarche  approximately age 7  gonadarche  approximately age 8  thelarche
