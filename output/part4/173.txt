Spanish  Reino de Espa a   note 7  5  is a sovereign state and a member of the European Union located in southwestern Europe on the Iberian Peninsula  Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar  to the north by France  Andorra  and the Bay of Biscay  and to the northwest and west by the Atlantic Ocean and Portugal  Spanish territory also includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean  the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean off the African coast  and two autonomous cities in North Africa  Ceuta and Melilla  that border Morocco  Furthermore  the town of Ll via is a Spanish exclave situated inside French territory  With an area of 504 030 square kilometres  194 610 sq mi   it is the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union after France  and the fourth largest country in Europe after Russia  Ukraine and France  Because of its location  the territory of Spain was subject to many external influences since prehistoric times and through to its dawn as a country  Spain emerged as a unified country in the 15th century  following the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs and the completion of the reconquest  or Reconquista  of the Iberian peninsula in 1492  Conversely  it has been an important source of influence to other regions  chiefly during the modern era  when it became a global empire that has left a legacy of over 500 million Spanish speakers today  making it the world s second most spoken first language  Spain is a democracy organised in the form of a parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy  It is a developed country with the twelfth largest economy in the world by nominal GDP  and very high living standards  including the tenth highest quality of life index rating in the world  as of 2005  It is a member of the United Nations  European Union  NATO  OECD  and WTO  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History

its cognates  Spain  and  Spanish  are disputed  The ancient Roman name for Iberia  Hispania  may derive from poetic use of the term Hesperia to refer to Spain  reflecting the Greek perception of Italy as a  western land  or  land of the setting sun   Hesperia          in Greek  and Spain  being still further west  as Hesperia ultima  6  It may also be a derivation of the Punic Ispanihad  meaning  land of rabbits  or  edge   a reference to Spain s location at the end of the Mediterranean  Roman coins struck in the region from the reign of Hadrian show a female figure with a coney at her feet  7  There are also claims that Espa a derives from the Basque word Ezpanna meaning  edge  or  border   another reference to the fact that the Iberian peninsula constitutes the southwest of the European continent  6  The humanist Antonio de Nebrija proposed that the word Hispania evolved from the Iberian word Hispalis  meaning  city of the western world   Jes s Luis Cunchillos argues that the root of the term span is the Phoenecian word spy  meaning  to forge metals   Therefore i spn ya would mean  the land where metals are forged   8  History Main article  History of Spain The Iberian peninsula enters written records as a land populated largely by the Iberians  Basques and Celts  After an arduous conquest  the peninsula came under the rule of Rome  During the early Middle Ages it came under Germanic rule but later  it was conquered by Moorish invaders from North Africa  In a process that took centuries  the small Christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula  The last Moorish kingdom fell in the same year Columbus reached the Americas  A global empire began which saw Spain become the strongest kingdom in Europe and the leading world power for a century and a half and the largest overseas empire for three centuries  Continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status  The Napoleonic invasions of Spain led to chaos  triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable  Prior to the Second World War  Spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government  whose rule oversaw a period of stagnation but that finished with a powerful economic surge  Eventually democracy was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy  In 1986  Spain joined the European Union  experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth  Prehistory and pre Roman peoples Main article  Prehistoric Iberia Archaeological research at Atapuerca indicates the Iberian Peninsula was populated by hominids 1 2 million years ago  9  Modern humans first arrived in Iberia  from the north on foot  about 32 000 years ago  10  The best known artifacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the famous paintings in the Altamira cave of Cantabria in northern Iberia  which were created about 15 000 BCE by cro magnons  11  Altamira Cave paintings  11  in Cantabria Archaeological and genetic evidence strongly suggests that the Iberian Peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern Europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age  The two main historical peoples of the peninsula were the Iberians and the Celts  The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side from the northeast to the southeast  The Celts inhabited the Atlantic side  in the north  center  Celtiberian   northwest and southwest part of the peninsula  Basques occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas  In the south of the peninsula appeared the semi mythical city of Tartessos  c 1100 BC   whose flourishing trade in items made of gold and silver with the Phoenicians and Greeks is documented by Strabo and the Book of Solomon  Between about 500 BC and 300 BC  the seafaring Phoenicians and Greeks founded trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast  The Carthaginians briefly exerted control over much of the Mediterranean side of the peninsula  until defeated in the Punic Wars by the Romans  12  Roman Empire and the Gothic Kingdom Main article  Hispania Roman Theatre of M rida  Badajoz During the Second Punic War  an expanding Roman Empire captured Carthaginian trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast from roughly 210 BC to 205 BC  It took the Romans nearly two centuries to complete the conquest of the Iberian peninsula  though they had control of much of it for over six centuries  Roman rule was bound together by law  language  and the Roman road  13  The cultures of the Celt and Iberian populations were gradually romanized  Latinized  at differing rates in different parts of Hispania  Local leaders were admitted into the Roman aristocratic class  note 8  12  Hispania served as a granary for the Roman market  and its harbors exported gold  wool  olive oil  and wine  Agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects  some of which remain in use  Emperors Trajan  Theodosius I  and the philosopher Seneca were born in Hispania  note 9 Christianity was introduced into Hispania in the 1st century CE and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century CE  12  Most of Spain s present languages and religion  and the basis of its laws  originate from this period  13  Cathedral of the Holy Saviour  Asturias The weakening of the Western Roman Empire s jurisdiction in Hispania began in 409  when the Germanic Suevi and Vandals  together with the Sarmatian Alans crossed the Rhine and ravaged Gaul until the Visigoths drove them into Iberia that same year  The Suevi established a kingdom in what is today modern Galicia and northern Portugal  As the western empire disintegrated  the social and economic base became greatly simplified  but even in modified form  the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire  including Christianity  The Alans  allies  the Hasdingi Vandals  established a kingdom in Gallaecia  too  occupying largely the same region but extending farther south to the Duero river  The Silingi Vandals occupied the region that still bears a form of their name  Vandalusia  modern Andalusia  in Spain  The Byzantines established an enclave  Spania  in the south  with the intention of reviving the Roman empire throughout Iberia  Eventually  however  Hispania was reunited under Visigothic rule  Muslim Iberia Main article  Al Andalus The Alhambra  Granada  In the 8th century  nearly all of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered  711 718  by largely Moorish Muslim armies from North Africa  These conquests were part of the expansion of the Umayyad Islamic Empire  Only a small area in the mountainous north west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion  Under Islamic law  Christians and Jews were given the subordinate status of dhimmi  This status permitted Christians and Jews to practice their religions as people of the book but they were required to pay a special tax and to be subject to certain discriminations  14  15  Conversion to Islam proceeded at a steadily increasing pace  The muladies  Muslims of ethnic Iberian origin  are believed to have comprised the majority of the population of Al Andalus by the end of the 10th century  16  17  La Giralda  the bell tower of Seville Cathedral The Muslim community in the Iberian peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions  The Berber people of North Africa  who had provided the bulk of the invading armies  clashed with the Arab leadership from the Middle East  note 10  Over time  large Moorish populations became established  especially in the Guadalquivir River valley  the coastal plain of Valencia  the Ebro River valley and  towards the end of this period  in the mountainous region of Granada  17  C rdoba  the capital of the caliphate  was the largest  richest and most sophisticated city in western Europe  Mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished  Muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the Middle East and North Africa  Muslim and Jewish scholars played an important part in reviving and expanding classical Greek learning in Western Europe  The Romanized cultures of the Iberian peninsula interacted with Muslim and Jewish cultures in complex ways  thus giving the region a distinctive culture  17  Outside the cities  where the vast majority lived  the land ownership system from Roman times remained largely intact as Muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners  and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to a remarkable expansion of agriculture  citation needed  In the 11th century  the Muslim holdings fractured into rival Taifa kingdoms  allowing the small Christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories  17  The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the Almoravids and the Almohads restored unity upon the Muslim holdings  with a stricter  less tolerant application of Islam  and saw a revival in Muslim fortunes  This re united Islamic state  experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed Christian gains  Fall of Muslim rule and unification Main article  Reconquista Loarre Castle  Huesca The Reconquista   Reconquest   is the centuries long period of expansion of Iberia s Christian kingdoms  The Reconquista is viewed as beginning with the Battle of Covadonga in 722  and was concurrent with the period of Muslim rule on the Iberian peninsula  The Christian army s victory over Muslim forces led to the creation of the Christian Kingdom of Asturias along the northwestern coastal mountains  Shortly after  in 739  Muslim forces were driven from Galicia  which was to eventually host one of medieval Europe s holiest sites  Santiago de Compostela and was incorporated into the new Christian kingdom  Muslim armies had also moved north of the Pyrenees  but they were defeated by Frankish forces at the Battle of Poitiers  Frankia  Later  Frankish forces established Christian counties on the southern side of the Pyrenees  These areas were to grow into the kingdoms of Navarre  Aragon and Catalonia  18  For several centuries  the fluctuating frontier between the Muslim and Christian controlled areas of Iberia was along the Ebro and Duero valleys   vila city walls The breakup of Al Andalus into the competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled Iberian Christian kingdoms gain the initiative  The capture of the strategically central city of Toledo in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the Christian kingdoms  Following a great Muslim resurgence in the 12th century  the great Moorish strongholds in the south fell to Christian Spain in the 13th century C rdoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248 leaving only the Muslim enclave of Granada as a tributary state in the south  19  In the 13th and 14th centuries  the Marinids Muslim sect based in North Africa invaded and established some enclaves on the southern coast but failed in their attempt to re establish Muslim rule in Iberia and were soon driven out  The 13th century also witnessed the Crown of Aragon  centred in Spain s north east  expand its reach across islands in the Mediterranean  to Sicily and even Athens  20  Around this time the universities of Palencia  1212 1263  and Salamanca  1218 1254  were established  The Black Death of 1348 and 1349 devastated Spain  21  Burgos Cathedral In 1469  the crowns of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were united by the marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon  1478 commenced the completion of the conquest of the Canary Islands and in 1492  the combined forces of Castile and Aragon captured the Emirate of Granada  ending the last remnant of a 781 year presence of Islamic rule in Iberia  The Treaty of Granada guaranteed religious tolerance toward Muslims  22  The year 1492 also marked the arrival in the New World of Christopher Columbus  during a voyage funded by Isabella  That same year  Spain s Jews were ordered to convert to Catholicism or face expulsion from Spanish territories during the Spanish Inquisition  23  A few years later  following social disturbances  Muslims were also expelled under the same conditions  note 11  24  As Renaissance New Monarchs  Isabella and Ferdinand centralized royal power at the expense of local nobility  and the word Espa a  whose root is the ancient name Hispania  began to be commonly used to designate the whole of the two kingdoms  24  With their wide ranging political  legal  religious and military reforms  Spain emerged as the first world power  Imperial Spain Main article  Spanish Empire The Spanish Empire s historical influence The unification of the crowns of Aragon and Castile laid the basis for modern Spain and the Spanish Empire  25  Spain was Europe s leading power throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century  a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions  It reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two Spanish Habsburgs   Charles I  1516 1556  and Philip II  1556 1598   This period saw the Italian Wars  the revolt of the comuneros  the Dutch revolt  the Morisco revolt  clashes with the Ottomans  the Anglo Spanish war and wars with France  26  The Spanish Empire expanded to include great parts of the Americas  islands in the Asia Pacific area  areas of Italy  cities in Northern Africa  as well as parts of what are now France  Germany  Belgium  Luxembourg  and the Netherlands  It was the first empire of which it was said that the sun never set  This was an age of discovery  with daring explorations by sea and by land  the opening up of new trade routes across oceans  conquests and the beginnings of European colonialism  Along with the arrival of precious metals  spices  luxuries  and new agricultural plants  Spanish explorers brought back knowledge from the New World  and played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe  27  The cultural efflorescence witnessed is now referred to as the Spanish Golden Age  The rise of humanism  the Protestant Reformation and new geographical discoveries raised issues addressed by the influential intellectual movement now known as the School of Salamanca  A 17th century galleon In the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century  Spain was confronted by unrelenting challenges from all sides  Barbary pirates under the aegis of the rapidly growing Ottoman empire  disrupted life in many coastal areas through their slave raids and renewed the threat of an Islamic invasion  28  This at a time when Spain was often at war with France  The Protestant Reformation schism from the Catholic Church dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars  The result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean  29  By the middle decades of a war  and plague ridden 17th century Europe the Spanish Habsburgs had enmeshed the country in the continent wide religious political conflicts  These conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the European economy generally  Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire  and help the imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces  but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of Portugal  with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640  and the Netherlands  and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive  Europe wide Thirty Years War  30  El Escorial  central Spain  In the latter half of the 17th century  Spain went into a gradual relative decline  during which it surrendered a number of small territories to France  However it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire  which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century  The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century  The War of Spanish Succession was a wide ranging international conflict combined with a civil war  and was to cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the Continent  31  During this war  a new dynasty originating in France  the Bourbons  was installed  Long united only by the Crown  a true Spanish state was established when the first Bourbon king  Philip V  united the crowns of Castile and Aragon into a single state  abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws  32  The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire  The new Bourbon monarchy drew on the French system of modernising the administration and the economy  Enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom s elite and monarchy  Military assistance for the rebellious British colonies in the American War of Independence improved the kingdom s international standing  33  Napoleonic rule and its consequences Main article  Mid nineteenth century Spain See also  Spanish American wars of independence Second of May 1808  the people revolt against the Bonapartist regime In 1793  Spain went to war against the new French Republic  which had overthrown and executed its Bourbon king  Louis XVI  The war polarised the country in an apparent reaction against the gallicised elites  Defeated in the field  peace was made with France in 1795 and it effectively became a client state of that country  In 1807  the secret treaty of Fontainebleau between Napoleon and the deeply unpopular Godoy led to a declaration of war against Britain and Portugal  French troops entered the kingdom unopposed  supposedly to invade Portugal  but instead they occupied Spanish fortresses  This invasion by trickery led to the abdication of the ridiculed Spanish king in favour of Napoleon s brother  Joseph Bonaparte  This foreign puppet monarch was widely regarded with scorn  The 2 May 1808 revolt was one of many nationalist uprisings against the Bonapartist regime across the country  34  These revolts marked the beginning of what is known to the Spanish as the War of Independence  and to the British as the Peninsular War  35  Napoleon was forced to intervene personally  defeating several badly coordinated Spanish armies and forcing a British army to retreat  However  further military action by Spanish guerrillas and armies  and Wellington s British Portuguese forces  combined with Napoleon s disastrous invasion of Russia  led to the ousting of the French imperial armies from the Spain in 1814  and the return of King Ferdinand VII  36  The French invasions devastated the economy  and left Spain a deeply divided country prone to political instability  The power struggles of the early 19th century led to the loss of all of its colonies in the Americas  which stretched from Las Californias to Patagonia   with the sole exception of Cuba and Puerto Rico  Spanish American War Main article  Spanish American War Amid the instability and economic crisis that afflicted Spain in the 19th century there arose nationalist movements in the Philippines and Cuba  Wars of independence ensued in those colonies and eventually the United States became involved  Despite the commitment and ability shown by some military units  they were so mismanaged by the highest levels of command that the Spanish American War  fought in the Spring of 1898  did not last long   El Desastre   The Disaster   as the war became known  helped give impetus to the Generation of 98 who were already conducting much critical analysis concerning the country  It also weakened the stability that had been established during Alfonso XII s reign  Spanish Civil War Main article  Spanish Civil War The 20th century brought little peace  Spain played a minor part in the scramble for Africa  with the colonisation of Western Sahara  Spanish Morocco and Equatorial Guinea  The heavy losses suffered during the Rif war in Morocco helped to undermine the monarchy  A period of authoritarian rule under General Miguel Primo de Rivera  1923 1931  ended with the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic  The Republic offered political autonomy to the Basque Country  Catalonia and Galicia and gave voting rights to women  Francisco Franco and US President Eisenhower  Madrid  1959 The Spanish Civil War  1936 39  ensued  Three years later the Nationalist forces  led by General Francisco Franco  emerged victorious with the support of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy  Popular Front government side was supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico and International Brigades  including the American Abraham Lincoln Brigade  but it was not supported officially by the Western powers due to the British led policy of Non Intervention  The Civil War claimed the lives of over 500 000 people 37  and caused the flight of up to a half million citizens  38  Most of their descendants now live in Latin American countries  with some 300 000 in Argentina alone  39  The Spanish Civil War has been called the first battle of the Second World War  Spain under Franco Main article  Spain under Franco The Spanish State established by Franco was nominally neutral in the Second World War  although sympathetic to the Axis  The only legal party under Franco s post civil war regime was the Falange Espa ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS  formed in 1937  the party emphasised anti Communism  Catholicism and nationalism  Given Franco s opposition to competing political parties  the party was renamed the National Movement  Movimiento Nacional  in 1949  After World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated  and was kept out of the United Nations  This changed in 1955  during the Cold War period  when it became strategically important for the U S  to establish a military presence on the Iberian peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the U S S R into the Mediterranean basin  In the 1960s  Spain registered an unprecedented rate of economic growth in what became known as the Spanish miracle  which resumed the much interrupted transition towards a modern economy  Post Franco Further information  Spanish society after the democratic transition Spanish Constitution of 1978 With Franco s death in November 1975  Juan Carlos succeeded to the position of King of Spain and head of state in accordance with the law  With the approval of the new Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the arrival of democracy  the State devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organization based on autonomous communities  In the Basque Country  moderate Basque nationalism has coexisted with a radical nationalist movement led by the armed organisation ETA  The group was formed in 1959 during Franco s rule but has continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy  On 23 February 1981  rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose a military backed government  King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters  via national television  to surrender  On 30 May 1982 Spain joined NATO  following a referendum  That year the Spanish Socialist Workers Party  PSOE  came to power  the first left wing government in 43 years  In 1986 Spain joined the European Community  what became the European Union  The PSOE was replaced in government by the Partido Popular  PP  after the latter won the 1996 General Elections  at that point the PSOE had served almost 14 consecutive years in office  Spanish euros  2002 On 1 January 2002  Spain ceased to use the peseta as currency replacing it with the euro  which it shares with 15 other countries in the Eurozone  Spain has also seen strong economic growth  well above the EU average  but well publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom that the extraordinary property prices and high foreign trade deficits of the boom were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse were confirmed by a severe property led recession that struck the country in 2008 9  40  A series of bombs exploded in commuter trains in Madrid  Spain on 11 March 2004  After a five month trial in 2007 it was concluded the bombings were perpetrated by a local Islamist militant group inspired by al Qaeda  41  The bombings killed 191 people and wounded more than 1800  and the intention of the perpetrators may have been to influence the outcome of the Spanish general election  held three days later  42  Though initial suspicions focused on the Basque group ETA  evidence soon emerged indicating possible Islamist involvement  Because of the proximity of the election  the issue of responsibility quickly became a political controversy  with the main competing parties PP and PSOE exchanging accusations over the handling of the aftermath  43  At 14 March elections  PSOE  led by Jos  Luis Rodr guez Zapatero  obtained a plurality  enough to form a new cabinet with Rodr guez Zapatero as the new Presidente del Gobierno or Prime Minister of Spain  thus succeeding the former PP administration  44  Geography Main article  Geography of Spain Boss st  L rida  a Pyrenean town At 504 782 km2  194 897 sq mi   Spain

and approving the constitution of 1978  51  After a national referendum on 6 December 1978  88  of voters approved of the new constitution  As a result  Spain is now composed of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities with varying degrees of autonomy thanks to its Constitution  which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation as well as that Spain has today no official religion but all are free to practice and believe as they wish  As of November 2009  the government of Spain keeps a balanced gender equality ratio  Nine out of the 18 members of the government are women  Under the administration of Jos  Luis Rodr guez Zapatero  Spain has been described as being  at the vanguard  in gender equality issues and also that   n o other modern  democratic  administration outside Scandinavia has taken more steps to place gender issues at the centre of government   52  The Spanish administration has also promoted gender based positive discrimination by approving gender equality legislation in 2007 aimed at providing equality between genders in Spanish political and economic life  Gender Equality Act   53  54  However  in the legislative branch  as of July 2010 only 128 of the 350 members of the Congress are women  36 3    55  It places Spain 13th on a list of countries ranked by proportion of women in the lower house  In the Senate  the ratio is even lower  since there are only 79 women out of 263  30 0    56  The Gender Empowerment Measure of Spain in the United Nations Human Development Report is 0 794  12th in the world  57  Branches of government Mariano Rajoy  Prime minister  Spain is a constitutional monarchy  with a hereditary monarch and a bicameral parliament  the Cortes Generales  The executive branch consists of a Council of Ministers of Spain presided over by the Prime Minister  nominated and appointed by the monarch and confirmed by the Congress of Deputies following legislative elections  By political custom established by King Juan Carlos since the ratification of the 1978 Constitution  the king s nominees have all been from parties who maintain a plurality of seats in the Congress  The legislative branch is made up of the Congress of Deputies  Congreso de los Diputados  with 350 members  elected by popular vote on block lists by proportional representation to serve four year terms  and a Senate  Senado  with 259 seats of which 208 are directly elected by popular vote and the other 51 appointed by the regional legislatures to also serve four year terms  Head of State King Juan

organizationally composed in the form of called Estado de las Autonom as   State of Autonomies    it is one of the most decentralized countries in Europe  along with Switzerland  Germany and Belgium  58  for example  all Autonomous Communities have their own elected parliaments  governments  public administrations  budgets  and resources  therefore  health and education systems among others are managed regionally  besides  the Basque Country and Navarre also manage their own public finances based on foral provisions  In Catalonia and the Basque Country  a full fledged autonomous police corps

divisions Main article  Political divisions of Spain The Spanish State is integrated by 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities  both groups being the highest or first order administrative division in the country  Autonomous communities are integrated by provinces  of which there are 50 in total  and in turn  provinces are integrated by municipalities  In Catalonia  two additional divisions exist  the comarques  sing  comarca  and the vegueries  sing  vegueria  both of which have administrative powers  comarques being aggregations of municipalities  and the vegueries being aggregations of comarques  The concept of a comarca exists in all autonomous communities  however  unlike Catalonia  these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions  Autonomous communities

Extremadura Portugal Castile and Le n Asturias Cantabria Basque Country Murcia Andalusia Ceuta Melilla France Balearic Islands Canary Islands Mediterranean Sea Bay of Biscay Atlantic Ocean Andorra Atlantic Ocean Gibraltar  UK  Autonomous communities are the first level administrative division in the country  These were created after the 1979 and current constitution came into effect in recognition of the right to self government to the  nationalities and regions of Spain   59  Autonomous communities were to be integrated by adjacent provinces with common historial  cultural  and economical traits  This territorial organization  based on devolution  is known in Spain as the  State of Autonomies   The basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the Statute of Autonomy  The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical identity  the limits of their territories  the name and organization of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according the constitution  60  The government of all autonomous communities must be based on a division of powers comprising  a Legislative Assembly whose members must be elected by universal suffrage according to the system of proportional representation and in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented  a Government Council  with executive and administrative functions headed by a president  elected by the Legislative Assembly and nominated by the King of Spain  a Supreme Court of Justice  under the Supreme Court of the State  which head the judicial organization within the autonomous community  Catalonia  Galicia and the Basque Country  which identified themselves as  nationalities  were granted self government through a rapid process  Andalusia also took that denomination in its first Statute of Autonomy  even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country  Progressively  other communities in revisions to their Statutes of Autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical regional identity  such as the Valencian Community  61  the Canary Islands  62  the Balearic Islands  63  and Aragon  64  The autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy  with their own parliaments and regional governments  The distribution of powers may be different for every community  as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy  since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical  Only two communities the Basque Country and Navarre have full fiscal autonomy  Aside of fiscal autonomy  the  historical  nationalities Andalusia  the Basque Country  Catalonia  and Galicia were devolved more powers than the rest of the communities  amongst them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time  In addition  the Basque Country  Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own  Ertzaintza  Mossos d Esquadra and the Polic a Foral respectively  Other communities have more limited forces or none at all  like the Polic a Aut noma Andaluza 65  in Andalusia or the BESCAM in Madrid  Nonetheless  recent amendments to existing Statutes of Autonomy or the promulgation of new Statutes altogether  have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the  historical nationalities  and the rest of the regions  Finally  along with the 17 autonomous communities  two autonomous cities are also part of the State of Autonomies and are first order territorial divisions  Ceuta and Melilla  These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast  Provinces and municipalities Provinces of Spain Main article  Provinces of Spain Autonomous communities are subdivided into provinces  provincias   which served as their territorial building blocks  In turn  provinces are integrated by municipalities  municipios   The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution  not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves  Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs  and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State  66  The current provincial division structure is based with minor changes on the one created in 1833 by Javier de Burgos  and in all  the Spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces  The communities of Asturias  Cantabria  La Rioja  the Balearic Islands  Madrid  Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that are integrated by a single province  which is coextensive with the community itself  In this cases  the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community  Foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of Spain European Union membership  1986 After the return of democracy following the death of Franco in 1975  Spain s foreign policy priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the Franco years and expand diplomatic relations  enter the European Community  and define security relations with the West  As a member of NATO since 1982  Spain has established itself as a major clarification needed  participant in multilateral international security activities  Spain s EU membership represents an important part of its foreign policy  Even on many international issues beyond western Europe  Spain prefers to coordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political cooperation mechanisms  With the normalization of diplomatic relations with North Korea in 2001  Spain completed the process of universalizing clarification needed  its diplomatic relations  Spain has maintained its special identification with Latin America  Its policy emphasizes the concept of an Iberoamerican community  essentially the renewal of the historically liberal concept of hispanoamericanismo  or Hispanism as it is often referred to in English  which has sought to link the Iberian peninsula with Latin America through language  commerce  history and culture  Spain has been an effective example of transition from dictatorship to democracy for formerly non democratic Latin American states  as shown in the many trips that Spain s King and Prime Ministers have made to the region  citation needed  Territorial disputes Spain claims Gibraltar  a six square km Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom in the southernmost part of the Iberian Peninsula  Then a Spanish town  it was conquered by an Anglo Dutch force in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of Archduke Charles  pretender to the Spanish throne  Port of Melilla The legal situation concerning Gibraltar was settled in 1713 by the Treaty of Utrecht  in which Spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown 67  stating that  should the British abandon this post  it would be offered to Spain first  Since the 1940s Spain has called for the return of Gibraltar  The overwhelming majority of Gibraltarians strongly oppose this  along with any proposal of shared sovereignty  68  UN resolutions call on the United Kingdom and Spain  both EU members  to reach an agreement over the status of Gibraltar  69  70  However  the Spanish claim makes a distinction between the isthmus that connects the Rock to the Spanish mainland on the one hand  and the Rock and city of Gibraltar on the other  While the Rock and city were ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht  Spain asserts that the  occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of International Law   71  The United Kingdom relies on de facto arguments of possession by prescription in relation to the isthmus  72  as there has been  continuous possession  of the isthmus  over a long period   73  Another claim by Spain is about the Savage Islands  not recognized by Portugal  Spain claims the sovereignty over the Perejil Island  a small  uninhabited rocky islet located in the South shore of the Strait of Gibraltar  The island lies 250 meters just off the coast of Morocco  8 km from Ceuta and 13 5 km from mainland Spain  Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco  It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002  The incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island  The islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty  Besides the Perejil Island  the Spanish held territories claimed by other countries are two  Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the plazas de soberan a islets off the northern coast of Africa  and Portugal does not recognise Spain s sovereignty over the territory of Olivenza  Emblem of Spanish Armed Forces Military Main article  Spanish Armed Forces The armed forces of Spain are known as the

capitalist mixed economy is the twelfth largest worldwide and the fifth largest in the European Union  as well as the Eurozone s fourth largest  The centre right government of former prime minister Jos  Mar a Aznar worked successfully to gain admission to the group of countries launching the euro in 1999  Unemployment stood at 7 6  in October 2006  a rate that compared favorably to many other European countries  and especially with the early 1990s when it stood at over 20   Perennial weak points of Spain s economy include high inflation  76  a large underground economy  77  and an education system which OECD reports place among the poorest for developed countries  together with the United States and UK  78  However  the property bubble that begun building from 1997  fed by historically low interest rates and an immense surge in immigration  imploded in 2008  leading to a rapidly weakening economy and soaring unemployment  By the end of May 2009  unemployment reached 18 7   37  for youths   79  80  The Eurozone Before the current crisis  the Spanish economy was credited for having avoided the virtual zero growth rate of some of its largest partners in the EU  81  In fact  the country s economy created more than half of all the new jobs in the European Union over the five years ending 2005  a process that is rapidly being reversed  82  The Spanish economy has been until recently regarded as one of the most dynamic within the EU  attracting significant amounts of foreign investment  83  The most recent economic growth benefited greatly from the global real estate boom  with construction representing an astonishing 16  of GDP and 12  of employment in its final year  84  According to calculations by the German newspaper Die Welt in 2007  Spain was on course to overtake Germany in per capita income by 2011  85  But the collapse of the housing boom in 2008 brought this to an end  According to the IMF  the PPP GDP per capita of Spain had  by 2010  slipped to USD 29 830  this compared to Germany at 36 081  UK 35 059  France 33 910  Italy 29 480  Greece 28 496  and Portugal 23 262  86  Research about quality of life by the Economist Intelligence Unit s quality of life survey placed Spain as the country among the top 10 best quality of life in the world for 2005  ahead of other economically and technologically advanced countries like France  Germany  the United Kingdom and South Korea  87  Before the collapse of the real estate boom there had been a corresponding rise in the levels of personal debt as prospective home owners struggled to meet asking prices  The average level of household debt tripled in less than a decade  This placed great pressure upon lower to middle income groups  by 2005 the median ratio of indebtedness to income had grown to 125   due primarily to expensive boom time mortgages  88  The 2008 2009 credit crunch and world recession manifested itself in Spain through a massive downturn in the property sector  Fortunately  Spain s banks and financial services avoided the more severe problems of their counterparts in the USA and UK  due mainly to a stringently enforced conservative financial regulatory regime  The Spanish financial authorities had not forgotten the country s own banking crisis of 1979 and an earlier real estate precipitated banking crisis of 1993  Indeed  Spain s largest bank  Banco Santander  participated in the UK government s bail out of part of the UK banking sector  89  A European Commission forecast predicted Spain would enter a recession by the end of 2008  90  According to Spain s Finance Minister   Spain faces its deepest recession in half a century   91  Spain s government forecast the unemployment rate would rise to 16  in 2009  The ESADE business school predicted

communities by population Geographical distribution of the Spanish population in 2008 In 2008 the population of Spain officially reached 46 million people  as recorded by the Padr n municipal  110  Spain s population density  at 91 km   235 sq mi   is lower than that of most Western European countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal  With the exception of the region surrounding the capital  Madrid  the most populated areas lie around the coast  The population of Spain more than doubled since 1900  when it stood at 18 6 million  principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s  111  Native Spaniards make up 88  of the total population of Spain  After the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and Spain s population growth rate dropped  the population again trended upward  based initially on the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s  and more recently  fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12  of the population  The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America  39    North Africa  16    Eastern Europe  15    and Sub Saharan Africa  4    112  In 2005  Spain instituted a three month amnesty program through which certain hitherto undocumented aliens were granted legal residency  In 2008  Spain granted citizenship to 84 170 persons  mostly to people from Ecuador  Colombia and Morocco  113  A sizeable portion of foreign residents in Spain also comes from other Western and Central European countries  These are mostly British  French  German  Dutch  and Norwegian  They reside primarily on the Mediterranean coast and the Balearic islands  where many choose to live their retirement or telecommute  Substantial populations descended from Spanish colonists and immigrants exist in other parts of the world  most notably in Latin America  Beginning in the late 15th century  large numbers of Iberian colonists settled in what became Latin America and at present most white Latin Americans  who make up about one third of Latin America s population  are of Spanish or Portuguese origin  In the 16th century perhaps 240 000 Spaniards emigrated  mostly to Peru and Mexico  114  They were joined by 450 000 in the next century  115  Between 1846 and 1932 it is estimated that nearly 5 million Spaniards emigrated to the Americas  especially to Argentina and Brazil  116  Approximately two million Spaniards migrated to other Western European countries between 1960 to 1975  During the same period perhaps 300 000 went to Latin America  117

Spanish Constitution of 1978  in its second article  recognises historic entities   nationalities   a carefully chosen word in order to avoid the more politically charged  nations   and regions  within the context of the Spanish nation  For some people  Spain s identity consists more of an overlap of different regional identities than of a sole Spanish identity  Indeed  some of the regional identities may even conflict with the Spanish one  clarification needed  Distinct traditional regional identities within Spain include the Basques  Catalans  Galicians and Castilians  among others  119  It is this last feature of  shared identity  between the more local level or Autonomous Community and the Spanish level which makes the identity question in Spain complex and far from univocal  Minority groups Spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies  especially Equatorial Guinea  and immigrants from several Sub Saharan and Caribbean countries have been recently settling in Spain  There are also sizeable numbers of Asian immigrants  most of whom are of Chinese  Indian  Filipino  Middle Eastern and South Asian origins  the population of Latin Americans is sizable as well and a fast growing segment  Other growing groups are Britons  760 000 in 2006  Germans and other immigrants from the rest of Europe  120  The arrival of the Gitanos  a Romani people  began in the 16th century  estimates of the Spanish Gitano population fluctuate around 700 000  121  The Mercheros  also Quinquis  are a minority group  formerly nomadic  that share a lot of the way of life of Gitanos  Their origin is unclear  Immigration Main article  Immigration to Spain According to the Spanish government there were 5 7 million foreign residents in Spain in 2011  or 12 2  of the total population  According to residence permit data for 2011  more than 860 000 were Romanian  about 770 000 were Moroccan  approximately 390 000 were British  and 360 000 were Ecuadorian  122  Other sizeable foreign communities are Colombian  Bolivian  German  Italian  Bulgarian  and Chinese  There are more than 200 000 migrants from Sub Saharan Africa living in Spain  principally Senegaleses and Nigerians  123  Since 2000  Spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows  despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level  This sudden and ongoing inflow of immigrants  particularly those arriving clandestinely by sea  has caused noticeable social tension  124  Marbella  M laga  where Britons  who are the third immigrant community in Spain  reside in large numbers  Within the EU  Spain had the second highest immigration rate in percentage terms after Cyprus  but by a great margin  the highest in absolute numbers  up to 2008  125  The number of immigrants in Spain had grown up from 500 000 people in 1996 to 5 2 million in 2008 out of a total population of 46 million  126  127  In 2005 alone  a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700 000 people  128  There are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration  including Spain s cultural ties with Latin America  its geographical position  the porosity of its borders  the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors  which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce  Another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of EU origin typically retiring to Spain s Mediterranean coast  In fact  Spain was Europe s largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007  with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2 5 million people arrived  129  According to the Financial Times  Spain is the most favoured destination for West Europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the EU  130  In 2008  the government instituted a Plan of Voluntary Return which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the EU to return to their home countries and receive several incentives  including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the Spanish Social Security  131  The program had little effect  during its first two months  just 1 400 immigrants took up the offer  132  What the program failed to do  the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs  In 2011 alone  more than half a million people have left Spain  133  For the first time in decades the net migration rate is expected to be negative  and 9 out 10 emigrants are foreigners  133  Languages Main article  Languages of Spain The languages of Spain  simplified    Spanish

have to choose either religion or ethics and Catholic is the only religion officially taught  According to a July 2009 study by the Spanish Center of Sociological Research about 73  of Spaniards self identify as Catholics  2 1  other faith  and about 22  identify with no religion among which 7 3  are atheists  Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services  This same study shows
