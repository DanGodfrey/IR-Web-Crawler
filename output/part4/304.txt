1934  His Jewish American family subsequently moved to Painesville  Ohio  but returned to Cleveland in 1949  following his father s death  As a child  he had a brief career performing in minstrel shows  He frequently ran away from home  taking an array of odd jobs including  by age 18   tuna fisherman off the coast of Galveston  itinerant crop picker down in New Orleans  hired gun for a wealthy neurotic  nitroglycerine truck driver in North Carolina  short order cook  cab driver  lithographer  book salesman  floorwalker in a department store  door to door brush salesman  and as a youngster  an actor in several productions at the Cleveland Play House   3  Ellison attended Ohio State University for 18 months  1951 53  before being expelled  He has said that the expulsion was a result of his hitting a professor who had denigrated his writing ability  and that over the next 40 odd years he had sent that professor a copy of every story he published  4  During the early 1950s he sold a story to EC Comics  Ellison moved to New York City in 1955 to pursue a writing career  primarily in science fiction  Over the next two years  he published more than 100 short stories and articles  He married Charlotte Stein in 1956 but they divorced four years later  He said of the marriage   four years of hell as sustained as the whine of a generator   5  In 1957  Ellison decided to write about youth gangs  To research the issue  he joined a street gang in the Red Hook  Brooklyn  New York area  under the name  Cheech Beldone   His subsequent writings on the subject include the novel  Web of the City Rumble  and the collection  The Deadly Streets  and also compose part of his memoir  Memos from Purgatory  Ellison was drafted into the United States Army  serving from 1957 to 1959  In 1960  he returned to New York  living at 95 Christopher Street in Greenwich Village  Moving to Chicago  Ellison wrote for William Hamling s Rogue magazine  As a book editor at Hamling s Regency Books  Hamling published novels and anthologies by writers such as B  Traven  Kurt Vonnegut  Robert Bloch and Philip Jos  Farmer  Clarence Cooper Jr and Ellison  In the late 1950s  Ellison wrote a number of erotic stories  such as  God Bless the Ugly Virgin  and  Tramp   which were later reprinted in Los Angeles based girlie magazines  That was his first use of the pseudonym Cordwainer Bird  He used the name in July and August 1957  in two journals  each of which had accepted two of his stories  In each journal  one story was published under the name Harlan Ellison  and the other under Cordwainer Bird  Later  as discussed in the Controversy section below  he used the pseudonym when he disagreed with the use or editing of his work  In 1960  Ellison married Billie Joyce Sanders  his second wife  but they divorced in 1963  citation needed   edit  Hollywood and beyond Ellison speaking at a SF conference Ellison moved to California in 1962  and subsequently began to sell his writing to Hollywood  He wrote the screenplay for The Oscar  starring Stephen Boyd and Elke Sommer  Ellison also sold scripts to many television shows  The Flying Nun  Burke s Law  Route 66  The Outer Limits  Star Trek  The Man from U N C L E   Cimarron Strip and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour  During the late 1960s  Ellison wrote a column about television for the Los Angeles Free Press  Titled  The Glass Teat   the column addressed political and social issues and their portrayal on television at the time  The columns were gathered into two collections  The Glass Teat and The Other Glass Teat  He was a participant in the 1965 March from Selma to Montgomery  Alabama  led by Martin Luther King  Jr  6  Also in 1966  he married his third wife  Lory Patrick  The marriage lasted only seven weeks  citation needed  In 1966  in an article that Esquire magazine would later name as the best magazine piece ever written  the journalist Gay Talese wrote about the goings on around the enigmatic Frank Sinatra  The article  entitled  Frank Sinatra Has a Cold   briefly describes a clash between the young Harlan Ellison and Frank Sinatra  when the crooner took exception to Ellison s boots during a billiards game  Talese is quoted as saying of the incident   Sinatra probably forgot about it at once  but Ellison will remember it all his life   Ellison continued to publish short fiction and nonfiction pieces in various publications  including some of his best known stories    Repent  Harlequin   Said the Ticktockman   1965  is a celebration of civil disobedience against repressive authority   I Have No Mouth  and I Must Scream   1967  is an allegory of Hell  where five humans are tormented by an all knowing computer throughout eternity  The story was the basis of a 1995 computer game  with Ellison participating in the game s design and providing the voice of the god computer AM   A Boy and His Dog  examines the nature of friendship and love in a violent  post apocalyptic world  It was made into the 1975 film of the same name  starring Don Johnson  He also edited the influential science fiction anthology Dangerous Visions  1967   which collected stories commissioned by Ellison  accompanied by his commentary laden biographical sketches of the authors  He challenged the authors to write stories at the edge of the genre  Many of the stories went beyond the traditional boundaries of science fiction pioneered by respected old school editors such as John W  Campbell  Jr  As an editor  Ellison was influenced and inspired by experimentation in the popular literature of the time  such as the beats  A sequel  Again Dangerous Visions  was published in 1972  A third volume  The Last Dangerous Visions  has been repeatedly postponed  see Controversy   In 1976  Ellison married his fourth wife  Lori Horowitz  He was 41 and she was 19  He said of the marriage   I was desperately in love with her  but it was a stupid marriage on my part   They were divorced after eight months  7  Ellison served as creative consultant to the science fiction TV series The Twilight Zone  1980s version  and Babylon 5  As a member of the Screen Actors Guild  SAG   he has voice over credits for shows including The Pirates of Dark Water  Mother Goose and Grimm  Space Cases  Phantom 2040  and Babylon 5  as well as making an onscreen appearance in the Babylon 5 episode  The Face of the Enemy   Ellison has commented on a great many movies and television programs  see The Glass Teat and The Other Glass Teat for television criticism and commentary  see Harlan Ellison s Watching for movie criticism and commentary   both negatively and positively  He does all his writing on a manual Olympia typewriter  and has a substantial distaste for personal computers and most of the Internet  On September 7  1986  Ellison married Susan Toth  his fifth and current wife   whom he had met in Scotland the year before  citation needed  For two years  beginning in 1986  Ellison took over as host of the Friday night radio program  Hour 25 on Pacifica Radio station KPFK FM  Los Angeles  after the death of Mike Hodel  the show s founder and original host  Ellison had been a frequent and favorite guest on the long running program  In one episode  he brought in his typewriter and proceeded to write a new short story live on the air  he titled the story  Hitler Painted Roses    Hour 25 also served as the inspiration for his story   The Hour That Stretches   Ellison s 1992 short story  The Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore  was selected for inclusion in the 1993 edition of The Best American Short Stories  Ellison was hired as a writer for Walt Disney Studios  but was fired on his first day after being overheard by Roy O  Disney in the studio commissary joking about making a pornographic animated film featuring Disney characters  He recounted this incident in his book Stalking the Nightmare  as part 3 of an essay titled  The 3 Most Important Things in Life   At a talk at the University of North Carolina Greensboro  Ellison stated he was walking the halls of Disney and was bored  until he found a screwdriver  at which time he walked throughout the facility tightening every screw he saw until he was confronted in the basement  His termination came later that day  Ellison has provided vocal narration to numerous audiobooks  both of his own writing and others  Ellison has helped narrate books by authors such as Orson Scott Card  Arthur C  Clarke  Jack Williamson and Terry Pratchett  Ellison lives in Los Angeles  California with Susan  his fifth wife  In 1994  he suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized for quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery  He had his own name trademarked in 2005  registered by The Kilimanjaro Corporation  which Ellison owns  and under which all his work is copyrighted  Ellison recently voiced himself as a character on the show Scooby Doo  Mystery Incorporated  in the H  P  Lovecraft inspired episode  The Shrieking Madness    edit  Pseudonyms Ellison has on occasion used the pseudonym Cordwainer Bird to alert members of the public to situations in which he feels his creative contribution to a project has been mangled beyond repair by others  typically Hollywood producers or studios  see also Alan Smithee   The first such work to which he signed the name was  The Price of Doom   an episode of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea  though it was misspelled as Cord Wainer Bird in the credits   An episode of Burke s Law   Who Killed Alex Debbs    credited to Ellison contains a character given this name  The  Cordwainer Bird  moniker is a tribute to fellow SF writer Paul M  A  Linebarger  better known by his pen name  Cordwainer Smith  The origin of the word  cordwainer  is shoemaker  from working with cordovan leather for shoes   The term used by Linebarger was meant to imply the industriousness of the pulp author  Ellison has said  in interviews and in his writing  that his version of the pseudonym was meant to mean  a shoemaker for birds   Since he has used the pseudonym mainly for works he wants to distance himself from  it may be understood to mean that  this work is for the birds  or that it is of as much use as shoes to a bird  Stephen King once said he thought that it meant that Ellison was giving people who mangled his work a literary version of  the bird   given credence by Ellison himself in his own essay titled  Somehow  I Don t Think We re in Kansas  Toto   describing his experience with the Starlost television series   The Bird moniker has since become a character in one of Ellison s own stories  not without some prompting  In his book Strange Wine  Ellison explains the origins of the Bird and goes on to state that Philip Jose Farmer wrote Cordwainer into the Wold Newton family the latter writer had developed  The thought of such a whimsical object lesson being related to such lights as Doc Savage  the Shadow  Tarzan  and all the other pulp heroes prompted Ellison to play with the concept  resulting in The New York Review of Bird  in which an annoyed Bird uncovers the darker secrets of the New York Literary Establishment before beginning a pulpish slaughter of same  Other pseudonyms Ellison has used during his career include Jay Charby  Sley Harson  Ellis Hart  John Magnus  Paul Merchant  Pat Roeder and Jay Solo  8   edit  Controversies  edit  Temperament Ellison has a reputation for being abrasive and argumentative  9  He has generally agreed with this assessment  and a dust jacket from one of Ellison s books described him as  possibly the most contentious person on Earth   Ellison has filed numerous grievance filings and lawsuit attempts that have been characterized as both justifiable and frivolous  His friend Isaac Asimov noted  Harlan uses his gifts for colorful and variegated invective on those who irritate him   intrusive fans  obdurate editors  callous publishers  offensive strangers   Another friend  writer Robert Bloch  spoke at a roast for Ellison  saying that other people take infinite pains   Harlan gives them    edit  Aggiecon I In 1969  Ellison was Guest of Honor at Texas A amp M University s first science fiction convention  Aggiecon  where he reportedly 10  referred to the Corps of Cadets as     America s next generation of Nazis      inspired in part by the continuing Vietnam War  Although the university was no longer solely a military school  as of 1965   the studentry was predominantly made up of cadet members  Between Ellison s anti military remarks and a food fight that broke out in the ballroom of the hotel where the gathering was held  although according to Ellison in 2000  the food fight actually started in a Denny s because the staff disappeared and they could not get their check   the school s administration almost refused to approve the science fiction convention the next year  and no guest of honor was invited for the next two Aggiecons  However  Ellison was subsequently invited back as Guest of Honor for Aggiecon V  1974  and Aggiecon XXXI  2000    edit  The Starlost The screenplay for his projected television series The Starlost was also given a Writers Guild Award  though the actual series  produced in 1973 74  was so altered by the producers that Ellison had his name removed from the credits and replaced with the pseudonym  Cordwainer Bird   see above    edit  Star Trek Ellison has repeatedly criticized how Star Trek creator and producer Gene Roddenberry  and others  rewrote his original script for the episode  The City on the Edge of Forever   Ellison s original work included a subplot involving drug dealing aboard the Enterprise and other elements that Roddenberry rejected  Despite his objections  he kept his legal name on the result instead of using his  Cordwainer Bird  nom de plume  see  Pseudonyms   above   Ellison s original script was eventually reprinted in the 1976 collection Six Science Fiction Plays  edited by Roger Elwood  In 1995  White Wolf Publishing released Harlan Ellison s The City on the Edge of Forever  a book that included the original script  several story treatments  and a long introductory essay by Ellison explaining his position on what he called a  fatally inept treatment   Both versions won prestigious awards  Wikinews has related news  Harlan Ellison sues CBS Paramount  WGA over Star Trek royalties On March 13  2009  Ellison sued CBS Paramount Television  seeking payment of 25  of net receipts from merchandising  publishing  and other income from the episode since 1967  the suit also names the Writers Guild of America for allegedly failing to act on Ellison s behalf  On October 23  2009  Variety magazine reported that a settlement had been reached  11   edit  The Last Dangerous Visions The Last Dangerous Visions  TLDV   the third volume of Ellison s anthology series  has become science fiction s most famous unpublished book  It was originally announced for publication in 1973  but has not seen print to date  Nearly 150 writers  many now dead  submitted works for the volume  In 1993 Ellison threatened to sue New England Science Fiction Association  NESFA  for publishing  Himself in Anachron   a short story written by Cordwainer Smith and sold to Ellison for the book by his widow  12  but later reached an amicable settlement  13  British science fiction author Christopher Priest critiqued Ellison s editorial practices in an article entitled  The Book on the Edge of Forever   14  later expanded into a book  Priest documented a half dozen unfulfilled promises by Ellison to publish TLDV within a year of the statement  Priest claims he submitted a story at Ellison s request which Ellison retained for several months until Priest withdrew the story and demanded that Ellison return the manuscript  Ellison was incensed by  Book on the Edge of Forever  and has  personally or by proxy  threatened Priest on numerous occasions since its publication   15  Ellison has a record of fulfilling obligations in other instances  though sometimes  as with Harlan Ellison s Hornbook for Mirage Press  several decades after the contract was signed   including to writers whose stories he solicited   edit  I  Robot I  Robot   the Illustrated Screenplay Shortly after the release of Star Wars  1977   Ben Roberts contacted Ellison to develop a script based on Isaac Asimov s I  Robot short story collection for Warner Brothers  In a meeting with studio head Robert Shapiro  Ellison concluded that Shapiro was commenting on the script without having read it  and accused him of having the  intellectual capacity of an artichoke   Shortly afterwards  Ellison was dropped from the project  Without Ellison  the film came to a dead end  because subsequent scripts were unsatisfactory to potential directors  After a change in studio heads  Warner allowed Ellison s script to be serialized in Isaac Asimov s Science Fiction Magazine and in book form  16  The 2004 film I  Robot  starring Will Smith  has no connection to Ellison s script   edit  I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream Ellison s iconic short story about  AM   a global AI  Artificial Intelligence  which unleashed its fury on humanity by extinguishing all human life down to a handful of trapped victims wandering in its world spanning interstices  and subject of its mordant whims and inventive  Old Testament like torments  has been turned into an early video game  and was purchased by a Hollywood studio for adaptation to the screen  but no script has been forthcoming thus far  The storyline is a combination of The Book of Job meets The Canterbury Tales transmuted into a Lovecraftian cybernetic realm   edit  Allegations of assault on Charles Platt In the 1980s  Ellison allegedly publicly assaulted author and critic Charles Platt at the Nebula Awards banquet  17  Platt did not pursue legal action against Ellison  and the two men later signed a  non aggression pact   promising never to discuss the incident again nor to have any contact with one another  Platt claims that Ellison has often publicly boasted about the incident  18   edit  Lawsuit against Fantagraphics On September 20  2006  Ellison sued Fantagraphics  a comic book publisher  claiming they had defamed him in their book Comics As Art  We told you so   19  The book recounts the history of Fantagraphics and discussed a lawsuit that resulted from a 1980 Ellison interview with Fantagraphics  industry news magazine  The Comics Journal  In this interview Ellison referred to comic book writer Michael Fleisher  calling him  bugfuck  and  derange o   Fleisher lost his libel suit against Ellison and Fantagraphics on December 9  1986  20  Ellison  after reading unpublished drafts of the book on Fantagraphics s website  believed that he had been defamed by several anecdotes related to this incident  He sued in the Superior Court for the State of California  in Santa Monica  Fantagraphics attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed  In their motion to dismiss  Fantagraphics argued that the statements were both their personal opinions and generally believed to be true anecdotes  On February 12  2007  the presiding judge ruled against Fantagraphics  anti SLAPP motion for dismissal  21  On June 29  2007  Ellison claimed that the litigation had been resolved 22  pending Fantagraphics  removal of all references to the case from their website  23  No money or apologies changed hands in the settlement as posted on August 17  2007  24   edit  With Connie Willis at Hugo Awards 2006 On August 26  2006  during the 64th World Science Fiction Convention  Ellison touched award winning novelist Connie Willis  breast while on stage at the Hugo Awards ceremony  25 Ellen Datlow described this as  a schtick of Harlan acting like a baby   26 Patrick Nielsen Hayden described this as  pathetic and nasty and sad and most of us didn t want to watch it   27  Ellison responded three days later  writing   I was unaware of any problem proceeding from my intendedly childlike grabbing of Connie Willis s left breast  as she was exhorting me to behave   He also posted that  I m glad  at last  to have transcended your expectations  I stand naked and defenseless before your absolutely correct chiding   On August 31 he posted   Would you be slightly less self righteous and chiding if I told you there was NO grab there was NO grope there was NO fondle   there was the slightest touch  A shtick  a gag between friends  absolutely NO sexual content  How about it  Mark  after playing straight man to Connie s very frequently demeaning public jackanapery toward me including treating me with considerable disrespect at the Grand Master Awards Weekend  where she put a chair down in front of her lectern as Master of Ceremonies  and made me sit there like a naughty child throughout her long  roast  of my life and career for more than 25 years  without once complaining  whaddaya think  Mark  am I even a leetle bit entitled to think that Connie likes to play  and geez ain t it sad that as long as SHE sets the rules for play  and I m the village idiot  she s cool   but gawd forbid I change the rules and play MY way for a change     and complained that Willis had not called him to discuss the matter  28   edit  Copyright suits Ellison claimed that James Cameron s film The Terminator drew from material from Ellison s  Soldier  29  and  Demon with a Glass Hand  30  episodes of The Outer Limits  Hemdale  the production company and the distributor Orion Pictures  settled out of court for an undisclosed sum  and adding a credit  acknowledging  the work of Ellison at the end of the film when released on video  31  Cameron objected to this acknowledgement  which was forced on him by the distributor  and has since labeled Ellison s claim a  nuisance suit   32  On April 24  2000 Ellison sued Stephen Robertson for posting four stories to the newsgroup  alt binaries e book  without authorization  The other defendants were AOL and RemarQ  internet service providers whose only involvement was running servers hosting the newsgroup  Ellison claimed that they had failed to stop the alleged copyright infringement in accordance with the  Notice and Takedown Procedure  outlined in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act  Robertson and RemarQ first settled with Ellison  and then AOL likewise settled with Ellison in June 2004  under conditions that were not made public  Since those settlements Ellison has initiated legal action and or takedown notices against more than 240 people who have distributed his writings on the Internet  saying   If you put your hand in my pocket  you ll drag back six inches of bloody stump   33  A lawsuit involving the film In Time  which Ellison contended plagiarizes his short story   Repent  Harlequin   Said the Ticktockman  was withdrawn after Ellison viewed the film  34  As part of the agreement to dismiss his lawsuit  Ellison has also agreed that each party will bear its own attorney fees   edit  Bibliography  edit  Novels and novellas Web of the City  1958   originally published
