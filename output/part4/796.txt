1798  to raise twelve additional regiments of infantry  the first 1  2  11th Infantry came into existence in the Army of the United States in January 1799  with Aaron Ogden as Lieutenant Colonel Commandant  It was raised for the  Quasi War  with France but saw no war service  The Act of February 20  1800  suspended enlistments for the new regiments  The Act of May 14  1800  authorized the President to discharge them  and under this authority the 11th Infantry was disbanded June 15  1800   edit  War of 1812 The second 1  2  11th U  S  regiment of infantry was organized on January 11  1812  when the Congress authorized a strengthening of the Regular Army in preparation for the threatening conflict that became known as the War of 1812  During the summer little was done in Vermont beyond organizing the 11th infantry  which seems to have consisted originally of six companies from Vermont and four from New Hampshire  The army gathered at Plattsburgh  New York  numbering about eight thousand men  of whom nearly one half were Vermonters  Among them was the 11th regiment of regulars under Col  Isaac Clark 3   12 March 1812 to 27 April 1814   1  On November 16  1812 the largest portion moved north under the immediate command of Maj  Gen  Henry Dearborn  then the senior officer of the army  and on November 18 encamped about half a mile south of the Canadian boundary line  The force there assembled numbered three thousand regulars and two thousand militia  while the entire British force on the northern frontier did not exceed three thousand  and of these not more than one thousand were within striking distance of the American army  When Dearborn was prepared to cross the line  the British Major Salaberry also prepared to meet him  Early in the morning of the November 20  a detachment of Dearborn s army forded the La Colle river and surrounded a British guard house  which was occupied by Canadian militia and a few Indians  who broke through the American lines and escaped unhurt  In the meantime a second party of the Americans had advanced  and commenced a sharp fire on those in possession of the ground  mistaking them for the British picket  This fire continued for nearly half an hour  when  being undeceived  both parties hastily retreated  leaving behind five killed and as many wounded  The troops immediately afterwards returned to Champlain  and on November 23 to Plattsburgh  when the militia were disbanded  and the 11th U  S  regiment was sent to Burlington  with the 9th  21st  and 25th  all under the command of Brig  Gen  John Chandler of Maine  3  The Vermont non intercourse act  passed November 6  1812  provided  that all officers  civil and military  of this State  shall aid in currying this act into full force    and therefore  immediately after the return of the 11th U  S  regiment and militia from Pittsburgh  a vigorous enforcement of the act along the northern boundary line of Vermont was commenced  In this work Col  Isaac Clark of the 11th Infantry regiment  and Lieut  Col  Edward Fifield of the militia  were conspicuous  3  February 10  1813  the Secretary of War ordered Gen  Dearborn to move the two brigades at Plattsburgh  Bloomfield s and Chandler s  numbering 2480 men   to Sackett s Harbor  and March 14 Dearborn complied  leaving no troops at Plattsburgh  and only the 11th regiment of infantry and a company of artillery at Burlington  The 11th Infantry regiment was not full at that time  but was to be filled in a few weeks  3  May 13  1813  five hundred men from the 11th Infantry regiment  being the first battalion  were ordered to Sackett s Harbor  and on May 31 left Burlington under the command of Lieut  Col  Timothy Upham  3  This 11th Infantry Regiment participated in the following  the

was Moody Bedel  4 September 1814 to 17 May 1815   1  became a brigadier general during the War of 1812  He was the son of Timothy Bedel a commander during the American Revolution  Moody Bedel s son John Bedel was a brigadier general of volunteers during the American Civil War  It was consolidated May October 1815 with a company of the 25th Infantry and a company each of the 27th  29th  and 37th Infantry to form a company of the 6th Infantry  The present 6th United States Infantry traces its lineage back to this 11th Infantry Regiment  for the First U S  6th Infantry Regiment see  2nd
