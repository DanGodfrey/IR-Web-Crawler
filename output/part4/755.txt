structure  is the result of the combination of several large U S  banking companies over the last decade including Chase Manhattan Bank  J P  Morgan  amp  Co   Bank One  Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual  Going back further  its predecessors include major banking firms among which are Chemical Bank  Manufacturers Hanover  First Chicago Bank  National Bank of Detroit  Texas Commerce Bank  Providian Financial and Great Western Bank  The current J P Morgan logo used for the company s Investment Banking  Asset Management  and Treasury  amp  Securities Services units  as of June 2008  14   edit  Chemical Banking Corporation Main article  Chemical Banking Corporation The New York Chemical Manufacturing Company was founded in 1823 as a maker of various chemicals  In 1824  the company amended its charter to perform banking activities and created the Chemical Bank of New York  After 1851  the bank was separated from its parent and grew organically and through a series of mergers  most notably with Corn Exchange Bank in 1954  Texas Commerce Bank  a large bank in Texas  in 1986  and Manufacturer s Hanover Trust Company in 1991  the first major bank merger  among equals    In the 1980s and early 1990s  Chemical emerged as one of the leaders in the financing of leveraged buyout transactions  In 1984  Chemical launched Chemical Venture Partners to invest in private equity transactions alongside various financial sponsors  By the late 1980s  Chemical developed its reputation for financing buyouts  building a syndicated leveraged finance business and related advisory businesses under the auspices of pioneering investment banker  Jimmy Lee  15  16  At many points throughout this history  Chemical Bank was the largest bank in the United States  either in terms of assets or deposit market share   In 1996  Chemical Bank acquired the Chase Manhattan Corporation taking the more prominent Chase name  In 2000  the combined company acquired J P  Morgan  amp  Co  and combined the two names to form what is today JPMorgan Chase  amp  Co  JPMorgan Chase retains Chemical Bank s headquarters at 270 Park Avenue and stock price history   edit  Chase Manhattan Bank Main article  Chase Manhattan Bank Logo used by Chase following the merger with the Manhattan Bank in 1955  The Chase Manhattan Bank was formed upon the 1955 purchase of Chase National Bank  established in 1877  by the Bank of the Manhattan Company  established in 1799   17  the company s oldest predecessor institution  The Bank of the Manhattan Company was the creation of Aaron Burr  who transformed The Manhattan Company from a water carrier into a bank  Led by David Rockefeller during the 1970s and the 1980s  Chase Manhattan emerged as one of the largest and most prestigious banking concerns  with leadership positions in syndicated lending  treasury and securities services  credit cards  mortgages  and retail financial services  Weakened by the real estate collapse in the early 1990s  it was acquired by Chemical Bank in 1996 retaining the prominent Chase name  Prior to its notable merger with J P  Morgan  amp  Co   the new Chase expanded the investment and asset management groups through two acquisitions  In 1999  it acquired San Francisco based Hambrecht  amp  Quist for  1 35 billion  In April 2000  UK based Robert Fleming  amp  Co  was sold to the new Chase Manhattan Bank for  7 7 billion  According to page 114 of An Empire of Wealth by John Steele Gordon  the origin of this strand of JPMorgan Chase s history runs as follows  At the turn of the nineteenth century  obtaining a bank charter required an act of the state legislature  This of course injected a powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual  Hamilton s political enemy and eventual murderer Aaron Burr was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company  called the Manhattan Company  to provide clean water to New York City  The innocuous looking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise  Within six months of the company s creation  and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe  the company opened a bank  the Bank of the Manhattan Company  Still in existence  it is today J P Morgan Chase  the second largest bank in the United States   edit  J P  Morgan  amp  Company Main article  J P  Morgan  amp  Co  J P  Morgan  amp  Co  logo before its merger with Chase Manhattan Bank in 2000 The heritage of the House of Morgan traces its roots to the partnership of Drexel  Morgan  amp  Co   which in 1895 was renamed J P  Morgan  amp  Co   see also  J  Pierpont Morgan   Arguably the most influential financial institution of its era  J P  Morgan  amp  Co  financed the formation of the United States Steel Corporation  which took over the business of Andrew Carnegie and others and was the world s first billion dollar corporation  In 1895  J P  Morgan  amp  Co  supplied the United States government with  62 million in gold to float a bond issue and restore the treasury surplus of  100 million  In 1892  the company began to finance the New York  New Haven and Hartford Railroad and led it through a series of acquisitions that made it the dominant railroad transporter in New England  Although his name was big  Morgan owned only 19  of Morgan assets  The rest was owned by the Rothschild family following a series of bailouts and rescues attributed by some to Morgan s stubborn will and seemingly  non existent  investment savvy  September 16  1920  a bomb exploded in front of the headquarters of J P  Morgan Inc  at 23 Wall Street  injuring 400 and killing 38 people  Built in 1914  23 Wall Street was known as the  House of Morgan   and for decades the bank s headquarters was the most important address in American finance  At noon  on September 16  1920  a terrorist bomb exploded in front of the bank  injuring 400 and killing 38  Shortly before the bomb went off  a warning note was placed in a mailbox at the corner of Cedar Street and Broadway  The warning read   Remember we will not tolerate any longer  Free the political prisoners or it will be sure death for all of you  American Anarchists Fighters   While there are many hypotheses regarding who was behind the bombing and why they did it  after 20 years of investigation the FBI rendered the case inactive without ever finding the perpetrators  In August 1914  Henry P  Davison  a Morgan partner  traveled to the UK and made a deal with the Bank of England to make J P  Morgan  amp  Co  the monopoly underwriter of war bonds for the UK and France  The Bank of England became a  fiscal agent  of J P  Morgan  amp  Co   and vice versa  The company also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France  Thus  the company profited from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments  In the 1930s  all of J P  Morgan  amp  Co  along with all integrated banking businesses in the United States  was required by the provisions of the Glass Steagall Act to separate its investment banking from its commercial banking operations  J P  Morgan  amp  Co  chose to operate as a commercial bank  because at the time commercial lending was perceived as more profitable and prestigious  Additionally  many within J P  Morgan believed that a change in political climate would eventually allow the company to resume its securities businesses but it would be nearly impossible to reconstitute the bank if it were disassembled  In 1935  after being barred from securities business for over a year  the heads of J P  Morgan spun off its investment banking operations  Led by J P  Morgan partners  Henry S  Morgan  son of Jack Morgan and grandson of J  Pierpont Morgan  and Harold Stanley  Morgan Stanley was founded on September 16  1935 with  6 6 million of nonvoting preferred stock from J P  Morgan partners  In order to bolster its position  in 1959  J P  Morgan merged with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York to form the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company  The bank would continue to operate as Morgan Guaranty Trust until the 1980s  before beginning to migrate back toward the use of the J P  Morgan brand  In 1984  the group finally purchased the Purdue National Corporation of Lafayette Indiana  uniting a history between the two figures of Salmon Portland Chase and John Purdue  In 1988  the company once again began operating exclusively as J P  Morgan  amp  Co   edit  Bank One Corporation Main article  Bank One Corporation In 2004  JPMorgan Chase merged with Chicago based Bank One Corp   bringing on board current chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon as president and COO and designating him as CEO William B  Harrison  Jr  s successor  Dimon s pay was pegged at 90  of Harrison s  Dimon quickly made his influence felt by embarking on a cost cutting strategy  and replaced former JPMorgan Chase executives in key positions with Bank One executives many of whom were with Dimon at Citigroup  Dimon became CEO in January 2006 and Chairman in December 2006  Bank One Corporation was formed upon the 1998 merger between Banc One of Columbus  Ohio and First Chicago NBD  These two large banking companies had themselves been created through the merger of many banks  This merger was largely considered a failure until Dimon recently ousted as President of Citigroup took over and reformed the new firm s practices especially its disastrous technology mishmash inherited from the many mergers prior to this one  Dimon effected more than sufficient changes to make Bank One Corporation a viable merger partner for JPMorgan Chase  Bank One Corporation traced its roots to First Bancgroup of Ohio  founded as a holding company for City National Bank of Columbus  Ohio and several other banks in that state  all of which were renamed  Bank One  when the holding company was renamed Banc One Corporation  With the beginning of interstate banking they spread into other states  always renaming acquired banks  Bank One   though for a long time they resisted combining them into one bank  After the First Chicago NBD merger  adverse financial results led to the departure of CEO John B  McCoy  whose father and grandfather had headed Banc One and predecessors  Dimon was brought in to head the company  JPMorgan Chase completed the acquisition of Bank One in the third quarter of 2004  The former Bank One and First Chicago headquarters in Chicago serve as the headquarters of Chase  JPMorgan Chase s commercial and retail banking subsidiary   edit  Bear Stearns Main article  Bear Stearns Bear Stearns logo At the end of 2007  Bear Stearns  amp  Co  Inc  was the fifth largest investment bank in the United States but its market capitalization had deteriorated through the second half of 2007  On Friday  March 14  2008 Bear Stearns lost 47  of its equity market value to close at  30 00 per share as rumors emerged that clients were withdrawing capital from the bank  Over the following weekend it emerged that Bear Stearns might prove insolvent and on or around March 15  2008 the Federal Reserve engineered a deal to prevent a wider systemic crisis from the collapse of Bear Stearns  On March 16  2008  after a weekend of intense negotiations between JPMorgan  Bear  and the federal government  JPMorgan Chase announced that it had plans to acquire Bear Stearns in a stock swap worth  2 00 per share or  240 million pending shareholder approval scheduled within 90 days  In the interim  JPMorgan Chase agreed to guarantee all Bear Stearns trades and business process flows  18  Two days later  on March 18  2008  JPMorgan Chase formally announced the acquisition of Bear Stearns for  236 million  The stock swap agreement was signed in the late night hours of March 18  2008  with JPMorgan agreeing to exchange 0 05473 of each of its shares upon closure of the merger for one Bear share  valuing the Bear shares at  2 each   19  On March 24  2008  after considerable public discontent by Bear Stearns shareholders over the low acquisition price threatened the deal s closure  a revised offer was announced at approximately  10 per share  Under the revised terms  JPMorgan also immediately acquired a 39 5  stake in Bear Stearns  using newly issued shares  at the new offer price and gained a commitment from the board  representing another 10  of the share capital  that its members would vote in favor of the new deal  With sufficient commitments thus in hand to ensure a successful shareholder vote  the merger was completed on June 2  2008   edit  Washington Mutual Main article  Washington Mutual The Washington Mutual logo prior to its acquisition by JPMorgan Chase  On September 25  2008  JPMorgan Chase bought most of the banking operations of Washington Mutual from the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  That night  the Office of Thrift Supervision  in what was by far the largest bank failure in American history  had seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into receivership  The FDIC sold the bank s assets  secured debt obligations and deposits to JPMorgan Chase  amp  Co for  1 836 billion  which re opened the bank the following day  As a result of the takeover  Washington Mutual shareholders lost all their equity  20  JPMorgan Chase raised  10 billion in a stock sale to cover writedowns and losses after taking on deposits and branches of Washington Mutual  21  Through the acquisition  JPMorgan now owns the former accounts of Providian Financial  a credit card issuer WaMu acquired in 2005  The company announced plans to complete the rebranding of Washington Mutual branches to Chase by late 2009  Chief executive Alan H  Fishman was flying from New York to Seattle on the day the bank was closed  and eventually received a  7 5 million sign on bonus and cash severance of  11 6 million after being CEO for 17 days   edit  Other recent acquisitions In 2006  JPMorgan Chase purchased Collegiate Funding Services  a portfolio company of private equity firm Lightyear Capital  for  663 million  CFS was used as the foundation for the Chase Student Loans  previously known as Chase Education Finance  22  In April 2006  JPMorgan Chase announced it would swap its corporate trust unit for The Bank of New York Co  s retail and small business banking network  The swap valued The Bank of New York business at  3 1 billion and JPMorgan s trust unit at  2 8 billion and gave Chase access to 338 additional branches and 700 000 new customers in New York  New Jersey  and Indiana  In March 2008  JPMorgan acquired the UK based carbon offsetting company ClimateCare  23  In November 2009  JPMorgan announced it would acquire the
