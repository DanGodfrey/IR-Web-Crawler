Etymology Further information  Great Zimbabwe and Rhodesia  name  Zimbabwe was formerly known as Southern Rhodesia  1923   Rhodesia  1965   and Zimbabwe Rhodesia  1979   The name Zimbabwe was introduced from ca  1960 in the context of the potential name of the country once independent  and used by the African nationalist factions in the Rhodesian Bush War  the most major of which were the Zimbabwe African National Union  led by Robert Mugabe from 1975   and the Zimbabwe African People s Union  led by Joshua Nkomo from its founding in the early 1960s  The name is based on a Shona name for a ruined ancient settlement whose remains are now a protected site  It is officially referred to as Great Zimbabwe  and was first recorded as Symbaoe in 1531 by Vicente Pegado  Captain of the Portuguese Garrison of Sofala  There are two theories on the origin of the word  Zimbabwe   Various sources hold that the word is derived from dzimba dza mabwe  translated from the Karanga dialect of Shona as  large houses of stone   dzimba   plural of imba   house   mabwe   plural of bwe   stone    8  9  10  The Karanga speaking Shona people are found around Great Zimbabwe in the modern day province of Masvingo  Archaeologist Peter Garlake claims that  Zimbabwe  is a contracted form of dzimba hwe which means  venerated houses  in the Zezuru dialect of Shona  and is usually applied to chiefs  houses or graves  11   edit  Geography and environment Main article  Geography of Zimbabwe Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa  lying between latitudes 15  and 23 S  and longitudes 25  and 34 E  Most of the country is elevated in the central plateau  high veld  stretching from the southwest to the northwest at altitudes between 1200 and 1600m  The country s east is mountainous with Mt  Nyangani as the highest point at 2 592 m  About 20  of the country consists of the low veld under 900m  Victoria Falls  one of the world s biggest and most spectacular waterfalls  is located in the country s northwest as part of the Zambezi river  The country has a tropical climate with a rainy season usually from late October to March  The climate is moderated by the altitude   edit  Flora and fauna Main article  Wildlife of Zimbabwe Elephant at water hole in Hwange National Park  The country is mostly savanna  although the moist and mountainous east supports tropical evergreen and hardwood forests  Trees include teak and mahogany  knobthorn  msasa  and baobab  Among the numerous flowers and shrubs are hibiscus  spider lily  leonotus  cassia  tree wisteria  and dombeya  Mammals include Hippopotamus  Rhinoceros  Baboon  Okapi  Giraffe  Kudu  Sable  Zebra  Warthog  Porcupine  Badger  Otter  Hare  and many more  In all  there are around 350 species of mammal  Snakes and lizards abound  The largest lizard  the water monitor  is found in many rivers  as are several species of crocodile  More than 500 species of birds like the Ant thrush  Barbet  Bee eater  Bishop bird  Bulbul  Bush warbler  Guineafowl  Emerald cuckoo  Grouse  Gray lourie  and Pheasant  Not forgetting the Insect kingdom  Zimbabwe has quite an incredible biodiversity  However  it contains a large amount of the conventional tropical flora and the African fauna  Mostly blanketed with savanna grasslands  its mountains nevertheless consist of evergreen forests  The chief animals of the country are the Big Five  a few Primates and Antelope   A diverse variety of marine and avian fauna is also to be found amongst the 131 species of Fish  the tiger fish is a speciality   For further

wildlife  Poverty  population growth and lack of fuel have led to extensive deforestation  which  along with poaching  has reduced the wildlife considerably  Deforestation and woodland degradation are a major concern 12  and have led to erosion and land degradation which diminish the amount of fertile soil  Despite all this  Zimbabwe s climate  along with Malta s  has been ranked highly on the index for the best climate to live in by some prestigious organisations   edit  History Main article  History of Zimbabwe  edit  Pre colonial era  1000 1887  Further information  Bantu expansion Towers of Great Zimbabwe  Proto Shona speaking societies first emerged in the middle Limpopo valley in the 9th century before moving on to the Zimbabwean highlands  The Zimbabwean plateau eventually became the center of subsequent Shona states  beginning in ca  the 10th century  Around the early 10th century  trade developed with Arab merchants on the Indian Ocean coast  helping to develop the Kingdom of Mapungubwe in the 11th century  This was the precursor to the more impressive Shona civilisations that would dominate the region during the 13th to 15th centuries  evidenced by ruins at Great Zimbabwe  near Masvingo  and other smaller sites  The main archaeological site is a unique dry stone architecture  The Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of sophisticated trade states developed in Zimbabwe by the time of the first European explorers from Portugal  They traded in gold  ivory and copper for cloth and glass  13  From about 1300 until 1600  Mapungubwe was eclipsed by the Kingdom of Zimbabwe  This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe s stone architecture  which survives to this day at the ruins of the kingdom s capital of Great Zimbabwe  From c  1450 1760  Zimbabwe gave way to the Kingdom of Mutapa  This Shona state ruled much of the area that is known as Zimbabwe today  and parts of central Mozambique  It is known by many names including the Mutapa Empire  also known as Mwene Mutapa or Monomotapa as well as  Munhumutapa   and was renowned for its gold trade routes with Arabs and the Portuguese  Portuguese settlers destroyed the trade and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century  13  As a direct response to the Portuguese presence in the interior  a new Shona state emerged called the Rozvi Empire  Relying on centuries of military  political and religious development  the Rozvi  which means  destroyers   removed the Portuguese from the Zimbabwe plateau by force of arms  The Rozvi continued the stone building traditions of the Zimbabwe and Mapungubwe kingdoms while adding guns to its arsenal and developing a professional army to protect its trade routes and conquests  Around 1821  the Zulu general Mzilikazi  meaning The Great Road  of the Khumalo clan successfully rebelled from King Shaka and set up his own tribe  the Ndebele  The tribe fought its way northwards into the Transvaal leaving a trail of destruction in its wake and beginning an era of widespread killings and devastation known as the Mfecane  When the Boer settlers  descendants of Dutch and other Europeans  arrived in the Transvaal in 1836 during the Great Trek they attacked the Ndebele and drove the tribe even further northward  In 1837 38  the Rozvi Empire along with other Shona states were conquered by the Ndebele and forced to pay tribute and concentrate in the northeast of present day Zimbabwe  After losing the Transvaal in 1840  Mzilikazi and his tribe settled the southwest of present day Zimbabwe in what became known as Matabeleland and established Bulawayo as their capital  Mzilikazi then organised his followers into a military system with regimental kraals  similar to those of Shaka  which became strong enough to repel the Boer attacks of 1847 1851 and persuade the government of the South African Republic to sign a peace treaty with him in 1852  Mzilikazi died in 1868 and after a brief  violent power struggle was succeeded by his son  Lobengula   edit  Colonial era  1888 1965  Main articles  Southern Rhodesia and Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Matabeleland in the 19th century  In the 1880s  the British arrived with colonialist Cecil Rhodes s British South Africa Company  14  In 1888  Rhodes obtained a concession for mining rights from King Lobengula of the Ndebele peoples  15  He presented this concession to persuade the government of the United Kingdom to grant a royal charter to his British South Africa Company  BSAC  over Matabeleland  and its subject states such as Mashonaland  16  Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column  a group of white settlers protected by well armed British South Africa Police  BSAP  through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury  now Harare   In 1893 and 1894  with the help of their new maxim guns  the BSAP would go on to defeat the Ndebele in the First Matabele War  a war which also resulted in the death of King Lobengula  Rhodes sought permission to negotiate similar concessions covering all territory between the Limpopo River and Lake Tanganyika  then known as  Zambesia   16  In accordance with the terms of aforementioned concessions and treaties  16  Rhodes promoted the colonisation of the region s land  with British control over labour as well as precious metals and other mineral resources  17  In 1895 the BSAC adopted the name  Rhodesia  for the territory of Zambesia  in honour of Rhodes  In 1898  Southern Rhodesia  became the official denotation for the region south of the Zambezi  18  which later became Zimbabwe  The region to the north was administered separately by the BSAC and later named Northern Rhodesia  now Zambia   Shortly after the disastrous Jameson Raid on the South African Republic  the Ndebele were led by their spiritual leader Mlimo against the white colonials and thus began the Second Matabele War  1896 97   The Shona also staged unsuccessful revolts  known as Chimurenga  against encroachment upon their lands  by clients of BSAC and Cecil Rhodes in 1896 and 1897  19  Following the failed insurrections of 1896 97 the Ndebele and Shona groups became subject to Rhodes s administration thus precipitating European settlement en masse which led to land distribution disproportionately favouring Europeans  displacing the Shona  Ndebele  and other indigenous peoples  Opening of the railway to Umtali in 1899 Southern Rhodesia became a self governing British colony in October 1923  subsequent to a 1922 referendum  Rhodesians served on behalf of the United Kingdom during World War II  mainly in the East African Campaign against Axis forces in Italian East Africa  Proportional to  European descended  population  Southern Rhodesia contributed more to both the First and Second World Wars than any other part of the Empire  including Britain itself  20  In 1953  in the face of African opposition  21  Britain consolidated the two colonies of Rhodesia with Nyasaland in the ill fated Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland which was dominated by Southern Rhodesia  Growing African nationalism and general dissent  particularly in Nyasaland  persuaded Britain to dissolve the Union in 1963  forming three colonies  As colonial rule was ending throughout the continent and as African majority governments assumed control in neighbouring Northern Rhodesia  Zambia  and in Nyasaland  Malawi   the white minority Rhodesian government led by Ian Smith s Rhodesian Front  RF  dropped the designation  Southern  in 1964 and issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence  commonly abbreviated to  UDI   from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965  effectively repudiating the recently adopted British policy of  no independence before majority rule   It was the first declaration of independence by a British colony since the American declaration of 1776  which was indeed claimed by the Rhodesian government to provide a precedent  20   edit  Independence and civil war  1965 1979  Main articles  Rhodesia  Rhodesian Bush War  Zimbabwe Rhodesia  and Lancaster House Agreement Ian Smith signing the Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965 with his cabinet watching  After UDI  the British government requested United Nations economic sanctions against Rhodesia as negotiations with the Smith administration in 1966 and 1968 ended in stalemate  The United Kingdom deemed the Rhodesian declaration an act of rebellion  but did not re establish control by force  A civil war ensued  with Joshua Nkomo s Zimbabwe African People s Union  ZAPU  and Robert Mugabe s Zimbabwe African National Union  ZANU  using assistance from the governments of Zambia and Mozambique  the latter following its independence from Portugal in 1975   Smith s declaration of a republic in 1970 was recognised only by South Africa  22  23  then governed by its apartheid administration  24  25  Over the years  the fighting against Ian Smith s government intensified  As a result  the Smith government opened negotiations with the leaders of ZAPU and ZANU  Bishop Abel Muzorewa signs the Lancaster House Agreement seated next to British Foreign Minister Lord Carrington  In March 1978  with his regime near the brink of collapse  Smith signed an accord with three African leaders  led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa  who offered safeguards for white civilians  As a result of the Internal Settlement  elections were held in April 1979  The United African National Council  UANC  party won a majority in this election  On 1 June 1979  the leader of UANC  Abel Muzorewa  became the country s prime minister and the country s name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia  The internal settlement left control of the country s police  security forces  civil service and judiciary in white hands  It assured whites of about one third of the seats in parliament  26  On 12 June  the United States Senate voted to end economic sanctions against Zimbabwe Rhodesia  Following the fifth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting  CHOGM   held in Lusaka  Zambia from 1 to 7 August in 1979  the British government invited Muzorewa and the leaders of the Patriotic Front to participate in a constitutional conference at Lancaster House  The purpose of the conference was to discuss and reach an agreement on the terms of an independence constitution and that elections should be supervised under British authority to enable Rhodesia to proceed to legal independence and the parties to settle their differences by political means  27  Lord Carrington  Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom  chaired the conference  27  The conference took place from 10 September to 15 December in 1979 with 47 plenary sessions  On 1 December 1979  delegations from the British and Rhodesian governments and the Patriotic Front

elections of February 1980  Robert Mugabe and his ZANU won a landslide victory  29  There was opposition to a Shona win in Matabeleland  In November 1980 Enos Nkala made remarks at a rally in Bulawayo  in which he warned ZAPU that ZANU would deliver a few blows against them  This started the first Entumbane uprising  in which ZIPRA and ZANLA fought for two days  30  In February 1981 there was a second uprising  which spread to Glenville and also to Connemara in the Midlands  ZIPRA troops in other parts of Matabeleland headed for Bulawayo to join the battle  and ex Rhodesian units had to come in to stop the fighting  Over 300 people were killed  These uprisings led to what has become known as Gukurahundi  Shona   the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains  31   or the Matabeleland Massacres  which ran from 1982 until 1985  Mugabe used his North Korean trained Fifth Brigade to crush any resistance in Matabeleland  It has been estimated that at least 20 000 Matabele were murdered and tens of thousands of others were tortured in camps such as the Valagwe camp  where 2 3000 people could be detained for torture and interrogation at any one time  32  The violence ended after ZANU and ZAPU reached a unity agreement in 1988 that merged the two parties  creating ZANU PF  33  34  Elections in March 1990 resulted in another victory for Mugabe and his party  which won 117 of the 120 election seats  Election observers estimated voter turnout at only 54  and found the campaign neither free nor fair  35  36  During the 1990s students  trade unionists and workers often demonstrated to express their discontent with the government  Students protested in 1990 against proposals for an increase in government control of universities and again in 1991 and 1992 when they clashed with police  Trade unionists and workers also criticised the government during this time  In 1992 police prevented trade unionists from holding anti government demonstrations  In 1994 widespread industrial unrest weakened the economy  In 1996 civil servants  nurses  and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues  37  38  The general health of the civilian population also began to significantly flounder  By 1997 an estimated 25  of the population of Zimbabwe had been infected by HIV  39   edit  Economic difficulties and hyperinflation  1999 2008  Land issues  which the liberation movement had promised to solve  re emerged as the main issue for the ruling party around 1997  Despite majority rule and the existence of a  willing buyer willing seller  land reform programme since the 1980s  whites made up less than 1  of the population but held about 70  of the most arable land  40  Mugabe began to redistribute land to blacks in 2000 with a compulsory land redistribution  Harare in 2006 Eventually a wide range of sanctions 41  42  43  were imposed by the US government and European Union against the person of Mugabe  individuals  private companies  parastatals  and the government of Zimbabwe  The legality and constitutionality of the process has regularly been challenged in the Zimbabwean High and Supreme Courts  The confiscation of the farmland was affected by continuous droughts and lack of inputs and finance led to a sharp decline in agricultural exports  which was traditionally the country s leading export producing sector  44  Mining and tourism have surpassed agriculture  As a result  Zimbabwe experienced a severe hard currency shortage that led to hyperinflation and chronic shortages in imported fuel and consumer goods  In 2002  Zimbabwe was suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations on charges of human rights abuses during the land redistribution and of election tampering  45  In 2003  the Zimbabwe government terminated its Commonwealth membership  46  Following elections in 2005  the government initiated  Operation Murambatsvina   an effort to crack down on illegal markets and homes that had seen slums emerge in towns and cities  This action has been widely condemned by opposition and international figures  who charge that it has left a substantial section of urban poor homeless  47  The Zimbabwe government has described the operation as an attempt to provide decent housing to the population although they have yet to deliver any new housing for the forcibly removed people  48  A map showing the food insecurity in Zimbabwe in June 2008  Zimbabwe s current economic and food crisis  described by some observers as the country s worst humanitarian crisis since independence  has been attributed in varying degrees to the government s price controls and land confiscations  the HIV AIDS epidemic  and a drought affecting the entire region  49  Life expectancy at birth for males in Zimbabwe has dramatically declined since 1990 from 60 to 42 years  among the lowest in the world  The amount of time a Zimbabwean citizen is expected to live healthily from birth is 39 years  50  Concurrently  the infant mortality rate has climbed from 53 to 81 deaths per 1 000 live births in the same period  As of 2009 update   1 2 million Zimbabweans live with HIV  51  On 29 March 2008  Zimbabwe held a presidential election along with a parliamentary election  The three major candidates were Robert Mugabe of the Zimbabwe African National Union   Patriotic Front  ZANU PF   Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change   Tsvangirai  MDC T   and Simba Makoni  an independent  The results of this election were withheld for two weeks  following which it was generally acknowledged that the MDC had achieved a majority of one seat in lower house of parliament  Mugabe retained control because after the  recount  which was done behind close doors without independent monitors Tsvangirai no longer had the margin required by Zimbabwean law citation needed   Hence  the doctored election results that would otherwise put Mugabe out of power  failed the opposition weasel words   In late 2008  problems in Zimbabwe reached crisis proportions in the areas of living standards  public health  with a major cholera outbreak in December  and various public considerations  52  Mining of diamonds at Marange in Chiadzwa became the subject of international attention as the World Diamond Council called for a clampdown on smuggling 53  and illegal miners were reported killed by the military  54   edit  2008 present In September 2008  a power sharing agreement was reached between Mugabe and Tsvangirai  in which Mugabe remained president and Tsvangirai became prime minister  Due to ministerial differences between their respective political parties  the agreement was not fully implemented until 13 February 2009  two days after the swearing in of Tsvangirai as Prime Minister of Zimbabwe  In November 2010  the IMF described the Zimbabwean economy as  completing its second year of buoyant economic growth after a decade of economic decline   mentioning  strengthening policies  and  favorable shocks  as main reasons for the economic growth  55  In December 2010 President Mugabe threatened to further expropriate privately owned companies unless  western sanctions  were lifted  He said   Why should we continue having companies and organisations that are supported by Britain and America without hitting back  Time has come for us to  take  revenge  We can read the riot act and say this is 51 percent we are taking and if the sanctions persist we are taking over 100 percent   56  Journalist Nicholas D  Kristof reported that life continues to be considerably worse for the majority of the nation than under the Rhodesian Front government  this despite improvements since the beginning of the power sharing government  57  However more recent studies  such as a 2011 survey by Freedom House  suggest that living conditions have improved on a wide front since the power sharing agreement  58  The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs states in its 2012 2013 planning document that the  humanitarian situation has improved in Zimbabwe since 2009  but conditions remain precarious for many people   59   edit  Administrative divisions

Bulawayo Harare Harare Manicaland Mutare Mashonaland Central Bindura Mashonaland East Marondera Mashonaland West Chinhoyi Masvingo Masvingo city Matabeleland North Lupane District Matabeleland South Gwanda Midlands Gweru The names of most of the provinces were generated from the Mashonaland and Matabeleland divide at the time of colonisation  Mashonaland was the territory occupied first by the British South Africa Company Pioneer Column and Matabeleland the territory conquered during the First Matabele War  This corresponds roughly to the precolonial territory of the Shona people and the Matabele people  although there are significant ethnic minorities in most provinces  Each province is headed by a Provincial Governor  appointed by the President  61  The provincial government is run by a Provincial Administrator  appointed by the Public Service Commission  Other government functions at provincial level are carried out by provincial offices of national government departments  62  The provinces are subdivided into 59 districts and 1 200 wards  sometimes referred to as municipalities   Each district is headed by a District Administrator  appointed by the Public Service Commission  There is also a Rural District Council  which appoints a Chief Executive Officer  The Rural District Council is composed of elected ward councillors  the District Administrator and one representative of the chiefs  traditional leaders appointed under customary law  in the district  Other government functions at district level are carried out by district offices of national government departments  63  At the ward level there is a Ward Development Committee  comprising the elected ward councillor  the kraalheads  traditional leaders subordinate to chiefs  and representatives of Village Development Committees  Wards are subdivided into villages  each of which has an elected Village Development Committee and a Headman  traditional leader subordinate to the

Parliament  President Robert Mugabe s Zimbabwe African National Union   Patriotic Front  commonly abbreviated ZANU PF  has been the dominant political party in Zimbabwe since independence  66  In 1987 then prime minister Mugabe revised the constitution  abolishing the ceremonial presidency and the prime ministerial posts to form an executive president  a Presidential system  His ZANU party has won every election since independence  in 1990 election the second placed party  Edgar Tekere s Zimbabwe Unity Movement  winning only 20  of the vote  67  During the 1995 parliamentary elections most opposition parties  including the ZUM  boycotted the voting  resulting in a near sweep by the ruling party  68  When the opposition returned to the polls in 2000  they won 57 seats  only five fewer than ZANU  68  Presidential elections were again held in 2002 amid allegations of vote rigging  intimidation and fraud  69  The 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections were held on 31 March and multiple claims of vote rigging  election fraud and intimidation were made by the MDC and Jonathan Moyo  calling for investigations into 32 of the 120 constituencies  70  Jonathan Moyo participated in the elections despite the allegations and won a seat as an independent member of Parliament  General elections were again held in Zimbabwe on 30 March 2008  71  The official results required a runoff between Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai  the opposition leader  the MDC challenged these results  citation needed  claiming widespread election fraud by the Mugabe government  The runoff was scheduled for 27 June 2008  On 22 June  citing the continuing unfairness of the process and refusing to participate in a  violent  illegitimate sham of an election process   Tsvangirai pulled out of the presidential run off  the ZEC held the run off and President Mugabe received a landslide majority  72  The MDC T led by Morgan Tsvangirai is now the majority in the Lower chamber of Parliament  The MDC split into two factions  One faction  MDC M   now led by Arthur Mutambara contested the elections to the Senate  while the other  led by Morgan Tsvangirai  opposed to contesting the elections  stating that participation in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe s claim that past elections were free and fair  The opposition parties have resumed participation in national and local elections as recently as 2006  The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2006 with Morgan Tsvangirai being elected to lead MDC T  which has become more popular than the other group  73  Robert Mugabe with Chinese leader Hu Jintao  Mutambara  a robotics professor and former NASA robotics specialist has replaced Welshman Ncube who was the interim leader of MDC M after the split  Morgan Tsvangirai did not participate in the Senate elections  while the Mutambara faction participated and won five seats in the senate  The Mutambara formation has been weakened by defections from MPs and individuals who are disillusioned by their manifesto  As of 2008  the Movement for Democratic Change has become the most popular  with crowds as large as 20 000 attending their rallies as compared to between 500 5 000 for the other formation  73  On 28 April 2008  Tsvangirai and Mutambara announced at a joint news conference in Johannesburg that the two MDC formations were cooperating  enabling the MDC to have a clear parliamentary majority  74  75  Tsvangirai said that Mugabe could not remain President without a parliamentary majority  75  On the same day  Silaigwana announced that the recounts for the final five constituencies had been completed  that the results were being collated and that they would be published on 29 April  76  In mid September 2008  after protracted

Zimbabwe  Chapter X  96  1   which states that    For the purpose of defending Zimbabwe  there shall be defence forces consisting of an army  an air force and such other branches  if any  of the defence forces as may be provided for by or under an act of parliament  90    The ZDF was set up by the integration of three belligerent forces    the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army  ZANLA   the Zimbabwe People s Revolutionary Army  ZIPRA   and the Rhodesian Security Forces  RSF    after the Rhodesian Bush War and Zimbabwean independence in 1980  The integration period saw the formation of The Zimbabwe National Army  ZNA  and Air Force of Zimbabwe  AFZ  as separate entities under the command of Rtd General Solomon Mujuru and Air Marshal Norman Walsh who retired in 1982  and was replaced by Air Marshal Azim Daudpota who handed over command to the late Rtd Air Chief Marshal Josiah Tungamirai in 1985  Although integration took place in the ZNA  there was no integration in the Air Force of Zimbabwe  Ex ZIPRA and ex ZANLA members who joined the Air Force particularly between 1980 and early 1982 did so as individuals  Consequently  many did not make the so called  grade  and were dismissed from the Force unlike their colleagues in the ZNA who were protected by the integration directive  Before Norman Walsh left the Air Force  military aircraft were destroyed through sabotage at Thornhill Air Base in Gweru  in an operation believed to have been conducted by South African special forces  An number of white officers were arrested and tortured and this led to an exodus of white commissioned officers from the AFZ  The Government responded by transferring Major General Josiah Tungamirai from the ZNA to the AFZ  becoming an Air Vice Marshal  who later deputised Air Marshal Daudpota  seconded from the Pakistan Air Force  The integration commanders handed over the Zimbabwean flags to then Lieutenant General Vitalis Zvinavashe  who later became the first Commander Defence Forces  1993   and Air Marshal Perrance Shiri in 1992  and subsequently in the ZNA to then Lieutenant General Constantine Chiwenga in 1993  The approval of the Defence Amendment Bill saw the setting up of a single command for the Defence Forces in 1995  The late General Vitalis Zvinavashe became the first commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces  with the commanders of both the Army and the Air Force falling under his command  Following his retirement in December 2003  General Constantine Chiwenga  was promoted and appointed Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces  Lieutenant General P  V  Sibanda replaced him as Commander of the Army  90  The ZNA currently has an active duty strength of 30 000  The Air Force has about 5 139 men assigned  91  The Zimbabwe

Army Main article  Zimbabwe National Army Flag of the Army of Zimbabwe The Zimbabwe National Army or ZNA was created in 1980 from elements of the Rhodesian Army  integrated to a greater or lesser extent with combatants from the ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrilla movements  the armed wings of  respectively  ZANU and ZAPU   Following majority rule in early 1980  British Army trainers oversaw the integration of guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces  For the first year a system was followed where the top performing candidate became battalion commander  If he or she was from ZANLA  then his or her second in command was the top performing ZIPRA candidate  and vice versa  93  This ensured a balance between the two movements in the command structure  From early 1981 this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments  and ZANLA ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA  The ZNA was originally formed into four brigades  composed of a total of 28 battalions  The brigade support units were composed almost entirely of specialists of the former Rhodesian Army  while unintegrated battalions of the Rhodesian African Rifles were assigned to the 1st  3rd and 4th Brigades  The notorious Fifth Brigade was formed in 1981 and disbanded in 1988 after allegations of brutality and murder during the Brigade s occupation of Matabeleland in what has become known as Gukurahundi  Shona   the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains    31  94  The

vegetables  spinach  chomolia  spring greens collard greens   beans and meat that has been stewed  grilled  roasted or sundried  Sadza is also commonly eaten with curdled milk  sour milk   commonly

served before dinner  It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner  Rice  pasta  and potato based foods  french fries and mashed potato  also make up part of the Zimbabwean cuisine  A local favourite is rice cooked with peanut butter which is taken with thick gravy  mixed vegetables and meat  A potpourri of peanuts 2 known as nzungu  boiled and sundried maize  black eyed peas known as

Hills were formed over 2 000 million years ago with granite being forced to the surface  then being eroded to produce smooth  whaleback dwalas  and broken kopjes  strewn with boulders and interspersed with thickets of vegetation  Mzilikazi  founder of the Ndebele nation  gave the area its name  meaning  Bald Heads   They have become famous and a tourist attraction due to their ancient shapes and
