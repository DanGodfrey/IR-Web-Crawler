regarding the founding of a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704  when Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts  the missionary arm of the Church of England  persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college  16  however  not until the founding of Princeton University across the Hudson River in New Jersey did the City of New York seriously consider founding a college  16  In 1746 an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college  In 1751  the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents  seven of whom were members of the Church of England  to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college  17  Classes were initially held in July 1754 and were presided over by the college s first president  Dr  Samuel Johnson  18  Dr  Johnson was the only instructor of the college s first class  which consisted of a mere eight students  Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church  located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan  19  The college was officially founded on October 31  1754  as King s College by royal charter of King George II  making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States  6  In 1763  Dr  Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by Myles Cooper  a graduate of The Queen s College  Oxford  and an ardent Tory  In the charged political climate of the American Revolution  his chief opponent in discussions at the College was an undergraduate of the class of 1777  Alexander Hamilton  20  The American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776  and was catastrophic for the operation of King s College  which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the Continental Army  The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783  The college s library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces  21  22   edit  Columbia College  1784 1896  The Gothic Revival Law School building on the Madison Avenue campus After the Revolution  the college turned to the State of New York in order to restore its vitality  promising to make whatever changes to the schools charter the state might demand  23  The Legislature agreed to assist the college  and on May 1  1784  it passed  an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King s College   24  The Act created a Board of Regents to oversee the resuscitation of King s College  and  in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic  the Legislature stipulated that  the College within the City of New York heretofore called King s College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of Columbia College   24  The Regents finally became aware of the college s defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee  which was headed by John Jay and Alexander Hamilton  In April of that same year  a new charter was adopted for the college  still in use today  granting power to a private board of 24 Trustees  25  On the May 21  1787  William Samuel Johnson  the son of Dr  Samuel Johnson  was unanimously elected President of Columbia College  Prior to serving at the university  Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention  26  For a period in the 1790s  with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments  a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay  Both President George Washington and Vice President John Adams attended the college s commencement on May 6  1789  as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school that had been involved in the American Revolution  27  The college s enrollment  structure  and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century  with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the College functioned  In 1857  the College moved from Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49th Street and Madison Avenue  where it remained for the next fifty years  During the last half of the 19th century  under the leadership of President F A P  Barnard  the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university  28  By this time  the College s investments in New York real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school  mainly owing to the city s rapidly expanding population  29   edit  Columbia University  1896 present  An illustration of Columbia in 1915  In 1896  the trustees officially authorized the use of yet another new name  Columbia University  and today the institution is officially known as  Columbia University in the City of New York   At the same time  university president Seth Low moved the campus again  from 49th Street to its present location  a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of Morningside Heights  30  Under the leadership of Low s successor  Nicholas Murray Butler  who served for over four decades  Columbia rapidly became the nation s major institution for research  setting the  multiversity  model that later universities would adopt  6  Research into the atom by faculty members John R  Dunning  I  I  Rabi  Enrico Fermi and Polykarp Kusch placed Columbia s Physics Department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the Manhattan Project  31  In 1947  to meet the needs of GIs returning from World War II  University Extension was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the Columbia University School of General Studies  32  During the 1960s Columbia experienced large scale student activism  which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied various buildings on campus  The incident forced the resignation of Columbia s then President  Grayson Kirk and the establishment of the University Senate  33  34  Though several schools within the university had admitted women for years  Columbia College first admitted women in the fall of 1983  after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard College  an all female institution affiliated with the university  to merge the two schools  35  Barnard College still remains affiliated with Columbia  and all Barnard graduates are issued diplomas authorized by both Columbia University and Barnard College  36   edit  Campus  edit  Morningside Heights Low Memorial Library The majority of Columbia s graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in Morningside Heights on Seth Low s late 19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught in one location  The campus was designed along Beaux Arts principles by architects McKim  Mead  and White  Columbia s main campus occupies more than six city blocks  or 32 acres  13 ha   in Morningside Heights  New York City  a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions  The university owns over 7 800 apartments in Morningside Heights  housing faculty  graduate students  and staff  Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories  purpose built or converted  are located on campus or in Morningside Heights  7  Columbia University has an extensive underground tunnel system more than a century old  with the oldest portions predating the present campus  Some of these remain accessible to the public  while others have been cordoned off  37  38  Butler Library  rated one of the most beautiful college libraries in the United States  39  The Nicholas Murray Butler Library  commonly known simply as Butler Library  is the largest single library in the Columbia University Library System  and is one of the largest buildings on the campus  Proposed as  South Hall  by the university s former President Nicholas Murray Butler as expansion plans for Low Memorial Library stalled  the new library was funded by Edward Harkness  benefactor of Yale s residential college system  and designed by his favorite architect  James Gamble Rogers  It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946  The library s design is neo classical in style  Its facade features an arcade of columns in the Ionic order above which are inscribed the names of great writers  philosophers  and thinkers  most of whom are read by students engaged in the Core Curriculum of Columbia College  40  As of 2009  Columbia s library system includes over 10 4 million volumes  making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States  41  42  Several buildings on the Morningside Heights campus are listed on the National Register of Historic Places  Low Memorial Library  a National Historic Landmark and the centerpiece of the campus  is listed for its architectural significance  Philosophy Hall is listed as the site of the invention of FM radio  Also listed is Pupin Hall  another National Historic Landmark  which houses the physics and astronomy departments  Here the first experiments on the fission of uranium were conducted by Enrico Fermi  The uranium atom was split there ten days after the world s first atom splitting in Copenhagen  Denmark  43  44  45  A statue by sculptor Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater is centered on the front steps of Low Memorial Library  McKim  Mead  amp  White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus  Draped in an academic gown  the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne  The scroll like arms of the throne end in lamps  representing sapientia and doctrina  A book signifying knowledge  balances on her lap  and an owl  the attribute of wisdom  is hidden in the folds of her gown  Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat  terminating with a crown of King s College which refers to Columbia s origin as a Royalist institution in 1754  A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture  The statue was dedicated on September 23  1903  as a gift of Mr   amp  Mrs  Robert Goelet  and was originally covered in golden leaf  During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture  but it has since been repaired  46  The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends  the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian  and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student  given that Barnard is a women s college  47  48   The Steps   alternatively known as  Low Steps  or the  Urban Beach   are a popular meeting area for Columbia students  The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus  South Field  to its upper terrace  With a design inspired by the City Beautiful movement  the steps of Low Library provides Columbia University and Barnard College students  faculty  and staff with a comfortable and spacious outdoor platform and space for informal gatherings  events  and ceremonies  McKim s classical facade epitomizes late 19th century new classical designs  with its columns and portico marking the entrance to an important structure  49  On warm days when the weather is favorable  the Low Steps often become a popular gathering place for students to sunbathe  eat lunch  or play frisbee  50    The template below  Wide image  is being considered for merging  See templates for discussion to help reach a consensus    Panorama view of the

for a new campus in Manhattanville  an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus  Stretching from 125th Street to 133rd Street  the new campus will house buildings for Columbia s schools of business and the arts and allow the construction of the Jerome L  Greene Center for Mind  Brain  and Behavior  where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson s and Alzheimer s  51  The  7 billion expansion plan includes demolishing all buildings  except three that are historically significant  eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses  and relocating tenants in 132 apartments  Replacing these buildings will be 6 800 000 square feet  630 000 m2  of space for the university  Community activist groups in West Harlem fought the expansion for reasons ranging from property protection and fair exchange for land  to residents  rights  52  53  Subsequent public hearings drew neighborhood opposition  Most recently  as of December 2008  the State of New York s Empire State Development Corporation approved use of eminent domain  which  through declaration of Manhattanville s  blighted  status  gives governmental bodies the right to appropriate private property for public use  54  On May 20  2009  the New York State Public Authorities Control Board approved the Manhanttanville expansion plan  55  New York Presbyterian Hospital is affiliated with the medical schools of both Columbia University and Cornell University  According to US News and World Reports  Americas Best Hospitals 2009   it is ranked sixth overall and third among university hospitals  Columbia Medical School has a strategic partnership with New York State Psychiatric Institute  and is affiliated with 19 other hospitals in the U S

Columbia is enhanced by the Columbia University subway station  In 2006  the university established the Office of Environmental Stewardship to initiate  coordinate and implement programs to reduce the university s environmental footprint  The U S  Green Building Council selected the university s Manhattanville plan for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  LEED  Neighborhood Design pilot program  The plan commits to incorporating smart growth  new urbanism and  green  building design principles  57  Columbia is one of the 2030 Challenge Partners  a group of nine universities in the city of New York that have pledged to reduce their greenhouse emissions by 30  within the next ten years  Columbia University adopts LEED standards for all new construction and major renovations  The University requires a minimum of Silver  but through its design and review process seeks to achieve higher levels  This is especially challenging for lab and research buildings with their intensive energy use  however  the university also uses lab design guidelines that seek to maximize energy efficiency while protecting the safety of researchers  58  Every Thursday and Sunday of the month  Columbia hosts a greenmarket where local farmers can sell their produce to residents of the city  In addition  from April to November Hodgson s farm  a local New York gardening center  joins the market bringing a large selection of plants and blooming flowers  The market is one of the many operated at different points throughout the city by the non profit group GrowNYC  59  Dining services at Columbia spends 36 percent of its food budget on local products  in addition to serving sustainably harvested seafood and fair trade coffee on campus  60  Columbia has been rated  B   by the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives  61   edit  Academics  edit  Undergraduate admissions and financial aid Alma Mater is a well known

college in the United States by admission rate behind Harvard  63  64  65  The undergraduate yield rate for the class of 2014 is 59   66  According to the 2011 college selectivity ranking by U S  News  amp  World Report  which factors admission and yield rates among other criteria  Columbia is the third most selective college in the nation  behind Yale and Caltech and tied with Harvard  MIT  and Princeton  67  Columbia sends approximately 90  of its undergraduates to graduate school in virtually every academic  professional and vocational field  68  Columbia is a racially diverse school  with approximately 52  of all students identifying themselves as persons of color  Additionally  50 3  of all undergraduates in the Class of 2013 receive financial aid  The average financial aid package for these students exceeds  30 000  with an average grant size of over  20 000  69  On April 11  2007  Columbia University announced a  400m to  600m donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid  The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education  Its exact value will depend on the eventual value of Kluge s estate at the time of his death  however  the generous donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia  70  Annual gifts  fund raising  and an increase in spending from the university s endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students  As of 2008  undergraduates from families with incomes as high as  60 000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university  including room  board  and academic fees  subsidized by the university  That same year  the university ended loans for incoming and current students who were on financial aid  replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university  However  this does not apply to international students  transfer students  visiting students  or students in the School of General Studies  71  In the fall of 2010  admission to Columbia s undergraduate colleges Columbia College and Columbia Engineering  formerly known as SEAS  began accepting the Common Application  The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the common application  72  Scholarships are also given to undergraduate students by the admissions committee  Designations include John W  Kluge Scholars  John Jay Scholars  C  Prescott Scholars  Global Scholars  Egleston Scholars  and Science Research Fellows  Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first year applicants  According to Columbia  the first four designated scholars  distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements  dynamism  intellectual curiosity  the originality and independence of their thinking  and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied

graduation Students initiated a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues  The first was Columbia s proposed gymnasium in neighboring Morningside Park  this was seen by the protesters to be an act of aggression aimed at the black residents of neighboring Harlem  A second issue was the Columbia administration s failure to resign its institutional membership in the Pentagon s weapons research think tank  the Institute for Defense Analyses  IDA   Students barricaded themselves inside Low Library  Hamilton Hall  and several other university buildings during the protests  and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students  177  178  The protests achieved two of their stated goals  Columbia disaffiliated from the IDA and scrapped the plans for the controversial gym  building a subterranean physical fitness center under the north end of campus instead  The gym s plans were eventually used by Princeton University for the expansion of its athletic facilities  At least 30 Columbia students were suspended by the administration as a result of the protests  Many of the Class of  68 walked out of their graduation and held a countercommencement on Low Plaza with a picnic following at Morningside Park  the place where the protests began  179  The protests hurt Columbia financially as many potential students chose to attend other universities and some alumni refused to donate money to the school  Allan Bloom  a professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago  believed that the protest efforts at Columbia were responsible for pushing higher education further toward the liberal left  As a result of the protests  Bloom stated   American universities were no longer places of intellectual and academic debate  but rather places of  political correctness  and liberalism   180   edit  Protests against racism and apartheid Further student protests  including hunger strike and more barricades of Hamilton Hall and the Business School 181  during the late 1970s and early 1980s  were aimed at convincing the university trustees to divest all of the university s investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the apartheid regime in South Africa  A notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978  when following a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968  students marched and rallied in protest of university investments in South Africa  The Committee Against Investment in South Africa  CAISA  and numerous student groups including the Socialist Action Committee  the Black Student Organization and the Gay Students group joined together and succeeded in pressing for the first partial divestment of a U S  university  The initial  and partial  Columbia divestment  182  focused largely on bonds and financial institutions directly involved with the South African regime  183  It followed a year long campaign first initiated by students who had worked together to block the appointment of former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to an endowed chair at the university in 1977  184  Broadly backed by a diverse array of student groups and many notable faculty members the Committee Against Investment in South Africa held numerous teach ins and demonstrations through the year focused on the trustees ties to the corporations doing business with South Africa  Trustee meetings were picketed and interrupted by demonstrations culminating in May 1978 in the takeover of the Graduate School of Business  185  186   edit  Ahmadinejad speech controversy Students protest Ahmadinejad s invitation to speak at Columbia University  The School of International and Public Affairs traditionally extends invitations to many heads of state and heads of government who come to New York City for the opening of the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly  In 2007  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one of those invited to speak on campus  Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24  2007  as part of Columbia University s World Leaders Forum  187  The invitation proved to be highly controversial  Thousands of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide  University President Lee C  Bollinger tried to assuage the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak  but with a negative introduction  given personally by Bollinger   This did not mollify those who were displeased with the fact that the Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus  188  Columbia students  though  turned out en masse to listen to the speech on the South Lawn  An estimated 2 500 under graduates and graduates came out for the historic occasion  During his speech  Ahmadinejad criticized Israel s policies towards the Palestinians  called for research on the historical accuracy of the Holocaust  raised questions as to who initiated the 9 11 attacks  defended Iran s nuclear power program  criticizing the UN s policy of sanctions on his country  and attacked U S  foreign policy in the Middle East  In response to a question about Iran s treatment of women and homosexuals  he asserted that women are respected in Iran and that  In Iran  we don t have homosexuals like in your country    In Iran  we do not have this phenomenon  I don t know who told you this   189  The latter statement drew laughter from the audience  The Manhattan District Attorney s Office accused Columbia of accepting grant money from the Alavi Foundation to support faculty  sympathetic  to Iran s Islamic republic  190   edit  ROTC controversy Beginning in 1969  during the Vietnam War  the university did not allow the U S  military to have Reserve Officers  Training Corps  ROTC  programs on campus  191  though Columbia students could participate in ROTC programs at other colleges and universities  192  193  194  195  At a forum at the university during the 2008 presidential election campaign  both John McCain and Barack Obama said that the university should consider reinstating ROTC on campus  194  196  197  After the debate  the President of the University  Lee C  Bollinger  stated that he did not favor reinstating Columbia s ROTC program  because of the military s anti gay policies  In November 2008  Columbia s undergraduate student body held a referendum on the question of whether or not to invite ROTC back to campus  and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue  ROTC lost the vote  which would not have been binding on the administration  and did not include graduate students  faculty  or alumni  by a fraction of a percentage point  In April 2010 during Admiral Mike Mullen s address at Columbia  President Lee C  Bollinger stated that the ROTC would be readmitted to campus if the admiral s plans for revoking the don t ask  don t tell policy were successful  In February 2011 during one of three town hall meetings on the ROTC ban  former Army staff sergeant Anthony Maschek  a purple heart recipient for injuries sustained during his service in Iraq  was booed and hissed at by some students during his speech promoting the idea of allowing the ROTC on campus  198  In April 2011 the Columbia University Senate voted to welcome the ROTC program back on campus  199  Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and

performances before Furnald Hall  known among students as the more studious and reportedly  anti social  residence hall  where the underclassmen in the Band serenade the graduating seniors with an
