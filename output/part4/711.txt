New York  NY RKO  Radio Keith Orpheum  Pictures is an American film production and distribution company  As RKO Radio Pictures Inc   it was one of the Big Five studios of Hollywood s Golden Age  The business was formed after the Keith Albee Orpheum  KAO  theater chains and Joseph P  Kennedy s Film Booking Offices of America  FBO  studio were brought together under the control of the Radio Corporation of America  RCA  in October 1928  a  RCA chief David Sarnoff engineered the merger to create a market for the company s sound on film technology  RCA Photophone  By the mid 1940s  the

silent to sound film production en masse  The Radio Corporation of America  RCA  controlled an advanced optical sound on film system  Photophone  recently developed by General Electric  RCA s parent company  However  its hopes of joining in the anticipated boom in sound movies faced a major hurdle  Warner Bros  and Fox  Hollywood s other vanguard sound studio  were already financially and technologically aligned with ERPI  a subsidiary of AT amp T s Western Electric division  The industry s two largest companies  Paramount and Loew s MGM  with two other major studios  Universal and First National  were poised to contract with ERPI for sound conversion as well  1  Early Radio Keith Orpheum logo Seeking a customer for Photophone  in late 1927 David Sarnoff  then general manager of RCA  approached Joseph Kennedy about using the system for Kennedy s modest sized studio  Film Booking Offices of America  FBO   Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of a plan for the company to attain a central position in the film industry  maximizing Photophone revenue  Next on the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned  Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase  Around that time  the large Keith Albee Orpheum  KAO  circuit of theaters  built around the then fading medium of live vaudeville  was attempting a transition to the movie business  In mid 1927  the filmmaking operations of Path   U S   and Cecil B  De Mille had united under KAO s control  Early in 1928  KAO general manager John J  Murdock  who had assumed the presidency of Path   turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille s company  Producers Distributing Corporation  PDC   This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought  2  3  b  After an aborted attempt by Kennedy to bring yet another studio that had turned to him for help  First National  into the Photophone fold  RCA was ready to step back in  the company acquired Kennedy s stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business  On October 23  1928  RCA announced the creation of the Radio Keith Orpheum holding company  with Sarnoff as chairman of the board  Kennedy  who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies  kept Path  separate from RKO and under his personal control  2  4  RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO  22 percent  in the early 1930s  RCA s share of stock in the company rose as high as 60 percent  5  The company s production and distribution arm  presided over by former FBO vice president Joseph I  Schnitzer  was incorporated early in 1929 as Radio Pictures  6  Looking to get out of the film business the following year  Kennedy arranged in late 1930 for RKO to purchase Path  from him  On January 29  1931  Path   with its contract players  well regarded newsreel operation  and Culver City studio and backlot  was merged into RKO as Kennedy sold off the last of his stock in the company he had been instrumental in creating  7   edit  Golden Age studio  edit  Early years Rio Rita  1929   first smash hit for RKO  then releasing films under the  Radio Pictures  banner  Declaring that it would make only all talking films  RKO began shooting at the small facility FBO shared with Path  in New York City while the main FBO studio in Hollywood was technologically refitted  In charge of production was William LeBaron  who had held the same position at FBO  The new company s two initial releases were musicals  The melodramatic Syncopation premiered on March 29  1929  8  The comedic Street Girl debuted July 30  This was billed as RKO s first  official  production first to follow the formal incorporation of Radio Pictures  first to be made in Hollywood  9  c  A few nonsinging pictures followed  but the studio s first major hit was again a musical  RKO spent heavily on the lavish Rio Rita  including a number of Technicolor sequences  Opening in September to rave reviews  it was named one of the ten best pictures of the year by Film Daily  10  Cinema historian Richard Barrios credits it with initiating the  first age of the filmed Broadway musical   11  By the end of the year  RKO was making use of an additional production facility five hundred acres had been acquired near Encino in the San Fernando Valley as a backlot for exteriors and large scale standing sets  12  RKO released a limited slate of twelve features in its first year  in 1930  that figure more than doubled to twenty nine  13  Originally organized as the distinct business entities RKO Productions Inc  and RKO Distributing Corp   by July the studio was making a transition to the new  unified RKO Radio Pictures Inc  14  Encouraged by Rio Rita s success  RKO produced several costly musicals incorporating Technicolor sequences  among them Dixiana and Hit the Deck  both scripted and directed  like Rio Rita  by Luther Reed  15  Following the example of the other major studios  RKO had planned to create its own musical revue  Radio Revels  Promoted as the studio s most extravagant production to date  it was to be photographed entirely in Technicolor  16  The project was abandoned  however  as the public s taste for musicals temporarily subsided  From a total of more than sixty Hollywood musicals in 1929 and over eighty the following year  the number dropped to eleven in 1931  17  RKO was left in a bind  it still had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more features with its system  Complicating matters  audiences had come to associate color with the momentarily out of favor musical genre due to a glut of such productions from the major Hollywood studios  Fulfilling its obligations  RKO produced two all Technicolor pictures  The Runaround and Fanny Foley Herself  both 1931   containing no musical sequences  Neither was a success  18  Even as the U S  economy foundered  RKO had gone on a spending spree  buying up theater after theater to add to its exhibition chain  In October 1930  the company purchased a 50 percent stake in the New York s Van Beuren studio  which specialized in cartoons and live shorts  19  RKO s production schedule soon surpassed forty features a year  released under the names  Radio Pictures  and  for a short time after the 1931 merger   RKO Path    Cimarron  1931   produced by LeBaron himself  would become the only RKO production to win the Academy Award for Best Picture  nonetheless  having cost a profligate  1 4 million to make  it was a money loser on original domestic release  20  d  The most popular RKO star of this pre Code era was Irene Dunne  who made her debut as the lead in the 1930 musical Leathernecking and was a headliner at the studio for the entire decade  21  Other major performers included Joel McCrea  Ricardo Cortez  Dolores del R o  and Mary Astor  Richard Dix  Oscar nominated for his lead performance in Cimarron  would serve as RKO s standby B movie star until the early 1940s  22  The comedy team of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey  often wrangling over ingenue Dorothy Lee  was a bankable mainstay for years  23 Constance Bennett  Ann Harding  and Helen Twelvetrees came over with Path   24  The Path  acquisition  though a defensible investment in the long term for its physical facilities  was yet another major expense borne by the fledgling RKO  particularly as Path  s stock price had been artificially inflated by some prepurchase finagling  25  After little more than a year of semiautonomous operation within RKO  Path  was dissolved as a feature production unit  26   edit  Success under Selznick King Kong  1933   one of Hollywood s great spectacles Exceptions like Cimarron and Rio Rita aside  RKO s product was largely regarded as mediocre  so in October 1931 Sarnoff hired twenty nine year old David O  Selznick to replace LeBaron as production chief  27  In addition to implementing rigorous cost control measures  Selznick championed the unit production system  which gave the producers of individual movies much greater independence than they had under the prevailing central producer system   Under the factory system of production you rob the director of his individualism   said Selznick   and this being a creative industry that is harmful to the quality of the product made   28  Instituting unit production  he predicted  would also result in cost savings of 30 40 percent  28  To make films under the new system  Selznick recruited prize behind the camera personnel  such as director George Cukor and producer director Merian C  Cooper  and gave producer Pandro S  Berman  aged twenty six  increasingly important projects  29  Selznick discovered and signed a young actress who would quickly become one of the studio s biggest stars  Katharine Hepburn  John Barrymore was also enlisted for a few memorable performances  30  From September 1932 on  print advertising for the company s features displayed the revised name  RKO Radio Pictures   the Path  name was used only for newsreels and documentaries  e  That year  the New York City based corporate headquarters moved into the new RKO Building  an Art Deco skyscraper that was one of the first Rockefeller Center structures to open  31  Selznick spent a mere fifteen months as RKO production chief  resigning over a dispute with new corporate president Merlin Aylesworth concerning creative control  32  One of his last acts at RKO was to approve a screen test for a thirty three year old  balding Broadway song and dance man named Fred Astaire  33  In a memo  Selznick wrote   I feel  in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line  that his charm is     tremendous   34  Selznick s tenure was widely considered masterful  In 1931  before he arrived  the studio had produced forty two features for  16 million in total budgets  In 1932  under Selznick  forty one features were made for  10 2 million  with clear improvement in quality and popularity  35  He backed several major successes  including A Bill of Divorcement  1932   with Cukor directing Hepburn s debut  and the monumental King Kong  1933  largely Merian Cooper s brainchild  brought to life by the astonishing special effects work of Willis O Brien  36  Still  the shaky finances and excesses that marked the company s pre Selznick days had not left RKO in shape to withstand the Depression  the company sank into receivership in early 1933  from which it did not emerge until 1940  37   edit  Cooper at the helm Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers  the only performers ever to make the annual list of top box office stars while with RKO  38 Top Hat  1935  was the third of the eight films in which they costarred between 1934 and 1939  Cooper took over as production head after Selznick s departure and oversaw two hits starring Hepburn  Morning Glory  1933   for which she won her first Oscar  and Little Women  1933   director Cukor s second collaboration with the actress  39  Among the studio s in house productions  the latter was the biggest box office success of the decade  40 Ginger Rogers had already made several minor films for RKO when Cooper signed her to a seven year contract and cast her in the big budget musical Flying Down to Rio  1933   41  Rogers was paired with Astaire  making his movie debut  Billed fourth and fifth respectively  the picture turned them into stars  42 Hermes Pan  assistant to the film s dance director  would become one of Hollywood s leading choreographers through his subsequent work with Astaire  43  44  Along with Columbia Pictures  RKO became one of the primary homes of the screwball comedy  As film historian James Harvey describes  compared to their richer competition  the two studios were  more receptive to experiment  more tolerant of chaos on the set  It was at these two lesser  majors    that nearly all the preeminent screwball directors did their important films  Howard  Hawks and  Gregory  La Cava and  Leo  McCarey and  George  Stevens   45  The relatively unheralded William A  Seiter directed the studio s first significant contribution to the genre  The Richest Girl in the World  1934   46  The drama Of Human Bondage  1934   directed by John Cromwell  was Bette Davis s first great success  47  Stevens s Alice Adams and director John Ford s The Informer were each nominated for the 1935 Best Picture Oscar the Best Director statuette won by Ford was the only one ever given for an RKO production  48 The Informer s star  Victor McLaglen  also took home an Academy Award  he would appear in a dozen movies for the studio over a span of two decades  49  Lacking the financial resources of industry leaders MGM  Paramount  and Fox  RKO turned out many pictures during the era that made up for it with high style in an Art Deco mode  exemplified by such Astaire Rogers musicals as The Gay Divorcee  1934   their first pairing as leads  and Top Hat  1935   50  One of the figures most responsible for that style was another Selznick recruit  Van Nest Polglase  chief of RKO s highly regarded design department for almost a decade  51  52  Film historian James Naremore has described RKO as  chiefly a designer s studio  It never had a stable of important actors  writers  or directors  but     it was rich in artists and special effects technicians  As a result its most distinctive pictures contained a strong element of fantasy not so much the fantasy of horror  which during the thirties was the province of Universal  but the fantasy of the marvelous and adventurous   53  As a group  the studio s craft divisions were among the strongest in the industry  51  54 Costumer Walter Plunkett  who worked with the company from the close of the FBO era through the end of 1939  was known as the top period wardrobist in the business  55  Sidney Saunders  innovative head of the studio s paint department  was responsible for significant progress in rear projection quality  56  On June 13  1935  RKO premiered the first feature film shot entirely in advanced three strip Technicolor  Becky Sharp  The movie was coproduced with Pioneer Pictures  founded by Cooper who departed RKO after two years helming production and John Hay  Jock  Whitney  who brought in his cousin Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney  Cooper had successfully encouraged the Whitneys to purchase a major share of the Technicolor business as well  57  Though judged by critics a failure as drama  Becky Sharp was widely lauded for its visual brilliance and technical expertise  58  RKO also employed some of the industry s leading artists and craftsmen whose work was never seen  From the studio s earliest days through late 1935  Max Steiner  regarded by many historians as the most influential composer of the early years of sound cinema  made music for over 100 RKO films  44  59  Murray Spivak  head of the studio s audio special effects department  made important advances in the use of rerecording technology first heard in King Kong  60   edit  Briskin and Berman In October 1935 the ownership team expanded  with financier Floyd Odlum leading a syndicate that bought 50 percent of RCA s stake in the company  the Rockefeller brothers  also major stockholders  increasingly became involved in the business  61  While RKO kept missing the mark in building Hepburn s career  major stars Cary Grant and Barbara Stanwyck joined the studio s roster though Stanwyck would have little success during her few years there  Grant was a trendsetter  one of the first leading men of the sound era to work extensively as a freelancer  under nonexclusive studio deals  while his star was still on the rise  62  f Ann Sothern starred in seven RKO films between 1935 and 1937  paired five times with Gene Raymond  63  Katharine Hepburn s last film for RKO was a bomb  Today  Bringing Up Baby  1938  is regarded as one of the finest screwball comedies  64  Soon after the appointment of a new production chief  Samuel Briskin  in late 1935  RKO entered into an important distribution deal with animator Walt Disney  Van Beuren consequently folded its cartoon operations   65  From 1936 to 1954  the studio released his features and shorts  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  1937  was the highest grossing movie in the period between The Birth of a Nation  1915  and Gone with the Wind  1939   66  Following the change in print branding a few years earlier  the opening and closing logos on RKO movies  other than the Path  nonfiction line  were changed from  Radio Pictures  to  RKO Radio Pictures  in 1936  In February 1937  Selznick  now a leading independent producer  took over RKO s Culver City studio and Forty Acres  as the backlot was known  under a long term lease  Gone with the Wind  his coproduction with MGM  was largely shot there  67  g  In addition to its central Hollywood studio  RKO production now revolved around its Encino backlot  While the Disney association was beneficial  RKO s own product was widely seen as declining in quality and Briskin was gone by the end of the year  68  Pandro Berman who had filled in on three previous occasions accepted the position of production chief on a noninterim basis  As it turned out  he would leave the job before the decade s turn  but his brief tenure resulted in some of the most notable films in studio history  including Gunga Din  with Grant and McLaglen  Love Affair  starring Dunne and Charles Boyer  and The Hunchback of Notre Dame  all 1939   69 Charles Laughton  who gave a now fabled performance as Quasimodo in the latter  returned periodically to the studio  headlining six more RKO features  70  For Maureen O Hara  who made her American screen debut in the film  it was the first of ten pictures she would make for RKO through 1952  71  After costarring with Ginger Rogers for the eighth time in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle  1939   Fred Astaire departed the studio  72  The studio s B Western star of the period was George O Brien  who made eighteen RKO pictures  sixteen between 1938 and 1940  The Saint in New York  1938  successfully launched a B detective series featuring the character Simon Templar that would run through 1943  73  The Wheeler and Woolsey comedy series ended in 1937 when Woolsey became ill  he died the following year   RKO filled the void by releasing independently produced features such as the Dr  Christian series and the Laurel and Hardy comedy The Flying Deuces  1939   74  The studio soon had its own new B comedy star in Lupe V lez  The Girl from Mexico  1939  was followed by seven frantic installments of the Mexican Spitfire series  all featuring Leon Errol  between 1940 and 1943  73  The studio s technical departments maintained their reputation as industry leaders  Vernon Walker s special effects unit became famous for its sophisticated use of the optical printer and lifelike matte work  an art that would reach its apex with 1941 s Citizen Kane  75   edit  Kane and Schaefer s troubles Orson Welles in the title role of Citizen Kane  1941   often cited as the greatest film of all time  76  Pan Berman had received his first screen credit in 1925 as a nineteen year old assistant director on FBO s Midnight Molly  77  He departed RKO in December 1939 after policy clashes with studio president George J  Schaefer  handpicked the previous year by the Rockefellers and backed by Sarnoff  78  With Berman gone  Schaefer became in effect production chief  though other men including the former head of the industry censorship board  Joseph I  Breen nominally filled the role  79  Schaefer  announcing his philosophy with a new studio slogan   Quality Pictures at a Premium Price   was keen on signing up independent producers whose films RKO would distribute  80  In 1941  the studio landed one of the most prestigious independents in Hollywood when it arranged to handle Samuel Goldwyn s productions  The first two Goldwyn pictures released by the studio were highly successful  The Little Foxes  directed by William Wyler and starring Bette Davis  garnered four Oscar nominations  81  while the Howard Hawks directed Ball of Fire at last brought Barbara Stanwyck a hit under the RKO banner  However  Schaefer agreed to terms so favorable to Goldwyn that it was next to impossible for the studio to make money off his films  82  David O  Selznick loaned out his leading contracted director for two RKO pictures in 1941  Alfred Hitchcock s Mr  and Mrs  Smith was a modest success and Suspicion a more substantial one  with an Oscar winning turn by Joan Fontaine  h  That May  RKO released Citizen Kane  coproducing with director Orson Welles s Mercury Productions  While it opened to strong reviews and would go on to be hailed as one of the greatest movies ever made  it lost money at the time and brought down the wrath of the Hearst newspaper chain on RKO  83  The next year saw the commercial failure of Welles s The Magnificent Ambersons like Kane  critically lauded and overbudget and the expensive embarrassment of his aborted documentary It s All True  84  The three Mercury productions combined to drain  2 million from the RKO coffers  major money for a corporation that had reported an overall deficit of  1 million in 1940 and a nominal profit of a bit more than  500 000 in 1941  i  Many of RKO s other artistically ambitious pictures were also dying at the box office and it was losing its last exclusive deal with a major star as well  Rogers  after winning an Oscar in 1941 for her performance in the previous year s Kitty Foyle  held out for a freelance contract like Grant s  after 1943  she would appear in just one more RKO production  thirteen years later  85  On June 17  1942  Schaefer tendered his resignation  86  He departed a weakened and troubled studio  but RKO was about to turn the corner  Propelled by the box office boom of World War II and guided by new management  RKO would make a strong comeback over the next half decade  87   edit  Rebound under Koerner By the end of June 1942  Floyd Odlum had taken over a controlling interest in the company via his Atlas Corporation  edging aside the Rockefellers and Sarnoff  Charles Koerner  former head of the RKO theater chain and allied with Odlum  had assumed the title of production chief some time prior to Schaefer s departure  88  With Schaefer gone  Koerner could actually do the job  announcing a policy of  entertainment  not genius   a snipe at Schaefer s artistic ambitions in general and his sponsorship of Welles in particular   89  he brought the studio much needed stability until his death in February 1946  87  90  The change in RKO s fortunes was virtually immediate  corporate profits rose from  736 241 in 1942  the theatrical division compensating for the studio s  2 34 million deficit  to  6 96 million the following year  91  The Rockefellers sold off their stock and  early in 1943  RCA dispensed with the last of its holdings in the company as well  cutting David Sarnoff s ties to the studio that was largely his conception  92  In June 1944  RKO created a television production subsidiary  RKO Television Corporation  to provide content for the new medium  RKO became the first major studio to produce for television with Talk Fast  Mister  a one hour drama filmed at RKO Path  studios in New York and broadcast by the DuMont network s New York station  WABD  on December 18  1944  In collaboration with Mexican businessman Emilio Azc rraga Vidaurreta  RKO established Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City in 1945  93  Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in Notorious  1946   RKO made over  1 million profit on the coproduction with David O  Selznick s Vanguard Films  94  With RKO on increasingly secure ground  Koerner sought to increase its output of handsomely budgeted  star driven features  However  the studio s only remaining major stars under anything like extended contracts were Grant  whose services were shared with Columbia Pictures  and O Hara  shared with Twentieth Century Fox  95  96  Lacking in house stars  Koerner and his successors under Odlum arranged with the other studios to loan out their biggest names or signed one of the growing number of freelance performers to short term   pay or play  deals  Thus RKO pictures of the mid  and late forties offered Bing Crosby  Henry Fonda  and others who were out of the studio s price range for extended contracts  97 John Wayne appeared in 1943 s A Lady Takes a Chance on loan from Republic Pictures  he was soon working regularly with RKO  making nine more movies for the studio  98 Gary Cooper appeared in RKO releases produced by Goldwyn and  later  the startup International Pictures  99  and Claudette Colbert starred in a number of RKO coproductions  100 Ingrid Bergman appeared under a variety of hats  on loan out from Selznick in The Bells of St  Mary s  1945   the biggest hit of any in house RKO production during the 1940s  40  in the coproductions Notorious  1946  and Stromboli  1950   and in the independently produced Joan of Arc  1948   101  Freelancing Randolph Scott appeared in one major RKO release annually from 1943 through 1948  102  In similar fashion  many leading directors made one or more films at RKO during this era  including Alfred Hitchcock once more  with Notorious  and Jean Renoir  with This Land Is Mine  1943   reuniting Laughton and O Hara  and The Woman on the Beach  1947   103  John Ford s The Fugitive  1947  and Fort Apache  1948   which appeared right before studio ownership changed hands again  were followed by She Wore a Yellow Ribbon  1949  and Wagon Master  1950   all four were co productions between RKO and Argosy  the company run by Ford and RKO alumnus Merian C  Cooper  104  Of the directors under long term contract to RKO in the 1940s  the best known was Edward Dmytryk  who first came to notice with the remarkably profitable Hitler s Children  1943   Shot on a  205 000 budget placing it in the bottom quartile of Big Five studio productions  it was one of the ten biggest Hollywood hits of the year  105  j  Another low cost war themed film directed by Dmytryk  Behind the Rising Sun  released a few months later  was similarly profitable  40  106   edit  Focus on B movies Film art at low budget  I Walked with a Zombie  1943   produced by Val Lewton and directed by Jacques Tourneur Much more than the other Big Five studios  RKO relied on B pictures to fill up its schedule  Of the thirty one features released by RKO in 1944  for instance  ten were budgeted below  200 000  twelve were in the  200 000 to  500 000 range  and only nine cost more  In contrast  a clear majority of the features put out by the other top four studios were budgeted at over a half a million dollars  107  A focus on B pictures limited the studio s financial risk  while it also limited the potential for reward  Dmytryk s extraordinary coups aside   RKO had a history of making better profits with its run of the mill and low cost product than with its A movies  5  The studio s low budget films offered training opportunities for new directors  as well  among them Mark Robson  Robert Wise  and Anthony Mann  108  109  Robson and Wise received their first directing assignments with producer Val Lewton  whose specialized B horror unit also included the more experienced director Jacques Tourneur  The Lewton unit s moody  atmospheric work represented by films such as Cat People  1942   I Walked with a Zombie  1943   and The Body Snatcher  1945  is now highly regarded  108  110  Richard Dix concluded his lengthy RKO career with the 1943 Lewton production The Ghost Ship  111 Tim Holt was RKO s cowboy star of the era  appearing in forty six B Westerns and more than fifty movies altogether for the studio  112  In 1940  Chester Lauck and Norris Goff brought their famous comic characters Lum and Abner from radio to RKO for a six film run  113  The Falcon detective series began in 1941  the Saint and the Falcon were so similar that Saint creator Leslie Charteris sued RKO  114  The Falcon was first played by George Sanders  who had appeared five times as the Saint  He bowed out after four Falcon films and was replaced by his brother  Tom Conway  Conway had a nine film run in the part before the series ended in 1946  Johnny Weissmuller starred in six Tarzan pictures for RKO between 1943 and 1948 before being replaced by Lex Barker  63  Film noir  to which lower budgets lent themselves  became something of a house style at the studio  indeed  the RKO B Stranger on the Third Floor  1940  is widely seen as initiating noir s classic period  115  Its cinematographer  Nicholas Musuraca  who began at FBO in the 1920s and stayed with RKO through 1954  is a central figure in creating the look of classic noir  116  Design chief Albert D Agostino another long termer  who succeeded Van Nest Polglase in 1941 and art director Walter Keller  along with others in the department  such as art directors Carroll Clark and Jack Okey and set decorator Darrell Silvera  are similarly credited  117  The studio s 1940s list of contract players was filled with noir regulars  Robert Mitchum  who graduated to major star status  and Robert Ryan each made no fewer than ten film noirs for RKO  118 Gloria Grahame  Jane Greer  and Lawrence Tierney were also notable studio players in the field  119  Freelancer George Raft starred in two noir hits  Johnny Angel  1945  and Nocturne  1946   120  Tourneur  Musuraca  Mitchum  and Greer  along with D Agostino s design group  joined to make the A budgeted Out of the Past  1947   now considered one of the greatest of all film noirs  121 Nicholas Ray began his directing career with the noir They Live by Night  1948   the first of a number of well received films he made for RKO  122   edit  HUAC and Howard Hughes Crossfire  1947  was a hit  but no American studio would hire blacklisted director Edward Dmytryk again until he named names to HUAC in 1951  123  Producer Adrian Scott wouldn t get another screen credit for two decades  He died before he could see it  124  RKO  and the movie industry as a whole  had its most profitable year ever in 1946  A Goldwyn production released by RKO  The Best Years of Our Lives  was the most successful Hollywood film of the decade  125  But the legal status of the industry s reigning business model was increasingly being called into doubt  the U S  Supreme Court ruled in Bigelow v  RKO that the company was liable for damages under antitrust statutes for having denied an independent movie house access to first run films a common practice among all of the Big Five  126  With profits at a high point  Floyd Odlum cashed in by selling off about 40 percent of his shares in the company to a group of investment firms  127  After Koerner s death  Radio Keith Orpheum president N  Peter Rathvon and RKO Radio Pictures president Ned Depinet had exchanged positions  with Depinet moving to the corporate offices in New York and Rathvon relocating to Hollywood and doubling as production chief while a permanent replacement was sought for Koerner  On the first day of 1947  producer and Oscar winning screenwriter Dore Schary  who had been working at the studio on loan from Selznick  took over the role  128  RKO appeared in good shape to build on its recent successes  but the year brought a number of unpleasant harbingers for all of Hollywood  The British government imposed a 75 percent tax on films produced abroad  along with similarly confiscatory taxes and quota laws enacted by other countries  this led to a sharp decline in foreign revenues  129  130  The postwar attendance boom peaked sooner than expected and television emerged as a competitor for audience interest  Across the board  profits fell a 27 percent drop for the Hollywood studios from 1946 to 1947  131  The phenomenon that would become known as McCarthyism was building strength  and in October  the House Un American Activities Committee  HUAC  began hearings into Communism in the motion picture industry  Two of RKO s top talents  Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott  refused to cooperate  As a consequence  they were fired by RKO per the terms of the Waldorf Statement  the major studios  pledge to  eliminate any subversives   Scott  Dmytryk  and eight others who also defied HUAC dubbed the Hollywood Ten were blacklisted across the industry  132  Ironically  the studio s major success of the year was Crossfire  a Scott Dmytryk film  133  Odlum concluded it was time to exit the film business  and he put his remaining RKO shares approximately 25 percent of the outstanding stock on the market  134  Before the turn of the year  the Path  branded newsreel was sold to Warner Bros  130  For her performance in The Farmer s Daughter  1947   a coproduction with Selznick s Vanguard Films  Loretta Young won the Best Actress Oscar the following March  It would turn out to be the last major Academy Award for an RKO picture  135  In May 1948  eccentric aviation tycoon and occasional movie producer Howard Hughes gained control of the company  beating out British film magnate J  Arthur Rank as the buyer of Odlum s interest  136  During Hughes s tenure  RKO suffered its worst years since the early 1930s  as his capricious management style took a heavy toll  Production chief Schary quit almost immediately due to his new boss s interference and Rathvon soon followed  137  Within weeks of taking over  Hughes had dismissed three fourths of the work force  production was virtually shut down for six months as the conservative Hughes shelved or canceled several of the  message pictures  that Schary had backed  Once shooting picked up again  Hughes quickly became notorious for meddling in minute production matters  particularly the presentation of actresses he favored  138  All of the Big Five saw their profits dwindle in 1948 from Fox  down 11 percent  to Loew s MGM  down 62 percent but at RKO they virtually vanished  from  5 1 million in 1947 to  0 5 million  a drop of 90 percent  139  The production distribution end of the RKO business  now deep in the red  would never make a profit again  140  Offscreen  Robert Mitchum s arrest and conviction for marijuana possession he would serve two months in jail was widely assumed to mean career death for RKO s most promising young star  but Hughes surprised the industry by announcing that his contract was not endangered  141  Of much broader significance  Hughes decided to get the jump on his Big Five competitors by being the first to settle the federal government s antitrust suit against the major studios  which had won a crucial Supreme Court ruling in United States v  Paramount Pictures  Inc  Under the consent decree he signed  Hughes agreed to dissolve the old parent company  Radio Keith Orpheum Corp   and split RKO s production distribution business and its exhibition chain into two entirely separate corporations RKO Pictures Corp  and RKO Theatres Corp  with the obligation to promptly sell off one or the other  While Hughes delayed the divorcement procedure until December 1950 and didn t actually sell his stock in the theater company for another three years  his decision to acquiesce was one of the crucial steps in the collapse of classical Hollywood s studio system  142   edit  Turmoil under Hughes Robert Mitchum  RKO s most prolific lead of the late 1940s and early 1950s  95  costarred in Macao  1952  with Jane Russell  who was personally contracted to Howard Hughes  143  Director Josef von Sternberg s work was combined with scenes shot by Nicholas Ray and Mel Ferrer  144  While Hughes s time at RKO was marked by dwindling production and a slew of expensive flops  the studio continued to turn out some well received films under production chiefs Sid Rogell and Sam Bischoff  though both became fed up with Hughes s meddling and quit after less than two years   Bischoff would be the last man to hold the job under Hughes   145  There were B noirs such as The Window  1949   which turned into a hit  146  and The Set Up  1949   directed by Robert Wise and starring Robert Ryan  which won the Critic s Prize at the Cannes Film Festival  147 The Thing from Another World  1951   a science fiction drama coproduced with Howard Hawks s Winchester Pictures  is seen as a classic of the genre  148  In 1952  RKO put out two films directed by Fritz Lang  Rancho Notorious and Clash by Night  The latter was a project of the renowned Jerry Wald Norman Krasna production team  lured by Hughes from Warner Bros  with great fanfare in August 1950  149  The company also began a close working relationship with Ida Lupino  She starred in two suspense films with Robert Ryan Nicholas Ray s On Dangerous Ground  1952  though shooting had been completed two years earlier  and Beware  My Lovely  1952   a coproduction between RKO and Lupino s company  The Filmakers  150  Of more historic note  Lupino was Hollywood s only female director during the period  of the five pictures The Filmakers made with RKO  Lupino directed three  including her now celebrated The Hitch Hiker  1953   151  Exposing many moviegoers to Asian cinema for the first time  RKO distributed Akira Kurosawa s epochal Rashomon in the United States  sixteen months after its original 1950 Japanese release  152  The only smash hits released by RKO in the 1950s came out during this period  but neither was an in house production  Goldwyn s Hans Christian Andersen  1952  was followed by Disney s Peter Pan  1953   40  153  In early 1952  Hughes fought off a lawsuit by screenwriter Paul Jarrico  who had been caught up in the latest round of HUAC hearings Hughes had fired him and removed his name from the credits of a recent release  The studio owner subsequently ordered 100 RKO employees on  leave of absence  while he established a  security office  to oversee an ideological vetting system   We are going to screen everyone in a creative or executive capacity   he declared   The work of Communist sympathizers will not be used   154  As more credits were expunged  some in the industry began to question whether Hughes s hunt for subversives served primarily as a convenient rationale for further curtailing production and trimming expenses  155  In September  Hughes and his corporate president  Ned E  Depinet  sold their RKO studio stock to a Chicago based syndicate with no experience in the movie business  the syndicate s chaotic reign lasted until February 1953  when the stock and control were reacquired by Hughes  156  The studio s net loss in 1952 was over  10 million  and shooting had taken place for just a single in house production over the last five months of the year  157  During the turmoil  Samuel Goldwyn ended his 11 year long distribution deal with RKO  Wald and Krasna escaped their contracts and the studio as well  The deal that brought the team to RKO had called for them to produce sixty features over five years  in just shy of half that time  they succeeded in making four  158  The Encino backlot shut down permanently in 1953 and the property was sold off  159  In November  Hughes finally fulfilled his obligations under the 1948 consent decree  divesting RKO Theatres  Albert A  List purchased the controlling interest in the business and renamed it List Industries  160  Hughes soon found himself the target of no less than five separate lawsuits filed by minority shareholders in RKO  accusing him of malfeasance in his dealings with the Chicago group and a wide array of acts of mismanagement   RKO s contract list is down to three actors and 127 lawyers   quipped Dick Powell  161  Looking to forestall the impending legal imbroglio  in early 1954 Hughes offered to buy out all of RKO s other stockholders  Convinced that the studio was sinking  Walt Disney ended his arrangement with RKO and set up his own distribution firm  Buena Vista Pictures  162  By the end of the year  at a cost of  23 5 million  Hughes had gained near total control of RKO Pictures  becoming the first virtual sole owner of a studio since Hollywood s pioneer days  Virtual  but not quite actual  Floyd Odlum reemerged to block Hughes from acquiring the 95 percent ownership of RKO stock he needed to write off the company s losses against his earnings elsewhere  Hughes had reneged on his promise to give Odlum first option on buying the RKO theater chain when he divested it and was now paying the price  163  With negotiations between the two at a stalemate  in July 1955  Hughes turned around and sold RKO pictures to the General Tire and Rubber Company for  25 million  164  For Hughes  this was the effective end of a quarter century s involvement in the movie business  Historian Betty Lasky describes Hughes s relationship with RKO as a  systematic seven year rape   165   edit  General Tire and studio s demise Jet Pilot  a Hughes pet production launched in 1949  Shooting wrapped in May 1951  but it was not released until 1957 due to his interminable tinkering  RKO was by then out of the distribution business  The movie was released by Universal International  166  In taking control of the studio  General Tire restored RKO s links to broadcasting  General Tire had bought the Yankee Network  a New England regional radio network  in 1943  167  In 1950  it purchased the West Coast regional Don Lee Broadcasting System  168  and two years later  the Bamberger Broadcasting Service  owner of the WOR TV and radio stations in New York City  169  The latter acquisition gave General Tire majority control of the Mutual Broadcasting System  one of America s leading radio networks  170  General Tire then merged its broadcasting interests into a new division  General Teleradio  171  Thomas O Neil  son of General Tire s founder William O Neil and chairman of the broadcasting group  saw that the company s new television stations  indeed all TV outlets  were in need of programming  With the purchase of RKO  the studio s library was his  and rights to the 742 films to which RKO retained clear title were quickly put up for sale  C amp C Television Corp   a subsidiary of beverage maker Cantrell  amp  Cochrane  won the bidding in December 1955  It was soon offering the films to independent stations in a package called  MovieTime USA   172  173  RKO Teleradio Pictures the new company created from the merger of General Teleradio and the RKO studio retained the broadcast rights for the cities where it owned TV stations  By 1956  RKO s classic movies were playing widely on television  allowing many to see such films as Citizen Kane for the first time  The  15 2 million RKO made on the deal convinced the other major studios that their libraries held profit potential a turning point in the way Hollywood did business  172  174  The new owners of RKO made an initial effort to revive the studio  hiring veteran producer William Dozier to head production  175  176  In the first half of 1956  the production facilities were as busy as they had been in a half decade  175  177  RKO Teleradio Pictures released Fritz Lang s final two American films  While the City Sleeps and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt  both 1956   but years of mismanagement had driven away many directors  producers  and stars  116  The studio was also saddled with the last of the inflated B movies such as Pearl of the South Pacific  1955  and The Conqueror  1956  that enchanted Hughes  178  The latter  starring John Wayne  was the biggest hit produced at the studio during the decade  but its  4 5 million in North American rentals did not come close to covering its  6 million cost  40  After a year and a half without a notable success  General Tire shut down production at RKO for good at the end of January 1957  The Hollywood and Culver City facilities were sold later that year for  6 15 million to Desilu Productions  owned by Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball  who had been an RKO contract player from 1935 to 1942  179  Desilu would be acquired by Gulf and Western Industries in 1967 and merged into G W s other production company  Paramount Pictures  the former RKO Hollywood studio became home to Paramount Television  now CBS Paramount Television   which it remains to this day  The renovated Culver City studio is now owned and operated as an independent production facility  180  Forty Acres  the Culver City backlot  was razed in the mid 1970s  181  List Industries  the former RKO Theatres Corp   was acquired by Glen Alden Corp  in 1959  After Glen Alden s 1967 acquisition of the Stanley Warner theater group  the two chains were merged into RKO Stanley Warner Theatres  Cinerama purchased the exhibition circuit from Glen Alden in 1971  182  With the closing down of production  RKO also shut its distribution exchanges  from 1957 forward  remaining pictures were released through other companies  primarily Universal International  The final RKO film  Verboten   a coproduction with director Samuel Fuller s Globe Enterprises  was released by Columbia Pictures in March 1959  183  That same year   Pictures  was stripped from the corporate identity  the holding company for General Tire s broadcasting operation and the few remaining motion picture assets was renamed RKO General  184  k  In the words of scholar Richard B  Jewell   The supreme irony of RKO s existence is that the studio earned a position of lasting importance in cinema history largely because of its extraordinarily unstable history  Since it was the weakling of Hollywood s  majors   RKO welcomed a diverse group of individualistic creators and provided them   with an extraordinary degree of freedom to express their artistic idiosyncrasies      I t never became predictable and it never became a factory   185   edit  RKO General Main article  RKO General One of North America s major radio and television broadcasters from the 1950s through the late 1980s  RKO General traces its roots to the 1943 purchase of the Yankee Network by General Tire  In 1952  the company united its newly expanded broadcasting interests into a division dubbed General Teleradio  With the tire manufacturer s acquisition of the RKO film studio in 1955  its media businesses were brought together under the rubric of RKO Teleradio Pictures  In 1959  following the breakup of the movie studio  the media division was given the name it would operate under for the next three decades  RKO General  In addition to its broadcasting activities  RKO General was also the holding company for many of General Tire s  and  after its parent company s reorganization  GenCorp s  other noncore businesses  including soft drink bottling  hotel enterprises  and  for seventeen years  the original Frontier Airlines  186  The RKO General radio lineup included some of the highest rated  most influential popular music stations in North America  In May 1965  KHJ  AM  in Los Angeles introduced the Boss Radio variation of the top 40 format  The restrictive programming style was soon adopted by many of RKO s other stations and imitated by non RKO broadcasters around the country  187  RKO s FM station in New York pioneered numerous formats under a variety of call letters  including WOR and WXLO   99X    in 1983  as WRKS   98 7 Kiss FM    it became one of the first major stations to regularly program rap music  188  In 1979  RKO General created the RKO Radio Network  reportedly the first broadcasting web linked via satellite  189  The company s television stations  for the most part non network affiliated  were known for showing classic films  both RKO productions and many others  under the banner of Million Dollar Movie  launched by New York s WOR TV in 1954  190  In June 1962  RKO General and Zenith Electronics initiated what became the first extended venture into subscription television service  through early 1969  Hartford  Connecticut s WHCT TV aired movies  sports  classical and pop music concerts  and other live performances without commercials  generating income from descrambler installation and weekly rental fees as well as individual program charges  191  However  RKO General s most notable legacy is what may be the longest licensing dispute in television history  It began in 1965  when General Tire was accused of obliging vendors to buy advertising with one of its stations if they wanted to keep their contracts  More than two decades  worth of legal actions ensued  eventually forcing GenCorp  the parent company since 1983 of both General Tire and RKO General  to sell off its broadcast holdings under FCC pressure  RKO General exited the media business permanently in 1991  186  192   edit  Later incarnations RKO Pictures

became involved in the coproduction of a number of feature films and TV projects through a subsidiary created three years earlier  RKO Pictures Inc  193  In collaboration with Universal Studios  RKO put out five films over the next three years  Though the studio frequently worked with major names including Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas  Jack Nicholson in The Border  and Nastassja Kinski in Cat People  all 1982  it met with little success  Starting with the Meryl Streep vehicle Plenty  1985   RKO took on more projects as sole studio backer  Films such as the erotic thriller Half Moon Street  1986  and the Vietnam War drama Hamburger Hill  1987  followed  but production ended as GenCorp underwent a massive reorganization following an attempted hostile takeover  186  With RKO General dismantling its broadcast business  RKO Pictures Inc   along with the original RKO studio s trademark  remake rights  and other remaining assets  was spun off and put up for sale  After a bid by RKO Pictures  own managers failed  it was acquired in late 1987 by Wesray Capital Corporation under the control of former U S  Secretary of the Treasury William E  Simon and Ray Chambers and linked with their Six Flags amusement parks to form RKO Six Flags Entertainment Inc  194  In 1989  RKO Pictures  which had produced no films while under Wesray control  was spun off yet again  Actress and Post Cereals heiress Dina Merrill and her husband  producer Ted Hartley  acquired a majority interest and merged the company with their Pavilion Communications  After a brief period as RKO Pavilion  the business was reorganized as RKO Pictures LLC  195  With the inaugural RKO production under Hartley and Merrill s ownership  False Identity  1990   the company also stepped into the distribution business  In 1992  it handled the well regarded independent production Laws of Gravity  directed by Nick Gomez  196  RKO s next significant release came in 1998 with Mighty Joe Young  a remake of a 1949 RKO movie that was itself something of a King Kong redux  197  In the early 2000s  the company was involved as a coproducer on TV movies and modestly budgeted features at the rate of about one annually  In 2003  RKO coproduced a Broadway stage version of the 1936 Astaire Rogers vehicle Swing Time  under the title Never Gonna Dance  198  In 2003  as well  RKO Pictures entered into a legal battle with Wall Street Financial Associates  WSFA   Hartley and Merrill claimed that the owners of WSFA fraudulently induced them into signing an acquisition agreement by concealing their  cynical and rapacious  plans to purchase RKO with the intention only of dismantling it  WSFA sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting RKO s majority owners from selling their interests in the company to any third parties  199  The WSFA motion was denied in July 2003  freeing RKO to deal with another potential purchaser  InternetStudios com  In 2004  that planned sale fell through when InternetStudios com apparently folded  200  The company s minimal involvement in new film production continues to focus on its remake rights  Are We Done Yet   based on Mr  Blandings Builds His Dream House  1948   was released in April 2007 to dismal reviews  201  Later in the year  RKO launched a horror division  Roseblood Movie Company  As of early 2010  Roseblood

Canadian TV and  consequently  video rights to the bulk of the RKO film library were sold at auction in 1971 after the holders  TransBeacon  a corporate descendant of C amp C Television   went bankrupt  The auctioned rights were split between United Artists and Marian B  Inc   MBI   In 1984  MBI created a subsidiary  Marian Pictures Inc   MBP   to which it transferred its share of the RKO

UA s considerable library  including its RKO rights  was bought by Turner Broadcasting for its new Turner Entertainment division  During RKO Pictures  brief Wesray episode  Turner acquired many of the distribution rights that had returned to RKO via MBP  as well as both the theatrical rights and the TV rights originally held back from C amp C for the cities where RKO owned stations  207  In October

Classic closing logo of RKO Radio Pictures Most Radio Pictures Inc  and RKO Radio Pictures Inc  films produced between 1929 and 1957 have an opening logo displaying the studio s famous trademark  the spinning globe and radio tower  nicknamed the  Transmitter   It was inspired by a two hundred foot tower built in Colorado for a giant electrical amplifier  or Tesla coil  created by inventor Nikola Tesla  215  Orson Welles referred to the design as his  favorite among the old logos  not just because it was so often a reliable portent      It reminds us to listen   216  The studio s closing logo  a triangle enclosing a thunderbolt  was also a well known trademark  217  Instead of the Transmitter  many Disney films released by the studio originally appeared with colorful versions of the RKO closing logo as part of the main title sequence  For decades  re releases of these films had Disney Buena Vista logos replacing the RKO insignia  but the originals have been restored in many recent DVD editions  218  The Hartley Merrill RKO Pictures has created new versions of the Transmitter and the closing thunderbolt logo   edit  See also List of RKO films  edit  Notes   The current online

firm   See RKO Radio Pictures  Inc  entry  Retrieved 2010 05 03  Many other online resources make the same false claim or similar ones  e g   that the RCA Photophone business was made part of RKO

business as Keith Albee  and Orpheum Circuit Inc  Edward F  Albee was Benjamin F  Keith s right hand man  He took over the company after the death of its founder  in 1914  and his son  A  Paul Keith  four years later  219  Many sources incorrectly give FBO s full name as  Film Booking Office of America   the proper name is Film Booking Offices of America  which may be confirmed by examining its official logo  220  As an example of the many erroneous descriptions of RKO s early history that are routine even in reputable sources  take the summary history of the company s origins in Grand Design  Hollywood as a Modern Business Enterprise  1930 1939  by Tino Balio  Berkeley  Los Angeles  and London  University of California Press  1995  1993    p  16  The following corrections must be

does cite Film Daily in a description of RKO as controlling 250 theaters in 1930  following a  buying binge   p  256   Schatz  1998  describes an  RKO chain of 161 theaters  around the time David O

Hollywood performers of the mid 1930s  see Balio  1995   p  155    By August 1940  the lease was no longer exclusive see  Screen News Here and in Hollywood   New York Times  August 28  1940  By mid

May 1  1949    Schatz s  1999  brief description of Mr  and Mrs  Smith as a  critical and commercial failure   p  89  is evidently incorrect  According to historian Leonard Leff   Mr  and Mrs  Smith had a happy ending  good reviews and modest box office success   225  Ed Sikov agrees  calling it a  solid commercial hit   226  Donald Spoto s report on its release lends further support to this position  227    Citizen Kane lost  150 000  160 000 on original release  the production cost was precisely  805 527 53   The Magnificent Ambersons lost  624 000  production cost  1 125 million   and the unreleased It s All True cost the studio an estimated  1 2 million  228  Note that the studio operation itself was almost certainly a bigger money loser than the cited figures suggest  with profits coming from the corporation s theatrical division  229    Jewell  1982  states that it  attracted  3 355 000 in film rentals   p  181   Lasky  1989  refers to a Hollywood Reporter article on the film  published seven months after its premiere  predicting it  would do better than  3 million in the U S  alone   p  185   It is not listed in Schatz s  1999  appendix of annual top box office films of the 1940s  p  466   based on a 1992 Variety reckoning  perhaps because of its unusual production history  Assuming Jewell s figure is accurate  and the Schatz Variety list is otherwise accurate and complete  Hitler s Children was the ninth biggest earner of 1943  a very impressive feat for a movie with a B budget and star  Tim Holt     Many online sources give RKO General s year of inception as 1958  without evidence  O Neill s 1959 dating is supported by the fact that there is no mention of RKO General in either the New York Times or the Los Angeles Times before February 1960
