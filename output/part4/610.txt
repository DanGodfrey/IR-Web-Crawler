and some 96  claiming to speak it  well  or  very well   3  However  no official language exists at the federal level  There have been several proposals to make English the national language in amendments to immigration reform bills  4  5  but none of these bills has become law with the amendment intact  The situation is quite varied at the state and territorial levels  with some states mirroring the federal policy of adopting no official language in a de jure capacity  others adopting English alone  others officially adopting English as well as local languages  and still others adopting a policy of de facto bilingualism  The variety of English spoken in the United States is known as American English  together with Canadian English it makes up the group of dialects known as North American English  Spanish is the second most common language in the country  and is spoken by over 12  of the population  6  The United States holds the world s fifth largest Spanish speaking population  outnumbered only by Mexico  Spain  Argentina  and Colombia  Throughout the Southwestern United States  long established Spanish speaking communities coexist with large numbers of more recent Hispanophone immigrants  Although many new Latin American immigrants are less than fluent in English  nearly all second generation Hispanic Americans speak English fluently  while only about half still speak Spanish  7  According to the 2000 US census  people of German ancestry make up the largest single ethnic group in the United States  and the German language ranks fifth  8  9 Italian  Polish  and Greek are still widely spoken among populations descending from immigrants from those countries in the early 20th century  but the use of these languages is dwindling as the older generations die  Russian is also spoken by immigrant populations  Tagalog and Vietnamese have over one million speakers each in the United States  almost entirely within recent immigrant populations  Both languages  along with the varieties of the Chinese language  Japanese  and Korean  are now used in elections in Alaska  California  Hawaii  Illinois  New York  Texas  and Washington  10  Native American languages are spoken in smaller pockets of the country  but these populations are decreasing  and the languages are almost never widely used outside of reservations  Hawaiian  although having few native speakers  is an official language along with English at the state level in Hawaii  The state government of Louisiana offers services and documents in French  as does New Mexico in Spanish  Besides English  Spanish  French  German  Navajo and other Native American languages  all other languages are usually learned from immigrant ancestors that came after the time of independence or learned through some form of education  Approximately 337 languages are spoken or signed by the population  of which 176 are indigenous to the area  52 languages formerly spoken in the country s territory are now extinct  11  Contents 1 Census statistics 2 Official language status 2 1 States that are de facto bilingual 2 2 Status of other languages 3 Indigenous languages 3 1 Native American

English  is the primary language used for legislation  regulations  executive orders  treaties  federal court rulings  and all other official pronouncements  although there are laws requiring documents such as ballots to be printed in multiple languages when there are large numbers of non English speakers in an area  As part of what has been called the English only movement  some states have adopted legislation granting official status to English  As of April 2011 update   out of 50 states  27 established English as the official language  including Hawaii where English and Hawaiian are both official  Place English official Other language s  Note Ref Alabama Yes No since 1990  15  Alaska Yes No since 2007  1998 law ruled unconstitutional  16  Arizona Yes No since 2006  1988 law

state of Alaska provides voting information in I upiaq  Central Yup ik  Gwich in  Siberian Yupik  Koyukon  and Tagalog  as well as English  California has agreed to allow the publication of state documents in other languages to represent minority groups and immigrant communities  Languages such as Spanish  Chinese  Korean  Tagalog  Persian  Russian  Vietnamese  and Thai appear in official state documents  and the Department of Motor Vehicles publishes in 9 languages  23  In New Mexico  although the state constitution does not specify an official language  laws are published in English and Spanish  and government material and services are legally required  by Act  to be made accessible to speakers of both languages  Some have asserted that the New Mexico situation is part of the provisions in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo  however  no mention of  language rights  is made in the Treaty or in the Protocol of Quer taro  beyond the  Mexican inhabitants  having  1  no reduction of rights below those of citizens of the United States and  2  precisely the same rights as are mentioned in Article III of the Treaty of the Louisiana Purchase and in the Treaty of the Florida Purchase  This would imply that the legal status of the Spanish language in New Mexico and in non Gadsden Purchase areas of Arizona is the same as of French in Louisiana and certainly not less than that of German in Pennsylvania  Percentage of people 5 years and over who speak Spanish at home  2008  Second most prevalent language in each US state Contrary to belief  the state of Pennsylvania was never officially bilingual  The state has a history of Pennsylvania Dutch German language communities that goes back to the 1650s  There were attempts to recognize German in Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries due to the prevalence of German speakers in the state  This situation prevailed until the 1950s in some rural areas  citation needed  The state of New York had state government documents  i e   vital records  co written in the Dutch language until the 1920s  in order to preserve the legacy of New Netherland  though England annexed the colony in 1664  24  Native American languages are official or co official on many of the U S  Indian reservations and pueblos  In Oklahoma before statehood in 1907  territory officials debated whether or not to have Cherokee  Choctaw and Muscogee languages as co official  but the idea never gained ground  The issue of bilingualism also applies in the states of Arizona and Texas  while the constitution of Texas has no official language policy  Arizona passed a proposition in the November 7  2006 general election declaring English as the official language  25  Nonetheless  Arizona law requires the distribution of voting ballots in languages such as Navajo and Tohono O odham in certain counties  26  In 2000  the census bureau printed the standard census questionnaires in six languages  English  Spanish  Korean  Chinese  in traditional characters   Vietnamese  and Tagalog   edit  Indigenous languages  edit  Native American languages The Native American languages predate European settlement of the New World  In a few parts of the U S   mostly on Indian reservations   they continue to be spoken fluently  Most of these languages are endangered  although there are efforts to revive them  Normally the fewer the speakers of a language the greater the degree of endangerment  but there are many small Native American language communities in the Southwest  Arizona and New Mexico  which continue to thrive despite their small size  In 1929  speaking of indigenous Native American languages  linguist Edward Sapir observed   Few people realize that within the confines of the United States there is spoken today a far greater variety of languages     than in the whole of Europe  We may go further  We may say  quite literally and safely  that in the state of California alone there are greater and more numerous linguistic extremes than can be illustrated in all the length and breadth of Europe   27  According to the 2000 Census and other language surveys  the largest Native American language speaking community by far is the Navajo  Navajo is an Athabascan language with 178 000 speakers  primarily in the states of Arizona  New Mexico and Utah  in addition to smaller numbers of speakers across the country  Dakota is a Siouan language with 18 000 speakers in the US alone  22 000 including speakers in Canada   not counting 6 000 speakers of the closely related Lakota  Most speakers live in the states of North Dakota and South Dakota  Central Alaskan Yup ik is an Eskimo Aleut language with 16 000 speakers  most of whom live in Alaska  Cherokee belongs to the Iroquoian language family  and had about 22 000 speakers as of 2005  28  The Cherokee have the largest tribal affiliation in the U S   but most are of mixed ancestry and do not speak the language  Recent efforts to preserve and increase the Cherokee language in Oklahoma and the Cherokee Indian reservation in North Carolina have been productive  Western Apache  with 12 500 speakers  is a Southern Athabaskan language closely related to Navajo  but not mutually intelligible with it  Most speakers live in Arizona  The O odham language  spoken by the Pima and the Tohono O odham  is a Uto Aztecan language with more than 12 000 speakers  most of whom live in central and southern Arizona and northern Sonora  Choctaw has 11 000 speakers  One of the Muskogean language family  like Seminole and Alabama  Keres has 11 000 speakers  A language isolate  the Keres are the largest of the Pueblo nations  The Keres pueblo of Acoma is the oldest continually inhabited community in the United States  Zuni has 10 000 speakers  Zuni is a language isolate mostly spoken in a single pueblo  Zuni  the largest in the U S  Ojibwe has 7 000 speakers  about 55 000 including speakers in Canada   The Algonquian language family includes populous languages like Cree in Canada  Many other languages have been spoken within the current borders of the United States  The following is a list of 28 language families  groups of demonstrably related languages  indigenous to the territory of the continental United States  Algic Alsean Athabaskan Caddoan Chimakuan Chinookan Chumashan Coosan Comecrudan Eskimo Aleut Iroquoian Kalapuyan Maiduan Muskogean Palaihnihan Plateau Penutian Pomoan Salishan Shastan Siouan Tanoan Tsimshian Utian Uto Aztecan Wakashan Wintuan Yokutsan Yuman In addition to the above list of families  there are many languages in the United States that are sufficiently well known to attempt to classify but which have not been shown to be related to any other language in the world  These 25 language isolates are listed below  With further study  some of these will likely prove to be related to each other or to one of the established families  There are also larger and more contentious proposals such as Penutian and Hokan  Adai Atakapa Cayuse Chimariko Chitimacha Coahuilteco Esselen Haida Karankawa Karok Keres Kootenai Natchez Salinan Siuslaw Takelma Timucua Tonkawa Tunica Washo Yana Yuchi Yuki Wappo Zuni Since the languages in the Americas have a history stretching for about 17 000 to 12 000 years  current knowledge of American languages is limited  There are doubtless a number of languages that were spoken in the United States that are missing from historical record   edit  Native American sign languages A sign language trade pidgin  known as Plains Indian Sign Language or Plains Standard  arose among the Plains Indians  Each signing nation had a separate signed version of their spoken language  that was used by the hearing  and these were not mutually intelligible  Plains Standard was used to communicate between these nations  It seems to have started in Texas and then spread north  through the Great Plains  as far as British Columbia  There are still a few users today  especially among the Crow  Cheyenne  and Arapaho  Unlike other sign languages developed by hearing people  it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages   edit  Austronesian languages  edit  Hawaiian Hawaiian is an official state language of Hawaii as prescribed in the Constitution of Hawaii  Hawaiian has 1 000 native speakers  Formerly considered critically endangered  Hawaiian is showing signs of language renaissance  The recent trend is based on new Hawaiian language immersion programs of the Hawaii State Department of Education and the University of Hawaii  as well as efforts by the Hawaii State Legislature and county governments to preserve Hawaiian place names  In 1993  about 8 000 could speak and understand it  today estimates range up to 27 000  Hawaiian is related to the M ori language spoken by around 150 000 New Zealanders and Cook Islanders as well as the Tahitian language which is spoken by another 120 000 people of Tahiti   edit  Samoan Samoan is an official territorial language of American Samoa  Samoans make up 90  of the population  and most people are bilingual   edit  Chamorro Chamorro is co official in the Mariana Islands  both in the territory of Guam and in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands  In Guam  the Chamorro people make up about 60  of the population   edit  Carolinian Carolinian is also co official in the Northern Marianas  where only 14  of people speak English at home   edit  Immigrant languages A trash can in Seattle labeled in four languages  English  Chinese       Vietnamese  should be r c   and Spanish  Tagalog also uses the Spanish word  Some of the first European languages to be spoken in the U S  are English  Dutch  German  French  and Spanish  From the mid 19th century on  the nation had large numbers of immigrants who spoke little or no English  and throughout the country state laws  constitutions  and legislative proceedings appeared in the languages of politically important immigrant groups  There have been bilingual schools and local newspapers in such languages as German  Hungarian  Irish  Italian  Norwegian  Greek  Polish  Swedish  Romanian  Czech  Japanese  Yiddish  Hebrew  Lithuanian  Welsh  Cantonese  Bulgarian  Dutch  Portuguese and others  despite opposing English only laws that  for example  illegalized church services  telephone conversations  and even conversations in the street or on railway platforms in any language other than English  until the first of these laws was ruled unconstitutional in 1923  Meyer v  Nebraska   Currently  Asian languages account for the majority of languages spoken in immigrant communities  Korean  the varieties of Chinese  and various Indian or South Asian languages like Punjabi  Hindi Urdu  Kannada  Gujarati  Marathi  Bengali  Tamil  Telugu and Malayalam  Arabic  Vietnamese  Tagalog  Persian  and others  From the 1920s to the early 1950s  a dozen radio stations broadcast in immigrant languages  notably Yiddish for European Jewish immigrants in the Eastern seaboard   but was curtailed by the Great Depression  1930s   then the US government during World War II and came to an end in the late 1940s  Global radio waves on shortwave radio can broadcast in any language and today the internet offers a wide variety of media streamlinked in every major language to the USA and everywhere  citation needed  Typically  immigrant languages tend to be lost through assimilation within two or three generations  though there are some groups such as the Cajuns  French   Pennsylvania Dutch  German  in a state where large numbers of people were heard to speak it before the 1950s  and the original settlers of the Southwest  Spanish  who have maintained their languages for centuries   edit  English Main article  American English English language distribution in the United States  English was inherited from British colonization  and it is spoken by the majority of the population  It serves as the de facto official language  the language in which government business is carried out  According to the US Census Bureau 80 3  spoke only English at Home and 24 252 429 of U S  residents do not speak English  well  or  very well   29  American English is different from British English in terms of spelling  a classic example being the dropped  u  in words such as color colour   grammar  vocabulary  pronunciation  and slang usage  The differences are not usually a barrier to effective communication between an American English and a British English speaker  but there are certainly enough differences to cause occasional misunderstandings  usually surrounding slang or region dialect differences  citation needed  Some states  like California  have amended their constitutions to make English the only official language  but in practice  this only means that official government documents must at least be in English  and does not mean that they should be exclusively available only in English  For example  the standard California Class C driver s license examination is available in 32 different languages  30   edit  Spanish Main article  Spanish in the United States Spanish language distribution in the United States  Spanish was also inherited from colonization and is sanctioned as official in Puerto Rico  Spanish is also taught in various regions as a second language  especially in areas with large Hispanic populations such as the Southwestern United States along the border with Mexico  as well as Florida  parts of California  the District of Columbia  Illinois  New Jersey  and New York  In Hispanic communities across the country  bilingual signs in both Spanish and English may be quite common  Furthermore  numerous neighborhoods exist  such as Washington Heights in New York City or Little Havana in Miami  in which entire city blocks will have only Spanish language signs and Spanish speaking people  In addition to Spanish speaking Hispanic populations  younger generations of non Hispanics in the United States seem to be learning Spanish in larger numbers due to the growing Hispanic population and increasing popularity of Latin American movies and music performed in the Spanish language  A 2007 American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau  showed that Spanish is the primary language spoken at home by over 34 million people aged 5 or older  6  making the United States the world s fifth largest Spanish speaking community  outnumbered only by Mexico  Spain  Colombia  and Argentina  31  32  Spanglish is a code switching variant of Spanish and English and is spoken in areas with large bilingual populations of Spanish and English speakers  such as along the Mexico   United States border  California  Arizona  New Mexico  and Texas   Florida  and New York City   edit  French French language distribution in the United States  Counties and parishes marked in yellow are those where 6  to 12  of the population speak French at home  brown  12  to 18   red  over 18   Cajun French and French based creole languages are not included even though the Creole dialects are spoken throughout the U S  and taught in many U S  schools  Main article  French in the United States French  the fourth most common language  is spoken mainly by the Louisiana Creole  native French  Cajun  Haitian  and French Canadian populations  It is widely spoken in Maine  New Hampshire  and in Louisiana  French is the second de facto language in the state of Louisiana  where the French dialect of Cajun predominates   The largest French speaking communities in the United States reside in Northeast Maine  Hollywood and Miami  Florida  New York City  certain areas of rural Louisiana  and small minorities in Vermont and New Hampshire  Many of the New England communities are connected to the dialect found across the border in Quebec or New Brunswick  More than 13 million Americans possess primary French heritage  but only 1 6 million speak that language at home   edit  Arabic Arabic is spoken by immigrants from the Middle East as well as many Muslim Americans  The highest concentrations of native Arabic speakers reside in heavily urban areas like Chicago  New York City  and Los Angeles  Detroit and the surrounding areas of Michigan boast a significant Arabic speaking population including many Arab Christians of Lebanese  Syrian  and Palestinian descent  Arabic is used for religious purposes by Muslim Americans and by some Arab Christians  notably Catholics of the Melkite and Maronite Churches as well as Rum Orthodox  i e  Antiochian Orthodox Christians   A significant number of educated Arab professionals who immigrate often already know English quite well  as it is widely used in the Middle East  Lebanese immigrants also have a broader understanding of French as do many Arabic speaking immigrants from North Africa   edit  Chinese Chinese  mostly of the Cantonese variety  is the third most spoken language in the United States  almost completely spoken within Chinese American populations and by immigrants or the descendants of immigrants  especially in California  33  Many young Americans not of Chinese descent have become interested in learning the language  specifically Mandarin  the official spoken language in the People s Republic of China  Over 2 million Americans speak some variety of Chinese  with the Mandarin variety becoming increasingly more prevalent due to the opening up of the PRC  33  In New York City at least  although Mandarin is spoken as a native language among only 10  of Chinese speakers  it is used as a secondary dialect among the greatest number of them and is on its way to replace Cantonese as their lingua franca  34   edit  Dutch Dutch language distribution in the United States  There has been a Dutch presence in America since 1602  when the government of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands chartered the Dutch East India Company  Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie  or VOC  with the mission of exploring for a passage to the Indies and claiming any uncharted territories for the Dutch republic  In 1664  English troops under the command of the Duke of York  later James II of England  attacked the New Netherland colony  Being greatly outnumbered  director general Peter Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam  with Fort Orange following soon  New Amsterdam was renamed New York  Fort Orange was renamed Fort Albany  Dutch was still spoken in many parts of New York at the time of the Revolution  For example  Alexander Hamilton s wife Eliza Hamilton attended a Dutch language church during their marriage  Martin Van Buren  the first President born in the United States following its independence  spoke Dutch as his native language  making him the only President whose first language was not English  In a 1990 demographic consensus  3  of surveyed citizens claimed descent from Dutch settlers  Modern estimates place the Dutch American population at 5 million  lagging just a bit behind Scottish Americans and Swedish Americans  Notable Dutch Americans include the Roosevelts  Theodore Roosevelt  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  and Eleanor Roosevelt  Marlon Brando  Thomas Alva Edison  Martin Van Buren and the Vanderbilts  The Roosevelts are direct descendants of Dutch settlers of the New Netherlands colony in the 17th century  Only 150 000 people in the United States still speak the Dutch language at home today  35  concentrated mainly in Michigan  i e  the city of Holland   Tennessee  Miami  Houston  and Chicago  The Dutch language is studied as a novelty in mostly Dutch communities of Pella  Iowa  and San Joaquin County  California has a renowned Dutch and Frisian settlement history since the 1840s  A vernacular dialect of Dutch  known as Jersey Dutch was spoken by a significant number of people in the New Jersey area between the start of the 17th century to the mid 20th century  With the beginning of the 20th century  usage of the language became restricted to internal family circles  with an ever growing number of people abandoning the language in favor of English  It suffered gradual decline throughout the 20th century  and it ultimately dissipated from casual usage   edit  Finnish Finnish language distribution in the United States  The first Finnish settlers in America were amongst the settlers who came from Sweden and Finland to New Sweden colony  Most colonists were Finnish  However  the Finnish language was not preserved as well among subsequent generations as Swedish  Shortly after the Civil War  many Finnish citizens immigrated to the United States  mainly in rural areas of the Midwest  and more specifically in Michigan s Upper Peninsula   Hancock  Michigan  as of 2005  still incorporates bi lingual street signs written in both English and Finnish  36 Americans of Finnish origin yield at 800 000 individuals  though only 39 770 speak the language at home  37  There is a distinctive dialect of English to be found in the Upper Peninsula  known as Yooper  Yuper often has a Finnish cadence and uses Finnish sentence structure with modified English  German  Swedish  Norwegian  and Finnish vocabulary  Notable Finnish Americans include Gus Hall  U S  Communist Party leader  Renny Harlin  film director  and the Canadian born actress Pamela Anderson  Another Finnish community in the United States is found in Lake Worth  Florida  north of Miami   edit  German Main article  German in the United States See also  Hutterite German  Texas German  Pennsylvania Dutchified English  Plautdietsch  German was a widely spoken language in some of the colonies  especially Pennsylvania  where a number of German speaking religious minorities settled to escape persecution in Europe  Dutch  Swedish  and Scottish Gaelic all became less common than German after the American Revolution  Another wave of settlement occurred when Germans fleeing the failure of 19th Century German revolutions emigrated to the United States  Large numbers of Germans settled throughout the U S   especially in the cities  Neighborhoods in many cities were German speaking  German farmers took up farming around the country  including the Texas Hill Country  at this time  German was widely spoken until the United States entered World War I  Numerous local German language newspapers and periodicals existed  German language distribution in the United States  In the early twentieth century  German was the most widely studied foreign language in the United States  and prior to World War I  more than 6  citation needed  of American school children received their primary education exclusively in German  though some of these Germans came from areas outside of Germany proper  Currently  more than 49 million Americans claim German ancestry  the largest self described ethnic group in the U S   but less than 4  of them speak a language other than English at home  according to the 2005 American Community Survey  38  The Amish speak a dialect of German known as Pennsylvania German  One reason for this decline of German language was the perception during both World Wars that speaking the language of the enemy was unpatriotic  foreign language instruction was banned in places during the First World War  Unlike earlier waves  they were more concentrated in cities  and integrated quickly  There is a myth  known as the Muhlenberg Vote  that German was to be the official language of the U S   but this is inaccurate and based on a failed early attempt to have government documents translated into German  39  The myth also extends to German being the second official language of Pennsylvania  however  Pennsylvania has no official language  Although more than 49 million Americans claim they have German ancestors  only 1 38 million Americans speak German at home  Many of these people are Amish and Mennonites   edit  Russian Russian language

Russian American Company used to own Alaska Territory until selling it after the Crimean War  Russian had always been limited  especially after the assassination of the Romanov dynasty of tsars  Starting in the 1970s and continuing until the mid 1990s  many people from the Soviet Union and later its constituent republics such as Russia  Ukraine  Belarus  and Uzbekistan have immigrated to the United States  increasing the language s usage in America  The largest Russian speaking neighborhoods in the United States are found in Queens  Brooklyn  and Staten Island in New York City  specifically the Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn   parts of Los Angeles  particularly West Los Angeles and West Hollywood  parts of Philadelphia  particularly the Far Northeast and  parts of Miami like Sunny Isles Beach   edit  Hebrew Modern Hebrew is used by some immigrants from Israel and Eastern Europe  Liturgical Hebrew is used as a religious or liturgical language by many of the United States  approximately 7 million Jews   edit  Ilocano Like the Tagalogs  the Ilocanos are an Austronesian stock which came from the Philippines  They were the first Filipinos to migrate en masse to the United States  They first entered the State of Hawai i and worked there in the vast plantations  As they did in the Philippine provinces of Northern Luzon and Mindanao  they quickly gained importance in the areas where they settled  Thus  the state of Hawai i became no less different from the Philippines in terms of percentage of Ilocano speakers  Like Tagalog  Ilocano is also being taught in universities where most of the Filipinos reside   edit  Irish Up to 37 million Americans have Irish ancestry  many of whose ancestors would have spoken Irish  According to the 2000 census  25 661 people speak Irish at home  40  As of 2008 update  it was the 76th most spoken language in the USA  with 22 279 speakers  41   edit  Italian Current distribution of the Italian language in the United States  Main article  Italian language in the United States The Italian language and its various dialects has been widely spoken in the United States for more than one hundred years  primarily due to large scale immigration from the late 19th century to the mid 20th C  In addition to Standard Italian learned by most people today  there has been a strong representation of the dialects and languages of Southern Italy amongst the immigrant population  Sicilian and Neapolitan in particular   As of 2000  though 15 638 348 American citizens report themselves as Italian Americans  only 1 008 370 of these report speaking the Italian language at home  0 384  of the population    edit  Khmer  Cambodian  Between 1981 1985 about 150 000 Cambodians resettled in the United States  42  Before 1975 very few Cambodians came to the United States  Those who did were children of upper class families sent abroad to attend school  After the fall of Phnom Penh to the communist Khmer Rouge in 1975  some Cambodians managed to escape  In 2000 the Census Bureau reported that there were approximately 172 000 Cambodians living in the United States  making up about 1 8 percent of the Asian population  43  The states with the most Khmer speakers are California  Massachusetts  Washington  Pennsylvania and Texas   edit  Polish The Polish language is very common in the Chicago metropolitan area  Chicago s largest white ethnic groups are those of Polish descent  The Polish people and the Polish language in Chicago have been very prevalent in the early years of the city  as well as the progression and economical and social development of Chicago  Poles in Chicago make up one of the largest ethnically Polish population  650 000 people  in the world comparable to the city of Wroc aw  the fourth largest city in Poland  That makes it one of the most important centres of Polonia and the Polish language in the United States  a fact that the city celebrates every Labor Day weekend at the Taste of Polonia Festival in Jefferson Park  44   edit  Portuguese The first Portuguese speakers in America were Jews who had fled the Inquisition  they founded the first Jewish communities  two of which stiil exist  Congregation Shearith Israel in New York and Congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia  However  by the end of the 18th century the use of Portuguese had been replaced by English  In the late 19th century  many Portuguese  mainly Azorean and Madeira  immigrated to the United States  establishing in cities like Providence  Rhode Island  New Bedford  Massachusetts  and Santa Cruz  California  Many of them also moved to Hawaii during its independence  In the mid late 20th century there was another surge of Portuguese immigration in America  mainly in the Northeast  New Jersey  New York  Connecticut  Massachusetts   Many Portuguese Americans may include descendants of Portuguese settlers born in Africa  like Angola  Cape Verde  and Mozambique  and Asia  mostly Macau   There were around 1 million Portuguese Americans in the United States by the year 2000  Portuguese  European Portuguese  has been spoken in the United States by small communities of immigrants  mainly in the metropolitan New York City area  like Newark  New Jersey  The Portuguese language is also spoken widely by Brazilian immigrants  established mainly in Miami  New York City and Boston   Brazilian Portuguese   edit  Scottish Gaelic In the 17th and 18th centuries  tens of thousands of Scots from Scotland  and Scots Irish from the north of Ireland arrived in the American colonies  Today  an estimated 20 million Americans are of Scottish ancestry  The province of Nova Scotia  Canada was the main concentration of Scottish Gaelic speakers in North America  Nova Scotia is Latin for New Scotland   According to the 2000 census  1 119 people speak Scottish Gaelic at home  45   edit  Swedish Swedish language distribution in the United States  There has been a Swedish presence in America since the New Sweden colony came into existence in March 1638  Widespread diaspora of Swedish immigration did not occur until the latter half of the 19th century  bringing in a total of a million Swedes  No other country had a higher percentage of its people leave for the United States except Ireland and Norway  At the beginning of the 20th century  Minnesota had the highest ethnic Swedish population in the world after the city of Stockholm  3 7  of US residents claim descent from Scandinavian ancestors  amounting to roughly 11 12 million people  According to SIL s Ethnologue  over half a million ethnic Swedes still speak the language  though according to the 2000 census only 67 655 speak it at home  46 Cultural assimilation has contributed to the gradual and steady decline of the language in the US  After the independence of the US from the Kingdom of Great Britain  the government encouraged colonists to adopt the English language as a common medium of communication  and in some cases  imposed it upon them  Subsequent generations of Swedish Americans received education in English and spoke it as their first language  Lutheran churches scattered across the Midwest started abandoning Swedish in favor of English as their language of worship  Swedish newspapers and publications alike slowly faded away  There are sizable Swedish communities in Minnesota  Ohio  Maryland  Philadelphia and Delaware  along with small isolated pockets in Pennsylvania  San Francisco  Fort Lauderdale  and New York  Chicago once contained a large Swedish enclave called Andersonville on the city s north side  John Morton  the person who cast the decisive vote leading to Pennsylvania s support for the United States Declaration of Independence  was a Finland Swede  Note that Finland was still a part of Sweden in the 18th century    edit  Tagalog Tagalog language distribution in the United States  Tagalog speakers were already present in the United States as early as the late sixteenth century as sailors contracted by the Spanish colonial government  In the eighteenth century  they established settlements in Louisiana  such as Saint Malo  After the American annexation of the Philippines  the number of Tagalog speakers steadily increased  as Filipinos began to migrate as students or contract laborers  Their numbers  however  decreased upon Philippine independence  as many Filipinos were repatriated  Today  Tagalog  together with its standardized form Filipino  is spoken by over a million Filipino Americans  and is promoted by Filipino American civic organizations and Philippine consulates  Taglish  a form of code switching between Tagalog and English  is also spoken by a number of Filipino Americans  As the Filipinos became the second fastest growing Asian population in the United States  Tagalog easily became the second most spoken Asian language in the continent  Today  Tagalog is being majored in some universities where a significant number of Filipinos exist  Some of these schools include the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the University of California  As Tagalog is the basis of Filipino  most of all the Filipinos living in the United States are proficient in Tagalog   edit  Welsh Welsh language distribution in the United States  Up to two million Americans are thought to have Welsh ancestry  However  there is very little Welsh being used commonly in the USA  According to the 2000 U S  Census  2 649 people speak Welsh at home 47  Some place names  such as Bryn Mawr in Chicago and Bryn Mawr  Pennsylvania  English  Big Hill  are Welsh  Several towns in Pennsylvania  mostly in the Welsh Tract  have Welsh namesakes  including Uwchlan  Bala Cynwyd  Gwynedd  and Tredyffrin   edit  Yiddish Yiddish has a much longer history in the United States than Hebrew  48  It has been present since at least the late 19th century and continues to have roughly 179 000 speakers as of the 2000 census  Though they came from varying geographic backgrounds and nuanced approaches to worship  immigrant Jews of Eastern Europe and Russia were often united under a common understanding of the Yiddish language once they settled in America  and at one point dozens of publications were available in most East Coast cities  Though it has declined by quite a bit since the end of WWII  it has by no means disappeared  Many Israeli immigrants and expatriates have at least some understanding of the language in addition to Hebrew  and many of the descendants of the great migration of Ashkenazi Jews of the past century pepper their mostly English vocabulary with some loan words  Furthermore  it is definitely a lingua franca alive and well among Orthodox Jewry  particularly in Los Angeles  Miami and New York  49  50   edit  New American languages  dialects  and creoles Several languages have developed on American soil  including creoles and sign languages   edit  African American Vernacular English African American Vernacular English  AAVE   also known as Ebonics  is a variety of English spoken by many African Americans  in both rural and urban areas  Not all African Americans speak AAVE and many European Americans do  Indeed  it is generally accepted that Southern American English is part of the same continuum as AAVE  There is considerable debate among non linguists as to whether the word  dialect  is appropriate to describe it  However  there is general agreement among linguists and many African Americans that AAVE is part of a historical continuum between creoles such as Gullah and the language brought by English colonists  Some educators view AAVE as exerting a negative influence on the learning of Proper and Standard English  as numerous AAVE rules differ from the rules of Standard English  Other educators  however  propose that Standard English should be taught as a  second dialect  in areas where AAVE is a strong part of local tradition   edit  Chinuk Wawa or Chinook Jargon Chinuk Wawa  or Chinook Jargon  is a Creole language of 700 800 words of French  English  Cree and other Native origins  It is the old trade language of the Pacific Northwest  It was used

and it was last used extensively in Seattle   edit  Gullah Gullah  an English African creole language spoken on the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia  retains strong influences of West African languages  The language is sometimes referred to as  Geechee    edit  Hawai i Creole English Hawaiian Pidgin  more accurately known as Hawai i Creole English  is commonly used by locals and is considered an unofficial language of the state  This not to be confused with Hawaiian English which is standard American English with Hawaiian words   edit  Outer Banks languages In the islands of the Outer Banks off North Carolina  several unique English dialects have developed  This is evident on Harkers Island and Ocracoke Island   edit  Pennsylvania Dutch Pennsylvania Dutch is a language spoken

Sign Language American Sign Language  ASL  is the native language of a number of Deaf and hearing people in America  While some sources have stated that ASL is the second most frequently used non English language in the US  following Spanish  51  recent scholarship has pointed out that most of these estimates are based on numbers conflating deafness with ASL use  and that the last actual study of this  in 1972  seems to indicate an upper bound of 500 000 ASL speakers at the time  14  Unlike Signed English  ASL is a natural language in its own right  not a manual representation of English
