Bono  David Evans   The Edge    his brother Dik  and Adam Clayton responded to an advertisement on a bulletin board at Mount Temple posted by fellow student Larry Mullen Jr  to form a rock band  The band had occasional jam sessions in which they did covers of other bands  Tired of long guitar solos and hard rock  Bono wanted to play Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys songs  Unfortunately the band could not play covers very well  so they started writing their own songs  The band went by the name  Feedback  for a few months  before changing to  The Hype  later on  After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band  the Virgin Prunes  the remaining four officially changed the name from  The Hype  to  U2   Initially Bono sang  played guitar  and wrote the band s songs  He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview   When we started out I was the guitar player  along with the Edge except I couldn t play guitar  I still can t  I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead  I had tried before  but I had no voice at all  I remember the day I found I could sing  I said   Oh  that s how you do it    34  When The Edge s guitar playing improved  Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone  although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica  As of 2006  Bono has taken piano lessons from his children s piano teacher as a means to improve his songwriting  35  Bono writes the lyrics for almost all U2 songs  which are often rich in social and political themes  4  His lyrics frequently allude to a religious connection or meaning  evident in songs such as  Gloria  from the band s album October  and  I Still Haven t Found What I m Looking For  from The Joshua Tree  5  During the band s early years  Bono was known for his rebellious tone which turned to political anger and rage during the band s War  The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum eras  4  Following the Enniskillen bombing that left 11 dead and 63 injured on 8 November 1987  the Provisional IRA paramilitaries threatened to kidnap Bono  2  IRA supporters also attacked a vehicle carrying the band members  2  These acts were in response to his speech condemning the Remembrance Day Bombing during a live performance of  Sunday Bloody Sunday   2  The singer had been advised to cut his on stage outburst from the Rattle and Hum film  but it was left in  36  Also featured in the film is footage of Bono spray painting a monument during an outdoor performance  Bono was forced to pay a fine  Bono as his alter ego  The Fly  on the Zoo TV Tour in 1992 U2 s sound and focus dramatically changed with their 1991 album  Achtung Baby  Bono s lyrics became more personal  inspired by experiences related to the private lives of the members of the band  2  4  During the band s Zoo TV Tour several of his stage personas were showcased  these included  The Fly   a stereotypical rock star  the  Mirror Ball Man   a parody of American televangelists  and  Mr  MacPhisto   a combination of a corrupted rock star and the Devil  2  4  During performances he attempts to interact with the crowd as often as possible and is known for pulling audience members onto the stage or moving himself down to the physical level of the audience  2  This has happened on several occasions including at the Live Aid concert in 1985 where he leapt off the stage and pulled a woman from the crowd to dance with her as the band played  Bad   and in 2005 during U2 s Vertigo Tour stop in Chicago  where he pulled a boy onto the stage during the song  An Cat Dubh   Into the Heart   2  37  Bono has often allowed fans to come on stage and perform songs with the band  Bono has won numerous awards with U2  including 22 Grammy awards and the 2003 Golden Globe award for best original song   The Hands That Built America   for the film Gangs of New York  15  38  During the live broadcast of the ceremony  Bono called the award  really  really fucking brilliant   39  In response  the Parents Television Council condemned Bono for his profanity and started a campaign for its members to file complaints with the FCC  40  Although Bono s use of  fuck  violated FCC indecency standards  the FCC refused to fine NBC because the network did not receive advance notice of the consequences of broadcasting such profanity and the profanity in question was not used in its literal sexual meaning  41  U2 performing at Madison Square Garden in November 2005  In 2005  the U2 band members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  in their first year of eligibility  42  In November 2008  Rolling Stone ranked Bono the 32nd greatest singer of all time  43  Bono and his bandmates were criticised in 2007 for moving part of their multi million euro song catalogue from Ireland to Amsterdam six months before Ireland ended a tax exemption on musicians  royalties  16  44  Under Dutch tax law  bands are subject to low to non existent tax rates  16  U2 s manager  Paul McGuinness  stated that the arrangement is legal and customary and businesses often seek to minimise their tax burdens  16  The move prompted criticisms in the Irish parliament  45  46  The band later responded by stating that approximately 95  of their business took place outside Ireland  and that they were taxed globally because of this  47  Bono was one of several super rich figures whose tax arrangements were singled out for criticism in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008  48  Collaborations In addition to his work with U2  he has collaborated with Frank

of rock and roll   Rock and roll is truly a broad church  but each lights a candle to their vision of what it is   74  The collection  which is edited by poet Jonathan Wells  contains titles such as

enterprise  85  In a 1986 interview with Rolling Stone magazine  Bono explained that he was motivated to become involved in social and political causes by seeing one of the Secret Policeman s Ball benefit shows  staged by John Cleese and producer Martin Lewis for the human rights organisation Amnesty International in 1979  86  I saw  The Secret Policeman s Ball  and it became a part of me  It

saved only by outside help not to mention celebrities and charity concerts is a destructive and misleading conceit   106  Elsewhere  Bono has been criticised  along with other celebrities  for

they failed to work with African entrepreneurs and grassroots organisations  and as a result  Africa has become more dependent on international handouts  114  Bono responded to his critics in Times Online on 19 February 2006  calling them  cranks carping from the sidelines  A lot of them wouldn t know what to do if they were on the field  They re the party who will always be in opposition so
