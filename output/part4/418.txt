The Incredible Hulk  1  May 1962   The Hulk is cast as the emotional and impulsive alter ego of the withdrawn and reserved physicist Dr  Bruce Banner  The Hulk appears shortly after Banner is accidentally exposed to the blast of a test detonation of a gamma bomb he invented  Subsequently  Banner will involuntarily transform into the Hulk  depicted as a giant  raging  humanoid monster  leading to extreme complications in Banner s life  Lee said the Hulk s creation was inspired by a combination of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde and Frankenstein  1  Although the Hulk s coloration has varied throughout the character s publication history  the most consistent shade is green  As the Hulk  Banner is capable of significant feats of strength  the magnitude of which increase in direct proportion to the character s anger  As the character himself puts it   The madder Hulk gets  the stronger Hulk gets   Strong emotions such as anger  terror and grief are also triggers for forcing Banner s transformation into the Hulk  A common storyline is the pursuit of both Banner and the Hulk by the U S  armed forces  because of all the destruction that he causes  The Hulk has since been depicted in various other media  most notably by Bill Bixby as Dr  David Banner and Lou Ferrigno as the Hulk in the live action television series and five made for television movies  Others have been  multiple animated series  through the use of CGI in Hulk  2003  and The Incredible Hulk  2008   and various video games  The Hulk is set to appear in the 2012 film The Avengers  Contents 1 Publication

Incredible Hulk  1  May 1962   written by writer editor Stan Lee  and penciller and co plotter Jack Kirby  and inked by Paul Reinman  Lee cites influence from Frankenstein 2  and Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde in the Hulk s creation   I combined Jekyll and Hyde with Frankenstein   he explains   and I got myself the monster I wanted  who was really good  but nobody knew it  He was also somebody who could change from a normal man into a monster  and lo  a legend was born   3  Lee remembers   I had always loved the old movie Frankenstein  And it seemed to me that the monster  played by Boris Karloff  wasn t really a bad guy  He was the good guy  He didn t want to hurt anybody  It s just those idiots with torches kept running up and down the mountains  chasing him and getting him angry  And I thought   Wouldn t it be fun to create a monster and make him the good guy   3  Lee also compared Hulk to the Golem of Jewish myth  2  In The Science of Superheroes  Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War 4  and the threat of nuclear attack  an interpretation shared by Weinstein in Up  Up and Oy Vey  2  This interpretation corresponds well when taken into account alongside other popularized fictional media created during this time period  which took advantage of the prevailing sense among Americans that nuclear power could produce monsters and mutants  5  Kaplan calls Hulk  schizophrenic   6  Jack Kirby has also commented upon his influences in drawing the character  recalling as inspiration the tale of a mother who rescues her child who is trapped beneath a car  7   edit  Debut and first series The Incredible Hulk  1  May 1962   Cover art by Jack Kirby and Paul Reinman  In the debut  Lee chose grey for the Hulk because he wanted a color that did not suggest any particular ethnic group  8  Colorist Stan Goldberg  however  had problems with the grey coloring  resulting in different shades of grey  and even green  in the issue  After seeing the first published issue  Lee chose to change the skin color to green  9  Green was used in retellings of the origin  with even reprints of the original story being recolored for the next two decades  until The Incredible Hulk vol  2   302  December 1984  reintroduced the grey Hulk in flashbacks set close to the origin story  Since then  reprints of the first issue have displayed the original grey coloring  with the fictional canon specifying that the Hulk s skin had initially been grey  The original series was canceled with issue  6  March 1963   Lee had written each story  with Kirby penciling the first five issues and Steve Ditko penciling and inking the sixth  The character immediately guest starred in The Fantastic Four  12  March 1963   and months later became a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers  appearing in the first two issues of the team s eponymous series  Sept   amp  Nov  1963   and returning as an antagonist in issues  3 and  5  Jan  May 1964   He then guest starred in Fantastic Four  25 26  April May 1964   which revealed Banner s full name as  Robert Bruce Banner   and The Amazing Spider Man  14  July 1964   Around this time  co creator Kirby received a letter from a college dormitory stating the Hulk had been chosen as its official mascot  2  Kirby and Lee realized their character had found an audience in college age readers   edit  Tales to Astonish Tales to Astonish  60  Oct  1964   Cover art by Jack Kirby and Sol Brodsky  A year and a half after the series was canceled  the Hulk became one of two features in Tales to Astonish  beginning in issue  60  Oct  1964   In the previous issue  he had appeared as an antagonist for Giant Man  whose feature under various superhero guises had run in the title since issue  35  This phase also introduced the concept of Banner s transformations being caused by extreme emotional stress  which would become central to the character s status as an iconic figure of runaway emotion  It was also during this time that the Hulk developed a more savage and child like personality  shifting from the brutish figure who spoke in complete sentences  This new Hulk feature was initially scripted by writer editor Lee and illustrated by the team of penciller Steve Ditko and inker George Roussos  Other artists later in this run included Jack Kirby from  68 84  June 1965   Oct  1966   doing full pencils or  more often  layouts for other artists  Gil Kane  credited as  Scott Edwards   in  76  Feb  1966   his first Marvel Comics work  Bill Everett inking Kirby in  78 84  April Oct  1966   and John Buscema  The Tales to Astonish run introduced the super villains the Leader  1  who would become the Hulk s archnemesis  and the Abomination  another gamma irradiated being  1  In issue  77  March 1966   Bruce Banner s and the Hulk s dual identity became publicly known  thus making Banner often a wanted fugitive from the authorities  Marie Severin finished out the Hulk s run in Tales to Astonish  Beginning with issue  102  April 1968  the book was retitled The Incredible Hulk vol  2  and ran until March 1999  when Marvel canceled the series and restarted the title with a new issue  1   edit  1970s The Incredible Hulk vol  2 was published through the 1970s  and the character also made guest appearances in other titles  Writers introduced Banner s cousin Jennifer Walters  the She Hulk  in a title of her own  In the first issue of the She Hulk comic  Banner gave some of his blood to Walters in a transfusion  She seemed fine at first  but when she later suffered stress it caused a transformation into the She Hulk  Unlike her cousin  she maintained her intellect and personality  although her inhibitions were noticeably lowered  She later appeared in the Hulk comic proper  as well as other Marvel titles  Banner s guilt about causing her change became another part of his character  although Jennifer grew to prefer her She Hulk state  Writers changed numerous times during the decade  At times  the creative staff included Archie Goodwin  Chris Claremont  and Tony Isabella  Len Wein handled many of the stories through the 1970s  working first with Herb Trimpe  then  in 1975  with Sal Buscema  who was the regular artist for ten years  Harlan Ellison plotted a story  scripted by Roy Thomas  for issue  140  June 1971    The Brute that Shouted Love at the Heart of the Atom   Issues  180 181  Oct  Nov  1974  introduced the character Wolverine  who would go on to become one of Marvel Comics  most popular  In 1977  Marvel  under its Curtis Magazines imprint  launched a second title  The Rampaging Hulk  a black and white comics magazine  1  Originally  the series was conceived as a flashback series  set between the end of his original  short lived solo title and the beginning of his feature in Tales to Astonish  10  After nine issues  the magazine was retitled The Hulk  and printed in full color  Near the end of the magazine s run  it went back to black and white  11  Back up features included Bloodstone  Man Thing  and Shanna the She Devil during the Rampaging Hulk issues  and later Moon Knight and Dominic Fortune  Ultimately  the stories from both incarnations of the magazine were quietly retconned as  movies  based upon the Hulk for alien audiences  citation needed   edit  1980s and 1990s Following Roger Stern  Bill Mantlo took over the writing with issue  245  March 1980   His  Crossroads of Eternity  stories  which ran through issues  300 313  Oct  1984   Nov  1985   explored the idea that Banner had suffered child abuse  Greg Pak  a later writer on The Incredible Hulk vol  2  called Mantlo s  Crossroads  stories one of his biggest influences on approaching the character  12  After five years  Mantlo and artist Mike Mignola left the title for Alpha Flight  13  and Alpha Flight writer John Byrne took over the series and left it after six issues  claiming   I took on the Hulk after a discussion with editor in chief Jim Shooter  in which I mentioned some of the things I would like to do with that character  given the chance  He told me to do whatever was necessary to get on the book  he liked my ideas so much  I did  and once installed he immediately changed his mind    You can t do this   Six issues was as much as I could take   14  Byrne was followed briefly by Al Milgrom  before new regular writer Peter David took over  David became the writer of the series with issue  331  May 1987   marking the start of a 12 year tenure  David s run altered Banner s pre Hulk characterization and the nature of the relationship between Banner and the Hulk  David returned to the Stern and Mantlo abuse storyline  expanding the damage caused  and depicting Banner as suffering dissociative identity disorder  DID   David s stories showed that Banner had serious mental problems long before he became the Hulk  David revamped the personality significantly  giving the gray Hulk the alias  Joe Fixit   and setting him up as a morally ambiguous Las Vegas enforcer and tough guy  David worked with numerous artists over his run on the series  including Dale Keown  Todd McFarlane  Sam Kieth  Gary Frank  Liam Sharp  Terry Dodson  Mike Deodato  George P rez  and Adam Kubert  1  In issue  377  Jan  1991   David revamped the Hulk again  using a storyline involving hypnosis to have the splintered personalities of Banner  Joe Fixit and the savage green Hulk synthesize into a new Hulk  who has the vast power of the Savage Hulk  the cunning of the gray Hulk  and the intelligence of Bruce Banner  In the 1993 Future Imperfect miniseries  writer David and penciller George P rez introduced readers to the Hulk of a dystopian future  Calling himself the Maestro  the Hulk rules over a world where most of the heroes have been killed  and only Rick Jones and a small band of rebels fight against the Maestro s rule  Although the Maestro seemed to be destroyed by the end  he returned in The Incredible Hulk vol  2   460  Jan  1998   also written by David  In 1998  David followed editor Bobbie Chase s suggestion to kill Betty Ross  In the introduction to the Hulk trade paperback Beauty and the Behemoth  David said that his wife had recently left him  providing inspiration for the storyline  Marvel executives used Ross  death as an opportunity to push the idea of bringing back the Savage Hulk  David disagreed  leading to his parting ways with Marvel  15  His last issue of Hulk was  467  Aug  1998   his 137th  Also in 1998  Marvel relaunched The Rampaging Hulk as a standard comic book rather than as a comics magazine   edit  Relaunch Following David s departure  Joe Casey took over as writer until the series  relaunch after issue  474  March 1999   Hulk vol  2 16  began immediately the following month  scripted by John Byrne and penciled by Ron Garney  Byrne supported the editorial decision to push for the return of the  savage  Hulk  but his work on the book was negatively received  citation needed  In particular  the 1999 Hulk Annual  which retconned the Skrulls as being responsible for the gamma bomb explosion that turned Banner into Hulk  were mocked in the pages of Peter David s Captain Marvel series  citation needed  published concurrently as Byrne s Hulk run  Erik Larsen and Jerry Ordway briefly took over scripting  and the title returned to The Incredible Hulk vol  3 17  with the arrival of Paul Jenkins in issue  12  March 2000   Jenkins wrote a story arc in which Banner and the three Hulks  Savage Hulk  grey Hulk  and the Merged Hulk  now considered a separate personality and referred to as the Professor  are able to mentally interact with one another  each personality taking over the shared body  During this  the four personalities  including Banner  confronted yet another submerged personality  a sadistic  Devil  intent on attacking the world for revenge  18  Bruce Jones followed as the series  writer  and his run features Banner using yoga to take control of the Hulk while he is pursued by a secret conspiracy and aided by the mysterious Mr  Blue  Jones appended his 43 issue Incredible Hulk run with the limited series Hulk Thing  Hard Knocks  1 4  Nov  2004   Feb  2005   which Marvel published after putting the ongoing series on hiatus  Peter David  who had initially signed a contract for the six issue Tempest Fugit limited series  returned as writer when it was decided to make the story  now only five parts  part of the ongoing series instead  19  David contracted to complete a year on the title  Tempest Fugit revealed that Nightmare has manipulated the Hulk for years  tormenting him in various ways for  inconveniences  that the Hulk had caused him  including the sadistic Hulk Jenkins had introduced  It also implied that some or all of the recent storylines by Bruce Jones may have been just illusion  20  After a four part tie in to the House of M crossover and a one issue epilogue  David left the series once more  citing the need to do non Hulk work for the sake of his career  21   edit  Planet Hulk and World War Hulk Main article  Planet Hulk Main article  World War Hulk In the 2006 crossover storyline Planet Hulk by writer Greg Pak  a secret group of superhero leaders  the Illuminati  consider the Hulk an unacceptable potential risk to Earth  and rocket him into space to live a peaceful existence on a planet uninhabited by intelligent life  After a trajectory malfunction  the Hulk crashes on the violent planet Sakaar  where he rises from a captured gladiator to rebel leader  then usurps Sakaar s throne  becoming the new emperor  This story was followed by World War Hulk  also written by Pak  and drawn by John Romita  Jr   in which the vessel used to send the Hulk to Sakaar explodes  killing millions  including the Hulk s pregnant queen  Caiera  and damages to the tectonic plates nearly destroying the planet  Enraged  the Hulk returns to Earth with Sakaar s citizens  and his allies  the Warbound  for

still written by Greg Pak but starring the mythological demigod Hercules and teenage genius Amadeus Cho  Marvel also launched a new volume of Hulk  written by Jeph Loeb and drawn by Ed McGuinness  The series featured the debut of a new Red Hulk  and Banner emerging from a coma and resuming his changes into the Green Hulk  After issue  12  The Incredible Hulk  600 was released  in which Red Hulk absorbs Hulk s radiation and claims Banner can never turn into the Hulk again  The series then continued with issue  13  with Banner questioning whether he should be glad that Hulk is gone or even if the Hulk is truly gone  The Incredible Hulk also continued with  601 onward  in which Banner seeks out his son Skaar  offering to train him to kill the Hulk in the eventuality of the Hulk s return  Under the aegis of megalomaniac Norman Osborn  Banner is re exposed to gamma radiation  re initiating the radiation in his body  thus allowing Banner to turn into the Hulk once more  Osborn explains he wants the Hulk to return  taking Banner out of the equation  and having him fight Skaar  hopefully killing each other  In a multi series crossover titled  Fall of the Hulks   beginning December 2009  Banner allies himself with the Red Hulk  revealed as a former agent of the supervillain group the Intelligencia  22  and  in fact  General Thunderbolt Ross  the one Banner had killed was a Life Model Decoy 23  In the concurrent  Hulked Out Heroes  arc  writer Jeff Parker has the Intelligencia irradiate several heroes  turning them into destructive Hulk versions of themselves until they are cured  In the now retitled The Incredible Hulks  612  Banner tries to rekindle his marriage with Betty Ross  who is now the Red She Hulk  Bruce and Betty resume their romantic relationship after defeating Fin Fang Foom  The last scene of the issue is of them in Hulk forms leaping off into the air  24   edit  Incredible Hulk vol  3 A new Incredible Hulk ongoing series began in October 2011  written by Jason Aaron and drawn by Marc Silvestri  At the start of this new series  Hulk and Bruce Banner have somehow become separate entities  Hulk has been living as a hunter for an underground tribe of Moloids while Banner has become a deranged scientist living on an island desperately trying to re trigger his transformations into the Hulk by doing experiments that are similar to the ones done in The Island of Doctor Moreau  Hulk is recruited by a group of agents led by Commander Amanda von Doom  who claims to be unrelated to Doctor Doom  to stop Bruce Banner   edit  Characterization  edit  Bruce Banner The core of the Hulk  Bruce Banner has been portrayed differently by different writers  but common themes persist  Banner  a genius  is sarcastic and seemingly very self assured when he first appears in Incredible Hulk  1  but is also emotionally withdrawn in most fashions  1  Banner designed the gamma bomb which caused his affliction  and the ironic twist of his self inflicted fate has been one of the most persistent common themes  2  Arie Kaplan describes the character thus   Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic  always wary that the monster inside him will erupt  and therefore he can t form meaningful bonds with anyone   6  Throughout the Hulk s published history  writers have continued to frame Bruce Banner in these themes  Under different writers  his fractured personality led to transformations into different versions of the Hulk  These transformations are usually involuntary  and often writers have tied the transformation to emotional triggers  such as rage and fear  As the series has progressed  different writers have adapted the Hulk  changing Hulk s personality to reflect changes in Banner s physiology or psyche  Writers have also refined and changed some aspects of Banner s personality  showing him as emotionally repressed  but capable of deep love for Betty Ross  and for solving problems posed to him  Under the writing of Paul Jenkins  Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive  applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him  On the occasions that Banner has controlled the Hulk s body  he has applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning  It was shown after his ability to turn into the Hulk was taken away by the Red Hulk that Banner has been extremely versatile as well as cunning when dealing with the many situations that followed   edit  The Hulk During the experimental detonation of a gamma bomb  scientist Bruce Banner rushes to save a teenager who has driven onto the testing field  Pushing the teen  Rick Jones  into a trench  Banner himself is caught in the blast  absorbing massive amounts of radiation  He awakens later in an infirmary  seeming relatively unscathed  but that night transforms into a lumbering grey form that breaks through the wall and escapes  A soldier in the ensuing search party dubs the otherwise unidentified creature a  hulk   25  The original version of the Hulk was often shown as simple and quick to anger  His first transformations were triggered by sundown  and his return to Banner by dawn  However  in Incredible Hulk  4  Banner started using a gamma ray device to transform at will  26  In more recent Hulk stories  emotions trigger the change  Although grey in his debut  difficulties for the printer led to a change in his color to green  In the original tale  the Hulk divorces his identity from Banner s  decrying Banner as  that puny weakling in the picture   25  From his earliest stories  the Hulk has been concerned with finding sanctuary and quiet  2  and often is shown reacting emotionally to situations quickly  Grest and Weinberg call Hulk the  dark  primordial side of  Banner s  psyche   4  Even in the earliest appearances  Hulk spoke in the third person  The Hulk retains a modest intelligence  thinking and talking in full sentences  and Lee even gives the Hulk expository dialogue in issue six  allowing readers to learn just what capabilities the Hulk has  when the Hulk says   But these muscles ain t just for show  All I gotta do is spring up and just keep goin    In Marvel  Five Fabulous Decades of the World s Greatest Comics  Les Daniels addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science  He quotes Jack Kirby thus   As long as we re experimenting with radioactivity  there s no telling what may happen  or how much our advancements may cost us   Daniels continues   The Hulk became Marvel s most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the atomic age   27  Though usually a loner  the Hulk helped to form both the Avengers 28  and the Defenders  29  He was able to determine that the changes were now triggered by emotional stress  30  The Fantastic Four  12  March 1963   featured the Hulk s first battle with the Thing  Although many early Hulk stories involve General Thaddeus  Thunderbolt  Ross trying to capture or destroy the Hulk  the main villain is often  like Hulk  a radiation based character  like the Gargoyle or the Leader  along with other foes such as the Toad Men  or Asian warlord General Fang  Ross  daughter  Betty  loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk  General Ross  right hand man  Major Glenn Talbot  also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing the Hulk and trying to gain Betty s love more honorably  Rick Jones serves as the Hulk s friend and sidekick in these early tales  In the 1970s  Hulk was shown as more prone to anger and rage  and less talkative  Writers played with the nature of his transformations  31  briefly giving Banner control over the change  and the ability to maintain control of his Hulk form  Hulk stories began to involve other dimensions  and in one  Hulk met the empress Jarella  Jarella used magic to bring Banner s intelligence to Hulk  and came to love him  asking him to become her mate  Though Hulk returned to Earth before he could become her king  he would return to Jarella s kingdom of K ai again  When Bill Mantlo took on writing duties  he led the character into the arena of political commentary when Hulk traveled to Tel Aviv  Israel  encountering both the violence of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  and the Jewish Israeli heroine Sabra  Soon after  Hulk encountered the Arabian Knight  a Bedouin superhero  2  Under Mantlo s writing  a mindless Hulk was sent to the  Crossroads of Eternity   where Banner was revealed to have suffered childhood traumas which engendered Bruce s repressed rage  32  Having come to terms with his issues  at least for a time  Hulk and Banner physically separated under John Byrne s writing  Separated from the Hulk by Doc Samson  33  Banner was recruited by the U S  government to create the Hulkbusters  a government team dedicated to catching Hulk  Banner and Ross married  34  but Byrne s change in the character was reversed by Al Milgrom  who reunited the two personas  35  and with issue  324  returned the Hulk to his grey coloration  with the changes occurring at night  regardless of Banner s emotional state  The Hulk appeared to perish in a gamma bomb explosion  but was instead sent to Jarella s home dimension of K ai  Shortly after returning to Earth  Hulk took on the identity of  Joe Fixit   a shadowy behind the scenes figure  working in Las Vegas on behalf of a casino owner  Michael Berengetti  36  For months  Banner was repressed in Hulk s mind  but slowly began to reappear  Hulk and Banner began to change back and forth again at dusk and dawn  as the character initially had  but this time  they worked together to advance both their goals  using written notes as communication as well as meeting on a mental plane to have conversations  In The Incredible Hulk  333  the Leader describes the grey Hulk persona as strongest during the night of the new moon and weakest during the full moon  Eventually  the Green Hulk began to reemerge  37  In issue  377  David revamped the Hulk again  Doctor Leonard Samson engages the Ringmaster s services to hypnotize Bruce Banner and force him  the Savage Hulk  Green Hulk  and Mr  Fixit  Grey Hulk  to confront Banner s past abuse at the hands of his father Brian Banner  During the session  the three identities confront a  Guilt Hulk   which sadistically torments the three with the abuse of Banner s father  Facing down this abuse  a new larger and smarter Hulk emerges and completely replaces the  human  Bruce Banner and Hulk personae  This Hulk is a culmination of the three aspects of Banner  He has the vast power of the Savage Hulk  the cunning of the grey Hulk  and the intelligence of Bruce Banner  Hulk  Future Imperfect  2  Jan  1993  depicting the Maestro  Cover art by George P rez  Peter David then introduces the Hulk to the Pantheon  a secretive organization built around an extended family of superpowered people  38  The family members  mostly distant cousins to each other  had codenames based in the mythos of the Trojan War  and were descendants of the founder of the group  Agamemnon  When Agamemnon leaves  he puts the Hulk in charge of the organization  The storyline ends when it is revealed Agamemnon has traded his offspring to an alien race to gain power  The Hulk leads the Pantheon against the aliens  and then moves on  During his leadership of the Pantheon  Hulk encounters a depraved version of himself from the future called Maestro  who Delphi saw in a vision back in The Incredible Hulk vol  2   401 with part of the events occurring concurrently in The Incredible Hulk vol  2   415  Thrown into the future  Hulk finds himself allied with Rick Jones  now an old man  in an effort to destroy the tyrant Maestro  Unable to stop him in any other manner  Hulk uses the time machine that brought him to the future to send the Maestro back into the heart of the very Gamma Bomb test that spawned the Hulk  Artistically  the character has been depicted as progressively more muscular in the years since his debut  39   edit  Powers  appearance  and abilities The Hulk possesses the potential for limitless physical strength depending directly on his emotional state  particularly his anger  40  This has been reflected in the repeated comment   The madder Hulk gets  the stronger Hulk gets   After probing  the entity Beyonder once claimed that the Hulk s potential strength had  no finite element inside   41  His durability  regeneration  and endurance also increase in proportion to his temper  42  Greg Pak described the Hulk shown during World War Hulk as having a level of physical power where  Hulk was stronger than any mortal and most immortals who ever walked the Earth   43  The Hulk s level of strength is normally limited by Banner s subconscious influence  When Hulk allowed Jean Grey to psionically  shut Banner off   he reached a scale of power on which he managed to overpower and destroy the physical form of the villain Onslaught  44  The Hulk is resistant to most forms of injury or damage  The extent varies between interpretations  but he has withstood the equivalent of solar temperatures  45  nuclear explosions  46  and planet shattering impacts  47  Despite his remarkable resiliency  continuous barrages of high caliber gunfire can hinder his movement to some degree  and this has been consistently portrayed outside the comic books  in both live action films and animation  He has been shown to have both regenerative and adaptive healing abilities  including growing tissues to allow him to breathe underwater  48  surviving unprotected in space for extended periods  49  50  and when injured  healing from most wounds within seconds  51  As an effect  he has an extremely prolonged lifespan  52  The Hulk s powerful legs allow him to leap into lower Earth orbit or across continents  53  and he has displayed sufficient superhuman speed to match Thor  54  and Sentry  55  He also possesses less commonly described powers  including abilities allowing him to  home in  to his place of origin in New Mexico  56  resist psychic control  57  or unwilling transformation  58  grow stronger from radiation 59  or dark magic  60  and to see and interact with astral forms  61  In the early days of the first Hulk comic series   massive  doses of gamma rays  such as from the explosion of a hand held nuclear grenade  would cause the Hulk to transform back to Bruce Banner  although this ability was written out of the character by the 1970s  As Bruce Banner  he is considered one of the greatest minds on Earth  He has developed expertise in the fields of biology  chemistry  engineering  and physiology  and holds a Ph D  in nuclear physics  He possesses  a mind so brilliant it cannot be measured on any known intelligence test   62  Bruce Banner also makes use of his intelligence to create highly advanced technology labelled as  Bannertech   which is on par with technological development from Tony Stark or Doctor Doom  The most common Bannertech Bruce uses is a force field able to shrug off blows from Hulk level entities  along with a teleporter  which can be used to transport an unknown number of people  Bannertech is also used by Amadeus Cho  as well as the Hulk persona itself  In The Science of Superheroes  Lois Grest and Robert Weinberg examined Hulk s powers  explaining the scientific flaws in them  Most notably  they point out that the level of gamma radiation Banner is exposed to at the initial blast would induce radiation sickness and kill him  or if not  create significant cancer risks for Banner  because hard radiation strips cells of their ability to function  They go on to offer up an alternate origin  in which a Hulk might be created by biological experimentation with adrenal glands and GFP  Charles Q  Choi from LiveScience com further explains that unlike the Hulk  gamma rays are not green  existing as they do beyond the visible spectrum  gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe  He also explains that gamma rays are so powerful  the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation and 10 000 times more powerful than visible light  that they can even convert energy into matter   a possible explanation for the increased mass that Bruce Banner takes on during transformations   Just as the Incredible Hulk  is the strongest one there is   as he says himself  so too are gamma ray bursts the most powerful explosions known   63   edit  Critical reception In 2008  Wizard magazine named the Hulk as the 7th Greatest Marvel Comics Character  64 Empire Magazine named him as the 14th Greatest Comic Book Character and the Fifth Greatest Marvel Character  65   edit  Related characters Main

Hulk in 2010 comics  He has two sons with his deceased second wife Caiera Oldstrong on the planet Sakaar named Skaar and Hiro Kala and a daughter named Lyra with Thundra the warrior woman  66  Since childhood  Banner has been close to his cousin  Jennifer Walters  who in their adulthoods became the She Hulk  67   edit  Other versions Main article  Alternative versions of the Hulk In addition to his mainstream incarnation  Hulk has also been depicted in other fictional universes  in which Bruce Banner s transformation  behavior  or circumstances vary from the mainstream setting  In some stories  someone other than Bruce Banner is the Hulk   edit  In other media Main article  Hulk in other media The Hulk character and the concepts behind it have been raised to the level of iconic status by many within and outside the comic book industry  In 2003  Official U S  PlayStation Magazine claimed the character had  stood the test of time as a genuine icon of American pop culture   68  The Hulk is often viewed as a reaction to war  As well as being a reaction to the Cold War  the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the Vietnam War raised  and Ang Lee said that the Iraq War influenced his direction  4  69  70  In the Michael Nyman edited edition of The Guardian  Stefanie Diekmann explored Marvel Comics  reaction to the September 11 attacks  Diekmann discussed The Hulk s appearance in the comic book Heroes  claiming that his greater prominence  alongside Captain America  aided in  stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well known and well respected protagonist   71  In Comic Book Nation  Wright alludes to Hulk s counterculture status  referring to a 1965 Esquire magazine poll amongst college students which  revealed that student radicals ranked Spider Man and the Hulk alongside the likes of Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons   Wright goes on to cite examples of his anti authority symbol status  Two of these are  The Ballad of the Hulk  by Jerry Jeff Walker  and the Rolling Stone cover for September 30  1971  a full color Herb Trimpe piece commissioned for the magazine  31  72  The Hulk has been caricatured in such animated television series as The Simpsons 73 Robot Chicken  and Family Guy  74  and such comedy TV series as The Young Ones  75  The character is also used as a cultural reference point for someone displaying anger or agitation  For example  in a 2008 Daily Mirror review of an EastEnders episode  a character is described as going  into Incredible Hulk mode  smashing up his flat   76  The Hulk  especially his alter ego Bruce Banner  is also a common reference in rap music  The term was represented as an analogue to marijuana in Dr  Dre s 2001  77  while more conventional references are made in Ludacris and Jermaine Dupri s popular single  Welcome to Atlanta   78  The 2003 Ang Lee directed Hulk film saw discussion of the character s appeal to Asian Americans  79  The Taiwanese born Ang Lee commented on the  subcurrent of repression  that underscored the character of The Hulk  and how that mirrored his own experience   Growing up  my artistic leanings were always repressed there was always pressure to do something  useful   like being a doctor   Jeff Yang  writing for the SF Gate  extended this self identification to Asian American culture  arguing that  the passive aggressive streak runs deep among Asian Americans especially those who have entered creative careers  often against their parents  wishes   80   edit  Television Live action 1977  82   88  90  The Incredible Hulk  Lou Ferrigno as Hulk  Bill Bixby as David Bruce Banner Animated 1966  Hulk  part of The Marvel
