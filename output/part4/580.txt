typically considered the first Democratic President of the United States  The  Kicking Donkey  party logo is still a well known symbol for the Democratic Party  despite no longer being the official logo of the party  Main article  History of the Democratic Party  United States  The Democratic Party evolved from Anti Federalist factions that opposed the fiscal policies of Alexander Hamilton in the early 1790s  Thomas Jefferson and James Madison organized these factions into the Democratic Republican Party  The party favored states  rights and strict adherence to the Constitution  it opposed a national bank and wealthy  moneyed interests  The Democratic Republican Party ascended to power in the election of 1800  After the War of 1812  the party s chief rival  the Federalist Party disbanded  Democratic Republicans split over the choice of a successor to President James Monroe  and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles  led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren  became the Democratic Party  Along with the Whig Party  the Democratic Party was the chief party in the United States until the Civil War  The Whigs were a commercial party  and usually less popular  if better financed  The Whigs divided over the slavery issue after the Mexican American War and faded away  In the 1850s  under the stress of the Fugitive Slave Law and the Kansas Nebraska Act  anti slavery Democrats left the party  Joining with former members of existing or dwindling parties  the Republican Party emerged  5  6  The Democrats split over the choice of a successor to President James Buchanan along Northern and Southern lines  while the Republican Party gained ascendancy in the election of 1860  As the American Civil War broke out  Northern Democrats were divided into War Democrats and Peace Democrats  The Confederate States of America  seeing parties as evils  did not have any  Most War Democrats rallied to Republican President Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans  National Union Party in 1864  which put Andrew Johnson on the ticket as a Democrat from the South  Johnson replaced Lincoln in 1865 but stayed independent of both parties   The Democrats benefited from white Southerners  resentment of Reconstruction after the war and consequent hostility to the Republican Party  After Redeemers ended Reconstruction in the 1870s  and the extremely violent disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in the 1890s  the South  voting Democratic  became known as the  Solid South   Though Republicans won all but two presidential elections  the Democrats remained competitive  The party was dominated by pro business Bourbon Democrats led by Samuel J  Tilden and Grover Cleveland  who represented mercantile  banking  and railroad interests  opposed imperialism and overseas expansion  fought for the gold standard  opposed bimetallism  and crusaded against corruption  high taxes  and tariffs  Cleveland was elected to non consecutive presidential terms in 1884 and 1892  7  Agrarian Democrats demanding Free Silver overthrew the Bourbon Democrats in 1896 and nominated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency  a nomination repeated by Democrats in 1900 and 1908   Bryan waged a vigorous campaign attacking Eastern moneyed interests  but he lost to Republican William McKinley  The Democrats took control of the House in 1910 and elected Woodrow Wilson as president in 1912 and 1916  Wilson effectively led Congress to put to rest the issues of tariffs  money  and antitrust that had dominated politics for 40 years with new progressive laws  The Great Depression in 1929 that occurred under Republican President Herbert Hoover and the Republican Congress set the stage for a more liberal government  the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives nearly uninterrupted from 1931 until 1995 and won most presidential elections until 1968  Franklin D  Roosevelt  elected to the presidency in 1932  came forth with government programs called the New Deal  New Deal liberalism meant the promotion of social welfare  labor unions  civil rights  and regulation of business  The opponents  who stressed long term growth  support for business  and low taxes  started calling themselves  conservatives   8  Issues facing parties and the United States after World War II included the Cold War and the Civil Rights Movement  Republicans attracted conservatives and white Southerners from the Democratic coalition with their resistance to New Deal and Great Society liberalism and the Republicans  use of the Southern strategy  African Americans  who traditionally supported the Republican Party  began supporting Democrats following the ascent of the Franklin Roosevelt administration  the New Deal  and the Civil Rights movement  The Democratic Party s main base of support shifted to the Northeast  marking a dramatic reversal of history  Bill Clinton was elected to the presidency in 1992  governing as a New Democrat  The Democratic Party lost control of Congress in the election of 1994 to the Republican Party  Re elected in 1996  Clinton was the first Democratic President since Franklin Roosevelt to be elected to two terms  Following twelve years of Republican rule  the Democratic Party regained majority control of both the House and the Senate in the 2006 elections  Some of the party s key issues in the early 21st century in their last national platform have included the methods of how to combat terrorism  homeland security  expanding access to health care  labor rights  environmentalism  and the preservation of liberal government programs  9  In the 2010 elections  the Democratic Party lost control of the House  but kept a small majority in the Senate  reduced from the 111th Congress   It also lost its majority in state legislatures and state governorships  The Democratic Party traces its origins to the inspiration of Democratic Republican Party  founded by Thomas Jefferson  James Madison  and other influential opponents of the Federalists in 1792  That party also inspired the Whigs and modern Republicans  Organizationally  the modern Democratic Party truly arose in the 1830s  with the election of Andrew Jackson  Since the division of the Republican Party in the election of 1912  it has gradually positioned itself to the left of the Republican Party on economic and social issues  Until the period following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964   which was championed by a Democratic president but faced lower Democratic than Republican support in Congress   the Democratic Party was primarily a coalition of two parties divided by region  Southern Democrats were typically given high conservative ratings by the American Conservative Union while northern Democrats were typically given very liberal ratings  Southern Democrats were a core bloc of the bipartisan conservative coalition which lasted through the Reagan era  The economically activist philosophy of Franklin D  Roosevelt  which has strongly influenced American liberalism  has shaped much of the party s economic agenda since 1932  and served to tie the two regional factions of the party together until the late 1960s  In fact  Roosevelt s New Deal coalition usually controlled the national government until the 1970s  10  As of 2010 update   Gallup polling found that 31  of Americans identified as Democrats  29  as Republicans  and 38  as independents  11  A Pew Research Center survey of registered voters released August 2010 stated that 47  identified as Democrats or leaned towards the party  in comparison to 43  of Republicans  12  Current structure and composition The Democratic National Committee  DNC  is responsible for promoting Democratic campaign activities  While the DNC is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the Democratic Platform  the DNC is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy  In presidential elections  it supervises the Democratic National Convention  The national convention is  subject to the charter of the party  the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when it is in session  with the DNC running the party s organization at other times  The DNC is currently chaired by Florida congresswomen Debbie Wasserman Schultz   13  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  DCCC  assists party candidates in House races  its current chairman  selected by the party caucus  is Rep  Steve Israel of New York  Similarly  the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee  DSCC   currently headed by Senator Patty Murray of Washington  raises large sums for Senate races  The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee  DLCC   currently chaired by Mike Gronstal of Iowa  is a smaller organization with much less funding that focuses on state legislative races  The DNC sponsors the College Democrats of America  CDA   a student outreach organization with the goal of training and engaging a new generation of Democratic activists  Democrats Abroad is the organization for Americans living outside the United States  they work to advance the goals of the party and encourage Americans living abroad to support the Democrats  The Young Democrats of America  YDA  is a youth led organization that attempts to draw in and mobilize young people for Democratic candidates  but operates outside of the DNC  In addition  the recently created branch of the Young Democrats  the Young Democrats High School Caucus  attempts to raise awareness and activism amongst teenagers to not only vote and volunteer  but participate in the future as well  The Democratic Governors Association  DGA   chaired by Governor Martin O Malley of Maryland  is an organization supporting the candidacies of Democratic gubernatorial nominees and incumbents  Likewise  the mayors of the largest cities and urban centers convene as the National Conference of Democratic Mayors  Each state also has a state committee  made up of elected committee members as well as ex officio committee members  usually elected officials and representatives of major constituencies   which in turn elects a chair  County  town  city  and ward committees generally are composed of individuals elected at the local level  State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction  oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses  and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law  Rarely do they have much funding  but in 2005  DNC Chairman Dean began a program  called the  50 State Strategy   of using DNC national funds to assist all state parties and paying for full time professional staffers  14  Ideology Further information  Political ideologies in the United States and Factions in the Democratic Party  United States  Since the 1890s  the Democratic Party has favored liberal positions  the term  liberal  in this sense describes social liberalism  not classical liberalism   In recent exit polls  the Democratic Party has had broad appeal across all socio ethno economic demographics  15  16  17  Historically  the party has favored farmers  laborers  labor unions  and religious and ethnic minorities  it has opposed unregulated business and finance  and favored progressive income taxes  In foreign policy  internationalism  including interventionism  was a dominant theme from 1913 to the mid 1960s  In the 1930s  the party began advocating welfare spending programs targeted at the poor  The party had a fiscally conservative  pro business wing  typified by Grover Cleveland and Al Smith  and a Southern conservative wing that shrank after President Lyndon B  Johnson supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964  The major influences for liberalism were labor unions  which peaked in the 1936 1952 era   and the African American wing  which has steadily grown since the 1960s  Since the 1970s  environmentalism has been a major new component  In recent decades  the party has adopted a centrist economic and socially progressive agenda  with the voter base having shifted considerably  Today  Democrats advocate more social freedoms  affirmative action  balanced budget  and a free enterprise system tempered by government intervention  mixed economy   The economic policy adopted by the modern Democratic Party  including the former Clinton administration  has been referred to as the  Third Way   18  The party believes that government should play a role in alleviating poverty and social injustice and use a system of progressive taxation  The Democratic Party  once dominant in the Southeastern United States  is now strongest in the Northeast  Mid Atlantic and New England   Great Lakes region  and the Pacific Coast  including Hawaii   The Democrats are also very strong in major cities  Liberals Main articles  Modern liberalism in the United States and Liberalism in the United States Franklin D  Roosevelt was considered a liberal Democratic President  Opinions of liberals in a 2005 Pew Research Center study  Social liberals  modern liberals  and progressives constitute roughly half of the Democratic voter base  Liberals thereby form the largest united typological demographic within the Democratic base  According to the 2008 exit poll results  liberals constituted 22  of the electorate  and 89  of American liberals favored the candidate of the Democratic Party  19 White collar college educated professionals were mostly Republican until the 1950s  they now compose perhaps the most vital component of the Democratic Party  20  A large majority of liberals favor universal health care  with many supporting a single payer system  A majority also favor diplomacy over military action  stem cell research  the legalization of same sex marriage  secular government  stricter gun control  and environmental protection laws as well as the preservation of abortion rights  Immigration and cultural diversity is deemed positive  liberals favor cultural pluralism  a system in which immigrants retain their native culture in addition to adopting their new culture  They tend to be divided on free trade agreements and organizations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   Most liberals oppose increased military spending and the display of the Ten Commandments in public buildings  21  This ideological group differs from the traditional organized labor base  According to the Pew Research Center  a plurality of 41  resided in mass affluent households and 49  were college graduates  the highest figure of any typographical group  It was also the fastest growing typological group between the late 1990s and early 2000s  21  Liberals include most of academia 22  and large portions of the professional class  15  16  17  Progressives Main articles  Progressivism in the United States and Progressive Democrats of America Many progressive Democrats are descendants of the New Left of Democratic presidential candidate Senator George McGovern of South Dakota  others were involved in the presidential candidacies of Vermont Governor Howard Dean and U S  Representative Dennis Kucinich of Ohio  The Congressional Progressive Caucus  CPC  is a caucus of progressive Democrats  and is the single largest Democratic caucus in the House of Representatives  Its members have included Dennis Kucinich of Ohio  John Conyers of Michigan  Jim McDermott of Washington  John Lewis of Georgia  Barbara Lee of California  the late Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota  and Sherrod Brown of Ohio  now a Senator  America Votes and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights are liberal umbrella organizations that push for progressive causes  Libertarians and civil libertarians See also  Libertarian Democrat Some libertarians also support the Democratic Party because Democratic positions on such issues as civil rights and separation of church and state are more closely aligned to their own than the positions of the Republican Party  They oppose gun control  the  War on Drugs   protectionism  corporate welfare  government debt  and an interventionist foreign policy  The Democratic Freedom Caucus is an organized group of this faction  Some civil libertarians also support the party because of their support of habeas corpus for unlawful combatants  opposition to torture of suspected terrorists  extraordinary rendition  warrantless wiretapping  indefinite detention without trial or charge  the Patriot Act  the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and what they see as the erosion of the protections of the Bill of Rights  Conservatives See also  Southern Democrats and Conservative Democrats The Pew Research Center has stated that conservative Democrats represent 15  of registered voters and 14  of the general electorate  21  In the House of Representatives  the Blue Dog Coalition  a caucus of fiscal and social conservatives and moderates forms part of the Democratic Party s current faction of conservative Democrats  They have acted as a unified voting bloc in the past  giving its forty plus members some ability to change legislation and broker compromises with the Republican Party s leadership  Historically  southern Democrats were generally much more ideologically conservative  In 1972  the last year that a sizable number of conservatives dominated the southern wing of the Democratic Party  the American Conservative Union gave higher ratings to most southern Democratic Senators and Congressmen than it did to Republicans  Centrists Though centrist Democrats differ on a variety of issues  they typically foster a mix of political views and ideas  Compared to other Democratic factions  they tend to be supportive of the use of military force  including the war in Iraq  and are more willing to reduce government welfare  as indicated by their support for welfare reform and tax cuts  One of the most influential factions is the Democratic Leadership Council  DLC   a nonprofit organization that advocates centrist positions for the party  The DLC hails President Bill Clinton as proof of the viability of  Third Way  politicians and a DLC success story  Former Representative Harold Ford  Jr  of Tennessee is its current chairman  Centrist Democrats form the New Democrat Coalition in the House of Representatives and Senate  Voter base Self identified Democrats versus self identified Republicans  January June 2010 data   Professionals Professionals  those who have a college education and whose work revolves around the conceptualization of ideas  have supported the Democratic Party by a slight majority since 2000  Between 1988 and 2000  professionals favored Democrats by a 12 percentage point margin  While the professional class was once a stronghold of the Republican Party  it has become increasingly split between the two parties  leaning in favor of the Democratic Party  The increasing support for Democratic candidates among professionals may be traced to the prevalence of social liberal values among this group  23    Professionals  who are  roughly speaking  college educated producers of services and ideas  used to be the most staunchly Republican of all occupational groups    now chiefly working for large corporations and bureaucracies rather than on their own  and heavily influenced by the environmental  civil rights  and feminist movements   began to vote Democratic  In the four elections from 1988 to 2000  they backed Democrats by an average of 52 percent to 40 percent    A study on the political attitudes of medical students  for example  found that  U S  medical students are considerably more likely to be liberal than conservative and are more likely to be liberal than are other young U S  adults  Future U S  physicians may be more receptive to liberal messages than conservative ones  and their political orientation may profoundly affect their health system attitudes   24  Similar results are found for professors  who are more strongly inclined towards liberalism and the Democratic Party than other occupational groups  22  The Democratic Party also has strong support among scientists  with 55  identifying as Democrats  32  as Independents  and 6  as Republicans and 52  identifying as liberal  35  as moderate  and 9  as conservative  25  Academia See also  Higher education in the United States Academics  intellectuals  and the highly educated overall constitute an important part of the Democratic voter base  Academia in particular tends to be progressive  In a 2005 survey  nearly 72  of full time faculty members identified as liberal  while 15  identified as conservative  The social sciences and humanities were the most liberal disciplines while business was the most conservative  Male professors at more advanced stages of their careers as well as those at elite institutions tend be the most liberal  22  Another survey by UCLA conducted in 2001 02  found 47 6  of scholars identifying as liberal  34 3  as moderate  and 18  as conservative  26  Percentages of professors who identified as liberal ranged from 49  in business to over 80  in political science and the humanities  22  Social scientists  such as Brett O Bannon of DePauw University  have claimed that the  liberal  opinions of professors seem to have little  if any  effect on the political orientation of students  27  28  Whether or not that is true  some conservatives and Republicans complain they are offended and even threatened by the liberal atmosphere of college campuses  who   As of July 2008 the Students for Academic Freedom arm of the David Horowitz Freedom Center  a conservative organization  posted a list of 440 student complaints  most of which pertain to perceived liberal bias of college professors  Those with graduate education  have become increasingly Democratic beginning in the 1992  29  1996  29  2000  15  2004  16  and 2008 30  elections  Intellectualism  the tendency to constantly reexamine issues  or in the words of Edwards Shields  the  penetration beyond the screen of immediate concrete experience   has also been named as an explanation why academia is strongly democratic and liberal  31  32  Although Democrats are well represented at the postgraduate level  self identified Republicans are more likely to have attained a 4 year college degree  The trends for the years 1955 through 2004 are shown by gender in the graphs above  reproduced with permission from Democrats and Republicans   Rhetoric and Reality  a book published in 2008 by Joseph Fried  These results are based on surveys conducted by the National Election Studies  supported by the National Science Foundation  33  Youth Studies have shown that younger voters tend to vote mostly for Democratic candidates in recent years  Despite supporting Ronald Reagan and George H  W  Bush  the young have voted in favor of the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since Bill Clinton in 1992  and are more likely to identify as liberals than the general population  34  In the 2004 presidential election  Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry received 54  of the vote from voters of the age group 18 29  while Republican George W  Bush received 45  of the vote from the same age group  In the 2006 midterm elections  the Democrats received 60  of the vote from the same age group  16  17  Polls suggest that younger voters tend to be more liberal than the general population and have more liberal views than the public on same sex marriage and universal healthcare  helping Barack Obama carry 66  of their votes in 2008  The Young Democrats of America are an affiliated organization of members of the party younger than 36 that advocates for youth issues and works for youth voter turnout  Labor Since the 1930s  a critical component of the Democratic Party coalition has been organized labor  Labor unions supply a great deal of the money  grass roots political organization  and voting base of support for the party  Democrats are far more likely to be represented by unions  although union membership has declined  in general  during the last few decades  This trend is depicted in the following graph from the book  Democrats and Republicans   Rhetoric and Reality  35  It is based on surveys conducted by the National Election Studies  NES   The historic decline in union membership over the past half century has been accompanied by a growing disparity between public sector and private sector union membership percentages  The three most significant labor groupings in the Democratic coalition today are the AFL CIO and Change to Win labor federations  as well as the National Education Association  a large  unaffiliated teachers  union  Both the AFL CIO and Change to Win have identified their top legislative priority for 2007 as passage of the Employee Free Choice Act  Other important issues for labor unions include supporting industrial policy  including protectionism  that sustains unionized manufacturing jobs  raising the minimum wage and promoting broad social programs such as Social Security and universal health care  Working class Further information  Social class in the United States American social classes While the American working class has lost much of its political strength with the decline of labor unions  36  it remains a stronghold of the Democratic Party and continues as an essential part of the Democratic base  Today  roughly a third of the American public is estimated to be working class with around 52  being either members of the working or lower classes  37  38  Yet  as those with lower socioeconomic status are less likely to vote  the working and lower classes are underrepresented in the electorate  The working class is largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work  It consists mainly of clerical and blue collar workers  37  Even though most in the working class are able to afford an adequate standard of living  high economic insecurity and possible personal benefit from an extended social safety net  make the majority of working class person left of center on economic issues  Most working class Democrats differ from most liberals  however  in their more socially conservative views  Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority  Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics  In 2005  only 15  had a college degree  compared to 27  at the national average and 49  of liberals  respectively  Together socially conservative and the financially disadvantaged comprised roughly 54  of the Democratic base  21  The continued importance of the working class votes manifests itself in recent CNN exit polls  which shows that the majority of those with low incomes and little education vote for the Democratic Party  15  16  17  Women Although the  gender gap  has varied over many years  women of all ages are more likely than men to identify as Democrats  Recent polls have indicated that 41  of women identify as Democrats while only 25  of women identify as Republicans and 26  as independents  while 32  of men identify as Democrats  28  as Republicans and 34  as independents  Among ethnic minorities  women also are more likely than males to identify as Democrats  Also  American women that identified as single  living with a domestic partner  divorced  separated  or widowed are more likely than men in these categories to vote Democratic  in contrast to married Americans  which split about equally between Democrat and Republican  Again  women in these categories are significantly more likely than males in these categories to vote Democratic  39  The National Federation of Democratic Women is an affiliated organization meant to advocate for women s issues  National women s organizations that often support Democratic candidates are Emily s List and the National Organization for Women  Relation to marital status and parenthood Americans that identify as single  living with a domestic partner  divorced  separated  or widowed are more likely to vote Democratic  in contrast to married Americans  which split about equally between Democrat and Republican  39  GSS surveys of more than 11 000 Democrats and Republicans conducted between 1996 and 2006 came to the result that the differences in fertility rates are not statistically significant between these parties  with the average Democrat having 1 94 children and the average Republican having 1 91 children   40  However  there is a significant difference in fertility rates between the two related groups liberals and conservatives  with liberals reproducing at much lower rate than conservatives  40  LGBT Americans Lesbian  gay  bisexual  and transgender Americans typically vote Democratic in national elections within the 70 77  range  according to national media exit polling  In heavily gay precincts in large cities across the nation  the average was higher  ranging from 85 94   This trend has continued since 1996 when Bill Clinton won 71  of the LGBT vote compared to Bob Dole s 16  and 13  for others  In 2000 Al Gore won 70  to George W  Bush s 25  with 5  for others  in 2004 John Kerry won 77  to George W  Bush s 23  and in 2008 Barack Obama won 70  to John McCain s 27  with 3  to others  Patrick Egan  a professor of politics at New York University specializing in LGBT voting patterns  calls this a  remarkable continuity   Saying  about three fourths vote Democratic and one fourth Republican from year to year   41  Notable LGBT Democrats include current Representatives Barney Frank of Massachusetts  Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin  Jared Polis of Colorado and David Cicilline of Rhode Island  The late activist and San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk was a Democrat  The National Stonewall Democrats is an LGBT advocacy group associated with the Democratic Party  The LGBT Equality Caucus is a congressional caucus of 76 Democrats and 1 Republican that work and advocate for LGBT rights within the House of Representatives  African Americans From the end of the Civil War  African Americans primarily favored the Republican Party due to its overwhelming political and more tangible efforts in achieving abolition  particularly through President Lincoln s Emancipation Proclamation  42  The south had long been a Democratic stronghold  favoring a state s right to legal slavery  In addition  the ranks of the fledgling Ku Klux Klan were composed almost entirely of white Democrats angry over poor treatment by northerners and bent on reversing the policies of Reconstruction  43  However  as years passed and memories waned  African Americans began drifting to the Democratic Party  as Franklin Roosevelt s New Deal programs gave economic relief to all minorities  including African Americans and Hispanics  42  Support for the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s by Democratic presidents John F  Kennedy and Lyndon B  Johnson helped give the Democrats even larger support among the African American community  which consistently vote between 85 95  Democratic  42  Prominent modern day African American Democratic politicians include Jim Clyburn  Ed Towns  Maxine Waters  John Lewis  Deval Patrick  Charles Rangel  John Conyers  and the current President of the United States  Barack Obama  who managed to net over 95  of the African American vote in the 2008 election  44  Despite being unaffiliated  the NAACP often participates in organizing and voter turnout drives and advocates for progressive causes  especially those that affect people of color  45  Within the House of Representatives  the Congressional Black Caucus  consisting of 44 black Democrats  serves to represent the interests of African Americans and advocate on issues that affect them  Hispanic and Latino Americans The Hispanic population  particularly the large Mexican American population in the Southwest and the large Puerto Rican and Dominican populations in the Northeast  have been strong supporters of the Democratic Party  They commonly favor liberal views on immigration  citation needed  In the 1996 presidential election  Democratic President Bill Clinton received 72  of the Hispanic vote  46  Since then  however  the Republican Party has gained increasing support from the Hispanic community  especially among Hispanic Protestants and Pentecostals  Along with Bush s much more liberal views on immigration  President Bush was the first Republican president to gain 40  of the Hispanic vote  he did so in the 2004 presidential election   Yet  the Republican Party s support among Hispanics eroded in the 2006 midterm elections  dropping from 44 to 30 percent  with the Democrats gaining in the Hispanic vote from 55  in 2004 to 69  in 2006  16  17  Democrats increased their share of the Hispanic vote in the 2008 presidential election  with Barack Obama receiving 67   Cuban Americans still heavily vote Republican  though there has been a noticeable change since the 2008 elections  During the 2008 elections Barack Obama received 47  of the Cuban American vote in Florida  47  According to Bendixen s exit polls  84  of Miami Dade Cuban American voters 65 or older backed McCain  while 55  of those 29 or younger backed Obama  48  Showing that the younger Cuban American generation have shifted to becoming more liberal  Unaffiliated Hispanic advocacy groups that often support progressive candidates and causes include the National Council of La Raza and the League of United Latin American Citizens  In the House of Representatives  the Democratic caucus of Hispanic Americans is the Congressional Hispanic Caucus  Throughout the decade of the 2000s  60  or more of Hispanic Roman Catholics registered voters have identified as either Democratic or leaning towards the Party  12  Native Americans The Democratic Party also has strong support among the Native American population  particularly in Arizona  New Mexico  Montana  North Dakota  South Dakota  Washington  Alaska  Idaho  Minnesota  Wisconsin  and North Carolina  Though now a small percentage of the population  virtually non existent in some regions   most Native American precincts vote Democratic in margins exceeded only by African Americans  49  Jewish Americans See also  National Jewish Democratic Council Jewish American communities tend to be a stronghold for the Democratic Party  with more than 70  of Jewish voters having cast their ballots for the Democrats in the 2004 and 2006 elections  16  17 Al Gore received 79  of the Jewish votes in 2000  and Barack Obama won about 77  of the Jewish vote in 2008  50  Support tends to vary among specific sectarian groups  For example  only 13  of Orthodox Jews supported Barack Obama in 2008 while around 60  of Conservative Jews and Reform Jews did so  51  A 2010 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 60  of self described Jews identified as Democratic or leaning towards the party  compared to 33  with those feelings towards Republicans  12  Jews as an important Democratic constituency are especially politically active and influential in large cities such as New York City  Los Angeles  Boston  Chicago  and play critical roles in large cities within presidential swing states  such as Philadelphia  Miami  and Las Vegas  Many prominent national Democrats in recent decades have been Jewish  including Chuck Schumer  Abraham Ribicoff  Henry Waxman  Martin Frost  Joseph Lieberman  Dianne Feinstein  Barney Frank  Barbara Boxer  Paul Wellstone  Rahm Emanuel  Russ Feingold  Herb Kohl  and Howard Metzenbaum  51  Arab and Muslim Americans Arab Americans and Muslim Americans have leaned Democratic since the Iraq War  52 Zogby found in June 2007 that 39  of Arab Americans identify as Democrats  26  as Republicans  and 28  as independents  52  Arab Americans  generally socially conservative but with more diverse economic views  historically voted Republican until recent years  having supported George W  Bush over Al Gore in 2000  53  Asian Americans This section requires expansion  Exit polls after the 2008 presidential election indicated that Democratic candidate  Barack Obama won 62  of the Asian American vote nationwide  54  Recent issue stances Columnist Ezra Klein argues that the current Democractic Party and President Obama have adopted the same positions held by moderate Republicans in the early 1990s  55  The following views are generally held by most Democrats  citation needed  Some Democrats take other positions on these issues  Economic issues Minimum wage Democrats favor a higher minimum wage  and more regular increases  The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 was an early component of the Democrats  agenda during the 110th Congress  In 2006  the Democrats supported six state ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage  all six initiatives passed  Fiscal policy Democrats generally support a more progressive tax structure to provide more services and reduce economic inequality  56  Currently they have proposed allowing those tax cuts the Bush administration gave to the wealthiest Americans to expire as written in the original legislation while wishing to keep in place those given to the middle class  56  57  Democrats generally support more government spending on social services while spending less on the military  58  59  They oppose the cutting of social services  such as Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid  and various welfare programs  60  believing it to be harmful to efficiency and social justice  Democrats believe the benefits of social services  in monetary and non monetary terms  are a more productive labor force and cultured population  and believe that the benefits of this are greater than any benefits that could be derived from lower taxes  especially on top earners  or cuts to social services  Furthermore  Democrats see social services as essential towards providing positive freedom  i e  freedom derived from economic opportunity  The Democratic led House of Representatives reinstated the PAYGO  pay as you go  budget rule at the start of the 110th Congress  61  DNC Chairman Howard Dean has cited Bill Clinton s presidency as a model for fiscal responsibility  Health care reform Democrats call for  affordable and quality health care   and many advocate an expansion of government intervention in this area  Many Democrats favor national health insurance or universal health care in a variety of forms to address the rising costs of modern health insurance  Some Democrats  such as Representatives John Conyers and John Dingell  have called for a single payer program of Medicare for All  The Progressive Democrats of America  a group operating inside the Democratic Party  has made single payer universal health care one of their primary policy goals  62  Some Democratic governors have supported purchasing Canadian drugs  citing lower costs and budget restrictions as a primary incentive  Recognizing that unpaid insurance bills increase costs to the service provider  who passes the cost on to health care consumers  many Democrats advocate expansion of health insurance coverage  Policies which most Democrats favor include  ending the ability of insurers to drop coverage when people get sick ending lifetime caps on benefits and payments insurers provide creating a nation wide insurance exchange across state lines dropping the current anti trust provision for insurance companies requiring large businesses to provide employer based insurance mandating coverage for all Americans ending insurance companies ability to discriminate based on pre existing conditions expansion of Medicaid providing subsidies for low to moderate income families and small businesses allowing children to stay on their parents coverage longer the expansion of Medicare to those aged 55 importing Canadian drugs and creating a national public insurance option paid for by premiums and co pays  Many of these proposals were included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010  Renewable energy and oil Democrats have opposed tax cuts and incentives to oil companies  favoring a policy of developing domestic renewable energy  such as Montana s state supported wind farm and  clean coal  programs as well as setting in place a cap and trade policy in hopes of reducing carbon emissions and creating incentives for clean energy innovations  Environment Democrats believe that the government should protect the environment and have a history of environmentalism  In more recent years  this stance has had as its emphasis alternative energy generation as the basis for an improved economy  greater national security  and general environmental benefits  63  The Democratic Party also favors expansion of conservation lands and encourages open space and rail travel to relieve highway and airport congestion and improve air quality and economy  it  believe s  that communities  environmental interests  and government should work together to protect resources while ensuring the vitality of local economies  Once Americans were led to believe they had to make a choice between the economy and the environment  They now know this is a false choice   64  The most important environmental concern of the Democratic Party is global warming  Democrats  most notably former Vice President Al Gore  have pressed for stern regulation of greenhouse gases  On October 15  2007  he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to build greater knowledge about man made climate change  and laying the foundations for the measures needed to counteract these changes asserting that  the climate crisis is not a political issue  it is a moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity   65  College education Most Democrats have the long term aim of having low cost  publicly funded college education with low tuition fees  like in much of Europe and Canada   which should be available to every eligible American student  or alternatively  with increasing state funding for student financial aid such as the Pell Grant or college tuition tax deduction  66  67  Trade agreements The Democratic Party has a mixed record on international trade agreements that reflects a diversity of viewpoints in the party  The liberal and cosmopolitan wing of the party  including the intelligentsia and college educated professionals overall  tend to favor globalization  while the organized labor wing of the party opposes it  68  In the 1990s  the Clinton administration and a number of prominent Democrats pushed through a number of agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   Since then  the party s shift away from free trade became evident in the Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA  vote  with 15 House Democrats voting for the agreement and 187 voting against  69  70  In his 1997 Achieving Our Country  philosopher Richard Rorty  professor at Stanford University states that economic globalization  invites two responses from the Left  The first is to insist that the inequalities between nations need to be mitigated    The second is to insist that the primary responsibility of each democratic nation state is to its own least advantaged citizens    the first response suggests that the old democracies should open their borders  whereas the second suggests that they should close them  The first response comes naturally to academic leftists  who have always been internationally minded  The second comes naturally to members of trade unions  and to marginally employed people who can most easily be recruited into right wing populist movements    p  88  68  Alternative Minimum Tax While the Democratic Party is in support of a progressive tax structure  it has vowed to adjust the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT   The tax was originally designed to tax the rich but now may affect many households  especially those with incomes ranging from  75 000 to  100 000  The party proposed to re adjust the tax in such a manner as to restore its initial intention  According to a 2007 Reuters News Report   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles B  Rangel has said he will push for permanent AMT relief for those taxpayers who were never meant to pay it   71  Social issues Discrimination The Democratic Party supports equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of sex  age  race  ethnicity  sexual orientation  gender identity  religion  creed  or national origin  The Party supports affirmative action programs to further this goal  Democrats also strongly support the Americans with Disabilities Act to prohibit discrimination against people based on physical or mental disability  Lesbian  gay  bisexual  and transgender rights The Democratic Party has been divided on the subject of same sex marriage  though support for it has been increasing and most of the support for same sex marriage in the United States has come from Democrats  Some members favor civil unions for same sex couples  others favor full and equal legalized marriage  and others are opposed to same sex marriage on religious or ideological grounds  Support for same sex marriage has increased in the past decade according to ABC News  An April 2009 ABC News Washington Post public opinion poll put support among Democrats at 62  72  A June 2008 Newsweek poll found that 42  of Democrats support same sex marriage while 23  support civil unions or domestic partnership laws and 28  oppose any legal recognition at all  73  The 2004 Democratic National Platform stated that marriage should be defined at the state level and it repudiated the Federal Marriage Amendment  74 Senator John Kerry  Democratic presidential candidate in 2004  did not support same sex marriage  Former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore said in 2009 that they now support gay marriage  75  76  President Barack Obama has stated that he considers marriage to be  something sanctified between a man and a woman   He campaigned for the election promising to  give same sex couples equal legal rights and privileges as married couples  in civil unions  77  At the same time  Obama opposed California s Prop 8  78  and he has promised to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act  77  Obama has stated that generally  decisions about marriage should be left to the states as they always have been   79  However  when running for the Illinois Senate in 1996  he said that he  unequivocally support ed  gay marriage  and  favor ed  legalizing same sex marriages  and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages   80  A broad majority of Democrats have supported other LGBT related laws such as extending hate crime statutes  legally preventing discrimination against LGBT people in the workforce  and repealing Don t ask  don t tell  A 2006 Pew Research Center poll of Democrats found that 55  supported gays adopting children with 40  opposed while 70  support gays in the military with only 23  opposed  81  Gallup polling from May 2009 stated that 82  of Democrats support open enlistment  82  Reproductive rights Most members of the Democratic Party believe that all women should have access to birth control  and support public funding of contraception for poor women  The Democratic Party  in its national platforms from 1992 to 2004  has called for abortion to be  safe  legal and rare    namely  keeping it legal by rejecting laws that allow governmental interference in abortion decisions  and reducing the number of abortions by promoting both knowledge of reproduction and contraception  and incentives for adoption  The wording changed in the 2008 platform  When Congress voted on the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003  Congressional Democrats were split  with a minority  including current Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  supporting the ban  and the majority of Democrats opposing the legislation  The Democratic Party opposes attempts to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v  Wade  which declared abortion covered by the constitutionally protected individual right to privacy under the Ninth Amendment  and Planned Parenthood v  Casey  which lays out the legal framework in which government action alleged to violate that right is assessed by courts  As a matter of the right to privacy and of gender equality  many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference  They believe that each woman  conferring with her conscience  has the right to choose for herself whether abortion is morally correct  Some Democrats also believe that poor women should have a right to publicly funded abortions  Current Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid self identifies as  pro life   while President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi self identify as  pro choice   Groups such as Democrats for Life of America represent the pro life faction of the party  while groups such as EMILY s List represent the pro choice faction  A Newsweek poll from October 2006 found that 25  of Democrats were pro life while a 69  majority was pro choice  83  Pro life Democrats themselves state that they represent over 40  of Democrats  84  Embryonic stem cell research The Democratic Party has voiced strong support for embryonic stem cell research with federal funding  85  In his 2004 platform  John Kerry affirmed his support of federally funded embryonic stem cell research  under the strictest ethical guidelines   saying   We will not walk away from the chance to save lives and reduce human suffering   74  In 2009  Barack Obama lifted the eight year running ban on embryonic stem cell research and proposed federal funding to further research  Foreign policy issues Invasion of Afghanistan See also  Afghanistan   United States relations and International public opinion on the war in Afghanistan Democrats in the House of Representatives and in the Senate near unanimously voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists against  those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States  in Afghanistan in 2001  supporting the NATO coalition invasion of the nation  Most elected Democrats continue to support the Afghanistan conflict  and some  such as a Democratic National Committee spokesperson  have voiced concerns that the Iraq War shifted too many resources away from the presence in Afghanistan  86  87  88  Since 2006  Democratic candidate Barack Obama has called for a  surge  of troops into Afghanistan and  since 2008  Republican candidate John McCain has also called for a  surge   88  As President  Obama sent a  surge  force of additional troops to Afghanistan  Troop levels were 94 000 in December 2011  and are falling  with a target of 68 000 by fall 2012  Obama plans to bring all the troops home by 2014  89  Support for the war among the American people has diminished over time  and many Democrats have changed their opinion and now oppose a continuation of the conflict  90  91  In July 2008  Gallup found that 41  of Democrats called the invasion a  mistake  while a 55  majority disagreed  in contrast  Republicans were more supportive of the war  The survey described Democrats as evenly divided about whether or not more troops should be sent  56  support it if it would mean removing troops from Iraq and only 47  support it otherwise  91  A CNN survey in August 2009 stated that a majority of Democrats now oppose the war  CNN polling director Keating Holland said   Nearly two thirds of Republicans support the war in Afghanistan  Three quarters of Democrats oppose the war   90  An August 2009 Washington Post poll found similar results  and the paper stated that Obama s policies would anger his closest supporters  92  Israel See also  Israel   United States relations The Democratic Party has both recently and historically supported Israel  93  94 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said   When it comes to Israel  Republicans and Democrats speak with one voice   95  A 2008 Gallup poll found that 64  say that they have a favorable image of Israel while only 16  say that they have a favorable image of the Palestinian Authority  93  Within the party  the majority view is held by the Democratic leadership although some members such as John Conyers Jr   George Miller  Nick Rahall  Dave Obey  Pete Stark  Dennis Kucinich  Jim McDermott  and Cynthia McKinney as well as former President Jimmy Carter are less or not supportive of Israel  94  The party leadership refers to the other side as a  fringe   94  The 2008 Democratic Party Platform acknowledges a  special relationship with Israel  grounded in shared interests and shared values  and a clear  strong  fundamental commitment to the security of Israel  our strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy   It also included  It is in the best interests of all parties  including the United States  that we take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the Israeli Palestinian conflict with a democratic  viable Palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the Jewish State of Israel  To do so  we must help Israel identify and strengthen those partners who are truly committed to peace  while isolating those who seek conflict and instability  and stand with Israel against those who seek its destruction  The United States and its Quartet partners should continue to isolate Hamas until it renounces terrorism  recognizes Israel s right to exist  and abides by past agreements  Sustained American leadership for peace and security will require patient efforts and the personal commitment of the President of the United States  The creation of a Palestinian state through final status negotiations  together with an international compensation mechanism  should resolve the issue of Palestinian refugees by allowing them to settle there  rather than in Israel  All understand that it is unrealistic to expect the outcome of final status negotiations to be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949  Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel  The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations  It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths  96  A January 2009 Pew Research Center study found that  when asked  which side do you sympathize with more   42  of Democrats and 33  of liberals  a plurality in both groups  sympathize most with the Israelis  Around half of all political moderates and or independents sided with Israel  97  Iraq War In 2002  Congressional Democrats were divided on the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq  147 voted against it  21 in the Senate and 126 in the House  and 110 voted for it  29 in the Senate  81 in the House   Since then  many prominent Democrats  such as former Senator John Edwards  have expressed regret about this decision  and have called it a mistake  while others  such as Senator Hillary Clinton have criticized the conduct of the war but not repudiated their initial vote for it  though Clinton later went on to repudiate her stance during the 2008 primaries   Referring to Iraq  in April 2007 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared the war to be  lost  while other Democrats  especially during the 2004 presidential election cycle  accused the President of lying to the public about WMDs in Iraq  Amongst lawmakers  Democrats are the most vocal opponents of Operation Iraqi Freedom and campaigned on a platform of withdrawal ahead of the 2006 mid term elections  A March 2003 CBS News poll taken a few days before the invasion of Iraq found that 34  of Democrats nationwide would support it without United Nations backing  51  would support it only with its backing  and 14  would not support it at all  98 The Los Angeles Times stated in early April 2003 that 70  of Democrats supported the decision to invade while 27  opposed it  99  The Pew Research Center stated in August 2007 that opposition increased from 37  during the initial invasion to 74   100  In April 2008  a CBS News poll found that about 90  of Democrats disapprove of the Bush administration s conduct and want to end the war within the next year  101  Democrats in the House of Representatives near unanimously supported a non binding resolution disapproving of President Bush s decision to send additional troops into Iraq in 2007  Congressional Democrats overwhelmingly supported military funding legislation that included a provision that set  a timeline for the withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq  by March 31  2008  but also would leave combat forces in Iraq for purposes such as targeted counter terrorism operations  102  103  After a veto from the president  and a failed attempt in Congress to override the veto  104  the U S  Troop Readiness  Veterans  Care  Katrina Recovery  and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act  2007 was passed by Congress and signed by the president after the timetable was dropped  Criticism of the Iraq War subsided after the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 led to a dramatic decrease in Iraqi violence  The Democratic controlled 110th Congress continued to fund efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan  Presidential candidate Barack Obama advocated a withdrawal of combat troops within Iraq by late 2010 with a residual force of peacekeeping troops left in place  105  He stated that both the speed of withdrawal and the amount of troops left over would be  entirely conditions based   105  On February 27  2009  President Obama announced   As a candidate for president  I made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry out this drawdown  while pledging to consult closely with our military commanders upon taking office to ensure that we preserve the gains we ve made and protect our troops    Those consultations are now complete  and I have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months   106  Around 50 000 non combat related forces will remain  106  Obama s plan drew wide bipartisan support  including that of defeated Republican Presidential candidate Senator John McCain  106  Unilateralism Democrats usually oppose the doctrine of unilateralism  which dictates that the United States should use military force without any assistance from other nations whenever it believes there is a threat to its security or welfare  They believe the United States should act in the international arena in concert with strong alliances and broad international support  This was a major foreign policy issue of John Kerry s 2004 presidential campaign  his platform attributed rifts with international allies to unilateralism  Barack Obama s 2008 campaign also discussed promoting the image of the United States abroad  In a general sense  the modern Democratic Party is more closely aligned with the international relations theories of liberalism  neoliberalism  and functionalism than realism and neorealism  though realism has some influence on the party  Wilsonian idealism  in which unilateral foreign intervention is justified to end genocide or other humanitarian crises  has also played a major role both historically and currently  with its supporters known as  liberal hawks   Political status of Puerto Rico Main article  Political status of Puerto Rico The Democratic Party has expressed its support for the U S  Citizens of Puerto Rico to exercise their right to self determination  Puerto Rico has been under U S  sovereignty for over a century and Puerto Ricans have been U S  citizens since 1917  but the island s ultimate status still has not been determined and its 3 9 million residents still do not have voting representation in their national government  Also states that U S  citizens in Puerto Rico should receive treatment under federal programs that is comparable to that of citizens in the States  The following are the appropriate section from the 2000  2004 and 2008 party platforms  107  74  108  Legal issues Torture Many Democrats are opposed to the use of torture against individuals apprehended and held prisoner by the U S  military  and hold that categorizing such prisoners as unlawful combatants does not release the U S  from its obligations under the Geneva Conventions  Democrats contend that torture is inhumane  decreases the United States  moral standing in the world  and produces questionable results  Democrats largely spoke out against waterboarding  USA PATRIOT Act All but two Democrats in the U S  Senate voted for the original USA PATRIOT Act legislation in 2001  The lone nay vote was from Russ Feingold of Wisconsin  Mary Landrieu of Louisiana did not vote  In the House the Democrats voted for the Act by 145 yea and 62 nay  Democrats split on the renewal in 2006  In the Senate  Democrats voted 34 for the 2006 renewal  and 9 against  In the House  Democrats voted 66 voted for the renewal  and 124 against  109  Right to privacy The Democratic Party believes that individuals should have a right to privacy  For example  Democrats have generally opposed the NSA warrantless surveillance of U S  citizens  Some Democratic officeholders have championed consumer protection laws that limit the sharing of consumer data between corporations  Most Democrats oppose sodomy laws and believe that government should not regulate consensual noncommercial sexual conduct among adults as a matter of personal privacy  Gun control With a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide  the Democratic Party has introduced various gun control measures  most notably the Gun Control Act of 1968  the Brady Bill of 1993  and Crime Control Act of 1994  However  some Democrats  especially rural  Southern  and Western Democrats  favor fewer restrictions on firearm possession and warned the party was defeated in the 2000 presidential election in rural areas because of the issue  110  In the national platform for 2008  the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban  Death penalty The Democratic Party supports the death penalty far less than the Republican Party  Though most Democrats in Congress have never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used federal death penalty  both Russ Feingold and Dennis Kucinich have introduced such bills with little success  Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death penalty laws  particularly in New Jersey and in New Mexico  They have also sought to prevent reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which currently prohibit it  including Massachusetts and New York  During the Clinton administration  Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty  These efforts resulted in the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996  Signed into law by President Clinton  the law heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases  In 1992  1993  and 1995  Democratic Texas Congressman Henry Gonz lez unsuccessfully introduced the Death Penalty Abolition Amendment which prohibited the use of capital punishment in the United States  Democratic Missouri Congressman William Lacy Clay  Sr  cosponsored the amendment in 1993  During his Illinois Senate career  now President Barack Obama successfully introduced legislation intended to reduce the likelihood of wrongful convictions in capital cases  requiring videotaping of confessions  When campaigning for the presidency  Obama stated that he supports the limited use of the death penalty  including for people who have been convicted of raping a minor under the age of 12  having opposed the Supreme Court s ruling in Kennedy v  Louisiana that the death penalty was unconstitutional in child rape cases  111  Obama has stated that he thinks the  death penalty does little to deter crime   and that it is used too frequently and too inconsistently  112  Name and symbols  A Live Jackass Kicking a Dead Lion  by Thomas Nast  Harper s Weekly  January 19  1870  Initially calling itself the  Republican Party   Jeffersonians were labeled  Democratic  by the opposition Federalists  with the hope of stigmatizing them as purveyors of democracy or mob rule  113  By the Jacksonian era  the term  The Democracy  was in use by the party  the name  Democratic Party  was eventually settled upon  114  Since the 1990s  Republicans have often referred to the Democratic Party using the phrase  Democrat Party  as a political epithet   115  The most common mascot symbol for the party is the donkey  although the party never officially adopted this symbol  116  Andrew Jackson s opponents had labeled him a jackass during the intense mudslinging in 1828  A political cartoon titled  A Modern Balaam and his Ass  depicting Jackson riding and directing a donkey  representing the Democratic Party  was published in 1837  A political cartoon by Thomas Nast in an 1870 edition of Harper s Weekly revived the donkey as a symbol for the Democratic Party  Cartoonists followed Nast and used the donkey to represent the Democrats  and the elephant to represent the Republicans  In the early 20th century  the traditional symbol of the Democratic Party in Midwestern states such as Indiana  Kentucky  Oklahoma and Ohio was the rooster  as opposed to the Republican eagle  This symbol still appears on Oklahoma  Kentucky  Indiana  and West Virginia 117 ballots  In New York  the Democratic ballot symbol is a five pointed star  118  For the majority of the 20th century  Missouri Democrats used the Statue of Liberty as their ballot emblem  This meant that when Libertarian candidates received ballot access in Missouri in 1976  they could not use the Statue of Liberty  their national symbol  as the ballot emblem  Missouri Libertarians instead used the Liberty Bell until 1995  when the mule became Missouri s state animal  From 1995 to 2004  there was some confusion among voters  as the Democratic ticket was marked with the Statue of Liberty  used by Libertarians in other states  and the Libertarians  mule was easily mistaken for a Democratic donkey  Although both major political parties  and many minor ones  use the traditional American red  white  and blue colors in their marketing and representations  since election night 2000 the color blue has become the identified color of the Democratic Party  while the color red has become the identified color of the Republican Party  That night  for the first time  all major broadcast television networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map  blue states for Al Gore  Democratic nominee  and red states for George W  Bush  Republican nominee   Since then  the color blue has been widely used by the media to represent the party  This has caused confusion among non American observers because blue is the traditional color of the right and red the color of the left outside of the United States  For example  in Canada red represents the Liberals  while blue represents the Conservatives  In the United Kingdom  red denotes the Labour Party and blue symbolizes the Conservative Party  Blue has also been used both by party supporters for promotional efforts   ActBlue  BuyBlue  BlueFund  as examples   and by the party itself in 2006 both for its  Red to Blue Program   created to support Democratic candidates running against Republican incumbents in the midterm elections that year  and on its official website  In September  2010  the Democratic Party unveiled its new logo  which featured a blue D inside a blue circle  It was the party s first official logo  as the donkey logo had been used as a semi official party logo  Jefferson Jackson Day is the annual fundraising event  dinner  held by Democratic Party organizations across the United States  119  It is named after Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson  whom the party regards as its distinguished early leaders  The song  Happy Days Are Here Again  is the unofficial song of the Democratic Party  It was used prominently when Franklin D  Roosevelt was nominated for president at the 1932 Democratic National Convention and remains a sentimental favorite for Democrats today  For example  Paul Shaffer played the theme on the Late Show with David Letterman after the Democrats won Congress in 2006  More recently  the emotionally similar song  Beautiful Day  by the band U2 has become a favorite theme song for Democratic candidates  John Kerry used the song during his 2004 presidential campaign  and several Democratic Congressional candidates used it as a celebratory tune in 2006
