listen    officially the Republic of Austria  German  Republik  sterreich   is a landlocked country of roughly 8 47 million people 3  in Central Europe  It is bordered by the Czech Republic and Germany to the north  Hungary and Slovakia to the east  Slovenia and Italy to the south  and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west  The territory of Austria covers 83 855 square kilometres  32 377 sq mi  and has a temperate and alpine climate  Austria s terrain is highly mountainous due to the presence of the Alps  only 32  of the country is below 500 metres  1 640 ft   and its highest point is 3 798 metres  12 461 ft   7  The majority of the population speak local Austro Bavarian dialects of German as their native language  8  and German in its standard form is the country s official language  9  Other local official languages are Burgenland Croatian  Hungarian and Slovene  7  The origins of modern day Austria date back to the time of the Habsburg dynasty when the vast majority of the country was a part of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation  During the 17th and 18th centuries  Austria became one of the great powers of Europe and  in response to the coronation of Napoleon I as the Emperor of the French  the Austrian Empire was officially proclaimed in 1804  In 1867  the Austrian Empire was reformed into Austria Hungary  After the collapse of the Habsburg  Austro Hungarian  Empire in 1918 at the end of World War I  Austria adopted and used the name the Republic of German Austria   Deutsch sterreich   later   sterreich   in an attempt for union with Germany  but was forbidden due to the Treaty of Saint Germain  The First Austrian Republic was established in 1919  In the 1938 Anschluss  Austria was occupied and annexed by Nazi Germany  10  This lasted until the end of World War II in 1945  after which Nazi Germany was occupied by the Allies and Austria s former democratic constitution was restored  In 1955  the Austrian State Treaty re established Austria as a sovereign state  ending the occupation  In the same year  the Austrian Parliament created the Declaration of Neutrality which declared that the Second Austrian Republic would become permanently neutral  Today  Austria is a parliamentary representative democracy comprising nine federal states  7  11  The capital and largest city  with a population exceeding 1 7 million  is Vienna  7  12  Austria is one of the richest countries in the world  with a nominal per capita GDP of  48 350  2011 est    The country has developed a high standard of living and in 2011 was ranked

of Austria First appearance of the word  ostarrichi   The word is circled in red  Modern Austria honours this document  dated 996  as the founding of the nation  The German name for Austria   sterreich  means  Eastern borderlands   it derives from the word Ostarr chi  which first appears in the  Ostarr chi document  of 996  16  This word is probably a translation of Medieval Latin Marchia orientalis into a local  Bavarian  dialect  It was a prefecture of Bavaria created in 976  The word  Austria  is a Latinisation of the German name and was first recorded in the 12th century  Friedrich Heer  one of the most important Austrian historians in the 20th century  stated in his book Der Kampf um die  sterreichische Identit t  The Struggle Over Austrian Identity   17  that the Germanic form Ostarr chi was not a translation of the Latin word  but both resulted from a much older term originating in the Celtic languages of ancient Austria  more than 2 500 years ago  the major part of the actual country was called Norig by the Celtic population  Hallstatt culture   according to Heer  no  or nor  meant  east  or  eastern   whereas  rig is related to the modern German Reich  meaning  realm   Accordingly  Norig would essentially mean Ostarr chi and  sterreich  thus Austria  The Celtic name was eventually Latinised to Noricum after the Romans conquered the area that encloses most of modern day Austria  in approximately 15 BC  Noricum later became a Roman province in the mid 1st century AD  18   edit  History Main article  History of Austria Settled in ancient times  11  the Central European land that is now Austria was occupied in pre Roman times by various Celtic tribes  The Celtic kingdom of Noricum was later claimed by the Roman Empire and made a province  Present day Petronell Carnuntum in Eastern Austria was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the Upper Pannonia province  Fifty thousand people called Carnuntum home for nearly 400 years  19  Coats of arms of the Habsburg Emperor in 1605 After the fall of the Roman Empire the area was invaded by Bavarians  Slavs and Avars  20  The Slavic tribe of the Carantanians migrated into the Alps and established the realm of Carantania  which covered much of eastern and central Austrian territory  Charlemagne conquered the area in 788 AD  encouraged colonisation and introduced Christianity  20  As part of Eastern Francia  the core areas that now encompass Austria were bequeathed to the house of Babenberg  The area was known as the marchia Orientalis and was given to Leopold of Babenberg in 976  21  The first record showing the name Austria is from 996 where it is written as Ostarr chi  referring to the territory of the Babenberg March  21  In 1156 the Privilegium Minus elevated Austria to the status of a duchy  In 1192  the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of Styria  With the death of Frederick II in 1246  the line of the Babenbergs went extinct  22  As a result Ottokar II of Bohemia effectively assumed control of the duchies of Austria  Styria and Carinthia  22  His reign came to an end with his defeat at D rnkrut at the hands of Rudolph I of Germany in 1278  23  Thereafter  until World War I  Austria s history was largely that of its ruling dynasty  the Habsburgs  In the 14th and 15th centuries  the Habsburgs began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the Duchy of Austria  In 1438 Duke Albert V of Austria was chosen as the successor to his father in law  Emperor Sigismund  Although Albert himself only reigned for a year  henceforth every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg  with only one exception  Battle of Vienna in 1683 broke the advance of the Ottoman Empire into Europe  The Habsburgs began also to accumulate lands far from the hereditary lands  In 1477 Archduke Maximilian  only son of Emperor Frederick III  married the heiress Maria of Burgundy  thus acquiring most of the Netherlands for the family  24  25  His son Philip the Fair married the heiress of Castile and Aragon  and thus acquired Spain and its Italian  African and New World appendages for the Habsburgs  24  25  In 1526 following the Battle of Moh cs  Bohemia and the part of Hungary not occupied by the Ottomans came under Austrian rule  26 Ottoman expansion into Hungary led to frequent conflicts between the two empires  particularly evident in the so called Long War of 1593 to 1606  The Turks made incursions into Styria nearly twenty times  27  burning  pillaging  and taking thousands of slaves  28  The Congress of Vienna by Jean Baptiste Isabey  1819 During the long reign of Leopold I  1657 1705  and following the successful defense of Vienna in 1683  under the command of the King of Poland  John III Sobieski   29  a series of campaigns resulted in bringing all of Hungary to Austrian control by the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699  Emperor Charles VI relinquished many of the fairly impressive gains the empire made in the previous years  largely due to his apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the House of Habsburg  Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for other powers  worthless recognitions of the Pragmatic Sanction that made his daughter Maria Theresa his heir  With the rise of Prussia the Austrian Prussian dualism began in Germany  Austria participated  together with Prussia and Russia  in the first and the third of the three Partitions of Poland  in 1772 and 1795   Austria later became engaged in a war with Revolutionary France  at the beginning highly unsuccessful  with successive defeats at the hands of Napoleon meaning the end of the old Holy Roman Empire in 1806  Two years earlier  30  in 1804  the Empire of Austria was founded  In 1814 Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the Napoleonic Wars  Archduke Franz Ferdinand  right  with his family It thus emerged from the Congress of Vienna in 1815 as one of four of the continent s dominant powers and a recognised great power  The same year  the German Confederation   Deutscher Bund  was founded under the presidency of Austria  Because of unsolved social  political and national conflicts the German lands were shaken by the 1848 revolution aiming to create a unified Germany  31  A unified Germany would have been possible either as a Greater Germany  or a Greater Austria or just the German Confederation without Austria at all  As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German speaking territories to what would become the German Empire of 1848  the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV  In 1864  Austria and Prussia fought together against Denmark and successfully freed the independent duchies of Schleswig and Holstein  Nevertheless as they could not agree on a solution to the administration of the two duchies  they fought in 1866 the Austro Prussian War  Defeated by Prussia in the Battle of K niggr tz  31  Austria had to leave the German Confederation and subsequently no longer took part in German politics  32  33  The Austro Hungarian Compromise of 1867  the Ausgleich  provided for a dual sovereignty  the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary  under Franz Joseph I  34  The Austrian Hungarian rule of this diverse empire included various Slavic groups including Croats  Czechs  Poles  Rusyns  Serbs  Slovaks  Slovenes and Ukrainians  as well as large Italian and Romanian communities  As a result  ruling Austria Hungary became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements  causing a high reliance on the use of an expanded secret police  Yet the government of Austria tried its best to be accommodating in some respects  The Reichsgesetzblatt  publishing the laws and ordinances of Cisleithania  was issued in eight languages  all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices  for example  The government of Hungary to the contrary tried to magyarise few ethnic entities which    Thus the wishes of ethnic groups dwelling in both parts of the dual monarchy hardly could be solved   edit  20th century The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 by Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip 35  was used by leading Austrian politicians and generals to persuade the emperor to declare war on Serbia  thereby risking and prompting the outbreak of World War I which led to the dissolution of the Austro Hungarian Empire  Over one million Austro Hungarian soldiers died in World War I  36  Ethno linguistic map of Austria Hungary  1910 On 21 October 1918  the elected German members of the Reichsrat  parliament of Imperial Austria  met in Vienna as the Provisional National Assembly for German Austria  Provisorische Nationalversammlung f r Deutsch sterreich   On 30 October the assembly founded the State of German Austria by appointing a government  called Staatsrat  This new government was invited by the emperor to take part in the decision on the planned armistice with Italy  but refrained from this business  this left the responsibility for the end of the war on 3 November 1918  solely to the emperor and his government  On 11 November the emperor  counseled by ministers of the old and the new government  declared he would not take part in state business any more  on 12 November German Austria  by law  declared itself to be a democratic republic and part of the new German republic  The constitution  renaming Staatsrat to Bundesregierung  federal government  and Nationalversammlung to Nationalrat  national council  was passed on 10 November 1920  The Treaty of Saint Germain of 1919  for Hungary the Treaty of Trianon of 1920  confirmed and consolidated the new order of Central Europe which to a great part had been established in November 1918  creating new states and resizing others  Over 3 million German speaking Austrians found themselves living outside of the newborn Austrian Republic as minorities in the newly formed or enlarged respective states of Czechoslovakia  Yugoslavia  Hungary and Italy  37  This included the provinces of South Tyrol and German Bohemia  the latter of which would play a role in sparking WWII  The South Tyrol question would become a lingering problem between Austria and Italy until it was officially settled by the 1980s with a large degree of autonomy being granted by the Italian national government  Between 1918 and 1919 Austria was known as the State of German Austria  Staat Deutsch sterreich   Not only did the Entente powers forbid German Austria to unite with Germany  they also rejected the name German Austria in the peace treaty to be signed  it was therefore changed to Republic of Austria in late 1919  38  Map of Austria Hungary After the war inflation began to devaluate the Krone  still Austria s currency  In the autumn of 1922 Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the League of Nations  39  The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy  stabilise the currency and improve its general economic condition  With the granting of the loan  Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations  In 1925 the Schilling  replacing the Krone by 10 000 1  was introduced  Later it was called the Alpine dollar due to its stability  From 1925 to 1929 the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after Black Friday  The First Austrian Republic lasted until 1933 when Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss  using what he called  self switch off of Parliament   Selbstausschaltung des Parlaments   established an autocratic regime tending toward Italian fascism  40  41  The two big parties at this time  the Social Democrats and the Conservatives  had paramilitary armies  42  the Social Democrats  Schutzbund was now declared illegal but still operative 42  as civil war broke out  40  41  43  Hitler speaking at Heldenplatz  Vienna  In February 1934 several members of the Schutzbund were executed  44  the Social Democratic party was outlawed and many of its members were imprisoned or emigrated  43  On 1 May 1934  the Austrofascists imposed a new constitution   Maiverfassung   which cemented Dollfuss s power but on 25 July he was assassinated in a Nazi coup attempt  45  46  His successor  Kurt Schuschnigg  struggled to keep Austria independent as  the better German state   but on 12 March 1938  Austrian Nazis took over government  while German troops occupied the country  47  On 13 March 1938  the Anschluss of Austria was officially declared  Two days later Hitler  an Austrian by birth   did what he called the  re unification  of his home country with the rest of Germany on Vienna s Heldenplatz  He established a plebiscite confirming the union with Germany in April 1938  Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn  Upper Austria  Austria was incorporated into the Third Reich and ceased to exist as an independent country  The Aryanisation of the wealth of Jewish Austrians started immediately mid March with a so called  wild   i e  extra legal  phase but soon was structured legally and bureaucratically to strip Jewish citizens of any asset they may have possessed  The Nazis called Austria  Ostmark  47  until 1942 when it was again renamed and called  Alpen Donau Reichsgaue   Some of the most prominent Nazis were native Austrians  including Adolf Hitler  Adolf Eichmann  Ernst Kaltenbrunner  Arthur Seyss Inquart  Franz Stangl  and Odilo Globocnik  48  as were 40  of the staff at Nazi extermination camps  49  Vienna fell on 13 April 1945  during the Soviet Vienna Offensive just before the total collapse of the Third Reich  The invading Allied powers  in particular the Americans  planned for the supposed  Alpine Fortress Operation  of national redoubt that was largely to have taken place on Austrian soil in the mountains of the eastern Alps  However it never materialized because of the rapid collapse of the Reich  Karl Renner and Adolf Sch rf  Socialist Party of Austria  Social Democrats and Revolutionary Socialists    Leopold Kunschak  Austria s People s Party  former Christian Social People s Party   and Johann Koplenig  Communist Party of Austria  declared Austria s secession from the Third Reich by the Declaration of Independence on 27 April 1945 and set up a provisional government in Vienna under state Chancellor Renner the same day  with the approval of the victorious Red Army and backed by Joseph Stalin  50   The date is officially named the birthday of the second republic   At the end of April  most of Western and Southern Austria still was under Nazi rule  On 1 May 1945  the federal constitution of 1929  which had been terminated by dictator Dollfuss on 1 May 1934  was declared valid again  Innsbruck hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics and will host the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics  the first in history Total military deaths from 1939 1945 are estimated at 260 000  51  Jewish Holocaust victims totaled 65 000  52  About 140 000 Jewish Austrians had fled the country in 1938 39  Thousands of Austrians had taken part in serious Nazi crimes  hundreds of thousands died in Mauthausen Gusen concentration camp only   a fact officially recognised by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky in 1992  Much like Germany  Austria was divided into British  French  Soviet and American zones and governed by the Allied Commission for Austria  53  As forecast in the Moscow Declaration in 1943  there was a subtle difference in the treatment of Austria by the Allies  50  The Austrian Government  consisting of Social Democrats  Conservatives and Communists  until 1947  and residing in Vienna  which was surrounded by the Soviet zone  was recognised by the Western Allies in October 1945 after some doubts that Renner could be Stalin s puppet  Thereby the creation of a separate Western Austrian government and the division of the country could be avoided  Austria  in general  was treated as though it had been originally invaded by Germany and liberated by the Allies  54  On 15 May 1955  after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the Cold War  Austria regained full independence by concluding the Austrian State Treaty with the Four Occupying Powers  On 26 October 1955  after all occupation troops had left  Austria declared its  permanent neutrality  by an act of parliament  which remains to this day but has been implicitly overlapped by constitutional amendments concerning Austria as member of the European Union from 1995 onwards  55  Austria joined the European Union in 1995 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007  The political system of the Second Republic is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929  which was reintroduced in 1945  The system came to be characterised by Proporz  meaning that most posts of political importance were split evenly between members of the Social Democrats and the People s Party  56  Interest group  chambers  with mandatory membership  e g  for workers  business people  farmers  grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process  so that hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus  57  Since 1945 a single party government took place only 1966 1970  Conservatives  and 1970 1983  Social Democrats   During all other legislative periods  either a grand coalition of Conservatives and Social Democrats or a  small coalition   one of these two and a smaller party  ruled the country  Following a referendum in 1994  at which consent reached a majority of two thirds  the country became a member of the European Union on 1 January 1995  58  The major parties SP  and  VP have contrary opinions about the future status of Austria s military non alignment  citation needed  While the SP  in public supports a neutral role  the  VP argues for stronger integration into the EU s security policy  even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some  VP politicians who    In reality  Austria is taking part in the EU s Common Foreign and Security Policy  participates in the so called by whom   Petersburg Agenda  including peace keeping and peace creating tasks  and has become member of NATO s  Partnership for Peace   the constitution has been amended accordingly  Since 2008  due to the Schengen Agreement  the only neighbouring country performing border controls towards Austria is Liechtenstein   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Austria Austrian Parliament in Vienna The Parliament of Austria is located in Vienna  the country s largest city and capital  Austria became a federal  parliamentary  democratic republic through the Federal Constitution of 1920  The political system of the Second Republic with its nine states is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929  which was reenacted on 1 May 1945  59  The head of state is the Federal President  Bundespr sident   who is directly elected by popular vote  The chairman of the Federal Government is the Federal Chancellor  who is appointed by the president  The government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by vote of no confidence in the lower chamber of parliament  the Nationalrat  Voting for the federal president and for the Parliament used to be compulsory in Austria  but this was abolished in steps from 1982 to 2004  60  The Parliament of Austria consists of two chambers  The composition of the Nationalrat  183 seats  is determined every five years  or whenever the Nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the federal chancellor  or by Nationalrat itself  by a general election in which every citizen over 16 years  since 2007  has voting rights  While there is a general threshold of 4 percent for all parties at federal elections  Nationalratswahlen   there remains the possibility to gain a direct seat  or Direktmandat  in one of the 43 regional election districts  The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in Austria  However  the upper house of parliament  the Bundesrat  has a limited right of veto  the Nationalrat can in almost all cases ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time  This is referred to as  Beharrungsbeschluss  lit   vote of persistence    A convention  called the  sterreich  Konvent 61  was convened on 30 June 2003 to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution  but failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two thirds of votes in the Nationalrat necessary for constitutional amendments and or reform  With legislative and executive  the courts are the third column of Austrian state powers  Notably the Constitutional Court  Verfassungsgerichtshof  may exert considerable influence on the political system by ruling out laws and ordinances not in compliance with the constitution  Since 1995  the European Court of Justice may overrule Austrian decisions in all matters defined in laws of the European Union  Austria also implements the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights  since the European Convention on Human Rights is part of the Austrian constitution   edit  Recent developments After general elections held in October 2006  the Social Democrats emerged as the largest party  whereas the People s Party lost about 8  in votes  62  63  Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties  In January 2007 the People s Party and Social Democrats formed a grand coalition with the social democrat Alfred Gusenbauer as Chancellor  This coalition broke up in June 2008  Elections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties  Social Democrats and People s Party  but together they still held more than 50  of the votes with the Social Democrats holding the majority  They formed a coalition with Werner Faymann from the Social Democrats as Chancellor  The positions of the Freedom Party and the deceased J rg Haider s new party Alliance for the Future of Austria  both parties on the political right  were strengthened during the election   edit  Foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of Austria Foreign ministry The 1955 Austrian State Treaty ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state  On 26 October 1955  the Federal Assembly passed a constitutional article in which  Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality   The second section of this law stated that  in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory   Since then  Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality  but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland  Austria began to reassess its definition of neutrality following the fall of the Soviet Union  granting overflight rights for the UN sanctioned action against Iraq in 1991  and  since 1995  it has developed participation in the EU s Common Foreign and Security Policy  CFSP   Also in 1995  it joined the Partnership for Peace and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia  Meanwhile  the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still valid fully is not to allow foreign military bases in Austria  citation needed  Austria attaches great importance to participation in the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development and other international economic organisations  and it has played an active role in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  OSCE   As an OSCE participating State  Austria s international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the U S  Helsinki Commission   edit  Military Main article  Austrian Armed Forces Austrian Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon fighter aircraft  The manpower of the Austrian Armed Forces  German  Bundesheer  mainly relies on conscription  All males who have reached the age of eighteen and are found fit have to serve a six months military service  followed by an eight year reserve obligation  Both males and females at the age of sixteen are eligible for voluntary service  7 Conscientious objection is legally acceptable and those who claim this right are obliged to serve an institutionalised nine months civilian service instead  Since 1998  women volunteers have been allowed to become professional soldiers  The main sectors of the Bundesheer are Joint Forces  Streitkr ftef hrungskommando  SKF Kdo  which consist of Land Forces  Landstreitkr fte   Air Forces

border crossings by illegal immigrants  This assistance came to an end when Hungary joined the EU Schengen Area in 2008  for all intents and purposes abolishing  internal  border controls between treaty states  Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission  but the legality of this is heavily disputed  In accordance with the Austrian constitution  armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases  mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergency  such as in the wake of natural disasters  They may generally not be used as auxiliary police

privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies  Labour movements are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics  Next to a highly developed industry  international tourism is the most important part of the national economy  Mariahilf shopping avenue Germany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria  making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the German economy  However  since Austria became a member state of the European Union it has gained closer ties to other European Union economies  reducing its economic dependence on Germany  In addition  membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria s access to the single European market and proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union  Growth in GDP accelerated in recent years and reached 3 3  in 2006  68  Austria indicated on 16 Nov 2010 that it would withhold the December installment of its contribution to the EU bailout of Greece citing material worsening of the Greek debt situation and apparent inability of Greece to collect the level of tax receipts it had previously promised  69

on 1 January 1999  and euro coins and banknotes entered circulation on 1 January 2002  As a preparation for this date  the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 1999  however all Austrian euro coins introduced in 2002 have this year on it  unlike other countries of the Eurozone where mint year is minted in the coin  Eight different designs  one per face value  were selected for the Austrian coins  In 2007  to adopt the new common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries  Austria changed the common side of its coins  Before adopting the Euro in 2002 Austria had maintained use of the Austrian schilling which was first established in December 1924  The Schilling was abolished in the wake of the Anschluss in 1938 and was reintroduced after the end of the World War II in November 1945  Austria has one of the richest collection of collectors  coins in the Eurozone  with face value ranging from 10 to 100 euro  although a 100 000 euro coin was exceptionally minted in 2004   These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of the minting of silver and gold coins  Unlike normal issues  these coins are not legal tender in all the eurozone  For instance  a  5

vocabulary differences  In terms of native language  however  various local Austro Bavarian  Alemannic in Vorarlberg  are spoken instead  and Standard German is more or less a second language to Austrians  The dialects more or less qualify for classification as separate languages but are not treated as such  even though Austro Bavarian is sometimes used in media and more so in TV comedy shows  The Austrian federal states of Carinthia and Styria are home to a significant indigenous Slovene speaking minority while in the easternmost state  Burgenland  formerly part of the Hungarian portion of Austria Hungary   there are significant Hungarian  and Croatian speaking minorities  Of the remaining number of Austria s people that are of non Austrian descent  many come from surrounding countries  especially from the former East Bloc nations  So called guest workers  Gastarbeiter  and their descendants  as well as refugees from the Yugoslav wars and other conflicts  also form an important minority group in Austria  Since 1994 the Roma Sinti  gypsies  have been an officially recognised ethnic minority in Austria  According to census information published by Statistik Austria for 2001 8  there were a total of 710 926 foreign nationals living in Austria  Of these  the largest by far are 283 334 foreign nationals from the former Yugoslavia  of whom 135 376 speak Serbian  105

Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two World Wars and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory  The recently deceased governor  J rg Haider  has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia  A poll by the K rntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65  of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs  since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view  Another interesting phenomenon is the so called  Windischen Theorie  84  stating that the Slovenes can be split in two groups  actual Slovenes and Windische  a traditional German name for Slavs   based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenes  who were taught Slovene standard language in school and those Slovenes who spoke their local Slovene dialect but went to German schools  The term Windische was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction  This politically influenced theory  dividing Slovene Austrians into the  loyal Windische  and the  national Slovenes   was never generally accepted and fell out of use some decades ago   edit  Religion Main article  Religion in Austria Main

Kindergarten in German   free in most states  is provided for all children between the ages of three and six years and  whilst optional  is considered a normal part of a child s education due to its high takeup rate  Maximum class size is around 30  each class normally being cared for by one qualified teacher and one assistant  Primary education  or Volksschule  lasts for four years  starting at age six  The maximum class size is 30  but may be as low as 15  It is generally expected that a class will be taught by one teacher for the entire four years and the stable bond between teacher and pupil is considered important for a child s well being  The so called  3Rs  Reading  wRiting and aRithmetic  dominate lesson time  with less time allotted to project work than in the UK  Children work individually and all members of a class follow the same plan of work  There is no streaming  Standard attendance times are 8 am to 12 pm or 1 pm  with hourly five  or ten minute breaks  Children are given homework daily from the first year  Historically there has been no lunch hour  with children returning home to eat  However  due to a rise in the number of mothers in work  primary schools are increasingly offering pre lesson and afternoon care  As in Germany  secondary education consists of two main types of schools  attendance at which is based on a pupil s ability as determined by grades from the primary school  The Gymnasium caters for the more able children  in the final year of which the Matura examination is taken  which is a requirement for access to university  The Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education but also for various types of further education  H here Technische Lehranstalt HTL   institution of higher technical education  HAK   commercial academy  HBLA   institution of higher education for economic business  etc    Attendance at one of these further education institutes also leads to the Matura  Some schools aim to combine the education available at the Gymnasium and the Hauptschule  and are known as Gesamtschulen  In addition  a recognition of the importance of learning English has led some Gymnasiums to offer a bilingual stream  in which pupils deemed able in languages follow a modified curriculum  a portion of the lesson time being conducted in English  The University of Vienna As at primary school  lessons at Gymnasium begin at 8 am and continue with short intervals until lunchtime or early afternoon  with children returning home to a late lunch  Older pupils often attend further lessons after a break for lunch  generally eaten at school  As at primary level  all pupils follow the same plan of work  Great emphasis is placed on homework and frequent testing  Satisfactory marks in the end of the year report   Zeugnis   are a prerequisite for moving up   aufsteigen   to the next class  Pupils who do not meet the required standard re sit their tests at the end of the summer holidays  those whose marks are still not satisfactory are required to re sit the year   sitzenbleiben    It is not uncommon for a pupil to re sit more than one year of school  After completing the first two years  pupils choose between one of two strands  known as  Gymnasium   slightly more emphasis on arts  or  Realgymnasium   slightly more emphasis on science   Whilst many schools offer both strands  some do not  and as a result  some children move schools for a second time at age 12  At age 14  pupils may choose to remain in one of these two strands  or to change to a vocational course  possibly with a further change of school  The Austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the Matura examination until recently  A 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as Medicine  In 2001  an obligatory tuition fee   Studienbeitrag   of  363 36 per term was introduced for all public universities  Since 2008  for all EU students the studies have been free of charge  as long as a certain time limit is not exceeded  the expected duration of the study plus usually two terms tolerance   101  When the time limit is exceeded  the fee of around  363 36 per term is charged  Some
