New York Harbor The Statue of Liberty  Liberty Enlightening the World  French  La Libert   clairant le monde  is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor  designed by Fr d ric Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28  1886  The statue  a gift to the United States from the people of France  is of a robed female figure representing Libertas  the Roman goddess of freedom  who bears a torch and a tabula ansata  a tablet evoking the law  upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence  July 4  1776  A broken chain lies at her feet  The statue has become an icon of freedom and of the United States  Bartholdi was inspired by French law professor and politician  douard Ren  de Laboulaye  who commented in 1865 that any monument raised to American independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples  Due to the troubled political situation in France  work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s  In 1875  Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the Americans provide the pedestal and the site  Bartholdi completed the head and the torch bearing arm before the statue was fully designed  and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions  The arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in 1876 and in New York s Madison Square Park from 1876 to 1882  Fundraising proved difficult  especially for the Americans  and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened due to lack of funds  Publisher Joseph Pulitzer of the World started a drive for donations to complete the project that attracted more than 120 000 contributors  most of whom gave less than a dollar  The statue was constructed in France  shipped overseas in crates  and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe s Island  The statue s completion was marked by New York s first ticker tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland  The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War  since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service  The statue was closed for renovation for much of 1938  In the early 1980s  it was found to have deteriorated to such an extent that a major restoration was required  While the statue was closed from 1984 to 1986  the torch and a large part of the internal structure were replaced  After the September 11 attacks in 2001  it was closed for reasons of safety and security  the pedestal reopened in 2004 and the statue in 2009  with limits on the number of visitors allowed to ascend to the crown  The statue  including the pedestal and base  closed beginning on October 29  2011  for up to a year so that a secondary staircase and other safety features can be installed  Liberty Island remains open  Public access to the balcony surrounding the torch has been barred for safety reasons since 1916  Contents

construction Origin The origin of the Statue of Liberty project is generally traced to a comment made by French law professor and politician  douard Ren  de Laboulaye in mid 1865  In after dinner conversation at his home near Versailles  Laboulaye  an ardent supporter of the Union in the American Civil War  stated   If a monument should rise in the United States  as a memorial to their independence  I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort a common work of both our nations   6  Bartholdi s design patent Laboulaye s comment was not intended as a proposal  but it inspired a young sculptor  Fr d ric Bartholdi  who was present at the dinner  6  Given the repressive nature of the regime of Napoleon III  Bartholdi took no immediate action on the idea except to discuss it with Laboulaye  Instead  Bartholdi approached Ismail Pasha  Khedive of Egypt  with a plan to build a huge lighthouse in the form of an ancient Egyptian female fellah or peasant  robed and holding a torch aloft  at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in Port Said  Sketches and models were made of the proposed work  though it was never erected  There was a classical precedent for the Suez proposal  the Colossus of Rhodes  an ancient bronze statue of the Greek god of the sun  Helios  This statue is believed to have been over 100 feet  30 m  high  and it similarly stood at a harbor entrance and carried a light to guide ships  7  The American project was further delayed by the Franco Prussian War  in which Bartholdi served as a major of militia  6  In the war  Napoleon III was captured and deposed  Bartholdi s home province of Alsace was lost to the Prussians  and a more liberal republic was installed in France  6  As Bartholdi had been planning a trip to the United States  he and Laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the idea with influential Americans  8  In June 1871  Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic  with letters of introduction signed by Laboulaye  9  Arriving at New York Harbor  Bartholdi focused on Bedloe s Island as a site for the statue  struck by the fact that vessels arriving in New York had to sail past it  He was delighted to learn that the island was owned by the United States government it had been ceded by the New York State Legislature in 1800 for harbor defense  It was thus  as he put it in a letter to Laboulaye   land common to all the states   10  As well as meeting many influential New Yorkers  Bartholdi visited President Ulysses S  Grant  who assured him that it would not be difficult to obtain the site for the statue  11  Bartholdi crossed the United States twice by rail  and met many Americans whom he felt would be sympathetic to the project  9  But he remained concerned that popular opinion on both sides of the Atlantic was insufficiently supportive of the proposal  and he and Laboulaye decided to wait before mounting a public campaign  12  Bartholdi s Lion of Belfort Bartholdi had made a first model of his concept in 1870  13  The son of a friend of Bartholdi s  American artist John La Farge  later maintained that Bartholdi made the first sketches for the statue during his U S  visit at La Farge s Rhode Island studio  Bartholdi continued to develop the concept following his return to France  13  He also worked on a number of sculptures designed to bolster French patriotism after the defeat by the Prussians  One of these was the Lion of Belfort  a monumental sculpture carved in sandstone below the fortress of Belfort  which during the war had resisted a Prussian siege for over three months  The defiant lion  73 feet  22 m  long and half that in height  displays an emotional quality characteristic of Romanticism  which Bartholdi would later bring to the Statue of Liberty  14  Design  style  and symbolism Detail from a fresco by Constantino Brumidi in the U S  Capitol in Washington  D C   showing two early symbols of America  Columbia  left  and the Indian princess Bartholdi and Laboulaye considered how best to express the idea of American liberty  15  In early American history  two female figures were frequently used as cultural symbols of the nation  16  One  Columbia  was seen as an embodiment of the United States in the manner that Britannia was identified with the United Kingdom and Marianne came to represent France  Columbia had supplanted the earlier figure of an Indian princess  which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans  16  The other significant female icon in American culture was a representation of Liberty  derived from Libertas  the goddess of freedom widely worshipped in ancient Rome  especially among emancipated slaves  A Liberty figure adorned most American coins of the time  15  and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art  including Thomas Crawford s Statue of Freedom  1863  atop the dome of the United States Capitol Building  15  Artists of the 18th and 19th centuries striving to evoke republican ideals commonly used representations of Liberty  15  A figure of Liberty was also depicted on the Great Seal of France  15  However  Bartholdi and Laboulaye avoided an image of revolutionary liberty such as that depicted in Eug ne Delacroix s famed Liberty Leading the People  1830   In this painting  which commemorates France s Revolution of 1830  a half clothed Liberty leads an armed mob over the bodies of the fallen  16  Laboulaye had no sympathy for revolution  and so Bartholdi s figure would be fully dressed in flowing robes  16  Instead of the impression of violence in the Delacroix work  Bartholdi wished to give the statue a peaceful appearance and chose a torch  representing progress  for the figure to hold  17  Crawford s statue was designed in the early 1850s  It was originally to be crowned with a pileus  the cap given to emancipated slaves in ancient Rome  Secretary of War Jefferson Davis  a Southerner who would later serve as president of the Confederate States of America  was concerned that the pileus would be taken as an abolitionist symbol  He ordered that it be changed to a helmet  18  Delacroix s figure wears a pileus  16  and Bartholdi at first considered placing one on his figure as well  Instead  he used a diadem  or crown  to top its head  19  In so doing  he avoided a reference to Marianne  who invariably wears a pileus  20  The seven rays form a halo or aureole  21  They evoke the sun  the seven seas  and the seven continents  22  and represent another means  besides the torch  whereby Liberty enlightens the world  17  Bartholdi s early models were all similar in concept  a female figure in neoclassical style representing liberty  wearing a stola and pella  gown and cloak  common in depictions of Roman goddesses  and holding a torch aloft  The face was modeled after that of Charlotte Beysser Bartholdi  the sculptor s mother  23  He designed the figure with a strong  uncomplicated silhouette  which would be set off well by its dramatic harbor placement and allow passengers on vessels entering New York Bay to experience a changing perspective on the statue as they proceeded toward Manhattan  He gave it bold classical contours and applied simplified modeling  reflecting the huge scale of the project and its solemn purpose  17  Bartholdi wrote of his technique  Thomas Crawford s Statue of Freedom The surfaces should be broad and simple  defined by a bold and clear design  accentuated in the important places  The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared  By exaggerating the forms  in order to render them more clearly visible  or by enriching them with details  we would destroy the proportion of the work  Finally  the model  like the design  should have a summarized character  such as one would give to a rapid sketch  Only it is necessary that this character should be the product of volition and study  and that the artist  concentrating his knowledge  should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity  24  Bartholdi made alterations in the design as the project evolved  Bartholdi considered having Liberty hold a broken chain  but decided this would be too divisive in the days after the Civil War  The erected statue does rise over a broken chain  half hidden by her robes and difficult to see from the ground  19  Bartholdi was initially uncertain of what to place in Liberty s left hand  he settled on a tabula ansata  a keystone shaped tablet 25  used to evoke the concept of law  26  Though Bartholdi greatly admired the United States Constitution  he chose to inscribe  JULY IV MDCCLXXVI  on the tablet  thus associating the date of the country s Declaration of Independence with the concept of liberty  25  Consultations with the metalwork foundry Gaget  Gauthier  amp  Co  led Bartholdi to conclude that the skin should be made of copper sheets  beaten to shape by the repouss  method  27  An advantage of this choice was that the entire statue would be light for its volume the copper need be only  094 inches  2 4 mm  thick  He decided on a height of 151 feet  46 m  for the statue  double that of Italy s Colosso di San Carlo Borromeo and the German statue of Arminius  both made with the same method  28  Bartholdi interested a former teacher of his  architect Eug ne Viollet le Duc  in the project  Viollet le Duc planned to construct a brick pier within the statue  to which the skin would be anchored  29  Announcement and early work By 1875  France was enjoying improved political stability and a recovering postwar economy  Growing interest in the upcoming Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide it was time to seek public support  30  In September 1875  he announced the project and the formation of the Franco American Union as its fundraising arm  With the announcement  the statue was given a name  Liberty Enlightening the World  31  The French would finance the statue  Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal  32  The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France  though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during the war with Prussia  31 French monarchists opposed the statue  if for no other reason than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye  who had recently been elected a senator for life  32  Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful  including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25  1876  that featured a new cantata by composer Charles Gounod  The piece was titled La Libert   clairant le monde  the French version of the statue s announced name  31  Stereoscopic image of right arm and torch of the Statue of Liberty  1876 Centennial Exposition Despite its initial focus on the elites  the Union was successful in raising funds from across French society  Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave  as did 181 French municipalities  Laboulaye s political allies supported the call  as did descendants of the French contingent in the American Revolutionary War  Less idealistically  contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the Panama Canal  The firm of Japy Fr res  copper merchants  donated all the copper needed to build the statue  a gift valued at 64 000 francs  about  16 000 at the time or the equivalent of  323 000 today   33  34  The copper is said to have come from a mine in Visnes  Norway  35  though this has not been conclusively determined  36  Although plans for the statue had not been finalized  Bartholdi moved forward with fabrication of the right arm  bearing the torch  and the head  Work began at the Gaget  Gauthier  amp  Co  workshop  37  In May 1876  Bartholdi traveled to the United States as a member of a French delegation to the Centennial Exhibition  38  and arranged for a huge painting of the statue to be shown in New York as part of the Centennial festivities  39  The arm did not arrive in Philadelphia until August  because of its late arrival  it was not listed in the exhibition catalogue  and while some reports correctly identified the work  others called it the  Colossal Arm  or  Bartholdi Electric Light   The exhibition grounds contained a number of monumental artworks to compete for fairgoers  interest  including an outsized fountain designed by Bartholdi  40  Nevertheless  the arm proved popular in the exhibition s waning days  and visitors would climb up to the balcony of the torch to view the fairgrounds  41  After the exhibition closed  the arm was transported to New York  where it remained on display in Madison Square Park for several years before it was returned to France to join the rest of the statue  41  During his second trip to the United States  Bartholdi addressed a number of groups about the project  and urged the formation of American committees of the Franco American Union  42  Committees to raise money to pay for the foundation and pedestal were formed in New York  Boston  and Philadelphia  43  The New York group eventually took on most of the responsibility for American fundraising and is often referred to as the  American Committee   44  One of its members was 19 year old Theodore Roosevelt  the future governor of New York and president of the United States  42  On March 3  1877  on his final full day in office  President Grant signed a joint resolution that authorized the President to accept the statue when it was presented by France and to select a site for it  President Rutherford B  Hayes  who took office the following day  selected the Bedloe s Island site that Bartholdi had proposed  45  Construction in France The statue s head on exhibit at the Paris World s Fair  1878 On his return to Paris in 1877  Bartholdi concentrated on completing the head  which was exhibited at the 1878 Paris World s Fair  Fundraising continued  with models of the statue put on sale  Tickets to view the construction activity at the Gaget  Gauthier  amp  Co  workshop were also offered  34  The French government authorized a lottery  among the prizes were valuable silver plate and a terracotta model of the statue  By the end of 1879  about 250 000 francs had been raised  46  The head and arm had been built with assistance from Viollet le Duc  who fell ill in 1879  He soon died  leaving no indication of how he intended to transition from the copper skin to his proposed masonry pier  47  The following year  Bartholdi was able to obtain the services of the innovative designer and builder Alexandre Gustave Eiffel  34  Eiffel and his structural engineer  Maurice Koechlin  decided to abandon the pier and instead build an iron truss tower  Eiffel opted not to use a completely rigid structure  which would force stresses to accumulate in the skin and lead eventually to cracking  To enable the statue to move slightly in the winds of New York Harbor and as the metal expanded on hot summer days  he loosely connected the support structure to the skin using what was dubbed an armature a metal framework that ends in a mesh of metal straps  known as  saddles   that are riveted to the skin  providing firm support  In a labor intensive process  each saddle had to be crafted individually  48  49  To prevent galvanic corrosion between the copper skin and the iron support structure  Eiffel insulated the skin with asbestos impregnated with shellac  50  The change in structural material from masonry to iron allowed Bartholdi to change his plans for the statue s assembly  He had originally expected to assemble the skin on site as the masonry pier was built  instead he decided to build the statue in France and have it disassembled and transported to the United States for reassembly in place on Bedloe s Island  51  Eiffel s design made the statue one of the earliest examples of curtain wall construction  in which the exterior of the structure is not load bearing  but is instead supported by an interior framework  He included two interior spiral staircases  to make it easier for visitors to reach the observation point in the crown  52  Access to an observation platform surrounding the torch was also provided  but the narrowness of the arm allowed for only a single ladder  40 feet  12 m  long  53  As the pylon tower arose  Eiffel and Bartholdi coordinated their work carefully so that completed segments of skin would fit exactly on the support structure  54  In a symbolic act  the first rivet placed into the skin  fixing a copper plate onto the statue s big toe  was driven by United States Ambassador to France Levi P  Morton  55  The skin was not  however  crafted in exact sequence from low to high  work proceeded on a number of segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors  56  Some work was performed by contractors one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi s exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of Montauban  57  By 1882  the statue was complete up to the waist  an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue  58  Laboulaye died in 1883  He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Ferdinand de Lesseps  builder of the Suez Canal  The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4  1884  and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York  59  The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal  by January 1885  this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage  60  Fundraising  criticism  and construction in the United States Frank Leslie s Illustrated Newspaper  June 1885  showing woodcuts of the completed statue in Paris  Bartholdi  and the statue s interior structure The committees in the United States faced great difficulties in obtaining funds  The Panic of 1873 had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade  The Liberty statue project was not the only such undertaking that had difficulty raising money  construction of the obelisk later known as the Washington Monument sometimes stalled for years  it would ultimately take over three and a half decades to complete  61  There was criticism both of Bartholdi s statue and of the fact that the gift required Americans to foot the bill for the pedestal  In the years following the Civil War  most Americans preferred realistic artworks depicting heroes and events from the nation s history  rather than allegorical works like the Liberty statue  61  There was also a feeling that Americans should design American public works the selection of Italian born Constantino Brumidi to decorate the Capitol had provoked intense criticism  even though he was a naturalized U S  citizen  62 Harper s Weekly declared its wish that  M  Bartholdi and our French cousins had  gone the whole figure  while they were about it  and given us statue and pedestal at once   63 The New York Times stated that  no true patriot can countenance any such expenditures for bronze females in the present state of our finances   64  Faced with these criticisms  the American committees took little action for several years  64  The foundation of Bartholdi s statue was to be laid inside Fort Wood  a disused army base on Bedloe s Island constructed between 1807 and 1811  Since 1823  it had rarely been used  though during the Civil War  it had served as a recruiting station  65  The fortifications of the structure were in the shape of an eleven point star  The statue s foundation and pedestal were aligned so that it would face southeast  greeting ships entering the harbor from the Atlantic Ocean  66  In 1881  the New York committee commissioned Richard Morris Hunt to design the pedestal  Within months  Hunt submitted a detailed plan  indicating that he expected construction to take about nine months  67  He proposed a pedestal 114 feet  35 m  in height  faced with money problems  the committee reduced that to 89 feet  27 m   68  Hunt s pedestal design contains elements of classical architecture  including Doric portals  and the large mass is fragmented with architectural detail to focus attention on the statue  68  In form  it is a truncated pyramid  62 feet  19 m  square at the base and 39 4 feet  12 0 m  at the top  The four sides are identical in appearance  Above the door on each side  there are ten disks upon which Bartholdi proposed to place the coats of arms of the states  between 1876 and 1889  there were 40 U S  states   although this was not done  Above that  a balcony was placed on each side  framed by pillars  Bartholdi placed an observation platform near the top of the pedestal  above which the statue itself rises  69  According to author Louis Auchincloss  the pedestal  craggily evokes the power of an ancient Europe over which rises the dominating figure of the Statue of Liberty   68  The committee hired former army General Charles Pomeroy Stone to oversee the construction work  70  Construction on the 15 foot  4 6 m  deep foundation began in 1883  and the pedestal s cornerstone was laid in 1884  67  In Hunt s original conception  the pedestal was to have been made of solid granite  Financial concerns again forced him to revise his plans  the final design called for poured concrete walls  up to 20 feet  6 1 m  thick  faced with granite blocks  71  72  The concrete mass was the largest poured to that time  72  Fundraising for the statue had begun in 1882  The committee organized a large number of money raising events  73  As part of one such effort  an auction of art and manuscripts  poet Emma Lazarus was asked to donate an original work  She initially declined  stating she could not write a poem about a statue  At the time  she was also involved in aiding refugees to New York who had fled anti Semitic pogroms in eastern Europe  These refugees were forced to live in conditions that the wealthy Lazarus had never experienced  She saw a way to express her empathy for these refugees in terms of the statue  74  The resulting sonnet   The New Colossus   including the iconic lines  Give me your tired  your poor Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free   is uniquely identified with the Statue of Liberty and is inscribed on a plaque in the museum in the base  75  Richard Morris Hunt s pedestal under construction in June 1885 Even with these efforts  fundraising lagged  Grover Cleveland  the governor of New York  vetoed a bill to provide  50 000 for the statue project in 1884  An attempt the next year to have Congress provide  100 000  sufficient to complete the project  failed when Democratic representatives would not agree to the appropriation  The New York committee  with only  3 000 in the bank  suspended work on the pedestal  With the project in jeopardy  groups from other American cities  including Boston and Philadelphia  offered to pay the full cost of erecting the statue in return for relocating it  76 Joseph Pulitzer  publisher of the World  a New York newspaper  announced a drive to raise  100 000  the equivalent of  2 3 million today   33  Pulitzer pledged to print the name of every contributor  no matter how small the amount given  77  The drive captured the imagination of New Yorkers  especially when Pulitzer began publishing the notes he received from contributors   A young girl alone in the world  donated  60 cents  the result of self denial   78  One donor gave  five cents as a poor office boy s mite toward the Pedestal Fund   A group of children sent a dollar as  the money we saved to go to the circus with   79  Another dollar was given by a  lonely and very aged woman   78  Residents of a home for alcoholics in New York s rival city of Brooklyn  the cities would not merge until 1898  donated  15  other drinkers helped out through donation boxes in bars and saloons  80  A kindergarten class in Davenport  Iowa  mailed the World a gift of  1 35  78  As the donations flooded in  the committee resumed work on the pedestal  81  In June  New Yorkers displayed their new found enthusiasm for the statue  as the French vessel Is re arrived with the crates holding the disassembled statue on board  Two hundred thousand people lined the docks and hundreds of boats put to sea to welcome the Is re  82  After five months of daily calls to donate to the statue fund  on August 11  1885  the World announced that  102 000 had been raised from 120 000 donors  and that 80 percent of the total had been received in sums of less than one dollar  83  Even with the success of the fund drive  the pedestal was not completed until April 1886  Immediately thereafter  reassembly of the statue began  Eiffel s iron framework was anchored to steel I beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled  84  Once this was done  the sections of skin were carefully attached  85  Due to the width of the pedestal  it was not possible to erect scaffolding  and workers dangled from the armature by ropes while installing the skin sections  Nevertheless  no one died during the construction work  86  Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch s balcony to illuminate it  a week before the dedication  the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal  fearing that ships  pilots passing the statue would be blinded  Instead  Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch  which was covered with gold leaf  and placed the lights inside them  87  A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs  88  After the skin was completed  renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmstead  designer of New York s Central Park and Brooklyn s Prospect Park  supervised a cleanup of Bedloe s Island in anticipation of the dedication  89  Dedication Unveiling of the Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World  1886  by Edward Moran  Oil on canvas  The J  Clarence Davies Collection  Museum of the City of New York  A ceremony of dedication was held on the afternoon of October 28  1886  President Grover Cleveland  the former New York governor  presided over the event  90  On the morning of the dedication  a parade was held in New York City  estimates of the number of people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million  President Cleveland headed the procession  then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America  General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade  The route began at Madison Square  once the venue for the arm  and proceeded to Battery Park at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway  with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row  As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange  traders threw ticker tape from the windows  beginning the New York tradition of the ticker tape parade  91  A nautical parade began at 12 45 p m   and President Cleveland embarked on a yacht that took him across the harbor to Bedloe s Island for the dedication  92  De Lesseps made the first speech  on behalf of the French committee  followed by the chairman of the New York committee  Senator William M  Evarts  A French flag draped across the statue s face was to be lowered to unveil the statue at the close of Evarts s speech  but Bartholdi mistook a pause as the conclusion and let the flag fall prematurely  The ensuing cheers put an end to Evarts s address  91  President Cleveland spoke next  stating that the statue s  stream of light shall pierce the darkness of ignorance and man s oppression until Liberty enlightens the world   93  Bartholdi  observed near the dais  was called upon to speak  but he refused  Orator Chauncey M  Depew concluded the speechmaking with a lengthy address  94  No members of the general public were permitted on the island during the ceremonies  which were reserved entirely for dignitaries  The only females granted access were Bartholdi s wife and de Lesseps s granddaughter  officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the crush of people  The restriction offended area suffragists  who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island  The group s leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women s right to vote  93  A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather  95  Shortly after the dedication  the Cleveland Gazette  an African American newspaper  suggested that the statue s torch not be lit until the United States became a free nation  in reality    Liberty enlightening the world   indeed  The expression makes us sick  This government is a howling farce  It can not or rather does not protect its citizens within its own borders  Shove the Bartholdi statue  torch and all  into the ocean until the  liberty  of this country is such as to make it possible for an inoffensive and industrious colored man to earn a respectable living for himself and family  without being ku kluxed  perhaps murdered  his daughter and wife outraged  and his property destroyed  The idea of the  liberty  of this country  enlightening the world   or even Patagonia  is ridiculous in the extreme  96  History since dedication Lighthouse Board and War Department  1886 1933  Government poster using the Statue of Liberty to promote the sale of Liberty Bonds When the torch was illuminated on the evening of the statue s dedication  it produced only a faint gleam  barely visible from Manhattan  The World characterized it as  more like a glowworm than a beacon   88  Bartholdi suggested gilding the statue to increase its ability to reflect light  but this proved too expensive  The United States Lighthouse Board took over the Statue of Liberty in 1887 and pledged to install equipment to enhance the torch s effect  in spite of its efforts  the statue remained virtually invisible at night  When Bartholdi returned to the United States in 1893  he made additional suggestions  all of which proved ineffective  He did successfully lobby for improved lighting within the statue  allowing visitors to better appreciate Eiffel s design  88  In 1901  President Theodore Roosevelt  once a member of the New York committee  ordered the statue s transfer to the War Department  as it had proved useless as a lighthouse  97  A unit of the Army Signal Corps was stationed on Bedloe s Island until 1923  after which military police remained there while the island was under military jurisdiction  98  The statue rapidly became a landmark  Many immigrants who entered through New York saw it as a welcoming sight  Oral histories of immigrants record their feelings of exhilaration on first viewing the Statue of Liberty  One immigrant who arrived from Greece recalled  I saw the Statue of Liberty  And I said to myself   Lady  you re such a beautiful   sic  You opened your arms and you get all the foreigners here  Give me a chance to prove that I am worth it  to do something  to be someone in America   And always that statue was on my mind  99  Originally  the statue was a dull copper color  but shortly after 1900 a green patina  also called verdigris  caused by the oxidation of the copper skin  began to spread  As early as 1902 it was mentioned in the press  by 1906 it had entirely covered the statue  100  In the belief that the patina was evidence of corrosion  Congress authorized  62 800 to paint the statue both inside and out  101  There was considerable public protest against the proposed exterior painting  102  The Army Corps of Engineers studied the patina for any ill effects to the statue and concluded that it protected the skin   softened the outlines of the Statue and made it beautiful   103  The statue was painted only on the inside  The Corps of Engineers also installed an elevator to take visitors from the base to the top of the pedestal  103  Bedloe s Island in 1927  showing the statue and army buildings  The eleven pointed walls of Fort Wood  which still form the statue s base  are visible  On July 30  1916  during World War I  German saboteurs set off a disastrous explosion on the Black Tom peninsula in Jersey City  New Jersey  in what is now part of Liberty State Park  close to Bedloe s Island  Carloads of dynamite and other explosives that were being sent to Britain and France for their war efforts were detonated  and seven people were killed  The statue sustained minor damage  mostly to the torch bearing right arm  and was closed for ten days  The cost to repair the statue and buildings on the island was about  100 000  The narrow ascent to the torch was closed for public safety reasons  and it has remained closed ever since  94  That same year  Ralph Pulitzer  who had succeeded his father Joseph as publisher of the World  began a drive to raise  30 000 for an exterior lighting system to illuminate the statue at night  He claimed over 80 000 contributors but failed to reach the goal  The difference was quietly made up by a gift from a wealthy donor a fact that was not revealed until 1936  An underwater power cable brought electricity from the mainland and floodlights were placed along the walls of Fort Wood  Gutzon Borglum  who later sculpted Mount Rushmore  redesigned the torch  replacing much of the original copper with stained glass  On December 2  1916  President Woodrow Wilson pressed the telegraph key that turned on the lights  successfully illuminating the statue  104  After the United States entered World War I in 1917  images of the statue were heavily used in both recruitment posters and the Liberty Bond drives that urged American citizens to support the war financially  This impressed upon the public the war s stated purpose to secure liberty and served as a reminder that embattled France had given the United States the statue  105  In 1924  President Calvin Coolidge used his authority under the Antiquities Act to declare the statue a national monument  97  The only successful suicide in the statue s history occurred five years later  when a man climbed out of one of the windows in the crown and jumped to his death  glancing off the statue s breast and landing on the base  106  Early National Park Service years  1933 1982  September 26  1972  President Richard Nixon visits the statue to open the American Museum of Immigration  The statue s raised right foot is visible  showing that it is depicted moving forward  In 1933  President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the statue transferred to the National Park Service  NPS   In 1937  the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe s Island  97  With the Army s departure  the NPS began to transform the island into a park  107  The Works Progress Administration  WPA  demolished most of the old buildings  regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island  and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear  The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue  temporarily removing the rays from the statue s halo so their rusted supports could be replaced  Rusted cast iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete  108  the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced  as well  Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal  109  The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938  108  During World War II  the statue remained open to visitors  although it was not illuminated at night due to wartime blackouts  It was lit briefly on December 31  1943  and on D Day  June 6  1944  when its lights flashed  dot dot dot dash   the Morse code for V  for victory  New  powerful lighting was installed in 1944 1945  and beginning on V E Day  the statue was once again illuminated after sunset  The lighting was for only a few hours each evening  and it was not until 1957 that the statue was illuminated every night  all night  110  In 1946  the interior of the statue within reach of visitors was coated with a special plastic so that graffiti could be washed away  109  In 1956  an act of Congress officially renamed Bedloe s Island as Liberty Island  a change advocated by Bartholdi generations earlier  The act also mentioned the efforts to found an American Museum of Immigration on the island  which backers took as federal approval of the project  though the government was slow to grant funds for it  111  Nearby Ellis Island was made part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument by proclamation of President Lyndon Johnson in 1965  97  In 1972  the immigration museum  in the statue s base  was finally opened in a ceremony led by President Richard Nixon  The museum s backers never provided it with an endowment to secure its future and it closed in 1991 after the opening of an immigration museum on Ellis Island  84  The statue was several times taken over briefly by demonstrators  publicizing causes such as Puerto Rican independence  opposition to abortion  and opposition to US intervention in Grenada  Demonstrations with the permission of the Park Service included a Gay Pride Parade rally and the annual Captive Baltic Nations rally  112  A powerful new lighting system was installed in advance of the American Bicentennial in 1976  The statue was the focal point for Operation Sail  a regatta of tall ships from all over the world that entered New York Harbor on July 4  1976  and sailed around Liberty Island  113  The day concluded with a spectacular display of fireworks near the statue  114  Renovation to present  since 1982  See also  Liberty Weekend July 4  1986  First Lady Nancy Reagan  in red  reopens the statue to the public  The statue was examined in great detail by French and American engineers as part of the planning for its centennial in 1986  115  In 1982  it was announced that the statue was in need of considerable restoration  Careful study had revealed that the right arm had been improperly attached to the main structure  It was swaying more and more when strong winds blew and there was a significant risk of structural failure  In addition  the head had been installed 2 feet  0 61 m  off center  and one of the rays was wearing a hole in the right arm when the statue moved in the wind  The armature structure was badly corroded  and about two percent of the exterior plates needed to be replaced  116  Although problems with the armature had been recognized as early as 1936  when cast iron replacements for some of the bars had been installed  much of the corrosion had been hidden by layers of paint applied over the years  117  In May 1982  President Ronald Reagan announced the formation of the Statue of Liberty Ellis Island Centennial Commission  led by Chrysler Corporation chair Lee Iacocca  to raise the funds needed to complete the work  118  Through its fundraising arm  the Statue of Liberty Ellis Island Foundation  Inc   the group raised more than  350 million in donations  119  The Statue of Liberty was one of the earliest beneficiaries of a cause marketing campaign  A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express card  the company would contribute one cent to the renovation of the statue  The campaign generated contributions of  1 7 million to the restoration project  120  In 1984  the statue was closed to the public for the duration of the renovation  Workers erected scaffolding that obscured the statue from view  Liquid nitrogen was used to remove layers of paint that had been applied to the interior of the copper skin over decades  leaving two layers of coal tar  originally applied to plug leaks and prevent corrosion  Blasting with baking soda powder removed the tar without further damaging the copper  121  The restorers  work was hampered by the asbestos based substance that Bartholdi had used  ineffectively  as inspections showed  to prevent galvanic corrosion  Workers within the statue had to wear protective gear  dubbed  moon suits   with self contained breathing circuits  122  Larger holes in the copper skin were repaired  and new copper was added where necessary  123  The replacement skin was taken from a copper rooftop at Bell Labs  which had a patina that closely resembled the statue s  in exchange  the laboratory was provided some of the old copper skin for testing  124  The torch  found to have been leaking water since the 1916 alterations  was replaced with an exact replica of Bartholdi s unaltered torch  125  Consideration was given to replacing the arm and shoulder  the National Park Service insisted that they be repaired instead  126  The entire armature was replaced  The puddled iron bars used by Eiffel were gradually removed  The new bars that attach to the pylon are made of low carbon corrosion resistant stainless steel  The bars that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium  an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves  127  To prevent the ray and arm making contact  the ray was realigned by several degrees  128  The lighting was again replaced night time illumination now comes from metal halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue  showing off various details  129  Access to the pedestal  which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s  was renovated to create a wide opening framed by a set of monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation  130  A modern elevator was installed  allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal  131  An emergency elevator was installed within the statue  reaching up to the level of the shoulder  132  September 11  2001  The twin towers of the World Trade Center burn with the Statue of Liberty in the foreground  July 3 6  1986  was designated  Liberty Weekend   marking the centennial of the statue and its reopening  President Reagan presided over the rededication  with French President Fran ois Mitterrand in attendance  July 4 saw a reprise of Operation Sail  133  and the statue was reopened to the public on July 5  134  In Reagan s dedication speech  he stated   We are the keepers of the flame of liberty  we hold it high for the world to see   133  Following the September 11 attacks  the statue and Liberty Island were immediately closed to the public  The island reopened at the end of 2001  while the pedestal and statue remained off limits  The pedestal reopened in August 2004  134  but the National Park Service announced that visitors could not safely be given access to the statue due to the difficulty of evacuation in an emergency  The Park Service adhered to that position through the remainder of the Bush administration  135  New York Congressman Anthony D  Weiner made the statue s reopening a personal crusade  136  On May 17  2009  President Barack Obama s Secretary of the Interior  Ken Salazar  announced that as a  special gift  to America  the statue would be reopened to the public as of July 4  but that only a limited number of people would be permitted to ascend to the crown each day  135  The statue  including the pedestal and base  closed on October 29  2011  the day after celebrations to mark the statue s 125th anniversary   for installation of new elevators and staircases  and to bring other facilities  such as restrooms  up to code  Although the statue is closed to the public for up to a year  Liberty Island remains open  1  137  Access and attributes Location and visiting Tourists aboard a Circle Line ferry bound for Liberty Island  June 1973 The statue is situated in Upper New York Bay on Liberty Island  south of Ellis Island  Both islands were ceded by New York to the federal government in 1800  138  As agreed in an 1834 compact between New York and New Jersey that set the state border at the bay s midpoint  the original islands remain New York territory despite their location on the New Jersey side of the state line  Land created by reclamation at Ellis is New Jersey territory  139  Entrance to the Statue of Liberty National Monument is free  but there is a charge for the ferry service that all visitors must use  as private boats may not dock at the island  A concession was granted in 2007 to Statue Cruises to operate the transportation and ticketing facilities  replacing Circle Line  which had operated the service since 1953  140  The ferries  which depart from Liberty State Park in Jersey City and Battery Park in Lower Manhattan  also stop at Ellis Island  making a combined trip possible  141  All ferry riders are subject to security screening  similar to airport procedures  prior to boarding  142  The statue  pedestal  and base are presently closed for renovation work  1  When the structure is open  visitors intending to enter the statue s base and pedestal must obtain a complimentary museum pedestal ticket along with their ferry ticket  143  Those wishing to climb the staircase within the statue  when it is open  to the crown purchase a special ticket  which may be reserved up to a year in advance  A total of 240 people per day are permitted to ascend  ten per group  three groups per hour  Climbers may bring only medication and cameras lockers are provided for other items and must undergo a second security screening  144  Inscriptions  plaques  and dedications Plaque honoring poet Emma Lazarus  with the text of  The New Colossus  There are several plaques and dedicatory tablets on or near the Statue of Liberty  A plaque on the copper just under the figure in front declares that it is a colossal statue representing Liberty  designed by Bartholdi and built by the Paris firm of Gaget  Gauthier et Cie  Cie is the French abbreviation analogous to Co    A presentation tablet  also bearing Bartholdi s name  declares the statue to be a gift from the people of the Republic of France that honors  the Alliance of the two Nations in achieving the Independence of the United States of America and attests their abiding friendship   145  There is a tablet placed by the New York committee that commemorates the fundraising done to build the pedestal  The cornerstone also bears a plaque placed by the Freemasons  145  In 1903  a bronze tablet that bears the text of  The New Colossus  and commemorates Emma Lazarus was presented by friends of the poet  Until the 1986 renovation  it was mounted inside the pedestal  today it resides in the Statue of Liberty Museum in the base  It is accompanied by a tablet given by the Emma Lazarus Commemorative Committee in 1977  celebrating the poet s life  145  A group of statues stands at the western end of the island  honoring those closely associated with the Statue of Liberty  Two Americans Pulitzer and Lazarus and three Frenchmen Bartholdi  Laboulaye  and Eiffel are depicted  They are the work of Maryland sculptor Phillip Ratner  146  In 1984  the Statue of Liberty was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site  The UNESCO  Statement of Significance  describes the statue as a  masterpiece of the human spirit  that  endures as a highly potent symbol inspiring contemplation  debate and protest of ideals such as liberty  peace  human rights  abolition of slavery  democracy and opportunity   147  Physical

sister  148  A replica 30 feet  9 1 m  tall stood atop the Liberty Warehouse on West 64th Street in Manhattan for many years  148  it now resides at the Brooklyn Museum  149  In a patriotic tribute  the Boy Scouts of America  as part of their Strengthen the Arm of Liberty campaign in 1949 1952  donated about two hundred replicas of the statue  made of stamped copper and 100 inches  2 500 mm  in height  to states and municipalities across the United States  150  Though not a true replica  the statue known as the Goddess of Democracy temporarily erected during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 was similarly inspired by French democratic traditions the sculptors took care to avoid a direct imitation of the Statue of Liberty  151  Among other recreations of New York City structures  a replica of the statue is part of the exterior of the New York New York Hotel  amp  Casino in Las Vegas  Nevada  152  1971 U S  airmail stamp depicting the head of the Statue of Liberty Reverse side of a Presidential Dollar coin As an American icon  the Statue of Liberty has been depicted on the country s coinage and stamps  It appeared on commemorative coins issued to mark its 1986 centennial  and on New York s 2001 entry in the state quarters series  153  An image of the statue was chosen for the American Eagle platinum bullion coins in 1997  and it was placed on the reverse  or  tails   side of the Presidential Dollar series of circulating coins  22  Two images of the statue s torch appear on the current ten dollar bill  154  The statue s intended photographic depiction on a 2010 forever stamp proved instead to be of the replica at the Las Vegas casino  155  Depictions of the statue have been used by many regional institutions  Between 1986 and 2000  New York State issued license plates featuring the statue  156  157  The Women s National Basketball Association s New York Liberty use both the statue s name and its image in their logo  in which the torch s flame doubles as a basketball  158  The New York Rangers of the National Hockey League depicted the statue s head on their third jersey  beginning in 1997  159  The National Collegiate Athletic Association s 1996 Men s Basketball Final Four  played at New Jersey s Meadowlands Sports Complex  featured the statue in its logo  160  The statue is a frequent subject in popular culture  In music  it has been evoked to indicate support for American policies  as in Toby Keith s song  Courtesy of the Red  White   amp  Blue  The Angry American    and in opposition  appearing on the cover of The Dead Kennedys  album Bedtime for Democracy  which protested the Reagan administration s policies  161  In film  the torch is the setting for the climax of director Alfred Hitchcock s 1942 movie Saboteur  162  The statue makes one of its most famous cinematic appearances in the 1968 picture Planet of the Apes  in which it is seen half buried in sand  161  163  It is destroyed in the science fiction films Independence Day  The Day After Tomorrow  and Cloverfield  161  In Jack Finney s time travel novel Time and Again  the right arm of the statue  on display in the early 1880s in Madison Square Park  plays a crucial role  164 Robert Holdstock  consulting editor of The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction  wondered in 1979  Where would  science fiction  be without the Statue of Liberty  For decades it has towered or crumbled above the wastelands of deserted  E arth giants have uprooted it  aliens have found it curious     the symbol of Liberty  of optimism  has become a symbol of science fiction s pessimistic view of the future   165  See also New York City portal List of the tallest statues in the United States Place des  tats Unis The Statue of Liberty  Ken Burns documentary Statue of Responsibility
