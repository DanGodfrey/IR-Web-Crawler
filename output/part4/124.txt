BelgiumLuxembourg  Luxembourg The European Commission is the executive body of the European Union  The body is responsible for proposing legislation  implementing decisions  upholding the Union s treaties and the general day to day running of the Union  2  The Commission operates as a cabinet government  with 27 members of the Commission  informally known as  commissioners  3     There is one member per member state  though members are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state  One of the 27 is the Commission President  currently Jos  Manuel Dur o Barroso  proposed by the European Council and elected by the European Parliament  The Council then appoints the other 26 members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated President  and then the 27 members as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament  4  The first Barroso Commission took office in late 2004 2  and its successor  under the same President  took office in 2010  5  The term  Commission  is used either in the narrow sense of the 27 member College of Commissioners  or College  or to also include the administrative body of about 23 000 European civil servants who are split into departments called Directorates General and Services  6  The internal working languages of the Commission are English  French and German  2  The Members of

of the five key institutions created in the supranational European Community system  following the proposal of Robert Schuman  French Foreign Minister  on 9 May 1950  Originating in 1951 as the High Authority in the European Coal and Steel Community  the Commission has undergone numerous changes in power and composition under various Presidents  involving three Communities  7   edit  Establishment The first Commission originated in 1951 as the nine member  High Authority  under President Jean Monnet  see Monnet Authority   The High Authority was the supranational administrative executive of the new European Coal and Steel Community  ECSC   It took office first on 10 August 1952 in Luxembourg  In 1958 the Treaties of Rome had established two new communities alongside the ECSC  the European Economic Community  EEC  and the European Atomic Energy Community  Euratom   However their executives were called  Commissions  rather than  High Authorities   7  The reason for the change in name was the new relationship between the executive and the Council  Some states such as France expressed reservations over the power of the High Authority and wished to limit it giving more power to the Council rather than the new executives  8  Louis Armand led the first Commission of Euratom  Walter Hallstein led the first Commission of the EEC  holding the first formal meeting on 16 January 1958 at the Castle of the Valley of the Duchess  It achieved agreement on a contentious cereal price accord as well as making a positive impression upon third countries when it made its international debut at the Kennedy Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  GATT  negotiations  9  Hallstein notably began the consolidation of European law and started to have a notable impact on national legislation  Little heed was taken of his administration at first but  with help from the European Court of Justice  his Commission stamped its authority solidly enough to allow future Commissions to be taken more seriously  10  However  in 1965 accumulating differences between the French government of Charles de Gaulle and the other member states  over British entry  direct elections to Parliament  the Fouchet Plan and the budget  triggered the  empty chair  crisis ostensibly over proposals for the Common Agricultural Policy  Although the institutional crisis was solved the following year  it cost Etienne Hirsch his presidency of Euratom and later Walter Hallstein the EEC presidency despite otherwise being viewed as the most  dynamic  leader until Jacques Delors  9   edit  Early development The three bodies  collectively named the European Executives  co existed until 1 July 1967 where  by means of the Merger Treaty  they were combined into a single administration under President Jean Rey  7  Due to the merger the Rey Commission saw a temporary increase to fourteen members  although all future Commissions were reduced back down to nine following the formula of one member for small states and two for larger states  11  The Rey Commission completed the Community s customs union in 1968 and campaigned for a more powerful  elected  European Parliament  12  Despite Rey being the first President of the combined communities  Hallstein is seen as the first President of the modern Commission  7  The Malfatti and Mansholt Commissions followed with work on monetary co operation and the first enlargement to the north in 1973  13  14  With that enlargement the Commission s membership increased to thirteen under the Ortoli Commission  the United Kingdom as a large member was granted two Commissioners   which dealt with the enlarged community during economic and international instability at that time  11  15  The external representation of the Community took a step forward when President Roy Jenkins  recruited to the presidency in January 1977 from his role as Home Secretary of the United Kingdom s Labour government  16  became the first President to attend a G8 summit on behalf of the Community  17  Following the Jenkins Commission  Gaston Thorn s Commission oversaw the Community s enlargement to the south  in addition to beginning work on the Single European Act  18   edit  Jacques Delors President Delors  one of the most notable Presidents in the Commission s history  Main article  Delors Commission One of the most notable Commissions was that headed by Jacques Delors  with later Presidents failing to achieve the same degree of personal recognition  Delors was seen as giving the Community a sense of direction and dynamism  19  Delors and his team are also considered as the  founding fathers of the euro   20  The International Herald Tribune noted the work of Delors at the end of his second term in 1992   Mr  Delors rescued the European Community from the doldrums  He arrived when Europessimism was at its worst  Although he was a little known former French finance minister  he breathed life and hope into the EC and into the dispirited Brussels Commission  In his first term  from 1985 to 1988  he rallied Europe to the call of the single market  and when appointed to a second term he began urging Europeans toward the far more ambitious goals of economic  monetary and political union   21   edit  Jacques Santer Main article  Santer Commission The successor to Delors was Jacques Santer  However the entire Santer Commission was forced to resign in 1999 by the Parliament as result of fraud and corruption scandal  with a central role played by  dith Cresson  These frauds were revealed by an internal auditor Paul van Buitenen  22  23  That was the first time a Commission had been forced to resign en masse and represented a shift of power towards the Parliament  24  However the Santer Commission did carry out work on the Amsterdam Treaty and the euro  25  In response to the scandal the European Anti fraud Office  OLAF  was created   edit  Romano Prodi Main article  Prodi Following Santer  Romano Prodi took office  The Amsterdam Treaty had increased the Commission s powers and Prodi was dubbed by the press as something akin to a Prime Minister  26  27  Powers were strengthened again with the Nice Treaty in 2001 giving the President more power over the composition of their Commission  7   edit  Jos  Manuel Barroso Main article  Barroso Commission In 2004 Jos  Manuel Barroso became President  however  the Parliament once again asserted itself in objecting to the proposed membership of the Barroso Commission  Due to the opposition Barroso was forced to reshuffle his team before taking office  28  The Barroso Commission was also the first full Commission since the enlargement in 2004 to 25 members and hence the number of Commissioners at the end of the Prodi Commission had reached 30  As a result of the increase in the number of states  the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a reduction in the number of Commissioners to one per state  rather than two for the larger states  11  Allegations of fraud and corruption were again raised in 2004 by former chief auditor Jules Muis  29  A Commission officer Guido Strack reported alleged fraud and abuses in his department in years 2002 2004 to OLAF and was fired as result  30  In 2008 Paul van Buitenen  the former auditor known from Santer Commission scandal  alleged European Anti fraud Office  OLAF  of lack of independence and effectiveness  31  Barroso s first Commission term expired 31 October 2009  Under the Treaty of Nice  the first Commission to be appointed after the number of member states reached 27 would have to be reduced to  less than the number of Member States   The exact number of Commissioners was to be decided by a unanimous vote of the European Council and membership would rotate equally between member states  Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in January 2007  this clause took effect for the next Commission  32  The Treaty of Lisbon  which entered force on 1 December 2009 mandated a reduction the number of commissioners to two thirds of member states from 2014 unless the Council decided otherwise  Membership would rotate equally and no member state would have more than one Commissioner  However  the treaty was rejected by voters in Ireland in 2008 with one main concern being the loss of their Commissioner  Hence a guarantee given for a rerun of the vote was that the Council would use its power to amend the number of Commissioners upwards  However according to the treaties it still has to be fewer than the total number of members  thus it was proposed that the member state that doesn t get a Commissioner would get the post of High Representative   the so called 26 1 formula  33  34  This guarantee  which may find its way into the next treaty amendment  probably in an accession treaty  contributed to the Irish approving the treaty in a second referendum in 2009  Lisbon also combined the posts of European Commissioner for External Relations with the Council s High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy  This post  also a Vice President of the Commission  would chair the Council of the European Union s foreign affairs meetings as well as the Commission s external relations duties  35  36  The treaty further provides that the most recent European elections should be  taken into account  when appointing the Commission  although the President is still proposed by the European Council  the European Parliament would  elect  the Commission rather than  approve  it as under the Treaty of Nice  35   edit  Powers and functions Incumbent President Barroso The Commission was set up from the start to act as an independent supranational authority separate from governments  it has been described as  the only body paid to think European   37  The members are proposed by their member state governments  one from each  however they are bound to act independently   neutral from other influences such as those governments which appointed them  This is in contrast to the Council  which represents governments  the Parliament  which represents citizens  and the Economic and Social Committee  which represents organised civil society  2  Through the article 17 of the Treaty on European Union the Commission has several responsibilities  develop medium term strategies  draft legislation and arbitrate in the legislative process  represent the EU in trade negotiations  make rules and regulations  for example in competition policy  draw up the budget of the European Union  and to scrutinise the implementation of the treaties and legislation  38   edit  Executive power Before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon  the executive power of the Union was held by the Council  it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise  However  the Council was theoretically allowed to withdraw these powers  exercise them directly  or impose conditions on their use  39  40  This aspect has been changed by the Treaty of Lisbon  after which the Commission exercises its powers just by virtue of the treaties  Powers are more restricted than most national executives  in part due to the Commission s lack of power over areas like foreign policy   that power is held by the European Council  which some analyses have described as another executive  41  Considering that under the Lisbon Treaty the European Council has become a formal institution with the power of appointing the Commission  it could be said that the two bodies hold the executive power of the Union  the European Council also holds individual national executive powers   However  it is the Commission which currently holds executive powers over the European Union  41  42  The governmental powers of the Commission have been such that some such as former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt have suggested changing its name to the  European Government   calling the present name of commission  ridiculous   43   edit  Legislative initiative The Commission differs from the other institutions in that it alone has legislative initiative in the European Union  meaning only the Commission can make formal proposals for legislation  legislative proposals cannot originate in the legislative branches  Under the Treaty of Lisbon  no legislative act is allowed in the field of the Common Foreign and Security Policy  In the other fields  however  Council and Parliament are able to request legislation  in most cases the Commission initiates the basis of these proposals  this monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of Union law  44  45  This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right  with most national parliaments holding the right in some respects  46  However  the Council and Parliament may request the Commission to draft legislation  though the Commission does have the power to refuse to do so 47  as it did in 2008 over transnational collective conventions  48  Under the Lisbon Treaty  EU citizens are also able to request the Commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures  but this is not binding  49  The Commission s powers in proposing law have usually centred on economic regulation  It has put forward a large number of regulations based on a  precautionary principle   This means that pre emptive regulation takes place if there is a credible hazard to the environment or human health  for example on tackling climate change and restricting genetically modified organisms  This is opposed to weighting regulations for their effect on the economy  Thus  the Commission often proposes stricter legislation than other countries  Due to the size of the European market this has made EU legislation an important influence in the global market  50  Recently the Commission has moved into creating European criminal law  In 2006  a toxic waste spill off the coast of C te d Ivoire  from a European ship  prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste  Some EU states at that time did not even have a crime against shipping toxic waste leading to the Commissioners Franco Frattini and Stavros Dimas to put forward the idea of  ecological crimes   Their right to propose criminal law was challenged in the European Court of Justice but upheld  As of 2007  the only other criminal law proposals which have been brought forward are on the intellectual property rights directive  51  and on an amendment to the 2002 counter terrorism framework decision  outlawing terrorism related incitement  recruitment  especially via the internet  and training  52   edit  Enforcement Once legislation is passed by the Council and Parliament  it is the Commission s responsibility to ensure it is implemented  It does this through the member states or through its agencies  In adopting the necessary technical measures  the Commission is assisted by committees made up of representatives of member states and of the public and private lobbies 53   a process known in jargon as  comitology    54  Furthermore  the Commission is responsible for the implementation of the EU budget  ensuring  along with the Court of Auditors  that EU funds are correctly spent  In particular the Commission has a duty to ensure the treaties and law are upheld  potentially by taking member states or other institutions to the Court of Justice in a dispute  In this role it is known informally as the  guardian of the treaties   55  Finally  the Commission provides some external representation for the Union  alongside the member states and the Common Foreign and Security Policy  representing the Union in bodies such as the World Trade Organisation  It is also usual for the President to attend meetings of the G8  55   edit  College For details on the current members  see Barroso Commission  The Commission is composed of a college of  Commissioners   27 members in all  including the President and vice presidents  Even though each member is appointed by a national government  one per state  they do not represent their state in the Commission 56   however in practice they do occasionally press for their national interest 57    Once proposed  the President delegates portfolios between each of the members  The power of a Commissioner largely depends upon their portfolio  and can vary over time  For example  the Education Commissioner has been growing in importance  in line with the rise in the importance of education and culture in European policy making  58  Another example is the Competition Commissioner  who holds a highly visible position with global reach  56  Before the Commission can assume office  the college as a whole must be approved by the Parliament  2  Commissioners are supported by their personal cabinet who give them political guidance  while the Civil Service  the DGs  see below  deal with technical preparation  59   edit  Appointment Floor 13 of the Berlaymont  Commission s meeting room The President of the Commission is first proposed by the European Council taking into account the latest Parliamentary elections  that candidate can then be elected by the European Parliament or not  If not  the European Council shall propose another candidate within one month  The candidate has often been a leading national politician but this is not a requirement  In 2009  the Lisbon Treaty was not in force and Barroso was not  elected  by the Parliament  but rather nominated by the European Council  in any case  the centre right parties of the EU pressured for a candidate from their own ranks  In the end  a centre right candidate was chosen  Jos  Manuel Barroso of the European People s Party  60  There are further criteria influencing the choice of the candidate  these include  which area of Europe the candidate comes from  favoured as Southern Europe in 2004  the candidate s political influence  credible yet not overpowering members  language  proficiency in French considered necessary by France  and degree of integration  their state being a member of both the eurozone and the Schengen Agreement  61  62  63  In 2004  this system produced a number of candidates 64  and was thus criticised by some MEPs  following the drawn out selection  the ALDE group leader Graham Watson described the procedure as a  Justus Lipsius carpet market  producing only the  lowest common denominator   while Green EFA co leader Daniel Cohn Bendit asked Barroso after his first speech  If you are the best candidate  why were you not the first   65  66  Following the election of the President  and the appointment of the High Representative by the European Council  each Commissioner is nominated by their member state  except for those states who provided the President and High Representative  in consultation with the Commission President  although he holds little practical power to force a change in candidate  However the more capable the candidate is  the more likely the Commission President will assign them a powerful portfolio  the distribution of which is entirely at his discretion  The President s team is then subject to hearings at the European Parliament which will question them and then vote on their suitability as a whole  If members of the team are found to be too inappropriate  the President must then reshuffle the team or request a new candidate from the member state or risk the whole Commission being voted down  As Parliament cannot vote against individual Commissioners there is usually a compromise whereby the worst candidates are removed but minor objections are put aside so the Commission can take office  Once the team is approved by parliament  it is formally put into office by the European Council  TEU Article 17 7   Following their appointment  the President appoints a number of Vice Presidents  the High Representative is mandated to be one of them  from among the commissioners  For the most part  the position grants little extra power to Vice Presidents  except the first Vice President who stands in for the President when he is away  56  Since 2009 the First Vice President has gained further power by also being the High Representative   edit  Political styles The present Commission  the Barroso Commission  took office in late 2004 after being delayed by objections from the Parliament which forced a reshuffle  In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria who each appointed their own Commissioners  With the increasing size of the Commission  President Barroso has adopted a more Presidential style of control over the college  which has earned him some criticism  67  However  despite Barroso being a more presidential and high profile figure than his predecessors  the Commission has begun to lose ground to the larger member states as countries such as France  the UK and Germany seek to sideline its role  This might increase with the creation of the President of the European Council under the Treaty of Lisbon  68  There has also been a greater degree of politicisation within the Commission   edit  Organisation Further information  European Civil Service Cypriot politician Androulla Vassiliou is currently the European Commissioner for Education  Culture  Multilingualism and Youth The Commission is primarily based in Brussels  with the President s office and the Commission s meeting room based on the 13th floor of the Berlaymont building  The Commission also operates out of numerous other buildings in Brussels and Luxembourg  2  69  When the Parliament is meeting in Strasbourg  the Commissioners also meet there in the Winston Churchill building to attend the Parliament s debates  70  The Commission is divided into departments known as Directorates General  DGs  that can be likened to departments or ministries  Each covers a specific policy area such as Agriculture or Justice and citizens  rights or internal services such as Human Resources and Translation and is headed by Director General who is responsible to a Commissioner  A Commissioner s portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs  they prepare proposals for them and if approved by a majority of Commissioners it goes forward to Parliament and Council for consideration  2  71  There has been criticism from a number of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable amount of time in turf wars as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other  Furthermore the DGs can exercise considerable control over a Commissioner with the Commissioner having little time to learn to assert control over their staff  72  73  According to figures published by the Commission  23 043 persons were employed by the Commission as officials and temporary agents in April 2007  In addition to these  9019  external staff   e g  Contractual agents  detached national experts  young experts  trainees etc   were employed  The single largest DG is the Directorate General for Translation  with a 2186 strong staff  while the largest group by nationality is Belgian  21 4    probably due to a majority  16 626  of staff being based in the country  74  The Commission s civil service is headed by a Secretary General  currently Catherine Day  37   edit  Press Press Room in the Berlaymont Communication with the press is handled by the Directorate General Communication  The Commission s chief spokesperson is Johannes Laitenberger who takes the midday press briefings  commonly known as the  Midday Presser   It takes place every weekday in the Commission s press room at the Berlaymont where journalists may ask questions of Commission officials on any topic and legitimately expect to get an  on the record  answer for live TV  Such a situation is unique in the world  75  It has been noted by one researcher that the press releases issued by the Commission are uniquely political  A release often goes through several stages of drafting which emphasises the role of the Commission and is used  for justifying the EU and the commission  increasing their length and complexity  Where there are multiple departments involved a press release can also be a source of competition between areas of the Commission and Commissioners themselves  This also leads to an unusually high number of press releases  1907 for 2006  and is seen as a unique product of the EU s political set up  73  There is a larger press corps in Brussels than Washington D C   in 2007 media outlets in every Union member state had a Brussels correspondent  76  However since the global downturn by 2010 the press corps in Brussels shrunk by a third  There is only one journalist covering EU news for Latvia and none for Lithuania  Although there has been a world wide cut in journalists  the considerable press releases and operations such as Europe by Satellite and EuroparlTV leads many news organisations to believe they can cover the EU from these source and news agencies  77   edit  Legitimacy Some argue that the method of appointment for the Commission increases the democratic deficit in the European Union  78  79  While the Commission is the executive branch  the candidates are chosen individually by the 27 national governments  which means it is not possible for a Commission Member or its President to be removed directly by the ballot box  Rather  the legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament  along with Parliament s power to dismiss the body  which  in turn  raises the concern of the relatively low turnout  less than 50   in elections for the European Parliament since 1999  While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections  including the off year elections of the United States Congress  the fact that there are no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position s legitimacy into question in the eyes of some  80  A further problem is the lack of a coherent electorate  even though democratic structures and methods are developing there is not such a mirror in creating a European civil society  81  The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission  including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president  An alternative viewpoint on the Commission states that the policy areas in which it has power to initiate legislation are ill suited to an institution subject to electoral pressures   In this respect the Commission has been compared with institutions such as independent Central Banks which deal with technical areas of policy  82  In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas  the ministers of member states  and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted  thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited  82  In 2009 European ombudsman published statistics of citizens  complaints against the European Union institutions  with most of them filed against European Commission  66   and concerning lack of transparency  36    83  In 2010 the Commission was sued for blocking access to documents on EU biofuel policy  84  This happened after media alleged the Commission of blocking scientific evidence against biofuel subsidies  85  Lack of transparency  unclear lobbyist relations  conflicts of interests and excessive spending of the Commission was highlighted in a number of reports by internal and independent auditing organisations  86  87  88  89   edit
