official name  pound sterling   plural  pounds sterling  is used mainly in formal contexts and also when it is necessary to distinguish the United Kingdom currency from other currencies with the same name  Otherwise the term pound is normally used  The currency name is sometimes abbreviated to just sterling  particularly in the wholesale financial markets  but not when referring to specific amounts  for example   Payment is accepted in sterling  but never  These cost five sterling   citation needed  The abbreviations  ster   or  stg   are sometimes used  The term British pound is commonly used in less formal contexts  although it is not an official name of the currency  A common slang term is quid  singular and plural  except in the common phrase  Quids in     The etymology of the term is unknown  although it might derive from the Latin  quid  and widely speculated to come from the Latin phrase  quid pro quo   9  There is some uncertainty as to the origin of the term  pound sterling   One source suggests it dates back to Anglo Saxon times  when coins called sterlings were minted from silver  240 of these sterlings weighed one pound  and large payments came to be made in  pounds of sterlings   10  Other references who    including the Oxford English Dictionary citation needed   say a sterling was a silver penny used in England by the Normans and date the term to around 1300  For more discussion of the etymology of  sterling   see Sterling silver  The currency sign is the pound sign      which is usually written with a single cross bar  as on sterling bank notes  though a version with a double cross bar     is also sometimes seen  The pound sign derives from the black letter  L   an abbreviation of Librae in Roman  sd units  librae  solidi  denarii  used for pounds  shillings and pence in the British pre decimal duodecimal currency system  Libra was the basic Roman unit of weight  derived from the Latin word for scales or balance  The ISO 4217 currency code is GBP  Occasionally  the abbreviation UKP is used but this is incorrect because the ISO 3166 country code for  the United Kingdom of  Great Britain and Northern Ireland is GB  see Terminology of the British Isles Terminology in detail   The Crown dependencies use their own  non ISO  codes  GGP  Guernsey pound   JEP  Jersey pound  and IMP  Isle of Man pound   Stocks are often traded in pence  so traders may refer to pence sterling  GBX  sometimes GBp   when listing stock prices   edit  Subdivisions and other units  edit  Decimal coinage Since decimalisation in 1971  see Decimal Day   the pound has been divided into 100 pence  until 1981 described on the coinage as  new pence    The symbol for the penny is  p   hence an amount such as 50p   0 50  properly pronounced  fifty pence  is more colloquially  quite often  pronounced  fifty pee   This also helped to distinguish between new and old pence amounts during the changeover to the decimal system  A decimal halfpenny was issued until 1984   edit  Pre decimal The Mad Hatter s hat shows an example of the old pre decimal system  the hat costs half a guinea  10 shillings and 6 pence  Prior to decimalisation  the pound was divided into 20 shillings and each shilling into 12 pence  making 240 pence to the pound  The symbol for the shilling was  s   not from the first letter of the word  but from the Latin solidus  The symbol for the penny was  d    from the French denier  from the Latin denarius  the solidus and denarius were Roman coins   A mixed sum of shillings and pence  such as 3 shillings and 6 pence  was written as  3 6  or  3s  6d   and spoken as  three and six   except for  1 1    2 1  etc   which were spoken as  one and a penny    two and a penny   etc    5 shillings was written as  5s   or  more commonly   5     The stroke     indicating shillings is also known as a solidus and was originally an adaptation of the long s which represented that word  Various coin denominations had  and in some cases continue to have  special names such as crown  farthing  sovereign and guinea  See Coins of the pound sterling and List of British coins and banknotes for details  By the 1950s  coins of George III  George IV and William IV had disappeared from circulation  but coins  at least the penny  bearing the head of any British king or queen from Queen Victoria onwards could be found in circulation  Silver coins were replaced by those in cupro nickel in 1947 and by the 1960s the silver coins were rarely seen  Silver cupro nickel shillings  from any period after 1816  and florins  2 shillings  remained as legal tender after decimalisation  as 5p and 10p respectively   the sixpences of 1816 and after remained legal tender until 1980  as two and a half new pence    edit  History The pound sterling is the world s oldest currency still in use  11   edit  Anglo Saxon Main article  Anglo Saxon pound A pound   20 shillings   240 silver pennies  formerly  The pound was a unit of account in Anglo Saxon England  equal to 240 silver pennies and equivalent to one pound weight of silver  It evolved into the modern British currency  the pound sterling  The accounting system of 4 farthings   1 penny  12 pence   1 shilling  20 shillings   1 pound was adopted from that introduced by Charlemagne to the Frankish Empire  see French livre   The origins of sterling lie in the reign of King Offa of Mercia   757 96  who introduced the silver penny  It copied the denarius of the new currency system of Charlemagne s Frankish Empire  As in the Carolingian system  240 pennies weighed 1 pound  corresponding to Charlemagne s libra   with the shilling corresponding to Charlemagne s solidus and equal to 12d  At the time of the penny s introduction  it weighed 22 5 troy grains of fine silver  32 tower grains  about 1 5 g   indicating that the Mercian pound weighed 5 400 troy grains  the Mercian pound became the basis of the tower pound  which weighed 5 400 troy grains  equivalent to 7 680 tower grains   At this time  the name sterling had yet to be acquired  The penny swiftly spread throughout the other Anglo Saxon kingdoms and became the standard coin of what was to become England   edit  Medieval The early pennies were struck from fine silver  as pure as was available   However  in 1158  a new coinage was introduced by King Henry II  known as the Tealby penny  which was struck from  925  92 5   silver  This became the standard until the 20th century and is today known as sterling silver  named after its association with the currency  Sterling silver is harder than the  999  99 9   fine silver that was traditionally used and so sterling silver coins did not wear down as rapidly as fine silver coins  The English currency was almost exclusively silver until 1344  when the gold noble was successfully introduced into circulation  However  silver remained the legal basis for sterling until 1816  In the reign of Henry IV  1399 1413   the penny was reduced in weight to 15 grains  0 97 g  of silver  with a further reduction to 12 grains  0 78 g  in 1464   edit  Tudor During the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI  the silver coinage was drastically debased  although the pound was redefined to the troy pound of 5 760 grains  373 g  in 1526  In 1544  a silver coinage was issued containing just one third silver and two thirds copper equating to  333 silver  or 33 3  pure  The result was a coin copper in appearance  but relatively pale in colour  In 1552  a new silver coinage was introduced  struck in sterling silver  However  the penny s weight was reduced to 8 grains  0 52 g   meaning that 1 troy pound of sterling silver produced 60 shillings of coins  This silver standard was known as the  60 shilling standard  and lasted until 1601 when a  62 shilling standard  was introduced  reducing the penny s weight to 7 23 31 grains  0 50 g   Throughout this period  the size and value of the gold coinage fluctuated considerably   edit  Unofficial gold standard In 1663  a new gold coinage was introduced based on the 22 carat fine guinea  Fixed in weight at 44  to the troy pound from 1670  this coin s value varied considerably until 1717  when it was fixed at 21 shillings  21    1 05 pounds   12  However  despite the efforts of Sir Isaac Newton  Master of the Mint  to reduce the guinea s value  this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver when compared to the valuations in other European countries  British merchants sent silver abroad in payments whilst goods for export were paid for with gold  As a consequence  silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in  leading to a situation where Great Britain was effectively on a gold standard  In addition  a chronic shortage of silver coins developed  citation needed   This shortage was aggravated by the fact that silver was the only commodity accepted by China for exporting goods during this period  From the mid 17th century  around 28 million kilograms  62 million pounds  of silver was received by China  principally from European powers  in exchange for Chinese goods  see 1 3 British trade and the Canton System in Opium Wars  edit  Establishment of modern currency The Bank of England was formed in 1694  followed by the Bank of Scotland a year later  Both began to issue paper money   edit  Currency of the United Kingdom The pound scots had begun equal to sterling but had suffered far higher devaluation until being pegged to sterling at a value of 12 pounds scots   1 pound sterling  In 1707  the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland merged to form the Kingdom of Great Britain  In accordance with the Treaty of Union  the currency of the  united kingdom  was sterling with the pound scots being replaced by sterling at the pegged value  The Irish pound was replaced by sterling in January 1826 at the value 13 Irish pounds   12 pound sterling   edit  Gold standard During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars  Bank of England notes were legal tender and their value floated relative to gold  The Bank also issued silver tokens to alleviate the shortage of silver coins  In 1816  the gold standard was adopted officially  with the silver standard reduced to 66 shillings  66     3 6s   rendering silver coins a  token  issue  i e   not containing their value in precious metal   In 1817  the sovereign was introduced  valued at 20 shillings  Struck in 22 carat gold  it contained 113 grains  7 3 g  of gold and replaced the guinea as the standard British gold coin without changing the gold standard  In 1825  the Irish pound  which had been pegged to sterling since 1801 at a rate of 13 Irish pounds   12 pounds sterling  was replaced  at the same rate  with sterling  During the late 19th and early 20th centuries  many other countries adopted the gold standard  As a consequence  conversion rates between different currencies could be determined simply from the respective gold standards  The pound sterling was equal to 4 85 U S  dollars  5 25 Canadian dollars  12 10 Dutch guilders  26 28 French francs  or equivalent currencies in the Latin Monetary Union   20 43 German Marks or 24 02 Austro Hungarian Krones  Discussions took place following the International Monetary Conference of 1867 in Paris concerning the possibility of the UK joining the Latin Monetary Union  and a Royal Commission on International Coinage examined the issues  13  resulting in a decision against joining monetary union  The gold standard was suspended at the outbreak of the war in 1914  with Bank of England and Treasury notes becoming legal tender  Prior to World War I  the United Kingdom had one of the world s strongest economies  holding 40  of the world s overseas investments  However  by the end of the war the country owed  850 million   30 7 billion as of 2012   14  mostly to the United States  with interest costing the country some 40  of all government spending  In an attempt to resume stability  a variation on the gold standard was reintroduced in 1925  under which the currency was fixed to gold at its pre war peg  although people were only able to exchange their currency for gold bullion  rather than for coins  This was abandoned on 21 September 1931  during the Great Depression  and sterling suffered an initial devaluation of some 25   15   edit  Use in the Empire Main article  Sterling Area Sterling circulated in much of the British Empire  In some parts  it was used alongside local currencies  For example  the gold sovereign was legal tender in Canada despite the use of the Canadian dollar  Several colonies and dominions adopted the pound as their own currency  These included Australia  Barbados  16 British West Africa  Cyprus  Fiji  the Irish Free State  Jamaica  New Zealand  South Africa and Southern Rhodesia  Some of these retained parity with sterling throughout their existence  e g  the South African pound   whilst others deviated from parity after the end of the gold standard  e g  the Australian pound   These currencies and others tied to sterling constituted the Sterling Area   edit  Bretton Woods See also  Economic history of the UK  1945 59 In 1940  an agreement with the U S A  pegged the pound to the U S  dollar at a rate of  1    4 03   Only the year before  it had been  4 86   17  This rate was maintained through the Second World War and became part of the Bretton Woods system which governed post war exchange rates  Under continuing economic pressure  and despite months of denials that it would do so  on 19 September 1949 the government devalued the pound by 30 5  to  2 80  The move prompted several other currencies to be devalued against the dollar  In 1961  1964 and 1966  the pound came under renewed pressure since the exchange rate against the dollar was considered too high  In the summer of 1966  with the value of the pound falling in the currency markets  exchange controls were tightened by the Wilson government  Among the measures  tourists were banned from taking more than  50 out of the country  until the restriction was lifted in 1979  The pound was eventually devalued by 14 3  to  2 40 on 18 November 1967   edit  Decimalisation Main article  Decimal Day On 15 February 1971  the UK decimalised  replacing the shilling and penny with a single subdivision  the new penny  The word  new  was omitted from coins after 1981   edit  Free floating pound With the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system  the pound floated from August 1971 onwards  It at first appreciated a little  rising to almost  2 65 in March 1972  from 2 42 when it had been fixed  The Sterling Area effectively ended at this time when the majority of its members also chose to float freely against the pound and the dollar   edit  1976 sterling crisis James Callaghan came to power in 1976  He was immediately told the economy was facing huge problems  according to documents released in 2006 by the National Archives  18  The effects of the 1973 oil crisis were still being felt  with inflation rising to over 27  in 1975  19  Financial markets were beginning to believe the pound was overvalued and in April of that year The Wall Street Journal advised the sale of sterling investments in a story titled  Good bye Great Britain   At the time the UK government was running a budget deficit and Labour s strategy emphasised high public spending  Callaghan was told there were three possible outcomes  a disastrous free fall in Sterling  an internationally unacceptable siege economy or a deal with key allies to prop up the pound while painful economic reforms were put in place  The US government feared the crisis could endanger NATO and the EEC and in light of this the US Treasury set out to force domestic policy changes  In November 1976 the IMF announced the conditions for a loan  including deep cuts in public expenditure  20   edit  1979 1989 The Conservatives arrived in power in 1979  on a programme of fiscal austerity  Initially  the pound rocketed  moving above the  2 40 level  as interest rates rose in response to the monetarist policy of targeting money supply  The high exchange rate was widely blamed for the deep recession of 1981  Sterling fell sharply after 1980  at its lowest  the pound stood at just  1 03 in March 1985  before returning to the US 1 70 level in December 1989   edit  Following the Deutsche Mark In 1988  Margaret Thatcher s Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson decided that the pound should  shadow  the West German Deutsche Mark  with the unintended result of a rapid rise in inflation as the economy boomed due to inappropriately low interest rates   For ideological reasons  the Conservative Government declined to use alternative mechanisms to control the explosion of credit  For this reason  former Prime Minister Edward Heath referred to Lawson as a  one club golfer    21  Following German re unification in 1990  the reverse held true  as high borrowing costs to fund Eastern reconstruction  a need exacerbated by the political choice to make the Ostmark equivalent to the Deutsche Mark  DM   meant rates in other countries shadowing the DM  especially the UK  were far too high relative to domestic circumstances  leading to a housing decline and recession   edit  Following the European Currency Unit On 8 October 1990 the Conservative government decided to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism  ERM   with the pound set at DM2 95  However  the country was forced to withdraw from the system on  Black Wednesday   16 September 1992  as Britain s economic performance made the exchange rate unsustainable  Speculator George Soros famously made approximately US 1 billion from shorting the pound   Black Wednesday  saw interest rates jump from 10  to 15  in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the pound from falling below the ERM limits  The exchange rate fell to DM2 20  Proponents who   of a lower GBP DM exchange rate were vindicated as the cheaper pound encouraged exports and contributed to the economic prosperity of the 1990s  citation needed   edit  Following inflation targets In 1997  the newly elected Labour government handed over day to day control of interest rates to the Bank of England  a policy that had originally been advocated by the Liberal Democrats   22  The Bank is now responsible for setting its base rate of interest so as to keep inflation in the Consumer Price Index  CPI  very close to 2   Should CPI inflation be more than one percentage point above or below the target  the governor of the Bank of England is required to write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining the reasons for this and the measures which will be taken to bring this measure of inflation back in line with the 2  target  On 17 April 2007  CPI inflation was reported at 3 1   inflation of the Retail Prices Index was 4 8    Accordingly  and for the first time  the Governor had to write publicly to the government explaining why inflation was more than one percentage point higher than its target  23   edit  Euro Main article  United Kingdom and the euro As a member of the European Union  the United Kingdom could adopt the Euro as its currency  However  the subject remains politically controversial  Gordon Brown  then Chancellor of the Exchequer  ruled out membership for the foreseeable future  saying that the decision not to join had been right for Britain and for Europe  24  The government of former Prime Minister Tony Blair had pledged to hold a public referendum to decide on membership should  five economic tests  be met  to ensure that adoption of the euro would be in the national interest  In addition to these internal  national  criteria  the UK would have to meet the EU s economic convergence criteria  Maastricht criteria   before being allowed to adopt the euro  The Conservative Liberal Democrat coalition ruled out joining the euro for the parliamentary term  Currently  the UK s annual government deficit  as a percentage of the GDP  is above the defined threshold  In February 2005  55  of British citizens were against adopting the currency  with 30  in favour  25  The idea of replacing the pound with the euro has been controversial with the British public  partly because of the pound s identity as a symbol of British sovereignty 26  and because it would  according to critics  lead to suboptimal interest rates  harming the British economy  In December 2008 the results of a BBC poll of 1000 people suggested that 71  would vote no  23  would vote yes to joining the European single currency  while 6  said they were unsure  27  The pound did not join the Second European Exchange Rate Mechanism  ERM II  after the Euro was created  Denmark and the UK have opt outs from entry to the Euro  Technically  every other EU nation must eventually sign up  The Scottish Conservative Party claims that there is an issue for Scotland in that the adoption of the Euro would mean the end of regionally distinctive banknotes  as the Euro banknotes do not have national designs  28  The Scottish National Party have not yet confirmed what the national currency of Scotland would be should Independence be realised  On 1 January 2008 the British sovereign bases on Cyprus  Akrotiri and Dhekelia  began using the Euro  along with the rest of the Republic of Cyprus   29

fluctuate in value against one another  although there may be correlation between movements in their respective exchange rates with other currencies such as the US dollar  Inflation concerns in the UK led the Bank of England to raise interest rates in late 2006 and 2007  This caused the pound to appreciate against other major currencies and  with the US dollar depreciating at the same time  the pound hit a 15 year high against the US dollar on 18 April 2007  reaching US 2 the day before  for the first time since 1992  32  The pound and many other currencies continued to appreciate against the dollar  sterling hit a 26 year high of US 2 1161 on 7 November 2007 as the dollar fell worldwide  From mid 2003 to mid 2007  the Pound Euro rate remained rangebound  within   5   of  1 45  33  Following the global financial crisis in late 2008  however  the pound has since depreciated at one of the fastest rates in history  reaching a 24 year low of  1 35 per  1 on 23 January 2009 34  and falling below  1 25 against the Euro in April 2008  35  A further decline was seen during the remainder of 2008  most dramatically in December when its Euro rate hit an all time low at  1 0219  29th   36  while its US dollar rate depreciated to  1 37 on 24 January 2009  37  The Pound appreciated in early 2009 reaching a peak against the Euro in mid July of  1 17  The following months the pound remained broadly steady against the Euro  with the Pound s current  27 May 2011  value at  1 15 and US 1 65  On 5 March 2009  the Bank of England had announced that they would pump  75 billion of new capital into the British economy  through a process known as quantitative easing  This was the first time in the United Kingdom s history that this measure has been used  although the Bank s Governor Mervyn King suggested it was not an experiment  38  The process had seen the Bank of England creating new money for itself  which it then had used to purchase assets such as government bonds  bank loans  or mortgages  39  The initial amount stated to be created through this method had been  75 billion  although Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling had given permission for up to  150 billion to be created if necessary  40  It had been expected the process likely to occur over a period of three months with results only likely in the long term  38  By 5 November 2009  some  175 billion had been injected using quantitative easing and the effectiveness of the process remained less successful in the long term   edit  Annual inflation rate The Bank of England had stated  2009  that the decision had been taken to prevent the rate of inflation falling below the two percent target rate 39  Mervyn King  the Governor of the Bank of England  also had suggested there were no other monetary options left as interest rates have already been cut to their lowest level ever  0 5   and it was unlikely that they would be cut further  40  The 2009 moves are history  the current inflation rate per annum is estimated roughly 5  for October 2011 after 5 2  in September 2011   edit  Coins Main article  Coins of the pound sterling  edit  Pre decimal coins The silver penny  plural  pence  abbreviation  d  was the principal and often sole coin in circulation from the 8th century until 13th century  Although some fractions of the penny were struck  see farthing and halfpenny   it was more common to find pennies cut into halves and quarters to provide smaller change  Very few gold coins were struck  with the gold penny  worth 20 silver pence  a rare example  However  in 1279  the groat  worth 4d was introduced  with the half groat following in 1344  1344 also saw the establishment of a gold coinage with the introduction  after the failed gold florin  of the noble worth six shillings and eight pence   6 8    i e  3 to the pound   together with the half and quarter noble  Reforms in 1464 saw a reduction in value of the coinage in both silver and gold  with the noble renamed the ryal and worth 10    i e  2 to the pound  and the angel introduced at the noble s old value of 6 8  The reign of Henry VII saw the introduction of two important coins  the shilling  abbr   s  known as the testoon  in 1487 and the pound  known as the sovereign  abbr     or L  in 1489  In 1526  several new denominations of gold coins were added  including the crown and half crown worth five shillings  5     and two shillings and six pence  2 6  two and six  respectively  Henry VIII s reign  1509 1547  saw a high level of debasement which continued into the reign of Edward VI  1547 1553   However  this debasement was halted in 1552 and a new silver coinage was introduced  including coins for 1d  2d  3d  4d and 6d  1    2 6 and 5    The reign of Elizabeth I  1558 1603  saw the addition of silver  d and 1 d coins  although these denominations did not last  Gold coins included the half crown  crown  angel  half sovereign and sovereign  Elizabeth s reign also saw the introduction of the horse drawn screw press to produce the first  milled  coins  Following the succession of the Scottish King James VI to the English throne  a new gold coinage was introduced  including the spur ryal  15     the unite  20    and the rose ryal  30     The laurel  worth 20    followed in 1619  The first base metal coins were also introduced  tin and copper farthings  Copper halfpenny coins followed in the reign of Charles I  During the English Civil War  a number of siege coinages were produced  often in unusual denominations  Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660  the coinage was reformed  with the ending of production of hammered coins in 1662  The guinea was introduced in 1663  soon followed by the    2 and 5 guinea coins  The silver coinage consisted of denominations of 1d  2d  3d  4d and 6d  1    2 6 and 5    Due to the widespread export of silver in the 18th century  the production of silver coins gradually came to a halt  with the half crown and crown not issued after the 1750s  the 6d pence and 1   stopping production in the 1780s  One response was the introduction of the copper 1d and 2d coins and the gold   guinea  7    in 1797  The copper penny was the only one of these coins to survive long  To alleviate the shortage of silver coins  between 1797 and 1804  the Bank of England counterstamped Spanish dollars  8 reales  and other Spanish and Spanish colonial coins for circulation  A small counterstamp of the King s head was used  Until 1800  these circulated at a rate of 4 9 for 8 reales  After 1800  a rate of 5   for 8 reales was used  The Bank then issued silver tokens for 5    struck over Spanish dollars  in 1804  followed by tokens for 1 6 and 3   between 1811 and 1816  In 1816  a new silver coinage was introduced in denominations of 6d  1    2 6  half crown  and 5    crown   The crown was only issued intermittently until 1900  It was followed by a new gold coinage in 1817 consisting of 10   and  1 coins  known as the half sovereign and sovereign  The silver 4d coin was reintroduced in 1836  followed by the 3d   thruppence   in 1838  with the 4d coin issued only for colonial use after 1855  In 1848  the 2   florin was introduced  followed by the short lived double florin in 1887  In 1860  copper was replaced by bronze in the farthing  quarter penny   d   halfpenny and penny  During the First World War  production of the half sovereign and sovereign was suspended and  although the gold standard was restored  the coins saw little circulation thereafter  In 1920  the silver standard  maintained at  925 since 1552  was reduced to  500  In 1937  a nickel brass 3d coin was introduced  the last silver 3d coins were issued seven years later  In 1947  the remaining silver coins were replaced with cupro nickel  Inflation caused the farthing to cease production in 1956 and be demonetised in 1960  In the run up to decimalisation  the halfpenny and half crown were demonetised in 1969   edit  Decimal coins  1 coin  Welsh design  2000  Elizabeth II Welsh dragon British coinage timeline  1968  The first decimal coins were introduced  These were cupro nickel 5p and 10p coins which were equivalent to and circulated alongside the 1   and 2   coins  1969  The curved equilateral heptagonal cupro nickel 50p coin replaced the 10   note  1971  The decimal coinage was completed when decimalisation came into effect in 1971 with the introduction of the bronze  p  1p and 2p coins and the withdrawal of the 1d and 3d coins  1980  Withdrawal of 6d coins  which had circulated at a value of 2 p  1982  The word  new  was dropped from the coinage and a 20p coin was introduced  1983  A  1 coin was introduced  1983  The  p coin was last produced  1984  The  p coin was demonetised 1990s  The 5p  10p and 50p coins became smaller  1991  The old 1   coins  which had continued to circulate with a value of 5p  were demonetised in 1991 after the 5p coin became smaller  1992  Bronze was replaced with copper plated steel 1993  The 2   coins were similarly demonetised  1998  The bi metallic  2 coin was introduced  2007  By now the value of copper in the pre 1992 1p 2p coins  which are 97  copper  exceeded the value to such an extent that melting down the coins by entrepreneurs was becoming worthwhile  with a premium of up to 11   with smelting costs reducing this to around 4   although this is illegal  and the market value of copper has subsequently fallen dramatically from these earlier peaks  At present  the oldest circulating coins in the U K  are the 1p and 2p copper coins introduced in 1971  Before decimalisation  change could contain coins aged one hundred years or more  with any of five monarchs  heads on the obverse  In April 2008 an extensive redesign of the coinage was unveiled  The new designs were issued gradually into circulation  starting in summer 2008  The new reverses of the 1p  2p  5p  10p  20p and 50p coins feature parts of the Royal Shield  and the new pound coin depicts the whole shield  The coins are of the same specifications as those with the old designs  which will continue to circulate    edit  Banknotes Main article  Banknotes of the pound sterling  10 Series E Bank of England note The first sterling notes were issued by the Bank of England shortly after its foundation in 1694  Denominations were initially written on the notes at the time of issue  From 1745  the notes were printed in denominations between  20 and  1000  with any odd shillings added in hand   10 notes were added in 1759  followed by  5 in 1793 and  1 and  2 in 1797  The lowest two denominations were withdrawn following the end of the Napoleonic wars  In 1855  the notes were converted to being entirely printed  with denominations of  5   10   20   50   100   200   300   500 and  1000 issued  A  20 note of the 2007 issue from the Bank of Scotland  The Bank of Scotland began issuing notes in 1695  Although the pound scots was still the currency of Scotland  these notes were denominated in sterling in values up to  100  From 1727  the Royal Bank of Scotland also issued notes  Both banks issued some notes denominated in guineas as well as pounds  In the 19th century  regulations limited the smallest note issued by Scottish banks to be the  1 denomination  a note not permitted in England  With the extension of sterling to Ireland in 1825  the Bank of Ireland began issuing sterling notes  later followed by other Irish banks  These notes included the unusual denominations of 30   and  3  The highest denomination issued by the Irish banks was  100  In 1826  banks at least 65 miles  105 km  from London were given permission to issue their own paper money  From 1844  new banks were excluded from issuing notes in England and Wales but not in Scotland and Ireland  Consequently  the number of private banknotes dwindled in England and Wales but proliferated in Scotland and Ireland  The last English private banknotes were issued in 1921  In 1914  the Treasury introduced notes for 10   and  1 to replace gold coins  These circulated until 1928  when they were replaced by Bank of England notes  Irish independence reduced the number of Irish banks issuing sterling notes to five operating in Northern Ireland  The Second World War had a drastic effect on the note production of the Bank of England  Fearful of mass forgery by the Nazis  see Operation Bernhard   all notes for  10 and above ceased production  leaving the bank to issue only 10     1 and  5 notes  Scottish and Northern Irish issues were unaffected  with issues in denominations of  1   5   10   20   50 and  100  The Bank of England reintroduced  10 notes in 1964  In 1969  the 10   note was replaced by the 50p coin as part of the preparation for decimalisation   20 Bank of England notes were reintroduced in 1970  followed by  50 in 1982  Following the introduction of the  1 coin in 1983  Bank of England  1 notes were withdrawn in 1988  Scottish and Northern Irish banks followed  with only the Royal Bank of Scotland continuing to issue this denomination  The  5 polymer banknote  issued by Northern Bank in 2000  is the only polymer note currently in circulation  although Northern Bank also produces paper based  10   20 and  50 notes and  interestingly  notes named  Titan   A Titan is a  100 000 000  one hundred million pound  bank note  41  of which there are only 40 in existence  Titans are only used within the banking system and are unobtainable by the general public   edit  Legal tender and regional issues Legal tender in the UK means  according to the Royal Mint   that a debtor cannot successfully be sued for non payment if he pays into court in legal tender   It does not mean that any ordinary transaction has to take place in legal tender or only within the amount denominated by the legislation  Both parties are free to agree to accept any form of payment whether legal tender or otherwise according to their wishes  In order to comply with the very strict rules governing an actual legal tender it is necessary  for example  actually to offer the exact amount due because no change can be demanded  Throughout the UK   1 and  2 coins are legal tender for any amount  with the other coins being legal tender only for limited amounts  In England and Wales  Bank of England notes are also legal tender for any amount citation needed   In Scotland and Northern Ireland  no banknotes are currently legal tender  although Bank of England 10   and  1 notes were legal tender  as were Scottish banknotes  during World War II  Currency  Defence  Act 1939  this status was withdrawn on 1 January 1946   However  the banks made deposits with the Bank of England to cover the bulk of their note issues  In the Channel Islands and Isle of Man  the local variations on the banknotes are legal tender in their respective jurisdictions  Scottish  Northern Irish  Channel Islands and Manx notes can be used anywhere in the UK as a means of payment  Guernsey  Jersey  the Isle of Man are in currency union with the United Kingdom and these currencies are not a separate currency from the British pound but are just a local issue of banknotes and coins denominated in pound sterling  It is legal for shopkeepers to choose to reject any payment  even if it would be legal tender in that jurisdiction  but not in their interest because no debt exists when the offer of payment is made at the same time as the offer of goods or services  When settling a restaurant bill after consuming the meal  or settling another debt  the laws of legal tender do apply and the payment can not be rejected  But usually any reasonable method of settling the debt  such as by credit card  will be accepted  Commemorative  5 and 25p  crown  coins  rarely seen in circulation  are legal tender  as are the bullion coins issued by the Mint  Coin Maximum usable as legal tender 42   5  post 1990 crown  unlimited  2 unlimited  1 unlimited 50p  10 25p  pre 1990 crown   10 20p  10 10p  5 5p  5 2p 20p 1p 20p Further  any coin or bank note ceases to be legal tender if it is 100  the amount of the debt  for example  offering a  20 note to settle a 20p debt    edit  Value In 2006  the House of Commons Library published a document 43  which included an index of prices in pounds for each year between 1750 and 2005  where 1974 was indexed at 100   This was an update of earlier documents published in 1998 and 2003   Regarding the period 1750 1914 the document states   Although there was considerable year on year fluctuation in price levels prior to 1914  reflecting the quality of the harvest  wars  etc   there was not the long term steady increase in prices associated with the period since 1945   It goes on to say that  Since 1945 prices have risen in every year with an aggregate rise of over 27 times   The value of the index in 1751 was 5 1  increasing to a peak of 16 3 in 1813 before declining very soon after the end of the Napoleonic Wars to around 10 0 and remaining in the range 8 5 10 0 at the end of the nineteenth century  The index was 9 8 in 1914 and peaked at 25 3 in 1920  before declining to 15 8 in 1933 and 1934 prices were only about three times as high as they had been 180 years earlier  44  Inflation had a dramatic effect during and after World War II the index was 20 2 in 1940  33 0 in 1950  49 1 in 1960  73 1 in 1970
