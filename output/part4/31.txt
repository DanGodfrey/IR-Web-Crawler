a prominent feature of the medieval period  The Middle Ages  adjectival form  medieval  mediaeval or medi val  is a periodization of European history  encompassing the period from the 5th century to the 15th century  The Middle Ages follows the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 and precedes the Early Modern Era  It is the middle period of a three period division of Western history  Classical  Medieval and Modern  The term  Middle Ages  first appears in Latin in the 15th century and reflects the view that this period was a deviation from the path of classical learning  a path that was later reconnected by Renaissance scholarship  In the Early Middle Ages the trends of the Late Antiquity  depopulation  deurbanization  and increased barbarian invasion  continued  North Africa and the Middle East  once part of the Eastern Roman Empire  became Islamic  Later in the period  the establishment of the feudal system allowed a move away from subsistence agriculture  There was sustained urbanization in Northern and Western Europe  During the High Middle Ages  c  1000 1300   Christian oriented art and architecture flourished and Crusades were mounted to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim control  The influence of the emerging nation state was tempered by the ideal of an international Christendom  The codes of chivalry and courtly love set rules for proper behavior  while the Scholastic philosophers attempted to reconcile faith and reason  Outstanding achievement in this period includes the Code of Justinian  the mathematics of Fibonacci and Oresme  the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas  the paintings of Giotto  the poetry of Dante and Chaucer  the travels of Marco Polo  and the architecture of Gothic cathedrals such as Chartres  Contents 1 Etymology and

periods in the most enduring scheme for analyzing European history  classical civilization  or Antiquity   the Middle Ages  and the modern period  1  It is  middle  in the sense of being between the two other periods in time  Humanists in the Renaissance argued that their scholarship restored direct links to the classical period  thus bypassing the Medieval period  The  Middle Ages  first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas  middle times   2  In early usage  there were many variants  including medium aevum  Middle Age   first recorded in 1604  2  and media scecula  Middle Ages   first recorded in 1625  3  English is the only major language that retains the plural form  3  Development of concept Medieval historians did not think of themselves as being in the middle of history  Instead  they wrote history from a universal and theological perspective  They divided history into periods such as the  Six Ages  or the  Four Empires   with their period being the last before the end of the world  They considered the Roman period  especially the time of the Apostles  an historical peak  followed by a long slide toward the Apocalypse  4  In the 1330s  the humanist and poet Petrarch referred to pre Christian times as antiqua  ancient  and to the Christian period as nova  new   4  While retaining the theme of decline from the apogee of ancient Rome  Petrarch s division was not based on theology  but on a perception of cultural and political decline  especially the idea that Medieval Latin was inferior to Classical Latin  5  From Petrarch s Italian perspective  this new period  which included his own time  was an age of national eclipse  5  Leonardo Bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodization in his History of the Florentine People  1442   6  Bruni s first two periods were based on those of Petrarch  but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline  Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire  1439 1453   Tripartite periodization became standard after the German historian Christoph Cellarius published Universal History Divided into an Ancient  Medieval  and New Period  1683   Start and end dates The most commonly given start date for the Middle Ages is 476  7  first used by Bruni  6  This was when Romulus Augustus  the last Roman emperor in the West  abdicated  The western empire had already lost its military power by this time and Romulus Augustus was only a puppet emperor  so many historians object that this convention ascribes undue significance to an arbitrary year  In contrast  Biondo used the sack of Rome in 410 by the Goths as the beginning of the period  4  In the history of Scandinavia  the Middle Ages followed prehistory during the 11th century  when the rulers converted to Christianity and substantial written records began to appear  A similar shift from prehistory to the Middle Ages occurred in Estonia and Latvia during the 13th century  For Europe as a whole  the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453 is commonly used as the end date of the Middle Ages  Depending on the context  other events  such as the invention of the moveable type printing press by Johann Gutenberg around 1455  the fall of Muslim Granada in Spain or Christopher Columbus s voyage to America  both 1492   can be used  For Italy  1401  the year the contract was awarded to build the north doors of the Florence Baptistery  is often used  citation needed  In contrast  English historians often use the Battle of Bosworth Field  1485  to mark the end of the period  8  For Spain  the death of King Ferdinand II  1516   of Queen Isabella I of Castile  1504  or otherwise the conquest of Granada  1492  is often used  9  Subdivisions Historians in the Romance languages tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts  an earlier  High  and later  Low  period  English speaking historians  following their German counterparts  generally subdivide the Middle Ages into three intervals   Early    High  and  Late   1  Belgian historian Henri Pirenne and Dutch historian Johan Huizinga popularized the following subdivisions in the early 20th century  the Early Middle Ages  476 1000   the High Middle Ages  1000 1300   and the Late Middle Ages  1300 1453   In the 19th century  the entire Middle Ages were often referred to as the  Dark Ages   5  a  But with the creation of these subdivisions use of this term was restricted to the Early Middle Ages  at least among historians  5  Timeline The later Roman Empire Main articles  Late Antiquity  Decline of the Roman Empire  Migration Period  and Byzantine Empire The Roman empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD with the following two centuries witnessing the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories  10  Economic issues  including inflation  and external pressures on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century unstable politically  with a number of different emperors coming to the throne and then being replaced by new usurpers  11  Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century  mainly in response to the need to defend against the renewed war with Sassanid Persia  which began in the middle of the 3rd century  The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in the number the curial landowning class  with increasing numbers of the members of that class being unwilling to shoulder the burdens of office holding in their native towns  12  A late Roman statue depicting the four Tetrarchs  now located in Venice  In the late 3rd and early 4th century  the Emperor Diocletian split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286  although the empire was not considered divided  as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other  13  b  After a period of civil war  in 330 Constantine refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital  Constantinople  14  Diocletian s reforms created a strong governmental bureaucracy  reformed taxation  and strengthened the army  These reforms bought the Empire time  but did not solve completely solve the problems the empire was facing  which included excessive taxation  a declining birthrate  and pressures on the frontiers  15  Civil war between different emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century  and the need for military forces to fight against rival emperors led to a weakening of frontier forces  with barbarian forces penetrating past the frontiers  16  Map of territorial boundaries ca  450 AD In 376  the Ostrogoths  fleeing from the Huns  received permission from the Roman emperor Valens to settle in the Roman province of Thracia  But the settlement did not go smoothly  and when Roman officials mishandled the situation  they began to raid and plunder Thracia  Valens  attempting to put down the disorder  was killed in battle with the Ostrogoths at the Battle of Adrianople on 9 August 378  17  Besides the barbarian threat from the north  internal divisions within the empire  especially within the Christian Church  caused troubles  18  In 400  the Visigoths  invaded the western empire  and although briefly forced back from Italy  in 410 they were able to sack the city of Rome  19  While the Visigoths were invading  in 406 the Alans  Vandals  and Suevi crossed into Gaul and over the next three years  they crossed across Gaul and in 409 arrived across the Pyrenees Mountains into modern day Spain  20  Other groups of barbarians took part in the movements of peoples in this time period  The Franks  Alemanni  and the Burgundians eventually all ended up in northern Gaul while the Angles  Saxons  and Jutes settled in Britain  21  In the 430s  the Huns were added to the mix  with their king Attila leading invasions into the Balkans in 442 and 447  into Gaul in 451  and into Italy in 452  22  With Attila s death in 453  the Hunnic confederation he led fell apart  23  All of these invasions by the varied tribes totally redid the political and demographic face of what had been the western Roman empire  21  By the end of the 5th century  the western empire was divided into smaller political units ruled by the tribes that had invaded in the early part of the century  24  The last emperor of the west  Romulus Augustulus  was deposed in 476  making this year the traditional date of the ending of the western empire  c  25  The Eastern Roman Empire  conventionally referred to as the  Byzantine Empire  after the fall of its western counterpart  had little ability to assert control over the lost western territories  Even though Byzantine emperors maintained a claim over the territory  and no  barbarian  king dared to elevate himself to the position of Emperor of the West  Byzantine control of most of the West could not be sustained  the renovatio imperii   imperial restoration   entailing reconquest of the Italian peninsula and Mediterranean periphery  by Justinian was the sole  and temporary  exception  26  Early Middle Ages Main article  Early Middle Ages The Book of Kells is one of the most famous artworks of the Early Middle Ages  New societies Although the political structure in western Europe had changed  the break was not as extensive as historians have claimed in the past  The emperors of the fifth century were often controlled by military men   such as Stilicho  Ricimer  Gundobad  or Aspar   and when western emperors ceased to be  many of the kings who replaced the emperor were from the same background as the military strongmen who had previously controlled the emperors  Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common  27  This led to a fusion of the Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes  including the popular assemblies which led to a direct influence of more of the free male tribal members in political society  28  Material remains of the Romans and the invaders were often similar  with the tribal items often being obviously modeled on Roman items  29  Similarly  much of the intellectual culture of the new kingdoms was directly based on Roman intellectual traditions  30  An important difference  however  was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities  Many of the new political entities no longer provided for their armies with tax revenues  but instead allocated lands or rents from lands to support the military forces  This change meant that there was less need for large tax revenues which meant that taxation systems decayed  31  Between the 5th and 8th centuries in western Europe  new peoples and powerful individuals filled the political void left by Roman centralized government  30  The Ostrogoths settled in Italy in the late fifth century under Theodoric and set up a kingdom marked by its cooperation between the Italians and the Ostrogoths  at least until the last years of Theodoric s reign  32  The Burgundians settled in Gaul  and after an earlier kingdom was destroyed by the Huns in 436 they formed a new kingdom in the 440s between modern day Geneva and Lyons  This grew to be a powerful kingdom in the late 5th and early 6th centuries  33  In northern Gaul  the Franks and Britons  set up small kingdoms  The Frankish kingdom was centered in northeastern Gaul and the first king of whom much is known is Childeric  who died in 481  d  Under Childeric s son Clovis  the Frankish kingdom expanded and converted to Christianity  The Britons  related to the natives of Britannia  settled in what is now Brittany  which took its name from their settlement  35  Other kingdoms were established by the Visigoths in Spain  the Suevi in northwestern Spain  and the Vandals in North Africa  33  Byzantine survival At the same time that western Europe was witnessing the formation of new kingdoms  the eastern section of the Empire remained intact and even enjoyed an economic revival that lasted into the early seventh century  There were less invasions of the eastern section of the empire  with most of those occurring in the Balkans  Peace with Persia  the traditional enemy of Rome  lasted throughout most of the 5th century  The eastern empire was marked by a much closer relationship between the political state and the Christian church  with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in western Europe  Legal developments included the codification of Roman law known as the Theodosian Code  36  Under the emperor Justinian  reigned 527 565   a further compilation took place  known as the Corpus Juris Civilis  37  Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths  But the conquest of Italy was not complete  and a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 meant that the rest of Justinian s reign was concentrated on defensive measures rather than further conquests  38  A further complication for the eastern empire was the slow infiltration of the Balkans by the Slavs  originally small invasions but by the late 540s Slavic tribes were in Thrace and Illyrium  defeating an imperial army near Adrianople in 551  In the 560s the Avars began to expand from their base on the north bank of the Danube River  By the end of the 6th century they were the dominant power in Central Europe and were routinely able to force the eastern emperors to give them tribute  They remained a strong power until 796  39  Further complications were the involvement of the emperor Maurice in Persian politics when he intervened in a succession dispute  This led to a period of peace but when Maurice was overthrown in turn  the Persians invaded and during the reign of the emperor Heraclius  reigned 610 641  managed to control large chunks of the empire  including Egypt  Syria  and Asia Minor  Heraclius was eventually able to secure a peace treaty with the Persians in 628 that restored the earlier boundaries of the empire  40  Religious ferment and Islam Main article  Muslim conquests Religious beliefs in the eastern empire and Persia were in flux during the late 6th and early 7th century  Judaism was an active missionary faith in this time period  with at least one Arab political leader converting to Judaism  Christianity also had active missions that competed with the Persian s Zoroastrianism in seeking to gain converts  especially amongst the residents of the Arabian peninsula  All of these strands came together in emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad  41  After Muhammad s death in 632  Islamic forces went on to conquer much of the eastern Empire as well as Persia  starting with Syria in 634 635 and extending to Egypt in 640 641  Persia in between 637 and 642  North Africa in the later 7th century  and Spain in 711  42  By the middle of the 8th century  new trading patterns were emerging in the Mediterranean  with trade between the Franks  the Arabs  and the Byzantines replacing the old Roman patterns of trade  Franks traded timber  furs  swords and slaves to the Arabs in return for silks and other fabrics  spices  and precious metals  43  Church and monasticism Christianity was a major unifying factor between Eastern and Western Europe prior to the Arab conquests  but the conquest of North Africa sundered the connections  Increasingly  the Byzantine Church  which became the Orthodox Church  differed in language  practices  and liturgy from the western Church  which became the Catholic Church  The eastern church used Greek instead of the western Latin language  Theological and political differences emerged  and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as iconoclasm  clerical marriage  and state control of the church had widened enough that the cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities  44  Bishops were central to Middle Age society due to the literacy they possessed  As a result  they often played a significant role in governance  However  beyond the core areas of Western Europe  there remained many peoples with little or no contact with Christianity or with classical Roman culture  Martial societies such as the Avars and the Vikings were still capable of causing major disruption to the newly emerging societies of Western Europe  The Early Middle Ages witnessed the rise of monasticism within the West  The shape of European monasticism was determined by traditions and ideas that originated in the deserts of Egypt and Syria  The style of monasticism that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life  called cenobitism  was pioneered by the saint Pachomius in the 4th century  Monastic ideals spread from Egypt to Western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries through hagiographical literature such as the Life of Saint Anthony  45  Saint Benedict wrote the definitive Rule for Western monasticism during the 6th century  detailing the administrative and spiritual responsibilities of a community of monks led by an abbot  46  The style of monasticism based upon the Benedictine Rule spread widely rapidly across Europe  replacing small clusters of cenobites  Monks and monasteries had a deep effect upon the religious and political life of the Early Middle Ages  in various cases acting as land trusts for powerful families  centres of propaganda and royal support in newly conquered regions  bases for mission  and proselytization  In addition  they were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region  Carolingians Main articles  Frankish Empire  Carolingian Empire  and Government of the Carolingian Empire The coronation of Charlemagne depicted in the 14th century Grandes Chroniques de France A nucleus of power unfolded in a region of northern Gaul and developed into kingdoms called Austrasia and Neustria  These kingdoms were ruled for three centuries by a dynasty of kings called the Merovingians  after their mythical founder Merovech  The history of the Merovingian kingdoms is one of family politics that frequently erupted into civil warfare between the branches of the family  The legitimacy of the Merovingian throne was granted by a reverence for the bloodline  and  even after powerful members of the Austrasian court  the mayors of the palace  took de facto power during the 7th century  the Merovingians were kept as ceremonial figureheads  The Merovingians engaged in trade with northern Europe through Baltic trade routes known to historians as the Northern Arc trade  and they are known to have minted small denomination silver pennies called sceattae for circulation  Aspects of Merovingian culture could be described as  Romanized   such as the high value placed on Roman coinage as a symbol of rulership and the patronage of monasteries and bishoprics  Some have hypothesized that the Merovingians were in contact with Byzantium  The Merovingians also buried the dead of their elite families in grave mounds and traced their lineage to a mythical sea beast called the Quinotaur  47  The 7th century was a tumultuous period of civil wars between Austrasia and Neustria  Such warfare was exploited by the patriarch of a family line  Pippin of Landen  who curried favour with the Merovingians and had himself installed in the office of Mayor of the Palace at the service of the King  From this position of great influence  Pippin accrued wealth and supporters  Later members of his family line inherited the office  acting as advisors and regents  The dynasty took a new direction in 732  when Charles Martel won the Battle of Tours  halting the advance of Muslim armies across the Pyrenees  Costumes of serfs or slaves  Approximately 10 20  of the rural population of Carolingian Europe consisted of serfs and slaves  The Carolingian dynasty  as the successors to Charles Martel are known  officially took control of the kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria in a coup of 753 led by Pippin III  A contemporary chronicle claims that Pippin sought  and gained  authority for this coup from the Pope  48  Pippin s successful coup was reinforced with propaganda that portrayed the Merovingians as inept or cruel rulers and exalted the accomplishments of Charles Martel and circulated stories of the family s great piety  At the time of his death in 783  Pippin left his kingdoms in the hands of his two sons  Charles and Carloman  When Carloman died of natural causes  Charles blocked the succession of Carloman s minor son and installed himself as the king of the united Austrasia and Neustria  This Charles  known to his contemporaries as Charles the Great or Charlemagne  embarked in 774 upon a program of systematic expansion that would unify a large portion of Europe  In the wars that lasted just beyond 800  he rewarded loyal allies with war booty and command over parcels of land  Much of the nobility of the High Middle Ages was to claim its roots in the Carolingian nobility that was generated during this period of expansion  48  Charlemagne s cathedral at Aachen built 792 805 AD The Imperial Coronation of Charlemagne on Christmas Day of 800 is frequently regarded as a turning point in medieval history  because it filled a power vacancy that had existed since 476  It also marks a change in Charlemagne s leadership  which assumed a more imperial character and tackled difficult aspects of controlling an empire  He established a system of diplomats who possessed imperial authority  the missi  who in theory provided access to imperial justice in the farthest corners of the empire  e  He also sought to reform the Church in his domains  pushing for uniformity in liturgy and material culture  Carolingian Renaissance Main article  Carolingian Renaissance Charlemagne s court in Aachen was the centre of a cultural revival that is sometimes referred to as the  Carolingian Renaissance   This period witnessed an increase of literacy  developments in the arts  architecture  and jurisprudence  as well as liturgical and scriptural studies  The English monk Alcuin was invited to Aachen  and brought with him the precise classical Latin education that was available in the monasteries of Northumbria  The return of this Latin proficiency to the kingdom of the Franks is regarded as an important step in the development of medieval Latin  Charlemagne s chancery made use of a type of script currently known as Carolingian minuscule  providing a common writing style that allowed for communication across most of Europe  After the decline of the Carolingian dynasty  the rise of the Saxon Dynasty in Germany was accompanied by the Ottonian Renaissance  Breakup of the Carolingian empire See also  Holy Roman Empire Breakup of the Carolingian empire While Charlemagne continued the Frankish tradition of dividing the regnum  kingdom  between all his heirs  at least those of age   the assumption of the imperium  imperial title  supplied a unifying force not available previously  Charlemagne was succeeded by his only legitimate son of adult age at his death  Louis the Pious  Louis s long reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and  after 829  numerous civil wars between various alliances of father and sons against other sons to determine a just division by battle  The final division was made at Cr mieux in 838  The Emperor Louis recognized his eldest son Lothair I as emperor and confirmed him in the Regnum Italicum  Italy   He divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald  his youngest son  giving Lothair the opportunity to choose his half  He chose East Francia  which comprised the empire on both banks of the Rhine and eastwards  leaving Charles West Francia  which comprised the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps  Louis the German  the middle child  who had been rebellious to the last  was allowed to keep his subregnum of Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother  The division was not undisputed  Pepin II of Aquitaine  the emperor s grandson  rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine  while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia  In two final campaigns  the emperor defeated both his rebellious descendants and vindicated the division of Cr mieux before dying in 840  Hungarian campaigns in the 10th century  Most European nations were praying for mercy   Sagittis hungarorum libera nos Domine     Lord save us from the arrows of Hungarians  A three year civil war followed his death  At the end of the conflict  Louis the German was in control of East Francia and Lothair was confined to Italy  By the Treaty of Verdun  843   a kingdom of Middle Francia was created for Lothair in the Low Countries and Burgundy  and his imperial title was recognized  East Francia would eventually morph into the Kingdom of Germany and West Francia into the Kingdom of France  around both of which the history of Western Europe can largely be described as a contest for control of the middle kingdom  Charlemagne s grandsons and great grandsons divided their kingdoms between their sons until all the various regna and the imperial title fell into the hands of Charles the Fat by 884  He was deposed in 887 and died in 888  to be replaced in all his kingdoms but two  Lotharingia and East Francia  by non Carolingian  petty kings   The Carolingian Empire was destroyed  though the imperial tradition would eventually lead to the Holy Roman Empire in 962  The breakup of the Carolingian Empire was accompanied by the invasions  migrations  and raids of external foes as not seen since the Migration Period  The Atlantic and northern shores were harassed by the Vikings  who forced Charles the Bald to issue the Edict of Pistres against them and who besieged Paris in 885 886  The eastern frontiers  especially Germany and Italy  were under constant Magyar assault until their great defeat at the Battle of the Lechfeld in 955  The Saracens also managed to establish bases at Garigliano and Fraxinetum  to sack Rome in 846 and to conquer the islands of Corsica  Sardinia  and Sicily  and their pirates raided the Mediterranean coasts  as did the Vikings  The Christianization of the pagan Vikings provided an end to that threat  Art and architecture Main articles  Medieval art and Medieval architecture Basilica of San Vitale Ravenna  Italy 548 AD St  Peter on the Wall Chapel England 662 AD Few truly large stone buildings were attempted between the Constantinian basilicas of the 4th century and the 8th century  but many smaller stone buildings were built  At this time  the establishment of churches and monasteries  and a comparative political stability  caused the development of a form of stone architecture loosely based upon Roman forms and hence later named Romanesque  Where available  Roman brick and stone buildings were recycled for their materials  From the fairly tentative beginnings known as the First Romanesque  the style flourished and spread across Europe in a remarkably homogeneous form  The features are massive stone walls  openings topped by semi circular arches  small windows  and  particularly in France  arched stone vaults and arrows  In the decorative arts  Celtic and Germanic barbarian forms were absorbed into Christian art  although the central impulse remained Roman and Byzantine  High quality jewellery and religious imagery were produced throughout Western Europe  Charlemagne and other monarchs provided patronage for religious artworks such as reliquaries and books  Some of the principal artworks of the age were the fabulous Illuminated manuscripts produced by monks on vellum  using gold  silver  and precious pigments to illustrate biblical narratives  Early examples include the Book of Kells and many Carolingian and Ottonian Frankish manuscripts  High Middle Ages Main articles  High Middle Ages  Feudalism  and 12th century Renaissance A page from a Psalter dating from the early 14th century  showing the end of Psalm 145 and the start of Psalm 146  The fortress of Carcassonne  France Medieval illustration of the capture of Jerusalem during the First Crusade  1099 Manuel Chrysoloras was brought to Florence in 1396 to teach Greek The High Middle Ages were characterized by the urbanization of Europe  military expansion  and intellectual revival that historians identify between the 11th century and the end of the 13th century  This revival was aided by the conversion of the raiding Scandinavians and Hungarians to Christianity  by the assertion of power by Castellans to fill the power vacuum left by the Carolingian decline  and not least by the increased contact with Islamic civilization  which had preserved and elaborated all the classic Greek literature forgotten in Europe after the collapse of The Roman Empire  This was now retranslated into Latin  along with newer works of important advances in science and technology  The High Middle Ages saw an explosion in population  This population flowed into towns  sought conquests abroad  or cleared land for cultivation  The cities of antiquity had been clustered around the Mediterranean  By 1200  the growing urban centres were in the centre of the continent  connected by roads or rivers  By the end of this period  Paris might have had as many as 200 000 inhabitants  49  In central and northern Italy and in Flanders  the rise of towns that were  to some degree  self governing  stimulated the economy and created an environment for new types of religious and trade associations  Trading cities on the shores of the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League  and Italian city states such as Venice  Genoa  and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean  This period marks a formative one in the history of the Western state as we know it  for kings in France  England  and Spain consolidated their power during this period  setting up lasting institutions to help them govern  Also new kingdoms like Hungary and Poland  after their sedentarization and conversion to Christianity  became Central European powers  Hungary  especially  became the  Gate to Europe  from Asia  and bastion of Christianity against the invaders from the East until the 16th century and the onslaught by the Ottoman Empire  The Papacy  which had long since created an ideology of independence from the secular kings  first asserted its claims to temporal authority over the entire Christian world  The entity that historians call the Papal Monarchy reached its apogee in the early 13th century under the pontificate of Innocent III  Northern Crusades and the advance of Christian kingdoms and military orders into previously pagan regions in the Baltic region and Finnic northeast brought the forced assimilation of numerous native peoples to the European identity  With the brief exception of the Kipchak and Mongol invasions  major barbarian incursions ceased  Crusades Main articles  Crusades and Reconquista The Crusades were holy wars or armed pilgrimages intended to liberate Jerusalem from Muslim control  Jerusalem was part of the Muslim possessions won during a rapid military expansion in the 7th century through the Near East  Northern Africa  and Anatolia  in modern Turkey   The first Crusade was preached by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095 in response to a request from the Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos for aid against further advancement  Urban promised indulgence to any Christian who took the Crusader vow and set off for Jerusalem  The resulting fervour that swept through Europe mobilized tens of thousands of people from all levels of society  and resulted in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099  as well as other regions  Although they were minorities within this region  the Crusaders tried to consolidate their conquests as a number of Crusader states   the Kingdom of Jerusalem  as well as the County of Edessa  the Principality of Antioch  and the County of Tripoli  collectively Outremer   During the 12th century and 13th century  there were a series of conflicts between these states and surrounding Islamic ones  Crusades were essentially resupply missions for these embattled kingdoms  Military orders such as the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller were formed to play an integral role in this support  By the end of the Middle Ages  the Christian Crusaders had captured all the Islamic territories in modern Spain  Portugal  and Southern Italy  Meanwhile  Islamic counter attacks had retaken all the Crusader possessions on the Asian mainland  leaving a de facto boundary between Islam and Western Christianity that continued until modern times  Substantial areas of northern Europe also remained outside Christian influence until the 11th century or later  these areas also became crusading venues during the expansionist High Middle Ages  Throughout this period  the Byzantine Empire was in decline  having peaked in influence during the High Middle Ages  Beginning with the Battle of Manzikert in 1071  the empire underwent a cycle of decline and renewal  including the sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204  After that  Andrew II of Hungary assembled the biggest army in the history of the Crusades  and moved his troops as a leading figure in the Fifth Crusade  reaching Cyprus and later Lebanon  coming back home in 1218  Despite another short upswing following the recapture of Constantinople in 1261  the empire continued to deteriorate  Science and technology Main articles  Medieval science and Medieval technology The University of Oxford  the University of Cambridge  and many other universities were founded at this time  The early Middle Ages coincided with the Islamic Golden Age  At that time  Islamic philosophy  science  and technology were more advanced than in Western Europe  Islamic scholars both preserved and built upon earlier Ancient Greek and Roman traditions and added their own inventions and innovations in Islamic Al Andalus  modern Spain and Portugal   Some of this knowledge was collected after the Christian reconquest of Muslim Spain  see Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe   and European scholars used it to build upon their existing knowledge and to fill in the gaps  Furthermore  much classical knowledge was not actually lost in Western Europe  but was instead scattered in monasteries all over Europe  and in the high Middle Ages it was collected and became a base for further enlightenment  At the same time  Byzantine Greeks were invited to Italy to teach Greek  and brought with them much classical knowledge  This migration of Byzantine scholars and other emigrates from southern Italy and Byzantium during the decline of the Byzantine Empire  1203 1453  were to make a big contribution in the High Middle Ages in Western Europe  These emigrates were grammarians  humanists  poets  writers  printers  lecturers  musicians  astronomers  architects  academics  artists  scribes  philosophers  scientists  politicians and theologians  They brought to Western Europe the far greater preserved and accumulated knowledge of their own  Greek  civilization  Roger Bacon  c  1214 1294  is sometimes credited as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method inspired by the works of Aristotle  One of these Greeks was Manuel Chrysoloras  1355 1415   a pioneer in the introduction of Greek literature to Western Europe during the late Middle Ages  In 1396  Coluccio Salutati  the chancellor of the University of Florence  invited Chrysolora to come and teach Greek grammar and literature  Chrysoloras also translated the works of Homer and Plato s Republic into Latin  Also during the Latin Empire of Constantinople 1204 1261  classical knowledge was brought back to the West by the crusaders  In Europe  there were still places where classic knowledge was translated and studied  In Ireland the monks preserved the work of the classic world  and in England  Bede wrote scientific  historical and theological works  reflecting the range of his writings from music and metrics to exegetical Scripture commentaries  He knew patristic literature  as well as Pliny the Elder  Virgil  Lucretius  Ovid  Horace and other classical writers  and during the Carolingian renaissance  770 850   there was a craving for Greek and Roman knowledge  50  William of Moerbeke  1215 1286  undertook a complete translation of the works of Aristotle directly from the Greek  Moerbeke was the first translator of Politics  c  1260  into Latin  as Politics  unlike other parts of the Aristotelian corpus  had not been translated into Arabic  51  Moerbeke s translations were already standard classics by the 14th century  when Henricus Hervodius identified their enduring value  they were literal  de verbo in verbo   faithful to the spirit of Aristotle  and without elegance  For several of Moerbeke s translations  the Greek texts have since disappeared  without him the works would be lost  Moerbeke also translated mathematical treatises by Hero of Alexandria and Archimedes  Especially important was his translation of Theological Elements by Proclus  translated in 1268   because Theological Elements was one of the fundamental sources of the revived Neo Platonic philosophical currents of the 13th century  Among the results of the Greek and Islamic influence on this period in European history was the replacement of Roman numerals with the decimal positional number system and the invention of algebra  which allowed more advanced mathematics  Another consequence was that the Latin speaking world regained access to lost classical literature and philosophy  Latin translations of the 12th century fed a passion for Aristotelian philosophy and Islamic science that is frequently referred to as the Renaissance of the 12th century  Meanwhile  trade grew throughout Europe as the dangers of travel were reduced  and steady economic growth resumed  Cathedral schools and monasteries ceased to be the sole sources of education in the 11th century when universities were established in major European cities  Literacy became available to a wider class of people  and there were major advances in art  sculpture  music  and architecture  Large cathedrals were built across Europe  first in the Romanesque style of architecture  and later in the more decorative Gothic style  A Westerner and an Arab learning geometry in the 15th century During the 12th and 13th century in Europe  there were radical changes in the rates of new inventions  innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production  and economic growth  The period saw major technological advances  including the invention of the cannon  spectacles  and artesian wells  and the cross cultural introduction of gunpowder  silk  the compass  and the astrolabe from the east  One major agricultural innovation during this period was the development of a 3 field rotation system for planting crops  as opposed the 2 field system that had been used   Further  the development of the heavy plow allowed for a rise in communal agriculture as most individuals could not afford to do it by themselves  As a result  medieval villages had formed a type of collective ownership and communal agriculture where the use of horses allowed villages to grow  There were also great improvements to ships and the clock  The latter advances made possible the dawn of the Age of Exploration  At the same time  huge numbers of Greek and Arabic works on medicine and the sciences were translated and distributed throughout Europe  Aristotle especially became very important  his rational and logical approach to knowledge influencing the scholars at the newly forming universities which were absorbing and disseminating the new knowledge during the 12th century Renaissance  Changes Monastic reform became an important issue during the 11th century  when elites began to worry that monks were not adhering to their Rules with the discipline that was required for a good religious life  During this time  it was believed that monks were performing a very practical task by sending their prayers to God and inducing Him to make the world a better place for the virtuous  The time invested in this activity would be wasted  however  if the monks were not virtuous  The monastery of Cluny  founded in the M con in 909  was founded as part of a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear  52  It was a reformed monastery that quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour  Cluny sought to maintain the high quality of spiritual life by electing its own abbot from within the cloister  and maintained an economic and political independence from local lords by placing itself under the protection of the Pope  49  Cluny provided a popular solution to the problem of bad monastic codes  and in the 11th century its abbots were frequently called to participate in imperial politics as well as reform monasteries in France and Italy  St Francis of Assisi  depicted by Bonaventura Berlinghieri in 1235  brought about reform in the church The monastic reform inspired change in the secular church  as well  The ideals that it was based upon were brought to the papacy by Pope Leo IX on his election in 1049  providing the ideology of clerical independence that fuelled the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century  The Investiture Controversy involved Pope Gregory VII and Henry IV  Holy Roman Emperor  who initially clashed over a specific bishop s appointment and turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture  clerical marriage  and simony  The Emperor  as a Christian ruler  saw the protection of the Church as one of his great rights and responsibilities  The Papacy  however  had begun insisting on its independence from secular lords  The open warfare ended with Henry IV s occupation of Rome in 1085 and the death of the Pope several months later  but the issues themselves remained unresolved even after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms  The conflict represents a significant stage in the creation of a papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities  It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors  52  The High Middle Ages was a period of great religious movements  The Crusades  which have already been mentioned  have an undeniable religious aspect  Monastic reform was similarly a religious movement effected by monks and elites  Other groups sought to participate in new forms of religious life  Landed elites financed the construction of new parish churches in the European countryside  which increased the Church s impact upon the daily lives of peasants  Cathedral canons adopted monastic rules  groups of peasants and laypeople abandoned their possessions to live like the Apostles  and people formulated ideas about their religion that were deemed heretical  Although the success of the 12th century papacy in fashioning a Church that progressively affected the daily lives of everyday people cannot be denied  there are still indicators that the tail could wag the dog  The new religious groups called the Waldensians and the Humiliati were condemned for their refusal to accept a life of cloistered monasticism  In many aspects  however  they were not very different from the Franciscans and the Dominicans  who were approved by the papacy in the early 13th century  the Franciscan and the Dominican friars developed the popular sermon   The picture that modern historians of the religious life present is one of great religious zeal welling up from the peasantry during the High Middle Ages  with clerical elites striving  only sometimes successfully  to understand and channel this power into familiar paths  Late Middle Ages Main article  Late Middle Ages See also  Crisis of the Late Middle Ages A bishop blesses victims of the Black Death Lands and countries ruled by Louis the Great of Hungary in 1370s  Louis led successful campaigns from Lithuania to southern Italy  The Allegory of Good Government was painted for the town council in Siena by Ambrogio Lorenzetti Joan of Arc in a 15th century miniature The Late Middle Ages were a period initiated by calamities and upheavals  During this time  agriculture was affected by a climate change that has been documented by climate historians  and was felt by contemporaries in the form of periodic famines  including the Great Famine of 1315 1317  Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines  and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period  53  The Black Death  a disease that spread among the populace like wildfire  killed as much as a third of the population in the mid 14th century  In some regions  the toll was higher than one half of the population  Towns were especially hard hit because of the crowded conditions  Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited  and in some places fields were left unworked  Because of the sudden decline in available labourers  the price of wages rose as landlords sought to entice workers to their fields  Workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings  and popular uprisings broke out across Europe  Even the king Louis I of Hungary was forced to stop his long war against the Kingdom of Naples in 1347  because of the deaths in the Italian region  The Black Death soon took the life of Louis I s wife  Margaret  daughter of the German emperor Charles IV  and as well few Hungarians  although the negative consequences of this disease in the Kingdom of Hungary were relatively mild  Paradoxically  creative social  economic and technological responses emerged from this period of stress  these developments laid the groundwork for further significant change during the Early Modern Period  It was also a period when the Catholic Church was increasingly divided against itself  During the time of the Western Schism  the Church was led by as many as three popes at one time  The divisiveness of the Church undermined papal authority  and allowed the formation of national churches  State resurgence The Late Middle Ages also witnessed the rise of strong  royalty based nation states  particularly the Kingdom of England  the Kingdom of France  and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula  Aragon  Castile  Navarre  and Portugal   The long conflicts of this time  such as the Hundred Years  War fought between England and France  strengthened royal control over the kingdoms  even though they were extremely hard on the peasantry  Kings profited from warfare by gaining land  France shows clear signs of a growth in royal power during the 14th century  from the active persecution of heretics and lepers  expulsion of the Jews  and the dissolution of the Knights Templar  In all of these cases  undertaken by Philip IV  the king confiscated land and wealth from these minority groups  49  The conflict between Philip and Pope Boniface VIII  a conflict which began over Philip s unauthorized taxation of clergy  ended with the violent death of Boniface and the installation of Pope Clement V  a weak  French controlled pope  in Avignon  This action enhanced French prestige  at the expense of the papacy  England  too  began the 14th century with warfare and expansion  Edward I waged war against the Principality of Wales and the Kingdom of Scotland  with mixed success  to assert what he considered his right to the entire island of Great Britain  Both the Kings of France and the Kings of England of this period presided over effective states administered by literate bureaucrats  and sought baronial consent for their decisions through early versions of parliamentary systems  called the Estates General in France and the Parliament in England  Towns and merchants allied with kings during the 15th century  allowing the kings to distance themselves further from the territorial lords  As a result of the power gained during the 14th and 15th centuries  late medieval kings built truly sovereign states  which were able to impose taxes  declare war  and create and enforce laws  all by the will of the king  Kings encouraged cohesion in their administration by appointing ministers with broad ambitions and a loyalty to the state  54  By the last half of the 15th century  kings like Henry VII of England and Louis XI of France were able to rule without much baronial interference  Hundred Years  War Main article  Hundred Years  War The Hundred Years  War was a conflict between France and England lasting 116 years  from 1337 to 1453  It was fought primarily over claims by the English kings to the French throne and was punctuated by several brief and two extended periods of peace before it finally ended in the expulsion of the English from France  except for the Calais Pale  This series of conflicts is commonly divided into three or four phases  the Edwardian War  1337 1360   the Caroline War  1369 1389   the Lancastrian War  1415 1429   and the slow decline of English fortunes  1429 1453  after the appearance of Joan of Arc  Though primarily a dynastic conflict  the war gave impetus to ideas of both French and English nationality  Militarily  it saw the introduction of new weapons and tactics  which eroded the older system of feudal armies dominated by heavy cavalry  The first standing armies in Western Europe since the time of the Western Roman Empire were introduced for the war  thus changing the role of the peasantry  For all this  as well as for its long duration  it is often viewed as one of the most significant conflicts in the history of medieval warfare  Controversy within the Church The troubled 14th century saw both the Avignon Papacy of 1305 1378  also called the Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy  a reference to the Babylonian Captivity of the Jews   and the so called Western Schism that lasted from 1378 to 1418  The practice of granting papal indulgences  fairly commonplace since the 11th century  was reformulated and explicitly monetized in the 14th century  49  Indulgences became an important source of revenue for the Church  revenue that filtered through parish churches to bishops and then to the pope himself  This was viewed by many as a corruption of the Church  In the early years of the 15th century  after a century of turmoil  ecclesiastical officials convened in Constance in 1417 to discuss a resolution to the Schism  49  Traditionally  councils needed to be called by the Pope  and none of the contenders were willing to call a council and risk being unseated  The act of convening a council without papal approval was justified by the argument that the Church was represented by the whole population of the faithful  The council deposed the warring popes and elected Martin V  The turmoil of the Church  and the perception that it was a corrupted institution  sapped the legitimacy of the papacy within Europe and fostered greater loyalty to regional or national churches  Martin Luther published objections to the Church  Although his disenchantment had long been forming  the denunciation of the Church was precipitated by the arrival of preachers raising money to rebuild the Basilica of Saint Peter in Rome  Luther might have been silenced by the Church  but the death of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I brought the imperial succession to the forefront of concern  Lutherans  split with the Roman Catholic Church in 1517  and the subsequent division of Catholicism into Lutheranism  Calvinism  and Anabaptism  put a definitive end to the unified Church built during the Middle Ages  European development Europe in the 1430s Europe in the 1470s The fall of east and central Europe Saint John of Capistrano and the Hungarian armies fighting the Ottoman Empire at the Siege of Belgrade in 1456 King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary  1458 1490   He extended his military power all over Central Europe conquering Bohemia and Austria  and fought the Ottoman Empire in the west with the biggest army of his time  In the end of the 15th century the Ottoman Empire advanced all over East Europe conquering eventually the Byzantine Empire and extending their control on the Slavic states of the Balkans  Hungary became eventually the last bastion of the Latin Christian world  and fought for the keeping its rule on his territories during two centuries  After the tragic death of the young King Vladislaus I of Hungary during the Battle of Varna in 1444 against the Ottomans  the Kingdom without monarch was placed in the hands of the count John Hunyadi  who became Hungary s regent governor  1446 1453   Hunyadi was considered by the pope as one of the most relevant military figures of the 15th century  Pope Pius II awarded him with the title of Athleta Christi or Champion of Christ   because he was the only hope of keeping a resistance against the Ottomans in Central and West Europe  Hunyadi succeeded during the Siege of Belgrade in 1456 against the Ottomans  which meant the biggest victory against that empire in decades  This battle became a real Crusade against the Muslims  as the Hungarian  Bohemian and Slavic peasants were motivated by the Franciscan monk Saint John of Capistrano  which came from Italy predicating the Holy War  The effect that it created in that time was one of the few main factors that helped achieving the victory  However the premature death of the Hungarian Lord left defenseless and in chaos that area of Europe  55  As an absolutely unusual event for the Middle Ages  Hunyadi s son  Matthias  was elected as King for Hungary by the nobility  For the first time  a member of an aristocratic family  and not from a royal family  was crowned  56  The king Matthias Corvinus of Hungary  1458 1490  was one of the most prominent figures of this Age  as he directed campaigns to the west conquering Bohemia answering to the Pope s claim for help against the Hussite Protestants  and also for solving the political hostilities with the German emperor Frederick III of Habsburg he invaded his west domains  for the end of his life Matthew of Hungary also held the title of Duke of Austria   Matthew organized the Black Army of Hungary  composed of mercenary soldiers that is considered until the date as the biggest army of its time  Using this powerful tool  the Hungarian king led wars against the Turkish armies and stopped them during his reign  However  the Ottoman Empire grew in strength  and the Black Army of Hungary disappeared  leaving the Kingdom defenseless after the death of Matthew  At the same time  Hungary became under his reign the most important country where the Renaissance developed after the Italian states  Many sculptors  poets  musicians  painters  scientists moved to Hungary from all corners of Europe  gathering all in the court of the King  He established what was at the time of Europe s largest libraries  the Bibliotheca Corviniana  with over 3000 codices  Hungary resisted until 1526 when the Ottoman armies won the Battle of Moh cs  and the Christian Kingdom lost his King Louis II of Hungary  falling in a serious crisis  The Protestant reform  and The American Continent s discovery left behind the matter of the Ottoman wars  and mutilated the medieval Europe leaving it without one of its most important Kingdoms  This episode is considered to be one of the final ones of the Medieval Times  57  Religion Christian heresy  for example  Arian  Cathar  John Wyclif  Hussites  Christian monasticism Benedictines Carthusians Cistercians Church and state

Earth in a 14th century copy of L Image du monde  c  1246  Further information  Dark Ages and Science in the Middle Ages The medieval period is frequently caricatured as supposedly a  time of ignorance and superstition  which placed  the word of religious authorities over personal experience and rational activity   58  Others argue that reason was generally held in high regard during the Middle Ages  The historian of science Edward Grant  writes that  If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed  in the 18th century   they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities   59  Also  contrary to common belief  David Lindberg says  the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free  particularly in the natural sciences  to follow reason and observation wherever they led   60  The caricature of the period is also reflected in a number of more specific notions  For instance  a claim that was first propagated in the 19th century 61  and is still very common in popular culture is the supposition that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat  This claim is mistaken  61  In fact  lecturers in the medieval universities commonly advanced evidence in favor of the idea that the Earth was a sphere  62  Lindberg and Numbers write   There was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge  Earth s  sphericity and even know its approximate circumference   63  The Middle Ages outside Europe The period of the Middle Ages in the territories that were part of the Roman Empire  viz  Europe and the Mediterranean  corresponds to the following historical periods in parts of Africa and Asia that were beyond Roman or Hellenistic influence  The Golden Age of Islam Umayyad Caliphate Abbasid Caliphate Turco Mongols Mongol invasions Ilkhanate Timurid dynasty Mamluks Seljuks Rise of the Ottoman Empire Middle kingdoms of India Bahmani Sultanate Pala Empire Delhi Sultanate  Medieval China   Tang Dynasty Song Dynasty Yuan Dynasty Ming Dynasty Feudal Japan  Nara period Heian period Kamakura period Muromachi period Korea  Goryeo Khmer Empire The Sahelian kingdoms in Africa Notes   A reference work published in 1883 equates the Dark Ages with the Middle Ages  but beginning with William Paton Ker in 1904  the term  Dark Ages  is generally restricted to the early part of the Medieval period  For example  the 1911 edition of Britannica defines the Dark Ages this way  See Dark Ages for a more complete historiography of this term    This system  which eventually encompassed two senior co emperors and two junior co emperors  is known as the Tetrarchy  13    An alternate date of 480 is sometimes given  as that was the date when Romulus Augustulus  predecessor Julius Nepos died  Nepos had continued to assert that he was the western emperor while holding onto Dalmatia  25    His grave was discovered in 1653 and is remarkable for the grave goods included  which included a number of weapons and a large quantity of gold  34    Although the missus dominicus makes appearances during the second half of the 8th century  it is after 800 that they were institutionalized  48  Citations   a b Power Central Middle Ages p  304   a b Albrow Gllobal Age p
