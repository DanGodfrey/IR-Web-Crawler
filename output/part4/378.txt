Chokwe statue  detail from the Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli and a Japanese Shisa lion Art is a term that describes a diverse range of human activities and the products of those activities  but is most often understood to refer to painting  film  photography  sculpture  and other visual media  Music  theatre  dance  literature  and interactive media are included in a broader definition of art or the arts  1  Until the 17th century  art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences  but in modern usage the fine arts are distinguished from acquired skills in general  Many definitions of art have been proposed by philosophers and others who have characterized art in terms of mimesis  expression  communication of emotion  or other values  During the Romantic period  art came to be seen as  a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science   2  The nature of art  and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation  are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics  3  Contents 1 Definition 2 History 3 Forms  genres  media  and styles 3 1 Skill and craft 3 2 Value judgment 4 Purpose of

or simply express an aesthetic truth or feeling  Panorama of a section of A Thousand Li of Mountains and Rivers  a 12th century painting by Song Dynasty artist Wang Ximeng  Britannica Online defines art as  the use of skill and imagination in the creation of aesthetic objects  environments  or experiences that can be shared with others   By this definition of the word  artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind  from early pre historic art to contemporary art  however  some theories restrict the concept to modern Western societies  4  The first and broadest sense of art is the one that has remained closest to the older Latin meaning  which roughly translates to  skill  or  craft   A few examples where this meaning proves very broad include artifact  artificial  artifice  medical arts  and military arts  However  there are many other colloquial uses of the word  all with some relation to its etymology  20th century Rwandan bottle  Artistic works may serve practical functions  in addition to their decorative value  The second and more recent sense of the word art is as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art and emerged in the early 17th century  5  Fine art means that a skill is being used to express the artist s creativity  or to engage the audience s aesthetic sensibilities  or to draw the audience towards consideration of the finer things  The word art can describe several things  a study of creative skill  a process of using the creative skill  a product of the creative skill  or the audience s experience with the creative skill  The creative arts  art as discipline  are a collection of disciplines that produce artworks  art as objects  that are compelled by a personal drive  art as activity  and convey a message  mood  or symbolism for the viewer to interpret  art as experience   Art is something that stimulates an individual s thoughts  emotions  beliefs  or ideas through the senses  Artworks can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects  Although the application of scientific knowledge to derive a new scientific theory involves skill and results in the  creation  of something new  this represents science only and is not categorized as art  Often  if the skill is being used in a common or practical way  people will consider it a craft instead of art  Likewise  if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way  it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art  On the other hand  crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art  Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference  6  However  even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self expression  The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas  such as in politically  spiritually  or philosophically motivated art  to create a sense of beauty  see aesthetics   to explore the nature of perception  for pleasure  or to generate strong emotions  The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent  The nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard Wollheim as  one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture   7  Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas  a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake  and as mimesis or representation  Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of Aristotle  8 Goethe defined art as an other resp  a second nature  according to his ideal of a style founded on the basic fundaments of insight and on the innermost character of things  9 Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another  8 Benedetto Croce and R G  Collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions  and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator  10  11  The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant  and was developed in the early twentieth century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell  More recently  thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self expression and interpretation  12 George Dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or institution has conferred  the status of candidate for appreciation   13  History Main article  History of art Venus of Willendorf  circa 24 000 22 000 BP Sculptures  cave paintings  rock paintings  and petroglyphs from the Upper Paleolithic dating to roughly 40 000 years ago have been found  but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them  The oldest art objects in the world a series of tiny  drilled snail shells about 75 000 years old were discovered in a South African cave  14  Containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100 000 years  15  Cave painting of a horse from the Lascaux caves  circa 16 000 BP Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations  Ancient Egypt  Mesopotamia  Persia  India  China  Ancient Greece  Rome  as well as Inca  Maya  and Olmec  Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art  Because of the size and duration of these civilizations  more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times  Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked  For example  this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature  poise  beauty  and anatomically correct proportions  In Byzantine and Medieval art of the Western Middle Ages  much art focused on the expression of Biblical and religious truths  and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world  such as the use of gold in the background of paintings  or glass in mosaics or windows  which also presented figures in idealized  patterned  flat  forms  Nevertheless a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works  and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe  Renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world  and the place of humans in it  reflected in the corporeality of the human body  and development of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in a three dimensional picture space  The stylized signature of Sultan Mahmud II of the Ottoman Empire was written in Arabic calligraphy  It reads Mahmud Khan son of Abdulhamid is forever victorious  The Great Mosque of Kairouan  also called the Mosque of Uqba  is one of the finest  most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques  dated in its present state from the 9th century  it is the ancestor and model of all the mosques in the western Islamic lands  16  The Great Mosque of Kairouan is located in the city of Kairouan in Tunisia  In the east  Islamic art s rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns  calligraphy  and architecture  Further east  religion dominated artistic styles and forms too  India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance  while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines  China saw the flourishing of many art forms  jade carving  bronzework  pottery  including the stunning terracotta army of Emperor Qin   poetry  calligraphy  music  painting  drama  fiction  etc  Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty  So  for example  Tang Dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse  emphasizing idealized landscapes  but Ming Dynasty paintings are busy and colorful  and focus on telling stories via setting and composition  Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too  and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting  Woodblock printing became important in Japan after the 17th century  Painting by Song Dynasty artist Ma Lin  circa 1250  24 8   25 2 cm The western Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe  as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post monarchist world  such as Blake s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer  or David s propagandistic paintings  This led to Romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans  exemplified in the novels of Goethe  The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements  such as academic art  Symbolism  impressionism and fauvism among others  The history of twentieth century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards  each being torn down in succession by the next  Thus the parameters of Impressionism  Expressionism  Fauvism  Cubism  Dadaism  Surrealism  etc  cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention  Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art  such as Pablo Picasso being influenced by African sculpture  Japanese woodblock prints  which had themselves been influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship  had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent development  Later  African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by Matisse  Similarly  the west has had huge impacts on Eastern art in the 19th and 20th centuries  with originally western ideas like Communism and Post Modernism exerting a powerful influence on artistic styles  Modernism  the idealistic search for truth  gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability  Theodor W  Adorno said in 1970   It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more  neither art itself  nor art in relationship to the whole  nor even the right of art to exist   17 Relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth  which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism  where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms  which can be appreciated and drawn from only with irony  Furthermore the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture  rather than regional cultures  Forms  genres  media  and styles Main article  The arts Detail of Leonardo da Vinci s Mona Lisa  showing the painting technique of sfumato The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories  each related to its technique  or medium  such as decorative arts  plastic arts  performing arts  or literature  Unlike scientific fields  art is one of the few subjects that are academically organized according to technique  2  dead link   An artistic medium is the substance or material the artistic work is made from  and may also refer to the technique used  For example  paint is a medium used in painting  and paper is a medium used in drawing  An art form is the specific shape  or quality an artistic expression takes  The media used often influence the form  For example  the form of a sculpture must exist in space in three dimensions  and respond to gravity  The constraints and limitations of a particular medium are thus called its formal qualities  To give another example  the formal qualities of painting are the canvas texture  color  and brush texture  The formal qualities of video games are non linearity  interactivity and virtual presence  The form of a particular work of art is determined by the formal qualities of the media  and is not related to the intentions of the artist or the reactions of the audience in any way whatsoever  A genre is a set of conventions and styles within a particular medium  For instance  well recognized genres in film are western  horror and romantic comedy  Genres in music include death metal and trip hop  Genres in painting include still life and pastoral landscape  A particular work of art may bend or combine genres but each genre has a recognizable group of conventions  clich s and tropes   One note  the word genre has a second older meaning within painting  genre painting was a phrase used in the 17th to 19th centuries to refer specifically to paintings of scenes of everyday life and is still used in this way   The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai  Japanese  1760 1849   colored woodcut print The original Fountain by Marcel Duchamp  1917  photographed by Alfred Stieglitz at the 291 after the 1917 Society of Independent Artists exhibit  Stieglitz used a backdrop of The Warriors by Marsden Hartley to photograph the urinal  The exhibition entry tag can be clearly seen  18  The style of an artwork  artist  or movement is the distinctive method and form followed by the respective art  Any loose brushy  dripped or poured abstract painting is called expressionistic  Often a style is linked with a particular historical period  set of ideas  and particular artistic movement  So Jackson Pollock is called an Abstract Expressionist  A particular style may have specific cultural meanings  For example  Roy Lichtenstein a painter associated with the American Pop art movement of the 1960s was not a pointillist  despite his use of dots  Lichtenstein used evenly spaced Ben Day dots  the type used to reproduce color in comic strips  as a style to question the  high  art of painting with the  low  art of comics  thus commenting on class distinctions in culture  Pointillism  a technique in late Impressionism  1880s  developed especially by the artist Georges Seurat  employs dots to create variation in color and depth in an attempt to approximate the way people really see color  Both artists use dots  but the particular style and technique relate to the artistic movement adopted by each artist  These are all ways of beginning to define a work of art  to narrow it down   Imagine you are an art critic whose mission is to compare the meanings you find in a wide range of individual artworks  How would you proceed with your task  One way to begin is to examine the materials each artist selected in making an object  image video  or event  The decision to cast a sculpture in bronze  for instance  inevitably effects its meaning  the work becomes something different from how it might be if it had been cast in gold or plastic or chocolate  even if everything else about the artwork remains the same  Next  you might examine how the materials in each artwork have become an arrangement of shapes  colors  textures  and lines  These  in turn  are organized into various patterns and compositional structures  In your interpretation  you would comment on how salient features of the form contribute to the overall meaning of the finished artwork   But in the end  the meaning of most artworks    is not exhausted by a discussion of materials  techniques  and form  Most interpretations also include a discussion of the ideas and feelings the artwork engenders   19  Skill and craft Adam  Detail from Michelangelo s fresco in the Cappella Sistina  1511  See also  Conceptual Art and Artistic Skill Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium  Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth  Art is an act of expressing feelings  thoughts  and observations  20  There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it  which facilitates one s thought processes  A common view is that the epithet  art   particular in its elevated sense  requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist  whether this be a demonstration of technical ability  an originality in stylistic approach  or a combination of these two  Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success  for Leonardo da Vinci  art  neither more nor less than his other endeavors  was a manifestation of skill  Rembrandt s work  now praised for its ephemeral virtues  was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity  At the turn of the 20th century  the adroit performances of John Singer Sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency  yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era s most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast  Pablo Picasso  was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled  A common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object  In conceptual art  Marcel Duchamp s  Fountain  is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects   ready made   and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills  Tracey Emin s My Bed  or Damien Hirst s The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living follow this example and also manipulate the mass media  Emin slept  and engaged in other activities  in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art  Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans  Hirst s celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts  The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects  However there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating hands on works of art  Value judgment Aboriginal hollow log tombs  National Gallery  Canberra  Australia This section may stray from the topic of the article into the topic of another article  Art  disambiguation   Please help improve this section or discuss this issue on the talk page   November 2010  Somewhat in relation to the above  the word art is also used to apply judgments of value  as in such expressions as  that meal was a work of art   the cook is an artist   or  the art of deception    the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised   It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity  Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism  At the simplest level  a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive  Though perception is always colored by experience  and is necessarily subjective  it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art  However   good  art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers  In other words  an artist s prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic  Also  art often depicts terrible images made for social  moral  or thought provoking reasons  For example  Francisco Goya s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians  Yet at the same time  the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya s keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage  Thus  the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction  if any  is required to define  art   The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing  Indeed  the reverse is often true  that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re invigoration of aesthetic sensibility  and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself  Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality  yet they all seem to agree in at least one point  once their aesthetic choices are accepted  the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist  Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion  It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings  and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings  Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent  but they do not have to do so consciously  Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition  that is  what it is to be human  21  Purpose of art A Navajo rug made circa 1880 Mozarabic Beatus miniature  Spain  late 10th century Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history  making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept  This does not imply that the purpose of Art is  vague   but that it has had many unique  different reasons for being created  Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline  The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non motivated  and those that are motivated  Levi Strauss   Non motivated functions of art The non motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human  transcend the individual  or do not fulfill a specific external purpose  In this sense  Art  as creativity  is something humans must do by their very nature  i e   no other species creates art   and is therefore beyond utility  Basic human instinct for harmony  balance  rhythm  Art at this level is not an action or an object  but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony  beauty   and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility   Imitation  then  is one instinct of our nature  Next  there is the instinct for  harmony  and rhythm  meters being manifestly sections of rhythm  Persons  therefore  starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes  till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry    Aristotle 22  Experience of the mysterious  Art provides a way to experience one s self in relation to the universe  This experience may often come unmotivated  as one appreciates art  music or poetry   The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious  It is the source of all true art and science    Albert Einstein 23  Expression of the imagination  Art provide a means to express the imagination in non grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language  Unlike words  which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning  art provides a range of forms  symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable   Jupiter s eagle  as an example of art  is not  like logical  aesthetic  attributes of an object  the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation  but rather something else   something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words  They furnish an aesthetic idea  which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation  but with the proper function  however  of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken    Immanuel Kant 24  Ritualistic and symbolic functions  In many cultures  art is used in rituals  performances and dances as a decoration or symbol  While these often have no specific utilitarian  motivated  purpose  anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture  This meaning is not furnished by any one individual  but is often the result of many generations of change  and of a cosmological relationship within the culture   Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative  ritual or symbolic  are aware of the trap posed by the term  art     Silva Tomaskova 25  Motivated functions of art Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional  conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator  These may be to bring about political change  to comment on an aspect of society  to convey a specific emotion or mood  to address personal psychology  to illustrate another discipline  to  with commercial arts  to sell a product  or simply as a form of communication  Communication  Art  at its simplest  is a form of communication  As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual  this is a motivated purpose  Illustrative arts  such as scientific illustration  are a form of art as communication  Maps are another example  However  the content need not be scientific  Emotions  moods and feelings are also communicated through art    Art is a set of  artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication    Steve Mithen 26  Art as entertainment  Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood  for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer  This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games  The Avante Garde  Art for political change  One of the defining functions of early twentieth century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change  Art movements that had this goal Dadaism  Surrealism  Russian Constructivism  and Abstract Expressionism  among others are collectively referred to as the avante garde arts   By contrast  the realistic attitude  inspired by positivism  from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France  clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement  I loathe it  for it is made up of mediocrity  hate  and dull conceit  It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books  these insulting plays  It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes  clarity bordering on stupidity  a dog s life    Andr  Breton  Surrealism  27  Art for psychological and healing purposes  Art is also used by art therapists  psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as art therapy  The Diagnostic Drawing Series  for example  is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient  The end product is not the principal goal in this case  but rather a process of healing  through creative acts  is sought  The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy  Art for social inquiry  subversion and or anarchy  While similar to art for political change  subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal  In this case  the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society  Spray paint graffiti on a wall in Rome Graffiti art and other types of street art are graphics and images that are spray painted or stencilled on publicly viewable walls  buildings  buses  trains  and bridges  usually without permission  Certain art forms  such as graffiti  may also be illegal when they break laws  in this case vandalism   Art for propaganda  or commercialism  Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda  and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood  In a similar way  art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion  In both cases  the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object  28  The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive  as many of them may overlap  For example  art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product  i e  the movie or video game  Controversial art Th odore G ricault s Raft of the Medusa  circa 1820 Further information  Art and politics Th odore G ricault s Raft of the Medusa  c  1820   was a social commentary on a current event  unprecedented at the time   douard Manet s Le D jeuner sur l Herbe  1863   was considered scandalous not because of the nude woman  but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time  rather than in robes of the antique world  John Singer Sargent s Madame Pierre Gautreau  Madam X   1884   caused a huge uproar over the reddish pink used to color the woman s ear lobe  considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high society model s reputation  In the twentieth century  Pablo Picasso s Guernica  1937  used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils  to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small  ancient Basque town  Leon Golub s Interrogation III  1981   depicts a female nude  hooded detainee strapped to a chair  her legs open to reveal her sexual organs  surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing  Andres Serrano s Piss Christ  1989  is a photograph of a crucifix  sacred to the Christian religion and representing Christ s sacrifice and final suffering  submerged in a glass of the artist s own urine  The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts  Art theories In the nineteenth century  artists were primarily concerned with ideas of truth and beauty  The aesthetic theorist John Ruskin  who championed what he saw as the naturalism of J  M  W  Turner  saw art s role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature  29  The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century  Richard Wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art  the Realist  whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view  the Objectivist  whereby it is also an absolute value  but is dependent on general human experience  and the Relativist position  whereby it is not an absolute value  but depends on  and varies with  the human experience of different humans  30  The arrival of Modernism in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art  31  and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of postmodernism  Clement Greenberg s 1960 article  Modernist Painting  defines modern art as  the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself   32  Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat  non illusionistic  abstract painting  Realistic  naturalistic art had dissembled the medium  using art to conceal art  modernism used art to call attention to art  The limitations that constitute the medium of painting the flat surface  the shape of the support  the properties of the pigment were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly  Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors  and were acknowledged openly  32  After Greenberg  several important art theorists emerged  such as Michael Fried  T  J  Clark  Rosalind Krauss  Linda Nochlin and Griselda Pollock among others  Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists  Greenberg s definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century  Pop artists like Andy Warhol became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture  as well as the art world  Artists of the 1980s  1990s  and 2000s expanded this technique of self criticism beyond high art to all cultural image making  including fashion images  comics  billboards and pornography  Classification disputes Main article  Classificatory disputes about art Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art  Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included cubist and impressionist paintings  Duchamp s Fountain  the movies  superlative imitations of banknotes  conceptual art  and video games  33  Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem  Rather   the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life  are  so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art   Novitz  1996   According to Novitz  classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper  For example  when the Daily Mail criticized Hirst s and Emin s work by arguing  For 1 000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces  Today  pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all  they are not advancing a definition or theory about art  but questioning the value of Hirst s and Emin s work  34  In 1998  Arthur Danto  suggested a thought experiment showing that  the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it  rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities  Cultural interpretation  an art theory of some kind  is therefore constitutive of an object s arthood   35  36  Anti art is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art  37  it is term associated with Dadaism and attributed to Marcel Duchamp just before World War I  37  when he was making art from found objects  37  One of these  Fountain  1917   an ordinary urinal  has achieved considerable prominence and influence on art  37  Anti art is a feature of work by Situationist International  38  the lo fi Mail art movement  and the Young British Artists  37  though it is a form still rejected by the Stuckists  37  who describe themselves as anti anti art  39  40  Art  class  and value Versailles  Louis Le Vau opened up the interior court to create the expansive entrance cour d honneur  later copied all over Europe  Art is sometimes perceived as belonging exclusively to higher social classes  In this context  art is seen as an upper class activity associated with wealth  the ability to purchase art  and the leisure required to pursue or enjoy it  The Palace of Versailles and the Hermitage in St  Petersburg illustrate this view  such vast collections of art are the preserve of the rich  of governments and wealthy organizations  Fine and expensive goods have been popular markers of status in many cultures  and they continue to be so today  There has been a cultural push in the other direction since at least 1793  when the Louvre  which had been a private palace of the Kings of France  was opened to the public as an art museum during the French Revolution  Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone  Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses  The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City  for example  was created by John Taylor Johnston  a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum   But despite all this  at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status  Performance by Joseph Beuys  1978  Everyone an artist   On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object  One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold  It is  necessary to present something more than mere objects  41  said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys  This time period saw the rise of such things as performance art  video art  and conceptual art  The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind  or was simply an idea  it could not be bought and sold   Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid 1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s  Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art    substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form     have  endeavored to undermine the art object qua object   42  In the decades since  these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works  43  invitations to exclusive performance art pieces  and the objects left over from conceptual pieces  Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art  The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it  and the artwork remains an upper class activity   With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s  artists  and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks  gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors   44  See also
