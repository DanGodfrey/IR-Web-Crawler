The Zimbabwean dollar  sign     or Z  to distinguish it from other dollar denominated currencies  was the official currency of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 12 April 2009  Although the dollar was considered to be among the highest valued currency units when it was introduced in 1980 to replace the Rhodesian dollar at par  political turmoil and hyperinflation rapidly eroded the value of the Zimbabwe dollar to become one of the least valued currency units in the world  undergoing three redenominations  with high face value paper denominations including a  100 trillion banknote  1014   3  The third redenomination produced the  fourth dollar   ZWL  which was worth 1 trillion ZWR  third dollar  and 10 septillion  first dollar  ZWD  so overall the ratio of the redenominations was 103   1010   1012   1025  Despite attempts to control inflation by legislation  and three redenominations  in 2006  2008 and 2009   use of the Zimbabwean dollar as an official currency was effectively abandoned on 12 April 2009  This was a result of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe legalising use of foreign currencies for transactions in January 2009  4  Currencies such as the South African rand  Botswana pula  pound sterling  euro  and the United States dollar are now used for all transactions in Zimbabwe  the policy of the government of Zimbabwe has insisted that any attempts to reintroduce Zimbabwean currency should be considered only if industrial output improves  5  Contents 1 History 1 1 Design 1 2 Introduction of the first dollar 1 3 Introduction of the second dollar 1 4 Introduction of the third

adopted during the decimalisation of 1970  the same practice which was used in other Commonwealth countries such as South Africa  Australia  and New Zealand  The selection of the name was motivated by the fact that the reduced value of the new unit correlated more closely to the value of the US dollar than it did to the pound sterling   edit  Design The main illustration on the obverse of banknotes issued since 1980 is the Chiremba Balancing Rocks in Epworth  Harare  The rocks were part of the Reserve Bank s emblem  which was used for all Bearer and Agro cheques  which circulated between 15 September 2003 and 31 December 2008  The reverse of dollar notes often illustrate the culture or landmarks of Zimbabwe   edit  Introduction of the first dollar The first Zimbabwean dollar was introduced in 1980 and replaced the Rhodesian dollar at par  The initial ISO 4217 code was ZWD  At the time of its introduction  the Zimbabwean dollar was worth more than the U S  dollar  with ZWD 1   USD 1 47 However  the currency s value eroded rapidly over the years  On 26 July 2006  the parallel market value of the Zimbabwean dollar fell to one hundred to the British pound  6  Date of

the head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe  Dr  Gideon Gono  announced that  Zimbabwe will have a new currency next year   New banknotes and coins were to replace the then current Zimbabwean dollar  Gono did not provide a name for this new currency  In June 2006  Deputy Finance Minister David Chapfika stated that Zimbabwe had to achieve macroeconomic stability  i e   double digit inflation  before any new currency was introduced  The dollar was redenominated on 1 August 2006 at the rate of 1 revalued dollar   1000 old dollars  The new dollar was subdivided into 100 cents  although cents were not used in practice  Together with the redenomination  the government devalued the dollar by 60  against the US dollar  see exchange rate history table below   from 101 000 old dollars  101 revalued  to 250 revalued dollars  ISO originally assigned a new currency code of ZWN to this redenominated currency  but the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe could not deal with a currency change  Therefore the currency code remained  ZWD   7  The revaluation campaign  which Gideon Gono named  Operation Sunrise  was completed on 21 August 2006  It was estimated that some ten trillion old Zimbabwe dollars  22  of the money supply  were not redeemed during this period  8  On 12 December 2006  Gono hinted in a memorandum to banks and other financial institutions that he would lay out the next phase of his monetary reforms dubbed Project Sunrise Two when he announced the monetary policy review statement in January 2007  It was not possible to get immediate confirmation from Gono s office whether the memorandum was advice to banks that he would be launching the new currency in January  But the chief executive officer of one of the country s largest banks said industry players had understood the governor s memo to mean new money would be introduced next month  9  A possible name appeared to be  ivhu   which means  soil  in Shona  10  The following year  on 2 February 2007  the RBZ revealed that a new  third  dollar would be released soon and gave some details of the new banknotes  see below   However  with inflation at the time still in the four digits  the banknotes remained in storage  During the same month  the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe declared inflation illegal  outlawing any raise in prices on certain commodities between 1 March and 30 June 2007  Officials arrested executives of some Zimbabwean companies for increasing prices on their products  Economists consider such measures ineffective at eliminating the problem of high inflation  since high sustained inflation is a symptom of high  sustained growth in the money supply  11  12  Economist Eddie Cross reported on 15 June 2007 that  There is talk that the Reserve Bank will cut another three zeros off our currency next week and this would mean that one Zimbabwe dollar would now equal one million of the old dollars  Chaos reigns in commerce and industry and those in the public sector are frantic   13  The Zimbabwe dollar was again devalued on 6 September 2007  this time by 92   14  to give an official exchange rate of ZW 30 000 to US 1  although the black market exchange rate was estimated to be ZW 600 000 to US 1  15  Meanwhile the WM Reuters company introduced a notional exchange rate  ISO ZWN  which more accurately reflected black market exchange rates  Since there was a shortage of foreign exchange in the country the official rate was nearly impossible to obtain  The method of calculation was based on Purchasing Power Parity utilising the dual listing of companies on the Harare  ZH  and London Stock exchanges  LN   citation needed  In particular  the Old Mutual Implied Rate  OMIR  was calculated by dividing the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange price of shares of the insurance company named  Old Mutual  by the London Stock Exchange Price for the same share  16   edit  Introduction of the third dollar The 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar banknote  1014 dollars   equal to 1027 pre 2006 dollars  Reserve bank governor Gideon Gono announced on 30 July 2008 that the Zimbabwean dollar would be redenominated  17  Effective 1 August 2008  ZW 10 billion would be worth ZW 1  the new currency code was ZWR  17  The planned denominations to be issued are coins valued Z 5  Z 10 and Z 25 and banknotes worth Z 5  Z 10  Z 20  Z 100 and Z 500  18  While the German firm of Giesecke  amp  Devrient was no longer printing Zimbabwean currency  The Daily Telegraph reported that the new currency was printed before the relationship was severed and had been kept in storage since then  19  Due to frequent cash shortages and the worthless Zimbabwean dollar  foreign currency was effectively legalised as a de facto currency on 13 September 2008 via a special program to officially license a number of retailers to accept foreign money  20  This reflected the reality of the dollarisation of the economy  with many shop keepers refusing to accept Zimbabwe dollars and requesting U S  dollars or South African rand instead  21  22  Despite redenomination  the RBZ was forced to print banknotes of ever higher values to keep up with surging inflation  with ten zeros reappearing by the end of 2008  see below    edit  Introduction of the fourth dollar On 2 February 2009  the RBZ announced that a further 12 zeros were to be taken off the currency  with 1 000 000 000 000  third  Zimbabwe dollars being exchanged for 1 new  fourth  dollar  23  New banknotes were introduced with a face value of Z 1  Z 5  Z 10  Z 20  Z 50  Z 100 and Z 500  24  The banknotes of the fourth dollar circulated alongside the third dollar  which had to remain legal tender until 30 June 2009  25  The new currency code was ZWL  26  The Zimbabwean dollar had become largely irrelevant  with the economy being almost completely dollarized  27  Even the national postal service  Zimpost  was said to be charging customers postage in US Dollars  even though some of the stamps were in Zimbabwean Dollar denomination  Zimbabwe finance minister  Tendai Biti  said in his first budget report   The death of the Zimbabwe dollar is a reality we have to live with  Since October 2008 our national currency has become moribund   28  In late January 2009  acting Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa announced that all Zimbabweans would be allowed to conduct business in any currency as a response to the hyperinflation crisis  29  On 12 April 2009  media outlets reported that economic planning minister Elton Mangoma had announced the suspension of the local currency  for at least a year   effectively terminating the fourth dollar  4  30   edit  Inflation v t e Zimbabwean inflation rates  official  since independence Date Rate Date Rate Date Rate Date Rate Date Rate Date Rate 1980 7  1985 10  1990

using the United States dollar  the euro  the pound sterling  the South African rand  or the Botswana pula instead  Early in the 21st century  Zimbabwe started to experience hyperinflation  Inflation reached 623  in January 2004  then fell back to low triple digits in 2004 before surging to 1 281 1  in 2006  31  32  Inflation reached another record high of 3714   year on year  in April 2007  33  The monthly rate for April 2007 exceeded 100   implying that inflation may soon exceed all forecasts  as 100  monthly inflation over sustained 12 months would produce annual inflation of over 400 000   Mid year inflation for 2007 has been breaching records as inflation for May 2007 was estimated at 4 530   year on year   34  On 21 June 2007  the United States ambassador to Zimbabwe  Christopher Dell  told The Guardian newspaper that inflation could reach 1 5 million percent by the end of the year  The unofficial inflation rate at that time was above 11 000   and the black market exchange rate was Z 400 000 to the pound  35  On 13 July 2007  the Zimbabwean government said it had temporarily stopped publishing  official  inflation figures  a move that observers said was meant to draw attention away from  runaway inflation which has come to symbolise the country s unprecedented economic meltdown   36  On 27 July 2007  the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe  CCZ  said its recent calculations for the monthly expenditure for an urban family of six showed that inflation for the month of June was more than 13 000   The Central Statistical Office  CSO   the official source of Consumer Price Index numbers  had not released its figures since February  2007  when it reported annual inflation at 1 729   37  In September 2007  the Central Statistical Office announced an official inflation rate of 6 592 8  for August 2007  38  Private estimates were as high as 20 000   39  In October 2007  they announced an official inflation rate of 7 892 1  for September 2007  40  In November 2007  they announced an official inflation rate of 14 840 5  for October 2007  41   edit  Hyperinflation Official  black market  and OMIR exchange rates 1 Jan 2001 to 2 Feb 2009  Note the logarithmic scale  Main article  Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe On 27 November 2007  the chief statistician of the Central Statistical Office  Moffat Nyoni  announced that it would be impossible to calculate the inflation rate of the dollar any further  This was due to the lack of availability of basic goods  and subsequent lack of information from which to calculate the inflation rate  plus  most computers had an insufficient number of digits and software  The International Monetary Fund stated that inflation was predicted to rise to 100 000  per annum  42  On 14 February 2008  the Central Statistical Office announced that the inflation rate for December 2007 was 66 212 3   and the unofficial exchange rate was Z 7 1 million to the US 1  43  On 20 February 2008  the Central Statistical Office said that officially  inflation has in January 2008 gone past the 100 000  mark to 100 580 2   44  On 4 April 2008  the Financial Gazette  FinGaz  reported that officially  inflation in February 2008 jumped to 164 900 3   45  On 15 May 2008  the Zimbabwe Independent reported that officially  inflation in March 2008 jumped to 355 000   46  On 21 May 2008  SW Radio Africa reported that  according to an independent financial assessment  inflation in May 2008 jumped to 1 063 572 6   The state statistical service has said there are not enough goods in the shortage stricken shops to calculate any new  official  figures  47  On 26 June 2008  the Zimbabwe Independent reported that  latest figures from the Central Statistical Offices  CSO  showed that annual inflation rose by 7 336 000 percentage points to 9 030 000  by 20 June and was set to end the month at well above 10 500 000   48  The Sydney Morning Herald reported that inflation was likely to be 2 million percent in May 2008 and 10 15 million percent in June 2008  according to John Robertson  a respected Zimbabwean economist  49  Robertson estimated inflation in July 2008 to be 40 50 million percent  49  Inflation can only be estimated because of the impossibility of following the cost of individual goods  49  According to Central Statistical Office statistics  annual inflation rate rose to 231 million percent in July 2008  The month on month rate rose to 2 600 2   50  By December 2008  annual inflation was estimated at 650 million googol percent  6 5   10108 percent   51  equivalent to a daily inflation rate of 96   As predicted by the quantity theory of money  this hyperinflation has been caused primarily by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe s choice to mushroom the money supply  Since February 2009  following a period of hyperinflation and widespread rejection of the devalued currency  companies and individuals are permitted to transact domestic business in other currencies  such as the US  or the South African rand  In consequence  the Zimbabwean economy has undergone dollarisation 52  and the Zimbabwean dollar has fallen out of everyday use  53   edit  Money supply  2006 2008  100 million Zimbabwean dollars On 16 February 2006  the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe  Gideon Gono  announced that the government had printed ZW 20 5 trillion in order to buy foreign currency to pay off IMF arrears  54  In early May 2006  Zimbabwe s government announced that they would produce another ZW 60 trillion  55  The additional currency was required to finance the recent 300  salary increase for soldiers and policemen and 200  increase for other civil servants  The money was not budgeted for the current fiscal year  and the government did not say where it would come from  On 29 May  Reserve Bank officials told IRIN that plans to print about ZW 60 trillion  about US 592 9 million at official rates  were briefly delayed after the government failed to secure foreign currency to buy ink and special paper for printing money  In late August 2006  it was reported that about ZW 10 trillion old dollars  22  of the money supply  had not been exchanged for revalued dollars  These bearer cheques were demonetised  On 27 June 2007  it was announced that central bank governor Gideon Gono had been ordered by President Robert Mugabe to print an additional ZWD 1 trillion to cater for civil servants  and soldiers  salaries that were hiked by 600  and 900  respectively  56  On 28 July 2007  it was reported that Mugabe has said that Zimbabwe will go on printing money if there is not enough for underfunded municipal projects  57  On 30 August 2007  it was reported that an additional ZW 3 trillion had been printed to pay for 500 000 scotch carts and 800 000 ox drawn ploughs plus an unspecified number of cattle  58  On 3 September 2007  it was reported that the black market in Zimbabwe is once again booming despite price controls  People who previously were employed for US 11  ZW 2 Million  a month are now able to turn as much as US 166  ZW 30 Million  just through black market trading  59  On 24 November 2007  it was reported that money supply was now  58 trillion revalued Zimbabwean dollars  ZWD  60    41 million US at parallel rates   However  Zimbabwe banks could only account for  1 to  2 trillion of those dollars  meaning that members of the public were holding  56 to  57 trillion in cash  On 4 January 2008  it was reported that money supply had been increased by  33 trillion  to  100 trillion  61  revalued Zimbabwean dollars  ZWD  62  Further  the demonetisation of the  200 000 bearer cheques was put on hold  thus increasing the money supply  A selection of Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe bearer cheques printed between July 2007 to July 2008  now expired  that illustrate the hyperinflation rate in Zimbabwe  The planned issue of additional banknotes  denominations of ZWD 1  5  and 10 Million  on 18 January 2008 will increase the money supply by an unknown amount  On 21 January 2008  it was reported  by Gideon Gono  that the money supply had been increased to ZW 170 trillion since the middle of December  Further  Gono expected it to reach  800 trillion by 28 January 2008  63  On 1 March 2008  it was reported that documents obtained by The Sunday Times show the Munich company Giesecke  amp  Devrient  G amp D  was receiving more than  500 000   382 000  a week for delivering bank notes equivalent to  170 trillion a week  The regime is surviving by printing money  at this stage there is no other way      Martin Rupiya  professor  war and security studies   University of Zimbabwe  According to a source at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe  G amp D was delivering 432 000 sheets of banknotes every week to Fidelity printers in Harare  where they were stamped with the denomination  Each sheet contains 40 notes and the current production is entirely in Z 10M notes  64  On 1 July 2008  Giesecke  amp  Devrient responded to pressure from the German government by suspending production of bank notes for Zimbabwe  65  66  In the Guardian  on 18 July 2008  a report on Zimbabwe s inflation  said that an egg costs ZW 50 billion  GBP 0 17  USD 0 32   and it showed adverts for prizes of Z 100 trillion in a Zimbabwean derby and ZW 1 2 quadrillion   1 200 000 000 000 000 00  approx  GBP 2 100  USD 4 200

providing the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe with the licences and software required to design and print Zimbabwe currency  68  69  The company  named Jura JSP  said it would consider ending its supply of licences and software if the European Union required it to do so  68  Without the licences and software  the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe may be unable to print notes in larger denominations than are already in circulation  69  On 24 July 2008  the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe announced that  appropriate measures are being put in place to address the current setbacks being faced on the currency front  as well as on financial and accounting systems   70  It promised that in  the next few days  it would institute changes to the minimum cash withdrawal limits and IT systems  constraints  70  Currently  the government limits cash withdrawals to ZW 100 billion per day  which is less than the cost of a loaf of bread  70  IT systems cannot handle such large numbers  the automated teller machines for one major bank give a  data overflow error  and freeze customers attempt to withdraw money with so many zeros  71  That same day  the Institute of Commercial Management reported that ZW 1 2 trillion is worth the same as one British pound  72  From January to December 2008  the money supply growth rose from 81 143  to 658 billion percent  73  Date 2006 2007 2008 July August September November

edit  Abandonment The use of foreign currencies were legalised in January 2009  causing general consumer prices to stabilise again after years of hyperinflation and price speculation  52  The move led to a sharp drop in the usage of the Zimbabwean dollar  as hyperinflation rendered even the highest denominations worthless  On 2 February 2009 the Zimbabwean dollar was redenominated once more  at the ratio of 1 000 000 000 000  1012  ZWR to 1 ZWL  The third dollar was expected to be demonetised on 1 July 2009  74  but the complete abandonment of local currency was hastened by the decline in overall consumer usage of local currency in favour of other currencies  helped by the legalisation of the use of hard currencies in January 2009  The dollar was effectively abandoned as an official currency on 12 April 2009 when the Economic Planning Minister Elton Mangoma confirmed the suspension of the national currency for at least a year  but exchange rates with the Zimbabwean dollar were maintained for up to a year afterwards  The current government of Zimbabwe said that the Zimbabwean currency should only be reintroduced if the industrial output was 60  or more of its capacity

dollar  and a bimetallic 5 dollar coin was introduced  Plans by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe  for new Z 5 000 and Z 10 000 coins were announced in June 2005  76  However  the coins never appeared  All old coins dating from the first dollar were reintroduced at face value to the third dollar in Aug 2008  effectively increasing their value 10 trillion fold  and new  10 and  25 coins were introduced  These coins were minted in 2003 but only issued with the redenomination  77   edit  Banknotes  traveller s cheques  and bearer cheques This section may be too long to read and navigate comfortably  Please consider moving more of the content into sub articles and using this article for a summary of the key points of the subject   January 2010  Main article  Banknotes of Zimbabwe  8 worth of Zimbabwean dollars in 2003  The banknotes of the Zimbabwean dollar were issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 2009  Up to 2003 regular banknotes were issued but as hyperinflation developed from 2003  the Reserve Bank issued short lived emergency travellers cheques  which were then quickly superseded by time limited Bearer Cheques  in denominations ranging from  5 000 to  20 000 in 2003  then up to  100 000 dollars by early 2006  On 1 August 2006  new Bearer cheques with thirteen denominations ranging from 1  to  100 000 were issued following the first redenomination of the dollar  superseding the regular banknotes by 21 August 2006 and until August 2008  Bearer cheques of 5 000 dollars  dated 1 February 2007  and 50 000  dated 1 March 2007  were issued in March 2007  followed by cheques of 200 000  dated 1 August 2007  in August 2007  Subsequently  Gideon Gono of the RBZ announced on 19 December 2007 that new bearer cheques  Z 250 000  Z 500 000  and Z 750 000  had been produced and would be released on 20 December  Additionally  the current high value bearer cheques  Z 200 000  would be demonetised as of 1 January 2008  78  However  due to ongoing problems  plans to demonetise this note were put on hold at the end of December  Since the Zimbabwean dollar was revalued in August 2006  there were repeated discussions and proposals regarding a further revaluation  As early as the beginning of 2007 it appeared that a revaluation was planned with new banknote designs being commissioned  79  New plans were announced in October 2007 80  They were initially postponed until 2008 before  in November 2007  the revaluation was described as  imminent  81  and would remove as many as four zeros from the currency and would be called Sunrise 2  82  83  However  on 18 December 2007  it was reported that a further printing of the current Z 200 000 bearer cheques had been produced  seemingly instead of revaluing  84  Further new issues of bearer cheques have since taken place  At a press conference on 16 January 2008  reserve bank Governor Gono stated that  With effect from Friday  January 18   the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is releasing the following bearer cheques into circulation  one million dollars  officially worth about US 33 22 euros but worth about 50c at the parallel rate   five million dollars and 10 million dollars   He continued      daily cash withdrawals have been increased from the current Z 50 million to Z 500 million per individual   Less than a month after announcing a similar move  Gono said the new notes would provide much needed relief to consumers who often have to go shopping with sacks of cash  85  The Zim Independent and Zim Online reported on 4 April 2008 that 25 and 50 million dollar bearer cheques were issued on 4 April  The RBZ also increased the maximum withdrawal limit for individuals to  5 billion a day  86  87  88  On 6 May 100 million dollar and 250 million dollar bearer cheques were issued and the official exchange rate was floated to counter black market speculation  89  10 days later  the RBZ announced that 500 million dollar bearer cheques and special agro cheques in the amounts of 5  25  and 50 billion dollars would be issued were to be issued on 20 May  On 14 July 2008 Giesecke  amp  Devrient ceased supplying bank note paper to Fidelity Printers  amp  Refiners  the Zimbabwean government owned company that printed Zimbabwean currency  90  Virtually incessant use of the currency printing presses have caused many of the machines to break down  and repair parts are no longer being shipped to Zimbabwe to repair the machines  90  The Reserve Bank issued the  100 billion Agro Cheque on 21 July  which were printed prior to the suspension  91  92  On 30 July 2008 the RBZ announced a new currency  effective 1 August 2008  removing 10 zeros from the monetary value  by  a factor of 1 to 10   93  Banknotes in the denominations of  1   5   10   20   100 and  500 were introduced and replaced bearer cheques and agro cheques by 31 December 2008  94  However  the familiar cycle of printing ever higher denomination notes to keep up with inflation continued despite redenomination  A  1 000 banknote was introduced by the RBZ on 19 September 2008  and ten days later  as the unofficial exchange rate surpassed 270 000 ZWD to the US dollar  it issued new notes in the denominations of  10 000 and  20 000  95  A  50 000 banknote was released on 13 October 2008  followed by  100 000   500 000  and  1 000 000 denominations announced on 3 November  96  The daily cash withdrawal limit was raised for individuals to Z 500 000 from Z 50 000 and for select companies it went up to  1 million  97  Banknotes valued at  10 million   50 million and  100 million were issued as the withdrawal limit was increased to  100 million per week on 4 December 2008  98  99  Scarcely four days later  on 8 December  the RBZ issued a  200 million banknote  100  and introduced a  500 million note on 12 December  worth approximately US 8 at the time  101  In little over half a year  the billion denomination returned  with the RBZ issuing banknotes of  1 billion   5 billion  and  10 billion on 19 December  102  Amid the continuing hyperinflation that rendered the currency virtually worthless  spurring the increasing dollarisation of the economy  the RBZ issued another set of new notes in denominations of  20 billion and  50 billion to be released 12 January  103  Stepping up another order of magnitude  the Reserve Bank introduced trillion denominated notes for the first time  unveiling banknotes valued at  10 trillion   20 trillion   50 trillion  and  100 trillion on 16 January  which were supposed to help citizens still in formal employment to withdraw a full month s worth of salary by showing a corresponding payslip  3  As even these notes became increasingly worthless  a media campaign was launched in South Africa using the notes as printing paper  104  On 2 February 2009 the dollar was revalued once more  this time in the ratio of 1 1012  105  and new banknotes of the fourth dollar  with seven denominations from  1 to  500  were issued  24  These banknotes circulated alongside the third dollar until the abandonment of the dollar on 12 April 2009   edit  Exchange rate history This table shows a condensed history of the foreign exchange rate of

popular currency conversion resources relied upon the official rate of 30 000 ZWD to 1 USD for published figures  in spite of the vast differences between that and free market rates  By 23 May 2008  Bloomberg 192  and Oanda 193  began publishing floating rates based on Zimbabwe s formally regulated domestic bank market  while Yahoo Finance started using the updated official rate in July  albeit with a decimal point shift of 6 places  Those reported rates generally reflected the Official Rate as shown in the above table  They soon began to differ  in overvaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar  increasingly substantially in comparison to less regulated markets such as offshore markets or paper cash freely traded on the streets of Harare  reflected above as Parallel Rates   edit  Devaluation of the third dollar On 1 August 2008  ten zeroes were removed from the currency  reducing 10 billion Zimbabwean dollars to one dollar  194  On 3 October 2008  the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe suspended
