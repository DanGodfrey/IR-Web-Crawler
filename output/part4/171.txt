parliamentary republic  23  member of the European Union  the Eurozone  the Schengen area  NATO  and OECD  24  Relative to its geography  history  economy  culture  and language  it is a very diverse country distinguished by a transitional character  25  Its capital and largest city is Ljubljana  26  The territory of Slovenia is mainly hilly or mountainous 27  and characterised by exceptionally high landscape 28  and biological 29  30  diversity and a mosaic structure  which are a result of natural attributes and the long lasting presence of humans  31  Four major European geographic units interweave here  the Alps  the Dinaric Alps  the Mediterranean  with a small portion of coastline along the Adriatic Sea  and the Pannonian Plain  27  32  The climate is temperate and significantly influenced by the variety of territory  with a strong interaction of the continental climate  the sub Mediterranean climate and Alpine climate across most of the country  33  The country is one of the water richest in Europe  34  with a dense river network  a rich aquifer system  and significant karstic underground watercourses  35  Over half of the territory is covered by forest  36  The settlement of Slovenia is dispersed and uneven  37  The Slavic  Germanic  Romance and Uralic linguistic and cultural groups have been meeting here  38  39  40  The dominant population is Slovene  but it has almost never been homogenous  41 Slovene is the only official language throughout the country  whereas Italian and Hungarian are regional minority languages  Roman Catholicism as well as Lutheranism have markedly influenced the formation of the Slovenian culture and identity  42  Nowadays  Slovenia is a largely secularised country  43  The economy of Slovenia is small  open  export

state formations  including the Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire  followed by the Habsburg Monarchy  In 1918  the Slovenes exercised self determination for the first time by co founding the internationally unrecognized State of Slovenes  Croats  and Serbs  which merged into Yugoslavia  During World War II  Slovenia was occupied and annexed by Germany  Italy  and Hungary only to emerge afterwards as a founding member of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  In 1991  after the introduction of multi party representative democracy  Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia

October 2009  Main article  History of Slovenia  edit  Prehistory to Slavic settlement Ancient menhir  probably of Celtic or Illyrian origin  in Krkav e  Slovenian Istria Slovene territory was inhabited in prehistoric times and there is evidence of human habitation around 250 000 years ago  A pierced cave bear bone  possibly the oldest known musical instrument in the world  has been discovered in Divje Babe cave near Cerkno  dating from the W rm glacial age when the area was inhabited by Neanderthals  50  In the Ljubljana Marshes  the remains of pile dwellings  which existed in the region for over 4 500 years  from 5000 to 500 BC  now protected as UNESCO World Heritage Site  have been discovered  51  as well as the oldest wooden wheel in the world  dated to between 5 100 and 5 350 years ago  52  In the transition period between the Bronze age to the Iron age  the Urnfield culture flourished  Numerous archeological remains dating from the Hallstatt period have been found in Slovenia  Novo Mesto  one of the most important archeological sites of the Hallstatt culture  has been nicknamed the  Town of Situlas  after numerous situlas found in the area  53  In the Iron Age  present day Slovenia was inhabited by Illyrian and Celtic tribes until the 1st century BC  when the Romans conquered the region establishing the provinces of Pannonia and Noricum  What is now western Slovenia was included directly under Roman Italia as part of the X region Venetia et Histria  The Romans established posts at Emona  Ljubljana   Poetovio  Ptuj  and Celeia  Celje  and constructed trade and military roads that ran across Slovene territory from Italy to Pannonia  In the 5th and 6th centuries  the area was exposed to invasions by the Huns and Germanic tribes during their incursions into Italy  After the departure of the last Germanic tribe   the Lombards   to Italy in 568  the Slavs from the East began to dominate the area  After the successful resistance against the nomadic Asian Avars  from 623 to 626   the Slavic people united with King Samo s tribal confederation  The confederation fell apart in 658 and the Slavic people  located in present day Carinthia  formed the independent duchy of Carantania  54   edit  The Middle Ages to Early Modern Period The installation of the Dukes in Carinthia  carried out in an ancient ritual in Slovene until 1414  In the mid 8th century  Carantania became a vassal duchy under the rule of the Bavarians  who began spreading Christianity  Three decades later  the Carantanians were incorporated  together with the Bavarians  into the Carolingian Empire  During the same period Carniola  too  came under the Franks  and was Christianized from Aquileia  Following the anti Frankish rebellion of Ljudevit Posavski at the beginning of the 9th century  the Franks removed the Carantanian princes  replacing them with their own border dukes  Consequently  the Frankish feudal system reached the Slovene territory  The Freising Manuscripts  dating from the 10th century  most probably written in upper Carinthia  are the oldest surviving documents in Slovene  The Magyar invasion of the Pannonian Plain in the late 9th century effectively isolated the Slovene inhabited territory from western Slavs  Thus  the Slavs of Carantania and of Carniola began developing into an independent Slovene ethnic group  After the victory of Emperor Otto I over the Magyars in 955  Slovene territory was divided into a number of border regions of the Holy Roman Empire  Carantania  being the most important  was elevated into the Duchy of Carinthia in 976  In the late Middle Ages the historic provinces of Carniola  Styria  Carinthia  Gorizia  Trieste and Istria developed from the border regions and incorporated into the medieval German state  The consolidation and formation of these historical lands took place in a long period between the 11th and 14th century being led by a number of important feudal families such as the Dukes of Spannheim  the Counts of Gorizia  the Counts of Celje and finally the House of Habsburg  In a parallel process  an intensive German colonization significantly diminished the extent of Slovene speaking areas  by the 15th century  the Slovene ethnic territory was reduced to its present size  54  In the 14th century  most of the territory of Slovenia was taken over by the Habsburgs  The counts of Celje  a feudal family from this area who in 1436 acquired the title of state princes  were their powerful competitors for some time  This large dynasty  important at a European political level  had its seat in Slovene territory but died out in 1456  Its numerous large estates subsequently became the property of the Habsburgs  who retained control of the area right up until the beginning of the 20th century  At the end of the Middle Ages  the Slovene Lands suffered a serious economic and demographic setback because of the Turkish raids  In 1515  a peasant revolt spread across nearly the whole Slovene territory and in 1572 3 the Croatian Slovenian peasant revolt wrought havoc throughout the wider region  Uprisings  which often met with bloody defeats  continued throughout the 17th century  54   edit  Reformation and emergence of national identity Protestant preacher Primo  Trubar  author of the first book in Slovene The first mentions of a common Slovene ethnic identity  transcending regional boundaries  date from the 16th century  55  when the Protestant Reformation spread throughout the Slovene Lands  During this period  the first books in Slovene were written by the Protestant preacher Primo  Trubar and his followers  establishing the base for the development of standard Slovene  In the second half of the 16th century  numerous books were printed in Slovene  including an integral translation of the Bible by Jurij Dalmatin  At the beginning of the 17th century  Protestantism was suppressed by the Habsburg sponsored Counter Reformation  which introduced the new aesthetics of Baroque culture  The Enlightenment in the Habsburg monarchy brought significant social and cultural progress to the Slovene people  It hastened economic development and facilitated the appearance of a middle class  Under the reign of Maria Theresa and Emperor Joseph II  1765 1790  many reforms were undertaken in the administration and society  including land reforms  the modernization of the Church and compulsory primary education in Slovene  1774   The start of cultural linguistic activities by Slovene intellectuals of the time brought about a national revival and the birth of the Slovene nation in the modern sense of the word  Before the Napoleonic Wars  some secular literature in Slovene emerged  During the same period  the first history of the Slovene Lands as an ethnic unity was written by Anton Toma  Linhart  while Jernej Kopitar compiled the first comprehensive grammar of Slovene  54  Peter Kozler s map of the Slovene Lands  designed during the Spring of Nations in 1848  became the symbol of the quest for a United Slovenia  Between 1809 and 1813  Slovenia was part of the Illyrian Provinces  an autonomous province of the Napoleonic French Empire  with Ljubljana as the capital  Although the French rule was short lived  it significantly contributed to the raise of national consciousness and political awareness of the Slovenes  After the fall of Napoleon  all Slovene Lands were once again included in the Austrian Empire  Gradually  a distinct Slovene national consciousness developed  and the quest for a political unification of all Slovenes became widespread  In the 1820s and 1840s  the interest in Slovene language and folklore grew enormously  with numerous philologists advancing the first steps towards a standardization of the language  Illyrian movement  Pan Slavic and Austro Slavic ideas gained importance  However  the intellectual circle around the philologist Matija  op and the Romantic poet France Pre eren was influential in affirming the idea of Slovene linguistic and cultural individuality  refusing the idea of merging the Slovenes into a wider Slavic nation  In 1848  a mass political and popular movement for the United Slovenia  Zedinjena Slovenija  emerged as part of the Spring of Nations movement within the Austrian Empire  Slovene activists demanded a unification of all Slovene speaking territories in a unified and autonomous Slovene kingdom within the Austrian Empire  citation needed  Although the project failed  it served as an almost undisputed platform of Slovene political activity in the following decades  In 1867  Slovene nationalist representatives gained a majority of votes in the Carniolan provincial elections  In the same year  the Austro Hungarian monarchy was established by splitting the Austrian Empire into two parts  Most of the territory of present day Slovenia remained in the Austrian part of the monarchy  while Prekmurje was included in the Hungarian part  By the end of the 19th century industry had developed considerably in Slovenia and the population had become as socially differentiated as in other European nations  At the turn of the 20th century  hundreds of thousands of Slovenes emigrated to other countries  mostly to the United States  but also to South America  Germany  Egypt  and to larger cities in the Austro Hungarian Empire  especially Zagreb and Vienna  It has been calculated that around 300 000 Slovenes emigrated between 1880 and 1910  which means that one in six Slovenes left their homeland   edit

Battles of the Isonzo World War I resulted in heavy casualties for Slovenes  particularly on the twelve Battles of the Isonzo  which took place in what is nowadays Slovenia s western border area  Hundreds of thousands of Slovene conscripts were drafted in the Austro Hungarian Army  and over 30 000 of them lost their lives  Hundreds of thousands of Slovenes from Gorizia and Gradisca were resettled in refugee camps in Italy and Austria  While the refugees in Austria received a decent treatment  the Slovene refugees in Italian camps were treated as state enemies  and several thousands died of malnutrition and diseases between 1915 and 1918  56  Entire areas of the Slovenian Littoral were destroyed   edit  In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia See also  Creation of Yugoslavia  Carinthian Plebiscite  and Rudolf Maister The proclamation of the State of Slovenes  Croats and Serbs at Congress Square in Ljubljana on 20 October 1918 The Slovene People s Party launched a movement for self determination  demanding the creation of a semi independent South Slavic state under Habsburg rule  The proposal was picked up by most Slovene parties  and a mass mobilization of Slovene civil society  known as the Declaration Movement  followed  57  This proposal was rejected by the Austrian political elites  but following the dissolution of Austro Hungarian Empire in the aftermath of the First World War  a National Council of Slovenes  Croats and Serbs took power in Zagreb on 6 October 1918  On 29 October independence was declared by a national gathering in Ljubljana  and by the Croatian parliament  declaring the establishment of the new State of Slovenes  Croats and Serbs  On 1 December 1918 the State of Slovenes  Croats and Serbs merged with Serbia  becoming part of the new Kingdom of Serbs  Croats and Slovenes  itself being renamed in 1929 to Kingdom of Yugoslavia  The main territory of Slovenia  being the most industrialized and westernized among others less developed parts of Yugoslavia became the main center of industrial production  in comparison to Serbia  for example  in Slovenia the industrial production was four times greater and even twenty two times greater than in Yugoslav Macedonia  The interwar period brought a further industrialization in Slovenia  with a rapid economic growth in the 1920s followed by a relatively successful economic adjustment to the 1929 economic crisis  Following a plebiscite in October 1920  Slovene speaking southern Carinthia was ceded to Austria  With the Treaty of Trianon  on the other hand  Kingdom of Yugoslavia was awarded the Slovene inhabited Prekmurje region  formerly part of Austro Hungary  as well  Slovenes whose territory fell under the rule of neighboring states Italy  Austria and Hungary  were subjected to policies of forced assimilation and in case of Fascist Italy violent Fascist Italianization   edit  Fascist Italianization of Littoral Slovenes and resistance See also  Treaty of Rapallo  1920   Julian March  and TIGR The Narodni dom  the Community Hall of ethnic Slovenes in Trieste  burned down by the Fascist squads in June 1920  became the symbol of Fascist Italianization  The Slovenes living under territories annexed to Italy in 1920  Slovenian Littoral  lacked any minorirty protection under international or domestic law  58  Clashes between the local Slovene population on one side and the Italian authorities and Fascist squads on the other started already in 1920  culminating with the burning of the Narodni dom  the Slovenian National Hall of Trieste  After the Fascist takeover in 1922  a policy of violent Fascist Italianization followed  seeking to eradicate the Slovene middle class and the intelligentsia  Education in Slovene was abolished in 1923  Slovene surnames and personal names were Italianized between 1926 and 1932  By 1927  all Slovene associations were banned and all public use of Slovene was prohibited  Police violence was carried out against opponents of the Fascist regime  By the mid 1930s  around 70 000 Slovenes had fled the region  mostly to Yugoslavia and South America  After the complete destruction of all Slovene minority organizations in Italy  the militant anti fascist organizations TIGR was formed in 1927 in order to fight Fascist violence  Acts of anti Fascist guerrilla continued throughout the late 1920s and 1930s   edit  World War II

Fascist Italy occupied southern Slovenia and Ljubljana  Nazi Germany got northern and eastern Slovenia  while Horthy s Hungary was awarded the Prekmurje region  Some villages in Lower Carniola were annexed by the Independent State of Croatia  The Nazis started a policy of violent Germanisation and more than 83 000 Slovenes were transported to labor camps in the Third Reich  to German regions and to Nazi concentration camps 59  Many were sent into exile to Nedi  s Serbia and Croatia  Some 30 000 Slovenes were drafted to the Wehrmacht  and almost a quarter of them lost their lives on various European battlefields  mostly on the Eastern Front  60  The Italian occupation policy in the Province of Ljubljana gave Slovenes cultural autonomy  The Province was annexed to Italy and the Fascist system was systematically introduced in the region  In Summer of 1941  a resistance movement led by the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation  emerged in both the Italian and in the German occupation zones  61  The resistance  albeit pluralistic at the beginning  was gradually taken over by the Communist Party  as in the rest of occupied Yugoslavia  61  Its armed wing were the Slovene Partisans  61  The guerilla warfare mostly took place in the Italian occupation zone  The Italian Army reacted with brutal repression  which included war crimes against the civilian population  including summary executions of civilians and destruction of whole villages  More than 30 000 Slovenes  around 7 5  of the whole pupoulation of the Province  were interned into the Rab and the Gonars concentration camps  62  63  64  German soldiers executing a civilian near Medvode in Upper Carniola  in late August 1941 In 1942  Ljubljana  which emerged as one of the centers of passive resistance against occupation  was encircled by barb wire in an attempt to cut the connections between the underground resistance in the town and the partisan guerrilla in the countryside  These measures proved unsuccessful in preventing the spread of the resistance  which by 1943 was active throughout the Italian occupied Slovenia  as well as in many areas under German occupation  In the summer of 1942  a civil war between Slovenes broke out  The two fighting factions were the Slovenian Partisans and the Italian sponsored anti communist militia  known as the White Guard  later re organized under Nazi command as the Slovene Home Guard  Small units of Slovenian Chetniks also existed in Lower Carniola and Styria  The Partisans were under the command of the Liberation Front  OF  and Tito s Yugoslav resistance  while the Slovenian Covenant served as the political arm of the anti Communist militia  The civil war was mostly restricted to the Province of Ljubljana  where more than 80  of the Slovene anti partisan units were active  Between 1943 1945  smaller anti Communist militia existed in parts of the Slovenian Littoral and in Upper Carniola  while they were virtually non existent in the rest of the country  By 1945  the total number of Slovene anti Communist militamen reached 17 500  65  Immediately after the war  some 12 000 members of the Slovene Home Guard were killed in the area of the Ko evski Rog  while thousands of anti communist civilians were killed in the first year after the war  66  In addition  hundreds of ethnic Italians from the Julian March were killed by the Yugoslav Army and partisan forces in the Foibe massacres  some 27 000 Istrian Italians fled Slovenian Istria from Communist persecution in the so called Istrian exodus  Members of the ethnic German minority either fled or were expelled from Slovenia  The overall number of World War II casualties in Slovenia is estimated at 89 000  including between 20 000 and 25 000 Slovene civilians killed by the occupation forces     tag ref The figure includes the Carinthian Slovene victims  www ds rs si dokumenti publikacije Zbornik 05 1 pdf lt  ref gt  while 14 000 people were killed immediately after the end of the war  66  BIn addition  tens of thousands of Slovenes left their homeland soon after the end of the world  Most of them settled in Argentina  Canada  Australia and in the USA   edit  The Socialist period Square of the Republic in Ljubljana  built in 1975 as Square of the Revolution to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Communist takeover in Slovenia and Yugoslavia Following the re establishment of Yugoslavia during World War II  Slovenia became part of Federal Yugoslavia  A socialist state was established  but because of the Tito Stalin split in 1948  economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the Eastern Bloc  In 1947  Italy ceded most of the Julian March to Yugoslavia  and Slovenia thus regained the Slovenian Littoral  From the 1950s  Slovenia enjoyed a relatively wide autonomy  Between 1945 and 1948  a wave of political repressions took place in Slovenia and in Yugoslavia  By 1947  all private property had been nationalised  Between 1949 and 1953  a forced collectivisation was attempted  After its failure  a policy of gradual liberalisation followed  A new economic policy  known as workers self management started to be implemented under the advice and supervision of the main theorist of the Yugoslav Communist Party  the Slovene Edvard Kardelj  In 1956  Josip Broz Tito  together with other leaders  founded the Non Aligned Movement  Slovenia s economy developed rapidly  particularly in the 1950s when the country was strongly industrialised  Despite restrictive economic and social legislation within Yugoslavia  Slovenia managed to preserve a high level of economic development with a skilled workforce  working discipline and organisation  After the economic reform and further economic decentralisation of Yugoslavia in 1965 and 1966 Slovenia was approaching a market economy  Its domestic product was 2 5 times the average  which strengthened national confidence among the Slovenes  After the death of Tito in 1980  the economic and political situation in Yugoslavia became very strained  54  Political disputes around economic measures were echoed in the public sentiment  as many Slovenians felt they were being economically exploited  having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration  citation needed   edit  Democracy and independence The first clear demand for Slovene independence was made in 1987 by a group of intellectuals in the 57th edition of the magazine Nova revija  Demands for democratisation and increase of Slovenian independence were sparked off  A mass democratic movement  coordinated by the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights  pushed the Communists in the direction of democratic reforms  These revolutionary events in Slovenia pre dated by almost one year the Revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe  but went largely unnoticed by international observers  In September 1989  numerous constitutional amendments were passed  which introduced parliamentary democracy to Slovenia  67  68  On 7 March 1990  the Slovenian Assembly changed the official name of the state to the Republic of Slovenia  69  70  In April 1990  the first democratic election in Slovenia took place and the united opposition movement DEMOS led by Jo e Pu nik emerged victorious  On 23 December 1990  more than 88  of the electorate voted for a sovereign and independent Slovenia  71  72  On 25 June  Slovenia became an independent country through the passage of appropriate legal documents  and on 26 June 1991  Milan Ku an solemnly proclaimed the independence at the Republic Square in Ljubljana  2

Forces  In 2008  military spending was an estimated 1 5  of the country s GDP  84  Since joining NATO  the Slovenian Armed Forces have taken an even more active part in supporting international peace  Their activities comprise the participation of Slovenian Armed Forces members in peace support operations and humanitarian activities  Among others  Slovenian soldiers are a part of international forces serving in Bosnia and Herzegovina  Kosovo  and Afghanistan  85   edit  Administrative divisions Main articles  Statistical regions of Slovenia and Municipalities of Slovenia Officially  Slovenia is subdivided into 211 municipalities  eleven of which have the status of urban municipalities   The municipalities are the only body of local autonomy in Slovenia  Besides  there also exist 62 administrative districts  officially called  Administrative Units   upravne enote   which are not a body of local self government  but territorial sub units of government administration  The Administrative Units are named after their capital  and are headed by a Head of the Unit  na elnik upravne enote   appointed by the Minister of Public Administration  Each municipality is headed by a Mayor   upan   elected every 4 years by popular vote  and a Municipal Council  ob inski svet   In the majority of the municipalities  the municipal council is elected through the system of proportional representation  only few smaller municipalities use the plurality voting system  In the urban municipalities  the municipal councils are called Town  or City  Councils  86  Every municipality also has a Head of the Municipal Administration  na elnik ob inske uprave   appointed by the Mayor  who is responsible for the functioning of the local administration  86  Despite the lack of any intermediate unit between the municipalities and the State  regional identity is strong in Slovenia  The traditional regions of Slovenia  based on the former four Habsburg crown lands

See also  Protected areas of Slovenia Topographic map of Slovenia Slovenia is situated in Central and Southeastern Europe touching the Alps and bordering the Mediterranean  It lies between latitudes 45  and 47  N  and longitudes 13  and 17  E  The 15th meridian east almost corresponds to the middle line of the country in the direction west east  88  The Geometrical Centre of the Republic of Slovenia is located at coordinates 46 07 11 8  N and 14 48 55 2  E  89  It lies in Slivna in the Municipality of Litija  90  Slovenia s highest peak is Triglav  2 864 m 9 396 ft   the country s average height above sea level is 557 m  1 827 ft   Four major European geographic regions meet in Slovenia  the Alps  the Dinarides  the Pannonian Plain  and the Mediterranean  Although on the shore of the Adriatic Sea  near the Mediterranean  most of Slovenia is in the Black Sea drainage basin  The Alps including the Julian Alps  the Kamnik Savinja Alps and the Karavanke chain  as well as the Pohorje massif dominate Northern Slovenia along its long border with Austria  Slovenia s Adriatic coastline stretches approximately 47 km  29 mi  91  from Italy to Croatia  The term  Karst topography  refers to that of southwestern Slovenia s Kras Plateau  a limestone region of underground rivers  gorges  and caves  between Ljubljana and the Mediterranean  On the Pannonian plain to the East and Northeast  toward the Croatian and Hungarian borders  the landscape is essentially flat  However  the majority of Slovenian terrain is hilly or mountainous  with around 90  of the surface 200 m  656 ft  or more above sea level  Over half of the country  10 124 km2 3 909 sq mi  is covered by forests  This makes Slovenia the third most forested country in Europe  after Finland and Sweden  The areas are covered mostly by beech  fir beech and beech oak forests and have a relatively high production capacity  92  Remnants of primeval forests are still to be found  the largest in the Ko evje area  Grassland covers 5 593 km2  2 159 sq mi  and fields and gardens  954 km2 368 sq mi   There are 363 km2  140 sq mi  of orchards and 216 km2  83 sq mi  of vineyards   edit  Geology This section requires expansion  Slovenia is in a rather active seismic zone because of its position to the south of the Eurasian Plate  93  Thus the country is at the junction of three important tectonic zones  the Alps to the north  the Dinaric Alps to the south and the Pannonian Basin to the east  93  Scientists have been able to identify 60 destructive earthquakes in the past  Additionally  a network of seismic stations is active throughout the country  93  Many parts of Slovenia have a carbonate ground  and an extensive subterranean system has developed   edit  Natural regions Landscape types in Slovenia   Alpine landscape   Panonnian landscape   Dinaric landscape   Mediterranean landscape The first regionalisations of Slovenia were made by geographers Anton Melik  1935 1936  and Svetozar Ile i   1968   The newer regionalisation by Ivan Gams divides Slovenia in the following macroregions  the Alps  visokogorske Alpe  the Prealpine Hills  predalpsko hribovje  the Ljubljana Basin  Ljubljanska kotlina  Submediterranean  Littoral  Slovenia  submediteranska   primorska Slovenija  the Dinaric Karst of inner Slovenia  dinarski kras notranje Slovenije  Subpannonian Slovenia  subpanonska Slovenija  According to a newer natural geographic regionalisation  the country consists of four macroregions  These are the Alpine  the Mediterranean  the Dinaric  and the Pannonian landscapes  Macroregions are defined according to major relief units  the Alps  the Pannonian plain  the Dinaric mountains  and climate types  submediterranean  temperate continental  mountain climate   94  These are often quite interwoven  Protected areas of Slovenia include national parks  regional parks  and nature parks  the largest of which is Triglav National Park  There are 286 Natura 2000 designated protected areas

climate is also influenced by the variety of relief  and the influence of the Alps and the Adriatic Sea  In the Northeast  the continental climate type with greatest difference between winter and summer temperatures prevails  In the coastal region  there is sub Mediterranean climate  The effect of the sea on the temperature rates is visible also up the So a valley  while a severe Alpine climate is present in the high mountain regions  There is a strong interaction between these three climatic systems across most of the country  96  97  Precipitation varies across the country as well  with over 3500 mm in some Western regions and dropping down to 800 mm in Prekmurje  Snow is quite frequent in winter and the record snow cover in Ljubljana was recorded in 1952 at 146 cm  Compared to Western Europe  Slovenia is not very windy  because it lies in the slipstream of the Alps  The average wind speeds are lower than in the plains of the nearby countries  Due to the rugged terrain  local vertical winds with daily periods are present  Besides these  there are three winds of particular regional importance  the bora  the jugo  and the foehn  The jugo and the bora are characteristic of the Littoral  Whereas jugo is humid and warm  bora is usually cold and gusty  The foehn is typical of the Alpine regions in the north of Slovenia  Generally present in Slovenia are the northeast wind  the southeast wind and the north wind  98   edit  Biodiversity Olm can be found in Postojna cave and others caves in country Slovenia is distinguished by an exceptionally wide variety of habitats  30  due to the contact of geological units and biogeographical regions  but also due to human influences  Because of pollution and degradation of environment  the diversity has been in decline  Slovenia is the third most forested country in Europe  with 58 5  of the territory covered by forests  99  The forests are an important natural resource  but logging is kept to a minimum  as Slovenians also value their forests for the preservation of natural diversity  for enriching the soil and cleansing the water and air  for the social and economic benefits of recreation and tourism  and for the natural beauty they give to the Slovenian landscape  In the interior of the country are typical Central European forests  predominantly oak and beech  In the mountains  spruce  fir  and pine are more common  Pine trees also grow on the Kras plateau  although only one third of the region is now covered by pine forest  The lime linden tree  also common in Slovenian forests  is a national symbol The tree line is at 1 700 to 1 800 metres  or 5 575 to 5 900 ft   100  The fauna includes marmots  Alpine ibex  and chamois  There are numerous deer  roe deer  boar  and hares  101  The edible dormouse is often found in the Slovenian beech forests  Trapping these animals is a long tradition and is a part of the Slovenian national identity  102  Some important carnivores include the Eurasian lynx  reintroduced to the Ko evje area in 1973   European wild cats  foxes  especially the red fox   and European jackal  103  There are also hedgehogs  martens  and snakes such as vipers

average  114  Slovenia today is a developed country that enjoys prosperity and stability  as well as a GDP per capita substantially higher than that of the other transitioning economies of Central Europe  which is approximately at the same level as New Zealand  citation needed  Slovenia benefits from a well educated and productive work force and its position at the crossroad of major trade routes  115  There is however a big difference in prosperity between Western Slovenia  Ljubljana  the Slovenian Littoral and Upper Carniola  with a GDP per capita at 106 7  of the EU average  which is at the level of certain prosperous European areas such as East Flanders  Outer London or Alsace  and South Eastern Slovenia  Inner Carniola  Lower Carniola  Slovenian Styria  Slovenian Carinthia and Prekmurje   which has a GDP per capita at 72 5  of the EU average  comparable to the poorest regions of Spain or Italy  such as Extremadura or Basilicata  The economically most prosperous regions of Slovenia are Central Slovenia and the Slovenian Littoral  while the poorest are Prekmurje  the Central Sava Valley and Slovenian Carinthia  116  Although Slovenia has taken a cautious  deliberate approach to economic management and reform  with heavy emphasis on achieving consensus before proceeding  its overall record is one of success  clarification needed  citation needed  Slovenia s trade is oriented towards other EU countries  mainly Germany  Austria  Italy  and France  This is the result of a wholesale reorientation of trade toward the West and the growing markets of central and eastern Europe in the face of the collapse of its Yugoslav markets  Slovenia s economy is highly dependent on foreign trade  Since 2007 Slovenia is part of a monetary union  the Eurozone  dark blue  Trade equals about 120  of GDP  exports and imports combined   About two thirds of Slovenia s trade is with EU members This high level of openness makes it extremely sensitive to economic conditions in its main trading partners and changes in its international price competitiveness  However  despite the economic slowdown in Europe in 2001 03  Slovenia maintained 3  GDP growth  Keeping labour costs in line with productivity is thus a key challenge for Slovenia s economic well being  and Slovenian firms have responded by specialising in mid  to high tech manufacturing  Industry and construction comprise over one third of GDP  A big portion of the economy remains in state hands and foreign direct investment  FDI  in Slovenia is one of the lowest in the EU per capita  Taxes are relatively high  the labor market is seen by business interests as being inflexible  and industries are losing sales to China  India  and elsewhere  117  During the 2000s  decade   privatisation was seen in the banking  telecommunications  and public utility sectors  Also  restrictions on foreign investment are being dismantled  and foreign direct investment  FDI  is expected to increase  Slovenia is the economic front runner of the countries that joined the European Union in 2004  It was the first new member to adopt the euro on 1 January 2007  and it was the first new member to hold the presidency of the European Union in the first half of 2008  In the financial crisis of the late 2000s  decade   the Slovenian economy suffered a major setback  In 2009  the Slovenian GDP per capita shrank by 7 33   which was the biggest fall in the European Union after the Baltic countries and Finland  Unemployment rose from 5 1  in 2008 to 11 1  in November 2010  118  which was above the average in the European Union  and was still rising  119  120  The total national debt of Slovenia at the end of September 2011 amounted to 15 884 million euros or 44 4  of GDP  121   edit  Energetics

Tourism in Slovenia Postojna Cave Piran  a port town in southwestern Slovenia on the Gulf of Piran Lake Bled  one of the most popular tourist destinations in Slovenia Slovenia offers tourists a wide variety of natural and cultural amenities  Different forms of tourism have developed  The tourist gravitational area is considerably large  however the tourist marked is small  There has been no large scale tourism and no acute environmental pressures  122  The nation s capital  Ljubljana  has many important Baroque and Vienna Secession buildings  with several important works of the native born architect Jo e Ple nik  123  At the North Western corner of the country lie the Julian Alps with the picturesque Lake Bled and the So a Valley  as well as the nation s highest peak  Mount Triglav in the middle of Triglav National Park  Other mountain ranges include Kamnik Savinja Alps  Karavanke and Pohorje  popular with skiers and hikers  124  The Karst Plateau in the Slovenian Littoral gave its name to karst  a landscape shaped by water dissolving the carbonate bedrock  forming caves  The most famous caves are the Postojna Caves with more than 28 million visitors  and the UNESCO listed  kocjan Caves  The region Slovenian Istria meets the Adriatic Sea  where the most important historical monument is the Venetian Gothic Mediterranean town of Piran while the settlement of Portoro  attracts crowds in summer  125  The hills around Slovenia s second largest town  Maribor  are renowned for their wine making  The northeastern part of the country is rich with spas  126  with Roga ka

motorway The Port of Koper The location at the junction of the Mediterranean  the Alps  the Dinarides and the Pannonian Plain and the area being traversed by major rivers have been the reasons for the intersection of the main transport routes in Slovenia  Their course was established already in the Antiquity  A particular geographic advantage in recent times has been the location of the intersection of the Pan European transport corridors V  the fastest link between the North Adriatic  and Central and Eastern Europe  and X  linking Central Europe with the Balkans  in the country  This gives it a special position in the European social  economic and cultural integration and restructuring  132  With the share of over 80   the road freight and passenger transport constitutes the largest part of transport in Slovenia  133  Personal cars are much more popular than public road passenger transport  which has significantly declined  133  134 Motorways and expressways  operated by the Motorway Company in the Republic of Slovenia  are the state roads of the highest category  135  On motorways and express ways  cars must have a toll sticker  136  Slovenia has a very high motorway density compared to the European Union average  136  The first highway in Slovenia  the A1 motorway connecting Vrhnika and Postojna  was opened in 1972  137  but the construction was really speed up in 1994  when the National Assembly enacted the first National Motorway Construction Programme  138  Till February 2012  a network consisting of 528 km  328 mi  of motorways  expressways and similar roads has been built  137  Its essential section  138  the Slovenian Motorway Cross  which is part of the Trans European Road network  was completed in October 2011  139  It comprises the motorway route heading from east to west  in line with the Pan European Corridor V  and the motorway route heading in the north south direction  in line with the Pan European Corridor X  138  part of which is considered the Slovenian transport backbone  136  The newly built road system slowly  but steadily transforms Slovenia into a large conurbation and connects it as a unitary social  economic and cultural space  with links to neighbouring areas  140  In contrast  other state roads  managed by the Road Directorate of the Republic of Slovenia  have been rapidly deteriorating due to neglection and the overall increase in traffic  136  About half of them are in a bad condition  141  The urban and suburban network serviced by buses is relatively dense  136  The existing Slovenian rails  which were mostly built in the 19th century  are out of date and can t compete with the motorway network  142  The maintenance and modernisation of the Slovenian railway network has been neglected due to the lack of financial assets  creating bottlenecks  143  Nevertheless  it has been gaining momentum with the completion of the motorway cross  142  The Slovenian Railways company operates 1 229 km  764 mi  of 1 435 mm  4 ft 8 1 2 in  standard gauge tracks  331 km  206 mi  as double track  and reaches all regions of the country  144  The network comprises main lines and regional lines  143  Electrification is provided by a 3 kV DC system  except at the junctions with railways of foreign countries  143  and covers 503 5 kilometres  312 9 mi   145  Due to the out of date infrastructure  the share of the railway freight transport has been in decline in Slovenia despite growing slightly in absolute terms  146  The railway passenger transport has been recovering after a large drop in the 1990s  147  The Pan European railway corridors V and X  and several E railways  E65  E67  E69  and E70  intersect in Slovenia  143  All international transit trains in Slovenia drive through the Ljubljana Railway Hub  and all international passenger trains stop there  148  There are three ports on the Slovenian coast  The traffic is mostly international  149  150  The major is the Port of Koper  built in 1957  151  It is a feeder port  151  It is about 2 000 nautical miles  3 700 km  2 300 mi  closer to destinations east of the Suez than the ports of Northern Europe  and the land transport from Koper by road and by railway to the main industrial centres in Central Europe is approximately 500 kilometres  310 mi  shorter than from Northern European ports  152  It is multimodal and one of the most modern in this part of the world  149  but its development is hindered by the lack of sufficient depth  153  From it  there are reliable and regular shipping container lines to all major world ports  152  The port has been rapidly growing and in 2011  more than 17 million tonnes  16 7 million long tons  18 7 million short tons  of cargo passed through it  152  154  It is the largest Northern Adriatic port in terms of container transport  155  In 2011  almost 590 000 TEUs passed through it  156  There is a skewed balance in the direction of trade flows in the Port of Koper where import flows clearly outweigh export flows  136  The majority of maritime passenger traffic in Slovenia takes place in Koper  157  where a passenger terminal was completed in 2005  158  It has recorded about 100 000 passengers in 2011  159  and has been visited by the largest passenger ships  such as the MS Voyager of the Seas  160  The two smaller ports used for the international passenger transport are located in Izola and Piran  The Port of Piran is also used for the international transport of salt  whereas the Port of Izola is used for fish disembarkation  Passenger transport in Slovenia takes place mainly with Italy and Croatia  161  The only shipping company of Slovenia is Splo na plovba  162  It operates 28 ships with 1 025 000 tonnes of tonnage  163  It transports freight and is active only in foreign ports  157  The air transport in Slovenia is quite low  146  but has significantly grown since 1991  164  There are three international airports in Slovenia  The Ljubljana Jo e Pu nik Airport in the central part of the country is by far the busiest  164  with connections to many major European destinations  165  Around 1 4 million passengers and 15 000 to 17 000 tonnes of cargo pass through it each year  166  The Maribor Edvard Rusjan Airport is located in the eastern part of the country and the Portoro  Airport in the western part  164  The state owned Adria Airways is the largest Slovenian airline  164  Since 2003  several new carriers have entered the market  mainly low cost airlines  136  The only Slovenian military airport is the Cerklje ob Krki
