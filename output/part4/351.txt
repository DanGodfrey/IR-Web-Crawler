edit  Development In 1977  the pilot episode of The Amazing Spider Man television series was released by Columbia Pictures as a feature film outside of the United States  In 1978 episodes from the television series were re edited and released outside of the United States as a feature film titled Spider Man Strikes Back  In 1979  a film made using the same method was released as Spider Man  The Dragon s Challenge  The disappointing performance of 1983 s Superman III made comic book adaptations low priority in Hollywood  though the comic industry itself thrived  1   edit  Cannon Films development period In 1985  after a brief option on Spider Man by Roger Corman expired  citation needed Marvel Comics optioned the property to Cannon Films  Cannon chiefs Menahem Golan and his cousin Yoram Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics  225 000 over the five year option period plus a percentage of the film s revenues  2  The rights would revert to Marvel if a film was not made by April 1990  3  Tobe Hooper  then preparing both Invaders From Mars and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2  was mooted as director  Golan and Globus misunderstood the concept of the character   They thought it was like The Wolf Man   said director Joseph Zito  4  and instructed writer Leslie Stevens  creator of The Outer Limits  to write a treatment reflecting their misconception  In Stevens  story  a corporate scientist intentionally subjects ID badge photographer Peter Parker to radioactive bombardment  transforming him into a hairy  suicidal  eight armed monster  The human tarantula refuses to join the scientist s new master race of mutants  battling a succession of mutations kept in a basement laboratory  4  5  Unhappy with the debasement of his comic book creation  Marvel s Stan Lee pushed for a new story and screenplay  written for Cannon by Ted Newsom and John Brancato  6  The variation on the origin story had Otto Octavius as a teacher and mentor to a college age Peter Parker  The cyclotron accident which  creates  Spider Man also deforms the scientist into Doctor Octopus and results in his mad pursuit of proof of the Fifth Force  Ock reconstructs his cyclotron and causes electromagnetic abnormalities  anti gravity effects  and bilocation which threatens to engulf New York and the world  Joseph Zito  who had directed Cannon s successful Chuck Norris film Invasion USA  replaced Tobe Hooper  The new director hired Barney Cohen to rewrite the script  Cohen  creator of TV s Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Forever Knight  added action scenes  a non canonical comic for the villain  gave Doc Ock the catch phrase   Okey dokey   and altered his goal from the Fifth Force to a quest for anti gravity  Producer Golan  using his pen name  Joseph Goldman   then made a minor polish to Cohen s rewrite  Zito scouted locations and studio facilities in both the U S  and Europe  and oversaw storyboard breakdowns supervised by Harper Goff  Cannon planned to make the film on the then substantial budget of between  15 and  20 million  2  While no casting was finalized  Zito expressed interest in actor stunt man Scott Leva  who had posed for Cannon s promotional photos and ads  and made public appearances as Spider Man for Marvel  The up and coming actor Tom Cruise was also discussed for the leading role  Zito considered Bob Hoskins as Doc Ock  Stan Lee expressed his desire to play Daily Bugle editor J  Jonah Jameson  7 Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn were considered for Aunt May  Peter Cushing as a sympathetic scientist  and Adolph Caesar as a police detective  6  With Cannon finances siphoned by the expensive Superman IV  The Quest for Peace and Masters of the Universe  the company slashed the proposed Spider Man budget to under  10 million  Director Zito opted out  unwilling to make a compromised Spider Man  The company commissioned low budget rewrites from writers Shepard Goldman  Don Michael Paul  and finally Ethan Wiley  and penciled in company workhorse Albert Pyun as director  who also made script alterations  5  Scott Leva was still associated with the character through Marvel  he had appeared in photo covers of the comic   and read each draft  Leva commented   Ted Newsom and John Brancato had written the script  It was good but it needed a little work  Unfortunately  with every subsequent rewrite by other writers  it went from good to bad to terrible   7  Due to Cannon s assorted financial crises  the project shut down after spending about  1 5 million on the project  4  In 1989  Path   owned by corrupt Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti  acquired the overextended Cannon  The filmmaking cousins parted  Globus remaining associated with Path   Golan leaving to create 21st Century Film Corporation  keeping a number of properties  including Spider Man  in lieu of a cash buy out  He also extended his Spider Man option with Marvel up to January 1992  3  Golan shelved the low budget rewrites and attempted to finance an independent production from the original big budget script  already budgeted  storyboarded and laid out  8  At Cannes in May 1989  21st Century announced a September start date  with ads touting the script by  Barney Cohen  Ted Newsom  amp  John Brancato and Joseph Goldman   9  As standard practice  Golan pre sold the unmade film to raise production funds  with television rights bought by Viacom and home video rights by Columbia Pictures  which wanted to establish a studio franchise  Stephen Herek was attached as director at this point  10  Golan submitted this  new  screenplay to Columbia in late 1989  actually the 1985 script with an adjusted  1989  date  and the studio requested yet another rewrite  Golan hired Frank LaLoggia  who turned in his draft but grew disenchanted with 21st Century  Neil Ruttenberg was hired for one more draft  which was also  covered  by script readers at Columbia  11  Columbia s script analysts considered all three submissions  essentially the same story   A tentative production deal was set  Said Stan Lee in 1990   21st Century  is  supposed to do Spider Man and now they re talking to Columbia and the way it looks now  Columbia may end up buying Spider Man from 21st Century   12   edit  Carolco Pictures 21st Century s Menahem Golan still actively immersed himself mounting  his  Spider Man  sending the original  Doc Ock  script for production bids  In 1990  he contacted Canadian effects company Light and Motion Corporation regarding the visual effects  which in turn offered the stop motion chores to Steven Archer  Krull  Clash of the Titans   13  Toward the end of shooting True Lies  Variety carried the announcement that Carolco had received a completed screenplay from James Cameron  14  This script bore the names of James Cameron  John Brancato  Ted Newsom  Barry  sic  Cohen and  Joseph Goldmari   a typographical scrambling of Golan s pen name   Joseph Goldman   with Marvel executive Joseph Calimari  15  The script text was identical to the one Golan submitted to Columbia the previous year  with the addition of a new 1993 date  Cameron stalwart Arnold Schwarzenegger was frequently linked to the project as the director s choice for Dr  Octopus  citation needed   edit  Cameron  scriptment  Months later  James Cameron submitted an undated 47 page  scriptment  with an alternate story  the copyright registration was dated 1991   part screenplay  part narrative story outline  4  The  scriptment  told the Spider Man origin  but used variations on the comic book characters Electro and Sandman as villains  This  Electro   named Carlton Strand  instead of Max Dillion  was a megalomaniacal parody of corrupt capitalists  Instead of Flint Marko s character  Cameron s  Sandman   simply named Boyd  is mutated by an accident involving Philadelphia Experiment style bilocation and atom mixing  in lieu of getting caught in a nuclear blast on a beach  The story climaxes with a battle atop the World Trade Center and had Peter Parker revealing his identity to Mary Jane Watson  In addition  the treatment was also heavy on profanity  and had Spider Man and Mary Jane having sex  16  This treatment reflected elements in previous scripts  from the Stevens treatment  organic web shooters  and a villain who tempts Spider Man to join a coming  master race  of mutants  from the original screenplay and rewrite  weird electrical storms causing blackouts  freak magnetic events and bi location  from the Ethan Wiley draft  a villain addicted to toxic super powers and multiple experimental spiders  one of which escapes and bites Peter  causing an hallucinatory nightmare invoking Franz Kafka s  Metamorphosis   from the Frank LaLoggia script  a blizzard of stolen cash fluttering down onto surprised New Yorkers  and from the Neil Ruttenberg screenplay  a criminal assault on the NYC Stock Exchange  5  In 1991  Carolco Pictures extended Golan s option agreement with Marvel through May 1996  3  but in April 1992  Carolco ceased active production on Spider Man due to continued financial and legal problems  17   edit  Litigation troubles When James Cameron agreed to make Spider Man  Carolco lawyers simply used his previous Terminator 2 contract as a template  A clause in this agreement gave Cameron the right to decide on movie and advertising credits  Show business trade articles and advertisements made no mention of Golan  who was still actively assembling the elements for the film  3  In 1993  Golan complained publicly and finally instigated legal action against Carolco for disavowing his contractual guarantee credit as producer  On the other hand  Cameron had the contractual right to decide on credits  5  Eventually  Carolco sued Viacom and Columbia to recover broadcast and home video rights  and the two studios countersued  2 20th Century Fox  though not part of the litigation  contested Cameron s participation  claiming exclusivity on his services as a director under yet another contract  4  In 1996  Carolco  21st Century  and Marvel went bankrupt  Via a quitclaim from Carolco dated March 28  1995  MGM acquired 21st Century s film library  assets  and received     all rights in and to all drafts and versions of the screenplay s  for Spider Man written by James Cameron  Ted Newsom  amp  John Brancato  Menahem Golan  Jon  sic  Michael Paul  Ethan Wiley  Leslie Stevens  Frank Laloggia  Neil Ruttenberg  Barney Cohen  Shepard Goldman and any and all other writers   18  MGM also sued 21st Century  Viacom  and Marvel Comics  alleging fraud in the original deal between Cannon and Marvel  In 1998  Marvel emerged from bankruptcy with a new reorganization plan that merged the company with Toy Biz  3  The courts determined that the original contract of Marvel s rights to Golan had expired  returning the rights to Marvel  but the matter was still not completely resolved  In 1999  Marvel licensed Spider Man rights to Columbia  by then absorbed by Sony  for a reported  7 million  MGM disputed the legality  claiming it had the Spider Man rights via Cannon  21st Century  and Carolco  and threatened to make a competing film  citation

of producer Kevin McClory s claim to the rights to both Thunderball and other related James Bond characters and elements  Calley announced that Columbia would produce an alternate 007 series  based on the  McClory material   which Calley acquired for Columbia  19   Columbia had made the original 1967 film spoof of Casino Royale  a non Eon production   Both studios now faced rival projects  which could undercut their own long term financial stability and plans  Columbia had no consistent movie franchise  and had sought Spider Man since 1989  MGM UA s only reliable source of theatrical income was a new James Bond film every two or three years  An alternate 007 series could diminish or even eliminate the power of MGM UA s long running Bond series  Likewise  an MGM UA Spider Man film could negate Columbia s plans to create an exclusive cash cow  Both sides seemed to have strong arguments for the rights to do such films  20  The two studios made a complex trade off in March 1999  Columbia relinquished its rights to create a new 007 series in exchange for MGM s giving up its claim to Spider Man  21  Columbia acquired the rights to all previous scripts in 2000  11  but exercised options only on the  Cameron Material   i e   both the completed multi author screenplay and the subsequent  scriptment   4  After more than a decade of attempts  Spider Man truly went into production

development  with Raimi attached to direct and Maguire  Dunst and other cast members set to reprise their roles  Both a fourth and a fifth movie were planned and at one time the idea of shooting the two sequels concurrently was under consideration  However  Raimi stated in March 2009 that only the fourth film was in development at that time and that if there were fifth and sixth films  those two films would actually be a continuation of each other  34  35  36  37 James Vanderbilt was hired in October 2008 to pen the screenplay after initial reports in early 2008 that Sony Pictures was in contact with David Koepp  who wrote the first Spider Man film  38  39  The script was subsequently rewritten by Pulitzer winning playwright David Lindsay Abaire and rewritten again by Gary Ross in October 2009  40  Sony also engaged Vanderbilt to write scripts for Spider Man 5 and Spider Man 6  39  In 2008  Raimi expressed interest in portraying the transformation of Dr  Curt Connors into his villainous alter ego  the Lizard  the character s actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea  41  42  43  Raimi also discussed his desire to upgrade Bruce Campbell from a cameo appearance to a significant role  44  It was reported in December 2009 that John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and that Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy  though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics  Instead  Raimi s Felicia was expected to become a new superpowered figure called the Vulturess  45  As disagreements between Sony and Raimi threatened to push the film of the intended May 6  2011 release date  Sony Pictures announced in January 2010 that plans for Spider Man 4 had been cancelled due to Raimi s withdrawal from the project  Raimi reportedly ended his participation due to his doubt that he could meet the planned May 6  2011 release date while at the same time upholding the film creatively  Raimi purportedly went through four iterations of the script with different screenwriters and still  hated it   22   edit  Venom In July 2007  Avi Arad revealed a Venom spin off was in the works  46  The

Critical reaction Further information  List of accolades received by the Spider Man franchise David Ansen of Newsweek enjoyed Spider Man as a fun film to watch  though he considered Spider Man 2 to be  a little too self important for its own good   Ansen saw Spider Man 3 as a return to form  finding it  the most grandiose chapter and the nuttiest   61  Tom Charity of CNN appreciated the films   solidly redemptive moral convictions   also noting the vast improvement of the visual effects from the first film to the third  While he saw the second film s Doc Ock as the  most engaging  villain  he applauded the third film s Sandman as  a triumph of CGI wizardry   62  Richard Corliss of Time enjoyed the action of the films and thought that they did better than most action movies by  rethinking the characters  the franchise and the genre   63  Colin Covert of the Star Tribune praised Spider Man as a  superb debut  of the superhero as well as Spider Man 2 as a  superior sequel  for filmgoers who are fans  of spectacle and of story   Covert expressed disappointment in Spider Man 3 as too ambitious with the multiple storylines leaving one  feeling overstuffed yet shortchanged   64  Manohla Dargis of The New York Times enjoyed the humor of the first two films  but found it missing in the third installment  Dargis also noted   The bittersweet paradox of this franchise is that while the stories have grown progressively less interesting the special effects have improved tremendously   65  Robert Denerstein of the Rocky Mountain News ranked the films from his favorite to his least favorite  Spider Man 2  Spider Man  and Spider Man 3  While Denerstein missed the presence of Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus from the second film  he found the third film   despite being  bigger  though not necessarily better    to have a  satisfying conclusion   66  Film Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic Yahoo  Movies Overall Top Critics Spider Man 89   215 reviews  67  83   36 reviews  68
