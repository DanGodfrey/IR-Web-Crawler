Phonograph record  category See also  List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame The Walk of Fame runs 1 3 miles  2 1 km  east to west on Hollywood Boulevard from North Gower Street to North La Brea Avenue  plus a short segment of Marshfield Way that runs diagonally between Hollywood and La Brea  and 0 4 miles  0 7 km  north to south on Vine Street between Yucca Street and Sunset Boulevard  1  As of January 23  2012  2012  01 23  update  the Walk consists of 2 458 stars  2  These are spaced at 6 foot  1 8 m  intervals  each consisting of a coral pink terrazzo five point star rimmed with brass  not bronze  an oft repeated inaccuracy  3  inlaid into a charcoal colored terrazzo background  In the upper portion of the pink star field  the name of the honoree is inlaid in brass block letters  Below the inscription  in the lower half of the star field  a round inlaid brass emblem indicates the category of the honoree s contributions  The emblems symbolize five categories within the entertainment industry  Classic film camera representing motion pictures Television receiver representing broadcast television Phonograph record representing audio recording or music Radio microphone representing broadcast radio Comedy tragedy masks representing theatre live performance  added in 1984  Of all the stars on the Walk to date  47  have been awarded in the motion pictures category  24  in television  17  in audio recording  10  in radio  and less than 2  in the live performance category  An average of twenty new stars are added to the Walk each year  3  According to a 2003 report by the market research firm NPO Plog Research  the Walk attracts about 10 million visitors annually   more than Sunset Strip  Grauman s Chinese Theatre  the Queen Mary  and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art   and has played an important role in making tourism the largest industry in Los Angeles County  4   edit  Special stars  Special category  stars recognize miscellaneous contributions by corporate entities  service organizations  and special honorees  and display emblems unique to those honorees  5  These stars are granted by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce or the Hollywood Historic Trust  but are not part of the Walk of Fame proper  instead  they are located nearby on private property  6  7  8  As examples  former Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley s star displays the Seal of the City of Los Angeles  6  9  10  the Los Angeles Police Department  LAPD  star emblem is a replica of a Hollywood Division badge  11  and stars representing corporations  such as Victoria s Secret and the Los Angeles Dodgers display the honoree s corporate logo  5  12  The  Friends of the Walk of Fame  monuments vary from the trademark  star  shape  they are charcoal terrazzo squares  rimmed by miniature pink terrazzo stars displaying the five standard category emblems  along with the sponsor s corporate logo  with the sponsor s name and contribution in inlaid brass block lettering  7  13  14  15  The monuments for the Apollo XI mission to the Moon are uniquely shaped  Four identical  circular  moons  bearing the names of the three astronauts  Neil Armstrong  Michael Collins  and Edwin E    Buzz   Aldrin Jr   the date of the first Moon landing   7 20 69    and the words  Apollo XI   are set on each of the four corners at the intersection of Hollywood and Vine  16  The  moons  are silver and dark grey terrazzo circles rimmed in brass on a square pink terrazzo background  with the television emblem inlaid at the  twelve o clock  position on the circles  16   edit  History  edit  Origin The Walk of Fame at the 6800 block of Hollywood Boulevard  looking eastward  The Kodak Theatre is in the foreground at left  In the upper left quadrant is the famous intersection of Hollywood and Highland  The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce credits E  M  Stuart  its volunteer president in 1953  with the original idea for creating a Walk of Fame  17  Stuart proposed the Walk as a means to  maintain the glory of a community whose name means glamour and excitement in the four corners of the world   17  Harry Sugarman  another Chamber member and president of the Hollywood Improvement Association  receives credit in an independent account  18  A committee was formed to flesh out the idea  and an architectural firm was retained to develop specific proposals  By 1955  the basic concept and general design had been agreed upon  and plans were submitted to the Los Angeles City Council  In February 1956  a prototype was unveiled featuring a caricature of an example honoree  John Wayne  by some accounts  19  inside a blue star on a brown background  17  However  caricatures proved too expensive and difficult to execute in brass with the technology available at the time  and the brown and blue motif was nixed by C  E  Toberman  the legendary real estate developer known as  Mr  Hollywood   because the colors clashed with a new building he was erecting on Hollywood Boulevard  17  20  Multiple accounts exist for the origin of the  star  concept  According to one  the historic Hollywood Hotel  which stood for over 50 years on Hollywood Boulevard at the site now occupied by the Hollywood and Highland complex and the Kodak Theatre  painted stars on its dining room ceiling over tables favored by its most famous celebrity patrons  and that may have served as an early inspiration  21  By another account the stars were  inspired both by the foot  and handprints outside Grauman s Chinese  Theater  and by Sugarman s  Tropics Restaurant  drinks menu  which featured celebrity photos framed in gold stars   18  22   edit  Selection and construction By March 1956 the final design and coral and charcoal color scheme had been approved  and between the spring of 1956 and the fall of 1957  1 558 honorees were selected by committees representing the four major branches of the entertainment industry at that time  motion pictures  television  audio recording  and radio  The committees met at the Brown Derby restaurant  23  and included such prominent names as Cecil B  DeMille  Samuel Goldwyn  Jesse Lasky  Walt Disney  Hal Roach  Mack Sennett  and Walter Lantz  17  A requirement stipulated by the original audio recording committee  and later rescinded  specified minimum sales of one million records or 250 000 albums for all music category nominees  The committee soon realized  however  that many important recording artists would be excluded from the Walk by that requirement  As a result  the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences was formed for the purpose of creating a separate award system for the music business  The first Grammy Awards were presented in Beverly Hills in 1959  24  Construction of the Walk began in 1958  but two lawsuits delayed completion  The first was filed by local property owners challenging the legality of the  1 25 million tax assessment levied upon them to pay for the Walk  along with new street lighting and trees  In October 1959 the assessment was ruled legal  17  The second lawsuit  filed by Charles Chaplin  Jr   sought damages for the exclusion of his father  Charlie Chaplin  whose nomination had been withdrawn due to pressure from multiple quarters  Chaplin s suit was dismissed in 1960  paving the way for completion of the project  17  25  26  Joanne Woodward s star displays the motion picture icon While Joanne Woodward is often singled out as the first to receive a star on the Walk of Fame  27  in fact there was no  first  recipient  the original stars were installed as a continuous project  with no individual ceremonies  Woodward s name was  however  one of eight drawn at random from the original 1 550 and inscribed on eight  display  stars that were built while litigation was still holding up permanent construction  28  29  30  They were installed temporarily on the northwest corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue in August 1958 to generate publicity and demonstrate how the Walk would eventually look  17  In addition to Woodward  the eight examples included Olive Borden  Ronald Colman  Louise Fazenda  Preston Foster  Burt Lancaster  Edward Sedgwick  and Ernest Torrence  17  31  Official groundbreaking took place on February 8  1960  21  On March 28  1960 the first permanent star  director Stanley Kramer s  was completed on the easternmost end of the new Walk near the intersection of Hollywood and Gower  17  32  The Joanne Woodward legend may have originated  according to one source  because she was the first to pose with her star for photographers  27   edit  Stagnation and revitalization Though the Walk was originally conceived  in part  to encourage redevelopment of Hollywood Boulevard  the 1960s and 1970s were a period of protracted urban decay in the Hollywood area as residents moved to suburbs  33  34  From the initial installation of over 1500 stars in 1960 1961  eight years passed without the addition of a new star  as the Los Angeles City Council in 1962 passed an ordinance naming the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce  the agent to advise the City  about adding names to the Walk  and the Chamber  over the next six years  devised rules  procedures  and financing methods to do so  17  In December 1968  Richard D  Zanuck was awarded the first star in eight years in a presentation ceremony hosted by Danny Thomas  17  23  35  Johnny Grant  center  at producer Joe Pasternak s presentation ceremony in 1991  At left is Gene Kelly  In July 1978  the City of Los Angeles designated the Hollywood Walk of Fame a Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument  36  Radio personality  television producer  honorary mayor of Hollywood  and Chamber member Johnny Grant  1923 2008  37  is generally credited with implementing the changes that resuscitated the Walk and established it as a significant tourist attraction  23  Beginning in 1968 he stimulated publicity and encouraged international press coverage by requiring that each recipient personally attend his or her star s unveiling ceremony  23  Grant later recalled that  it was tough to get people to come accept a star on the Walk of Fame  until the neighborhood finally began its recovery in the 1980s  34  Grant also instituted a fee of  2 500  now  30 000  3  payable by the person or entity nominating the recipient  to fund the Walk of Fame s upkeep and minimize further taxpayer burden  23  Grant was awarded a star in 1980 for his television work  17  and in 2002 he received a second star in the  special  category to acknowledge his pivotal role in improving and popularizing the Walk  38  He was also named chairman of the Selection Committee and Honorary Mayor of Hollywood  a ceremonial position previously held by Art Linkletter and Monty Hall  39  40  among others   17  38  He remained in both offices from 1980 until his death in 2008  and hosted the great majority of unveiling ceremonies  His unique special category star  with its emblem depicting a stylized  Great Seal of the City of Hollywood   41  is located at the entrance to the Kodak Theater  adjacent to Johnny Grant Way  42   edit  Expansion In 1984  a fifth category   Live Theatre  was added to permit acknowledgement of contributions from the live performance branch of the entertainment industry  and a second row of stars was created on each sidewalk to alternate with the existing stars  17  Hollywood Boulevard  7000 block  north side  looking westward  In 1994  the Walk of Fame was extended one block to the west on Hollywood Boulevard  from Sycamore Avenue to North LaBrea Avenue  plus the short segment of Marshfield Way that connects Hollywood and La Brea   where it now ends at the silver  Four Ladies of Hollywood  gazebo and the special  Walk of Fame  star  43  At the same time  Sophia Loren was honored with the 2 000th star on the Walk  17   edit  Restoration In 2008  a restoration of the Walk was initiated  with costs estimated between  4 million and  4 2 million  44  45  46  At least 778 stars will eventually be repaired or replaced during the ongoing project because of wear and tear suffered over the years  from minor cosmetic flaws to damage severe enough to constitute a walking hazard  The project began with an evaluation of all 2 365 stars on the Walk at the time  each receiving a letter grade of A  B  C  D  or F  Honorees whose stars received  F  grades  indicating the most severe damage  were Joan Collins  Peter Frampton  Dick Van Patten  Paul Douglas  Andrew L  Stone  Willard Waterman  Richard Boleslavski  Ellen Drew  Frank Crumit  and Bobby Sherwood  50 celebrities  stars received  D  grades  46  The ongoing restoration project is a collaboration between the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and various Los Angeles city and county governmental offices  along with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority  which operates the Metro Red Line that runs beneath the Walk  since earth movement due to the presence of the subway line is thought to be partly responsible for the damage  45  To provide funding for the restoration project  the  Friends of Walk of Fame  program was inaugurated  whereby commercial interests may contribute funds toward the restoration effort  46 Absolut Vodka became the first  Friend   44  with a donation of  1 million  47  followed by L Oreal  48  Friends are recognized with honorary plaques adjacent to the Walk of Fame in front of the Kodak Theatre  7  44  47  The program received some criticism  Alana Semuels of the Los Angeles Times referred to it as  just the latest corporate attempt to buy some good buzz   and quoted an area brand strategist   I think Johnny Grant would roll over in his grave to hear that a commercial entity was doing something to play with the concept of being immortalized   7  Karen Fondu  President of L Or al Paris  stated   Given the number of celebrities we have used as spokespersons for our brand  it was a natural affinity   47   edit  The Walk today  edit  Honorees with multiple stars The original selection committees chose to recognize some entertainers  contributions in multiple categories with multiple stars  Gene Autry is the only honoree with stars in all five categories  49  50 Bob Hope  Mickey Rooney  Roy Rogers  and Tony Martin each have stars in four categories   Rooney has three of his own and a fourth with his wife  Jan  51  52  while Rogers also has three of his own  and a fourth with his band  the Sons of the Pioneers  53  54  Thirty three people  including Frank Sinatra  Dinah Shore  Gale Storm  Danny Kaye  and Jack Benny  have stars in three categories  49  Seven recording artists have two stars in the same category for distinct achievements  Michael Jackson  as a soloist and as a member of The Jackson Five  Diana Ross  as a member of The Supremes and for her solo work  Smokey Robinson  as a solo artist and as a member of The Miracles  and John Lennon  Ringo Starr  George Harrison  and Paul McCartney as individuals and as members of The Beatles  55 Cher forfeited her opportunity to join this exclusive club by declining to schedule the mandatory personal appearance when she was selected in 1983  28  She did  however  attend the unveiling of the Sonny  amp  Cher star in 1998  as a tribute to her recently deceased ex husband  Sonny Bono  56  George Eastman is the only honoree with two stars in the same category for the same achievement   the invention of roll film  57   edit  Controversial additions Selected 1956  installed 1972  Charlie Chaplin is the only honoree to be selected twice for the same star on the Walk  He was unanimously voted into the initial group of 500 in 1956  but the Selection Committee ultimately excluded him  ostensibly due to questions regarding his morals  he had been charged with violating the Mann Act   and exonerated   during the  White Slavery  hysteria of the 1940s  but more likely due to his left leaning political views  58  The rebuke prompted an unsuccessful lawsuit by his son  Charles Chaplin  Jr  His star was finally added to the Walk in 1972  the same year he received his Academy Award  26  but even then  16 years later  the Chamber of Commerce received angry letters from across the country protesting its decision to include him  59  In 1978 the committee  perhaps recalling its Chaplin difficulties  voted against awarding a star to the controversial opera singer  actor  athlete  writer  lawyer  and social activist Paul Robeson  The outcry from the entertainment industry  civic circles  local and national politicians  and many other quarters was so intense that the decision was almost immediately reversed  60  61  62  His star is on the 6600 block of Hollywood Boulevard   edit  Names in common Two pairs of stars share identical names representing different people  There are two Harrison Ford stars  honoring the silent film actor  at 6665 Hollywood Boulevard   and the present day actor  in front of the Kodak Theatre at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard   Two Michael Jackson stars represent the singer dancer songwriter  at 6927 Hollywood Boulevard   and the radio personality  at 1597 Vine Street   When the singer songwriter Jackson died  in 2009  fans mistakenly began leaving flowers  candles  and other tributes at the Vine Street star  Upon learning of this  the radio host Jackson wrote on his web site   I am willingly loan ing  it to him and  if it would bring him back  he can have it   63  Twelve Joneses have stars  but only seven Smiths  There are 14 Moores  but the most common surname is Williams  Andy Williams  Bill Williams  Billy Dee Williams  Cindy Williams  Earle Williams  Esther Williams  Guy Williams  Hank Williams  Joe Williams  Kathlyn Williams  Paul Williams  Robin Williams  Roger Williams  Tex Williams and Vanessa Williams  64  The largest collection of stars honoring one group of blood relatives is the widely scattered set of seven representing the Barrymore family  John Barrymore  his brother Lionel  who has two   and sister Ethel  their uncle Sidney Drew  John s son John Drew Barrymore  and John Drew s daughter Drew Barrymore   edit  Bending the rules One of the four monuments recognizing the Apollo XI astronauts at the corners of Hollywood and Vine  Walk of Fame rules prohibit consideration of nominees whose contributions fall outside the five major entertainment categories  but the selection committee has been known to conjure some interesting rule interpretations to justify a selection  The Walk s four round Moon landing monuments at the corners of Hollywood and Vine  for example  officially recognize the Apollo XI astronauts for  contributions to the television industry   Johnny Grant acknowledged  in 2005  that classifying the first Moon landing as a television entertainment event was  a bit of a stretch   Magic Johnson s considerable basketball skills had no direct connection to movies  music  TV  radio  or theater  but the committee added him to the motion picture category  based on his ownership of the Magic Johnson Theatre chain  citing as precedent Sid Grauman  builder of Grauman s Chinese Theatre  27    Now  people want Orville Redenbacher   Grant quipped in the 2005 interview   because his popcorn is in all the theaters   27  Muhammad Ali s star was granted after the committee decided that boxing could be considered a form of  live performance   His star is the first  and so far only  one to be installed on a vertical surface  It is displayed on a wall of the Kodak Theatre  acceding to Ali s request that his name not be walked upon  65  66  Since 1968  all living honorees have been required to be present at their star s unveiling  and approximately 40 have declined the honor due to this condition  27  The only recipient to date who has failed to appear after having agreed to do so was Barbra Streisand  in 1976  Her star was unveiled anyway  near the intersection of Hollywood and Highland  67  Streisand did attend  however  when her husband  James Brolin  unveiled his star in 1998  two blocks to the east  68   edit  Unique and unusual Eleven stars are identified with a one word stage name  The most novel is Parkyakarkus  the principal pseudonym of Harry Einstein  the comedian and radio personality  and father of Albert Brooks and Bob Einstein   The other ten are Sting  Liberace  Cantinflas  Meiklejohn  Paderewski  Mako  Sabu  Houdini  Roseanne  and Shakira  The largest group of individuals represented by a single star is the estimated 122 adults and 12 children 69  collectively known as the Munchkins  from the landmark 1939 film  The Wizard of Oz  Clayton Moore is so inextricably linked with his Lone Ranger character  even though he played other roles during his career  that he is one of only two actors to have his character s name alongside his own on his star  The other is Tommy Riggs  whose star reads   Tommy Riggs  amp  Betty Lou   70  For more than 40 years  singer Jimmy Boyd was the youngest star recipient at age 20  but he lost that distinction in 2004 to 18 year old twins Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen  Their joint star  the only one shared by twins  is outside the Kodak Theatre  near the Hollywood and Highland Center  The Westmores received the first star honoring contributions in theatrical make up  Other make up artists on the walk are Max Factor and John Chambers  Three stars recognize experts in special effects  Ray Harryhausen  Dennis Muren  and Stan Winston  Only one costume designer has received a star  eight time Academy Award winner Edith Head  Sidney Sheldon is one of two novelists with a star  which he earned for writing screenplays such as The Bachelor and The Bobby Soxer before turning to novels  71  The other is Ray Bradbury  whose books and stories have formed the basis of dozens of movies and television programs over a nearly 60 year period  72  Nine inventors have stars on the Walk  George Eastman  as mentioned   Thomas Edison  inventor of the first true film projector and holder of numerous patents related to motion picture technology  Lee DeForest  inventor of the vacuum tube  which made radio and TV possible  and Phonofilm  which made sound movies possible  Merian C  Cooper  co inventor of the Cinerama process  Herbert Kalmus  inventor of Technicolor  Auguste and Louis Lumi re  inventors of important components of the motion picture camera  Mark Serrurier  inventor of the technology used for film editing  and Hedy Lamarr  co inventor of a  frequency hopping  radio guidance system which was a precursor to Wi Fi networks and cellular telephone systems  73   edit  Fictional characters  and those who create them  Main article  Fictional characters on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Mickey Mouse s star was the first awarded to a fictional character In 1978  in honor of his 50th anniversary  Mickey Mouse became the first animated character to receive a star  Other animated recipients are Bugs Bunny  Donald Duck  Woody Woodpecker  Snow White  Tinker Bell  Winnie the Pooh  Shrek  Rugrats  and the Simpsons  The star inscribed Charlie Tuna honors not the animated advertising mascot  but the long time radio personality  real name  Art Ferguson   Other fictional characters on the Walk include The Munchkins  as mentioned   two individual Muppets  Kermit the Frog and Big Bird  and The Muppets as a whole  one monster  Godzilla   and three non animated canine characters  Strongheart  Lassie  and Rin Tin Tin   Eight stars recognize cartoonists and animators  Walt Disney  Friz Freleng  Chuck Jones  Walter Lantz  Dr  Seuss  Charles Schulz  Hanna Barbera  and Jay Ward with Matt Groening due to receive a star in 2012  74  Three puppeteers have stars  Jim Henson  Shari Lewis  and Fran Allison   edit  Star locations Locations of individual stars are not necessarily random or arbitrary  Stars of legendary and world famous celebrities  the so called  show business royalty   are mostly found in front of Grauman s Chinese Theatre  Oscar winners  stars are usually placed near the Kodak Theatre  site of the annual Academy Awards presentations  Decisions are occasionally made with a dollop of whimsy  Mike Myers s star  for example  lies in front of an adult store called the International Love Boutique  an association with his Austin Powers roles  Roger Moore s star is located at 7007 Hollywood Boulevard in recognition of his seven James Bond films  and the last star  at the very end of the westernmost portion of the Walk  belongs to The Dead End Kids  Honorees are typically given input into choice of location  although final decisions remain with the Chamber  27  In her 1986 memoir  actor comedienne Carol Burnett explained her very specific location choice  While working as an usherette at the historic Warner Brothers Theatre  now the Hollywood Pacific Theatre  during the 1951 run of Alfred Hitchcock s film Strangers on a Train  she took it upon herself to advise a couple arriving during the final few minutes of a showing to wait for the next showing  to avoid seeing  and spoiling  the ending  The theatre manager fired her on the spot for  insubordination  and humiliated her by stripping the epaulets from her uniform in the theatre lobby  In 1977 when she was awarded a star  the Chamber asked if she had a preference for its placement   Right in front of where the old Warner Brothers Theatre was   she replied   at Hollywood and Wilcox   And that  she added  is exactly where you will find it  75   edit  Hollywood and La Brea Gateway The  Four Ladies of Hollywood  gazebo at the western border of the Walk of Fame  The Hollywood and La Brea Gateway gazebo  76  known locally as  The Four Ladies of Hollywood   77  stands upon a small triangular  island  formed by the confluence of Hollywood Boulevard  Marshfield Way  and North La Brea Avenue at the westernmost extension of the Walk of Fame  It was commissioned in 1993 by the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency Art Program  and created by the architect  production designer  and film director Catherine Hardwicke as a tribute to the multi ethnic women of Hollywood  76  The gazebo is a stainless steel stylized Art Deco lattice structure  The roof is an arched square supporting a circular dome  the word  HOLLYWOOD   decorated with small motion picture camera emblems  appears within each of the four archways  The dome is topped by a central obelisk  with neon block letters spelling  HOLLYWOOD  descending vertically on each of its four sides  Atop the obelisk is a small gilded weathervane style sculpture of Marilyn Monroe in her iconic  billowing skirt  pose from The Seven Year Itch  78  The domed structure is held aloft by four caryatids sculpted by Harl West 76  to represent the African American actress Dorothy Dandridge  Asian American actress Anna May Wong  Mexican actress Dolores Del Rio  and the multi ethnic  Brooklyn born actress Mae West  77  The sculpture measures 30 feet  9 1m  in height and 12 feet  3 6m  along each side  76  The work was dedicated February 1  1994  to a mixed reception  Los Angeles Times art critic Christopher Knight called it  the most depressingly awful work of public art in recent years   representing the opposite of Hardwicke s intended tribute to women   Sex  as a woman s historic gateway to Hollywood   he wrote   couldn t be more explicitly described   79  Independent writer and film producer Gail Choice  however  called it a fitting tribute to a group of pioneering  courageous women who  carried a tremendous burden on their feminine shoulders   as depicted quite literally in Hardwicke s gazebo   Never in my wildest dreams did I believe I d ever see women of color immortalized in such a creative and wonderful fashion   80  Hardwicke contended that critics had missed the  humor and symbolism  of the structure  which  embraces and pokes fun at the glamour  the polished metallic male form of the Oscar  and the pastiche of styles and dreams that pervades Tinseltown   81   edit  Theft and vandalism Actor Matt Damon s star under construction  August 2007  Four of the stars  which weigh about 300 pounds  136 kg  each  have been stolen from the Walk of Fame  In 2000  James Stewart s and Kirk Douglas s stars disappeared from their locations near the intersection of Hollywood and Vine  where they had been temporarily removed for a construction project  Police recovered them in the suburban community of South Gate when they arrested a man involved in an incident there and searched his house  The suspect was a construction worker employed on the Hollywood and Vine project  The stars had been badly damaged  and had to be remade  One of Gene Autry s five stars  it is not clear which one  was also stolen from a construction area  Johnny Grant later received an anonymous phone tip that the missing star was in Iowa  but it was never found   Someday  it will end up on eBay   Grant once joked  The most brazen and ambitious theft occurred in 2005  when thieves used a concrete saw to remove Gregory Peck s star from its Hollywood Boulevard site at the intersection of North El Centro Ave  near North Gower  The star was replaced almost immediately  but the original was never recovered and the perpetrators never caught  82  In late 2009 rumors circulated widely on media outlets and the Internet that John Lennon s star had been stolen  but it was merely being relocated further south on Vine Street to an area near the circular Capitol Records Building  adjacent to the stars of bandmates George Harrison and Ringo Starr  83  Paul McCartney s star was installed in the same location in 2012  84  Random acts of vandalism occur on the Walk on a regular basis  ranging from profanity and political statements written on stars with felt tip markers to attempted removal of brass emblems with chisels  85  Closed circuit surveillance cameras have been installed on the stretch of Hollywood Boulevard between La Brea Avenue and Vine Street in an effort to discourage mischievous activities  86   edit  Errors and mysteries In 2010  Julia Louis Dreyfus s star was constructed with the name  Julia Luis Dreyfus   87  The actress was reportedly amused  and the error was corrected  88  A similar mistake was made on Dick Van Dyke s star in 1993   Vandyke    and rectified  89  Film and television actor Don Haggerty s star originally displayed the first name  Dan   The mistake was fixed  but years later the television actor Dan Haggerty  of Grizzly Adams fame  no relation to Don  also received a star  The confusion eventually sprouted an urban legend that Dan Haggerty was the only honoree to have a star removed from the Walk of Fame  90  91   Motion Picture  category   TV  emblem For 28 years  the star intended to honor Mauritz Stiller  the Helsinki born pioneer of Swedish film who brought Greta Garbo to America  read  Maurice Diller   possibly due to mis transcription of verbal dictation  The star was finally remade with the correct name in 1988  92  93  As of 2010 update   two stars remain misspelled  Opera diva Lotte Lehmann s first name is spelled  Lottie   94  while Cinerama co inventor and King Kong creator  director  and producer Merian C  Cooper s first name is spelled  Meriam   95  96  Monty Woolley  the veteran film and stage actor best known for The Man Who Came to Dinner  1942  and the classic line   Time flies when you re having fun   is officially listed in the  Motion Picture  category  97  but his star on the Walk of Fame bears the television emblem  98  Woolley appeared on the small screen late in his career  but his TV contributions were eclipsed by his extensive stage  film  and radio work  99  100  101  102  Similarly  the star for Carmen Miranda bears the TV emblem 103  although her official category is  Motion Pictures   104  she acted in 18 films  105  Radio and television talk show host Larry King s star is officially listed in the  Television  category  106  but the brass emblem is a film camera  107  Two stars cannot be found  The Los Angeles Times  which has documented and photographed the Walk as part of its ongoing  Hollywood Star Walk  project  has not yet located the stars honoring Richard Crooks and the film career of Geraldine Farrar  108   Farrar s other star  recognizing her music career  is located on the 1700 block of Vine Street    edit  Homage Michael Jackson s star  about two weeks after his death in 2009  Some fans show respect for star recipients both living and dead by laying flowers or other symbolic tributes at their stars  109  Others show their support in other ways  The star awarded to Julio Iglesias  for example  is kept in  pristine condition  by  a devoted band of elderly women  who  scrub and polish it once a month   109  A tradition of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce is placement of a floral wreath at the star of a fallen awardee upon news of his or her death  for example Bette Davis in 1989  110 Katharine Hepburn in 2003  and Jackie Cooper in 2011  111  The stars along the Walk have also become impromptu grieving  memorial and vigil sites  and some continue to receive anniversary remembrances  News of the death of Elizabeth Taylor in 2011 resulted in a  deluge  of flowers and cards at her star  112  When recording artist Michael Jackson died in 2009  flowers and vigil keepers appeared at both his and radio commentator Michael Jackson s stars  63  113  Masses of flowers have also been received at stars honoring Richard Pryor  114 Ricardo Montalban  James Doohan  Frank Sinatra 115  116  and George Harrison  117   edit  Nomination process Director James Cameron unveiling his star  December 2009 Each year  an average of 200 nominations are submitted to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce Walk of Fame Selection Committee  Anyone  including fans  can nominate anyone active in the field of entertainment  as long as the nominee or his or her management is in agreement with the nomination  a letter of agreement from the nominated celebrity or representative must accompany the application   Nominees must have a minimum of five years  experience in the category for which they are nominated and a history of  charitable contributions   65  Posthumous nominees must have been deceased at least five years  At a meeting each June  the committee selects approximately 20 celebrities to receive stars on the Walk of Fame during the following year  One posthumous award is given each year as well  The nominations of those not selected are  rolled over  to the following year for reconsideration  those not selected two years in a row are dropped  and must be renominated to receive further consideration  Living recipients must agree to personally attend a presentation ceremony within five years of selection  A relative of deceased recipients must attend posthumous presentations  Presentation ceremonies are open to the public  3  The most common question received by Chamber personnel is   Why doesn t               have a star   118  Numerous major entertainment figures and legendary show business acts are not included on the Walk of Fame  for a variety of reasons  Some  such as Julia Roberts 27  119  and Clint Eastwood  119  have declined to participate  nominations cannot proceed without the nominee s consent  Others  such as George Clooney 120  and John Denver  28  were nominated but would not agree to the mandatory personal appearance at the unveiling ceremony  Others have simply never been nominated  or do not have a nominator willing or able to pay the selection fee  or have less than the required five years  minimum involvement in their designated field  Others are merely victims of selection constraints and probability  only about 10  of nominees are selected each year  Andrea Bocelli at his 2010 presentation ceremony A fee  currently  30 000   payable at time of selection  is collected to pay for the creation and installation of the star  as well as general maintenance of the Walk of Fame  The fee is usually paid by the nominating organization  which may be a fan club  or a film studio  record company  broadcaster  or other sponsor involved with the honoree s current or ongoing project  23  121  The Starz cable network  for example  paid for Dennis Hopper s star as part of the promotion for its series Crash  It was unveiled in March 2010  shortly before Hopper s death  23  122  Traditionally  the identities of selection committee members  other than its chairman  have not been made public in order to minimize conflicts of interest and to discourage lobbying by celebrities and their representatives  a significant problem during the original selections in the late 1950s   However  in 1999  in response to intensifying charges of  back room politics  in the selection process  the Chamber disclosed the members  names  They were Johnny Grant  the longtime chair and representative of the television category  Earl Lestz  president of Paramount Studio Group  motion pictures   Stan Spero  retired manager with broadcast stations KMPC and KABC  radio   Kate Nelson  owner of the Palace Theatre  live performance   and Mary Lou Dudas  vice president of A amp M Records  recording industry   123  Subsequently  however  the Chamber has revealed only that Lestz  who received his own star in 2004  became chairman after Grant died in 2008  Their current official position is that  each of the five categories is represented by someone with expertise in that field   3  As of June 2010  Lestz had been replaced as chairman by John Pavlik  former Director of Communications for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  124  While no public announcement was made to that effect  he was identified as chairman in the Chamber s press release announcing the 2011 star recipients  125   edit  See also Los Angeles portal List of stars on the Hollywood Walk
