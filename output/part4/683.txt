Earth s total surface area  or 30  of its land area  and with approximately 3 879 billion people  it hosts 60  of the world s current human population  During the 20th century Asia s population nearly quadrupled  3  Asia is defined according to similar definitions presented by the Encyclop dia Britannica 4  and the National Geographic Society 5  as 4 5 of the landmass of Eurasia   with the western portion of the latter occupied by Europe   located to the east of the Suez Canal  east of the Ural Mountains and south of the Caucasus Mountains  or the Kuma Manych Depression  and the Caspian and Black Seas  It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean  on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean  It contains one country in the Mediterranean Sea   Cyprus  Given its size and diversity  Asia   a toponym dating back to classical antiquity    is more a cultural concept  incorporating diverse regions and peoples than a homogeneous physical entity 6  Asia differs very widely among and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups  cultures  environments  economics  historical ties and government systems  Contents 1 Definition and boundaries 1 1 Greek three

more details on Asian borders  see Geography of Asia  Boundaries between continents  List of transcontinental countries and Copenhagen criteria  Greek three continent system Two point equidistant projection of Asia and surrounding landmasses  The original distinction between Europe and Asia was made by the ancient Greeks  They used the Aegean Sea  the Dardanelles  the Sea of Marmara  the Bosporus  the Black Sea  the Kerch Strait  and the Sea of Azov as the border between Asia and Europe  The Nile was often used as the border between Asia and Africa  then called Libya   although some Greek geographers suggested the Red Sea would form a better boundary  7 Darius  canal between the Nile and the Red Sea introduced considerable variation in opinion  Under the Roman Empire  the Don River emptying into the Black Sea was the western border of Asia  It was the northernmost navigable point of the European shore  citation needed  In the 15th century the Red Sea became established as the boundary between Africa and Asia  replacing the Nile  As exploration developed  the border between Asia and Europe had to be redefined  as the borders of the time did not extend to the arctic  7  Asia Europe boundary The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the Great  king of the Tsardom of Russia  defeating rival claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to the eastern lands  and armed resistance by the tribes of Siberia  synthesized a new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond  founded in 1721  The major geographical theorist of the empire was actually a former Swedish prisoner of war  taken at the Battle of Poltava in 1709 and assigned to Tobolsk  where he associated with Peter s Siberian official  Vasily Tatishchev  and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book  citation needed  At home in Sweden again  five years after Peter s death  in 1730 von Strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the Urals as the border of Asia  The Russians were enthusiastic about the concept  which allowed them to keep their European identity in geography as well as other cultural heritage  Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg  The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary  Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid 19th century  The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects  8  In the maps of the period  Transcaucasia was counted as Asian  The incorporation of most of that region into the Soviet Union tended to push views of the border to the south  Asia Oceania boundary The border between Asia and Oceania is placed somewhere in the Malay archipelago  The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania  devised in the 19th century  have had vastly different geographic meanings since their inception  Oceania has never been Asia  whatever it may have been defined to be  The chief factor in determining what islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there  not all European   Lewis and Wigen assert   The narrowing of  Southeast Asia  to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process   7  Ongoing definition Afro Eurasia shown in red Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact  an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means  In contrast to Europe  Asia is the largest and most culturally diverse of the continents in the seven continent system  9  It does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents  10  In addition to its general inherited geographical meaning  to which the entire literate world subscribes  Asia has any number of agency specific meanings organizationally and operationally of use in more restricted fields of interest  For example  the World University Service of Canada is a volunteer organization dedicated to bringing educational  health and other services to nations that need them the most  The regional divisions most convenient to its operations include  among others  the Middle East and Europe  and South and Southeast Asia  termed just  Asia   11  Its administrative Asia is substantially different from the overall geographic and the same may be said of many hundreds more agencies across the globe that operate in Asia from headquarters elsewhere  Some of the most innovative and perhaps the most transitory uses of  Asia  have been promulgated by the news media reporting on current events  Their classifications must be the most suitable for the news and the sources of it  For example  the BBC News has an Asia Pacific section  which acquires news from anywhere in Australasia  Oceania or the Pacific side of the Americas  12  From the time of Herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the three continent system  Europe  Africa  Asia  on the grounds that there is no or is no substantial physical separation between them  6  For example  Sir Barry Cunliffe  the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford  argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely  the western excrescence of the continent of Asia   13  Geographically  Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of Eurasia with Europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass   or of Afro Eurasia  geologically  Asia  Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass  except for the Suez Canal  and share a common continental shelf  Almost all of Europe and most of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate  adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia  east of the Cherskiy Range  on the North American Plate  Etymology Ptolemy s Asia Asia was originally a concept of Western civilization  14  The place name   Asia   in various forms in a large number of modern languages is of unknown ultimate provenience  Its etymology and language of origin are uncertain  It appears to be one of the most ancient of recorded names  A number of theories have been published  English Asia can be traced through the formation of English literature to Latin literature  where it has the same form  Asia  Whether all uses and all forms of the name derive also from the Latin of the Roman Empire is much less certain  Classical antiquity Latin Asia and Greek      appear to be the same word  Roman authors translated      as Asia  The Romans named a province Asia  which was in the location of the then Asia  There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major  Iraq   of which the name of Minor survived  As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek  it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from       but ancient transitions  due to the lack of literary contexts  are difficult to catch in the act  The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians  such as Herodotus  who were all Greek  Roman civilization Hellenized extensively  Ancient Greek certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name  15  The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus  about 440 BC   not because he innovated it  but because his Histories are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail  He defines it carefully  16  mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read  but whose works are now missing  By it he means Anatolia and the Persian Empire  in contrast to Greece and Egypt  Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women s names were  given to a tract which is in reality one   Europa  Asia  and Libya  referring to Africa   stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of Prometheus  i e  Hesione   but that the Lydians say it was named after Asies  son of Cotys  who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis  17  In Greek mythology   Asia         or  Asie         was the name of a  Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia   18  Herodotus  geographical puzzlement was perhaps only a form of disagreement  as  having read the earlier Greek poetry along with everyone else literate  he would have known perfectly well why places received female names  Athens  Mycenae  Thebes and many other locations in fact had them  In ancient Greek religion  places were under the care of female divinities  parallel to guardian angels  The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories  which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became  Greek mythology   For example  Hesiod mentions the daughters of Tethys and Ocean  among whom are a  holy company    who with the Lord Apollo and the Rivers have youths in their keeping   19  Many of these are geographic  Doris  Rhodea  Europa  Asia  Hesiod explains  20   For there are three thousand neat ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide  and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters   The Iliad  attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer  mentions two Phrygians  the tribe that replaced the Luvians in Lydia  in the Trojan War named Asios  an adjective meaning  Asian    21  and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as        22  Bronze Age Before Greek poetry  the Aegean Sea area was in a Greek Dark Age  at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun  Prior to then in the Bronze Age the records of the Assyrian Empire  the Hittite Empire and the various Mycenaean states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia  certainly in Anatolia  including if not identical to Lydia  These records are administrative and do not include poetry  The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 BC by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the Dorian invasion to this time  The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called Linear B  deciphered by a number of interested parties  most notably by a young World War II cryptographer  Michael Ventris  subsequently assisted by the scholar  John Chadwick  A major cache discovered by Carl Blegen at the site of ancient Pylos included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods  Some of these are of women held in servitude  as study of the society implied by the content reveals   They were used in trades  such as cloth making  and usually came with children  The epithet  lawiaiai   captives   associated with some of them identifies their origin  Some are ethnic names  One in particular  aswiai  identifies  women of Asia   23  Perhaps they were captured in Asia  but some others  Milatiai  appear to have been of Miletus  a Greek colony  which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks  Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased  24  The name is also in the singular  Aswia  which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it  There is a masculine form  aswios  This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa  centered on Lydia  or  Roman Asia   Alternatively  the etymology of the term may be from the Akkadian word  w a   m   which means  to go outside  or  to ascend   referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word asa meaning east  This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for Europe  as being from Akkadian er bu m   to enter  or  set   of the sun   T R  Reid supports this alternative etymology  noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from asu  meaning  east  in Assyrian  ereb for Europe meaning  west    14  The ideas of Occidental  form Latin Occidens  setting   and Oriental  from Latin Oriens for  rising   are also European invention  synonymous with Western and Eastern  14  Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification  almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and Eastern civilizations on the Eurasian continent  14  Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject  14  Also  Assuwa has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent  Asia   25  The Assuwa league was a confederation of states in western Anatolia  defeated by the Hittites under Tudhaliya I around 1400 BC  History Main article  History of Asia 1890 map of Asia The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions  East Asia  South Asia  Southeast Asia and the Middle East  linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian steppes  The coastal periphery was home to some of the world s earliest known civilizations  each of them developing around fertile river valleys  The civilizations in Mesopotamia  the Indus Valley and the Huanghe shared many similarities  These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel  Other innovations  such as writing  seem to have been developed individually in each area  Cities  states and empires developed in these lowlands  The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes  The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo Europeans  who spread their languages into the Middle East  South Asia  and the borders of China  where the Tocharians resided  The northernmost part of Asia  including much of Siberia  was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads  owing to the dense forests  climate and tundra  These areas remained very sparsely populated  The Silk Road connected many civilizations across Asia 26  The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts  The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty  While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially  in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe  However  the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force  for this and other reasons  the nomads who conquered states in China  India  and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local  more affluent societies  The Islamic Caliphate took over the Middle East and Central Asia during the Muslim conquests of the 7th century  The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century  an area extending from China to Europe  Geography This section requires expansion  Main article  Geography of Asia Geography in Asia is rather complicated  while Asia is the largest continent on Earth  and Asia is neighboring with Europe  Africa and Oceania  While neighboring with Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean  It contains 48 countries 27  in its region  with 2 of them  Russia and Turkey  having part of their land in Europe  and also see Geography of Asia for further information  Economy Main article  Economy of Asia Singapore has one of the busiest ports in the world and is the world s fourth largest foreign exchange trading centre  Asia has the second largest nominal GDP of all continents  after Europe  but the largest when measured in purchasing power parity  As of 2010  the largest economies in Asia are China  Japan  India  South Korea and Indonesia  Based on Global Office Locations 2011  Asia dominated the office locations with 4 of top 5 were in Asia  Hong Kong  Singapore  Tokyo  London and Shanghai  Around 68 percent of international firms have office in Hong Kong  28  In the late 1990s and early 2000s  the economies of the PRC 29  and India have been growing rapidly  both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8   Other recent very high growth nations in Asia include Malaysia  Indonesia  Pakistan  Thailand  Vietnam  Mongolia  Uzbekistan  Cyprus and the Philippines  and mineral rich nations such as Kazakhstan  Turkmenistan  Iran  Brunei  United Arab Emirates  Qatar  Kuwait  Saudi Arabia  Bahrain and Oman  According to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book The World Economy  A Millennial Perspective  India had the world s largest economy during 0 BCE and 1000 BCE  30  31  China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history  32  33  34  35  until the British Empire  excluding India  overtook it in the mid 19th century  For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second largest of any single nation in the world  after surpassing the Soviet Union  measured in net material product  in 1986 and Germany in 1968   NB  A number of supernational economies are larger  such as the European Union  EU   the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  or APEC   This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world s second largest economy  In the late 1980s and early 1990s  Japan s GDP was almost as large  current exchange rate method  as that of the rest of Asia combined  citation needed  In 1995  Japan s economy nearly equaled that of the USA as the largest economy in the world for a day  after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen US   Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea  Taiwan  Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim  known as the Asian tigers  which have now all

crucial role in the Economy of India It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2020  37  In terms of GDP per capita  both nominal and PPP adjusted  South Korea will become the second wealthiest country in Asia by 2025  overtaking Germany  the United Kingdom and France  According to IMF statistics for the year 2010  Taiwan PPP adjusted GDP per capita  at USD 34 743  is already higher than that of Finland  France  or Japan  citation needed  By 2027  according to Goldman Sachs  China will have the largest economy in the world  Several trade blocs exist  with the most developed being the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin  and it is rich in natural resources  such as petroleum  forests  fish  water  rice  copper and silver  Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia  particularly in the China  Taiwan  South Korea  Japan  India  the Philippines  and Singapore  Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations  but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads  Many companies from Europe  North America  South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia s developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure  According to Citigroup 9 of 11 Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth  They are Bangladesh  China  India  Indonesia  Iraq  Mongolia  Philippines  Sri Lanka and Vietnam  38  Asia has four main financial centres  Tokyo  Hong Kong  Singapore and Shanghai  Call centres and business process outsourcing  BPOs  are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled  English speaking workers  The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centres  Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry  India has become a major hub for outsourcing  In 2010  Asia had 3 3 million millionaires  people with net worth over US 1 million excluding their homes   slightly below North America with 3 4 million millionaires  Last year Asia had toppled Europe  39  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Asia Historical

language families and many language isolates  Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken  For instance  according to Ethnologue  more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia  more than 800 languages spoken in India  and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines  China has many languages and dialects in different provinces  Religions See also  Eastern philosophy  Religion in Asia  and List of Asian mythologies Buddhist monks in Thailand  Asian mythology is complex and diverse  The story of the Great Flood for example  as presented to Christians in the Old Testament  is first found in Mesopotamian mythology  in the Epic of Gilgamesh  Hindu mythology tells about an Avatar of the God Vishnu in the form of a fish who warned Manu of a terrible flood  In ancient Chinese mythology  Shan Hai Jing  the Chinese ruler Da Yu  had to spend 10 years to control a deluge which swept out most of ancient China and was aided by the goddess N wa who literally fixed the broken sky through which huge rains were pouring  Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings  Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy  They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits  whereas another school of thought from India  C rv ka  preached the enjoyment of material world  Christianity is also present in most Asian countries  Abrahamic Pilgrims in the annual Hajj at the Kaabah in Mecca  The Abrahamic religions of Judaism  Christianity  Islam and Baha i Faith originated in West Asia  Judaism  the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths  is practiced primarily in Israel  which has the world s largest Jewish population   41  though small communities exist in other countries  such as the Bene Israel in India  In the Philippines and East Timor  Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion  it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese  respectively  In Armenia  Cyprus  Georgia and Russia  Eastern Orthodoxy is the predominant religion  Various Christian denominations have adherents in portions of the Middle East  as well as China and India  The world s largest Muslim community  within the bounds of one nation  is in Indonesia  South Asia  mainly Pakistan  India and Bangladesh  holds 30  of Muslims  There are also significant Muslim populations in China  Iran  Malaysia  southern Philippines  Mindanao   Russia and most of West Asia and Central Asia  The Bah    Faith originated in Asia  in Iran  Persia   and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire  Central Asia  India  and Burma during the lifetime of Bah  u ll h  Since the middle of the 20th century  growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries  because the Bah    Faith s activities in many Muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities  Dharmic and Taoist Hindus believe that taking a dip in the holy water of the Ganges removes all past sins  The religions of Hinduism  Buddhism  Jainism and Sikhism originated in India  South Asia  In East Asia  particularly in China and Japan  Confucianism  Taoism and Zen Buddhism took shape  Over 80  of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism  alongside significant communities in Bangladesh  Pakistan  Bhutan  Sri Lanka and Bali  Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma  Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism  Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia  Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of Cambodia  98

small communities in India and Bangladesh  In many Chinese communities  Mahayana Buddhism is easily syncretized with Taoism  thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated  The Communist governed countries of China  Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist  thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under reported  Jainism is found mainly in India and in oversea Indian communities such as India and Malaysia  Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia  especially Southeast Asia  Confucianism is found predominantly in Mainland China  South Korea  Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations  Taoism is found mainly in Mainland China  Taiwan  Malaysia and Singapore  Taoism is easily syncretized with Mahayana Buddhism for many Chinese  thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated  Culture This section
