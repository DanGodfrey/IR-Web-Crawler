Batman  Arkham Asylum  both the Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane and Blackgate Prison remain gutted  the former in a massive breakout launched by the inmates  lead by the Joker and the latter due to a mysterious fire  which the Joker hints was caused by him for his plans in Arkham Asylum  The administrator of Arkham  mayoral candidate Quincy Sharp  soon takes advantage of Batman s defeat of the Joker at Arkham and claims the credit himself for bringing the asylum back under control  perhaps saying Batman was working under his orders  This is partially to salvage his image  in tatters after the single worst asylum riot took place at a crucial time when Sharp was trying to convince the people of Gotham City to vote for him  This is successful  and Sharp is elected mayor of Gotham  though it s actualy thanks to Hugo Strange s partnership with Ra s al Ghoul   His first act is to announce ruined Arkham Asylum and Blackgate Prison both unfit to house criminals  sane or insane  He then undertakes a bold new project  To move all the former inmates of incarceration at both places into a walled off urban district  Arkham City  This will be a city only for villains  and is made up of Gotham City s most notorious slums  including Crime Alley  To guard the perimeter of Arkham City the mayor does away with Arkham Asylum s old security force and replaces them with professional mercenaries from a private military organization  TYGER  who are subjegated to brainwashing by Strange   Once all the criminals are trapped inside the prison city  they are told they may do as they please  but there is only one rule  Do not try escaping or you ll be shot dead  This is supported by the TYGER mercenary forces  who enforce this policy through the liberal use of their firearms on any escaping denizens of Arkham City  Since the entire population of Arkham is made up of criminals running wild on the streets  Sharp secretly hopes they will destroy each other inside walled confinement instead of committing crimes in Gotham  With the criminals free to do whatever they want short of escaping  bloody turf wars erupt as various supervillains carve up Arkham City among themselves  A mysterious figure named Dr  Hugo Strange  an Arkham psychiatrist  is placed at the helm of the project by Sharp  but little is known about his objectives or his shadowy past  and rumors soon run rampant that he is up to horrible things behind Arkham City s walls  Those who try and find out too much about Arkham or Strange one by one mysteriously vanish by night  and it is implied most end up inside the city themselves  to be torn apart by the inmates  Batman  wary of Sharp and even more so of Strange  monitors Arkham City for several months  believing that the entire thing has been a ticking time bomb waiting to explode  PlotEdit  Note the following Details are exclusive to the Main storyline of Arkham City  Details relating to side missions such as information on Catwoman  Riddler  Bane ETC outside of the main storyline should be left out    Thank you for your co operation  One year after the events of Arkham Asylum  Bruce Wayne is holding a press conference in hopes of exposing Arkham City for what it is  a time bomb  Unfortunately  Hugo Strange is one step ahead and takes advantage of the situation to kidnap Batman as Bruce Wayne and the press and dump them into Arkham City to be torn apart  Strange thanks Batman for making it easy to capture him  and with him out of the way   Protocol 10  may proceed as planned  Bruce manages to steal a communications chip from a TYGER guards radio and protect Jack Ryder whilst fending off guards and inmates  The Penguin s gang captures Bruce however  and proceeds to get payback against Bruce for destroying his family  Bruce defeats the Penguin and his gang  breaking his cuffs in the process  and escapes into the City  He then has Alfred send a Batsuit in with the Batplane  Once dressed for the occasion  Batman then uses the TYGER Communications Chip he stole for his Cryptographic Sequencer  The TYGER guards communicate that Catwoman has been captured by Two Face  who is planning to publically trial and execute her in a court house  Batman plans to save her  as he believes her to be the most knowledgeable about the situation at hand  Batman is able to save Catwoman and restrain Two Face  Catwoman states that she doesn t know what Stange is planning but believes it s connected to Joker  While she and Batman were discussing Stange  Joker fires a sniper round into the courthouse which barely misses Catwoman thanks to Batmans quick reflexes  With this  the duo go their seperate ways  Batman traces the round that was fired to a Church tower across the street from the Courthouse  Batman enters the Church to find a complement of guards  a hostage medical team  including Aaron Cash  and Harley Quinn  Harley moves to attack Batman but Batman counters her  Harley states that the Joker isn t feeling well and that Batman can t see him  When she leaves  Batman prompty neutralises the guards and rescue the medical turn  Once at the top of the tower  Batman hijacks the remote feed for the gun  After doing so  Joker appears on the TV s inhabiting the small area  where we see Joker s face twisted with deep cuts  The tower then explodes from bombs placed by the Joker  Batman traces the the remote feed and tracks it to the Steel works  Joker s base of operations  Batman manages to save one of the medical team from Jokers men  to which she explains that she couldn t cure Joker  Batman tracks Joker to his office where he s lured into a trap using a Joker dummy  Batman determines that Joker was never really sick  only for Joker to prove him dead wrong  showing his twisted mutilated face  Joker also reveals that he s injected Batman with his Titan contaminated blood  and has had samples of it shipped to hospitals all over Gotham  intending to poison hundreds to give Batman the motivation to find a cure for him  Batman believes this to be Protocol 10  however Joker says he s never heard of it  and proceeds to push Batman out of a window  Batman takes a chip from a cellphone from Joker and puts it into his cowl in case Joker has information about the cure for him  Joker states that he blackmailed Mr  Freeze to make the cure for him but he s lost contact with him  Batman traces Mr  Freeze s base of operations to a old forensic lab formerly used by the GCPD  He discovers that he has been kidnapped by the Penguin and  by interrogating a thug  learns that his base of operations is in the old museum  After a few complications  Batman infiltraites the Museum and learns that  against his advice  Commisioner Gordon had sent an undercover team to infiltrate the gangs of Arkham City and Penguin has captured all 10 of them  After Penguin kills one of the cops  Batman promises him that he ll take him down  Batman rescues the hostages and reunites Freeze with his Suit  Freeze gives Batman a chip that acts as a failsafe in case someone ever managed to turn his tech against him  which proves vital to defeating Penguin since he is using Freeze s cryo gun  Penguin  however  has an ace up his sleeve  He dumps Batman into the basement of the Iceberg Lounge where he is keeping Solomon Grundy and amplifying his abilities with electricity  Batman tears into the Swamp Zombie s chest and destroys his vital organs  killing Solomon Grundy  Batman takes Penguin into the custody of the police officers and proceeds to get the cure from Freeze  Freeze states that the cure is incomplete and requires an enzyme that he cannot create  Batman recognizes the enzyme from blood tests he s run on Ra s al Ghul  Batman proceeds to follow one of Talia al Ghul s personal assassins back to the League of Assassin s headquarters  located in the ruins of the failed Wonder City project  Along the way  Batman is ambushed by more assassins and is saved by Robin  Batman gives a sample of his blood to Robin and tells him to find everyone with the poison in their veins  as they will likely be dead in 24 hours unless Freeze s antidote gets to them  Unfortunately  Joker s poisoned blood has started to take effect and Batman estimates that he only has a few hours left to live  Supposedly  because he has no other choice  Batman finally accepts Ra s offer to become his heir to the League of Assassin s  As part of his initiation to the League  Batman drinks a sample of the  Blood of the Demon  which boosts his health but doesn t completely cure him  Once passing his tests Batman confronts Ra s himself  who states that in order to become head of the League  Batman simply has to kill him  Batman refuses to kill under any circumstances  prompting Ra s to get himself into fighting shape by jumping into his Lazarus Pit and emersing Batman into a hallucination where he is all powerful  Batman nearly defeats Ra s  but at the last moment  he takes Talia hostage and tries to force Batman to kill him to save Talia  whom Ra s states is the only woman Batman has ever loved  supposedly   Instead  Batman simply knocks him to the ground via a well placed Batarang and acquires the blood sample he came for  Angrily  Talia runs off after having been used and betrayed by the only two people she loves  Ra s also reveals that the reason why he s seeking an heir is because years of Lazarus Pit use has mutated his body and mind  He says that each time he comes out of the Pit  he fears more and more what will come out next  Batman gives Ra s one chance to break his addiction or he ll come back and break it for him  Batman has no time to go after Talia  as he needs to get the blood to Freeze  Once back at the GCPD lab  Batman gives the blood to Freeze  which he uses to complete the antidote  However  at the last moment  Freeze tries to use the antidote to blackmail Batman into rescuing Nora Fries  whom has been kidnapped by the Joker to try and force Freeze to make the antidote  They proceed to fight each other over the antidote and Batman defeats Freeze  However  it is revealed that during the fight  Harley Quinn had broken into Freeze s safe and taken the antidote  Freeze tries to help Batman defeat Joker  hoping that he ll rescue Nora  by giving him am armament of Cryo bombs he developed  Unfortunately  on his way to Joker s hideout Vicki Vale s news team is shot down by Joker and they re caught in a war between Joker and Penguin s thugs  Batman easily rescues Vicky and moves on  being informed that the attack was a distraction to buy Harley time to get back to base  During his trek to the Steel Works  Batman discovers that Mayor Sharp has been imprisoned in the city  Batman rescues and interrogates him but learns no useful information  Batman then continues to the Steel Works  Once inside  Oracle calls and tells Batman that Strange has called an emergency meeting to activate Protocol 10  Strange claims that he failed to stop the spread of illegal firearms  which he provided  in the city and that the inmates are preparing an attack  Using this  Strange has gained permission to activate Protocol 10 in 30 minutes  Batman eventually confronts Joker who fights Batman with the assistance of one of the Abramovici Twins  a Titan enhanced Thug  and a small army of thugs  Once the fighting is over  a Protocol 10 missile is detonated nearby and debris pins Batman to the ground  With this  Talia al Ghul shows up and offers Joker immortality in exchange for Batman s life  Joker agrees to the deal but Talia plants one of Batman s tracking devices onto herself  subtly telling Batman to follow her lead  Meanwhile  across town  Catwoman and Poison Ivy are arguing  Catwoman neglected to water Poison Ivy s plants and now there is only one left which is locked up in Strange s vault  protected by TYGER  Catwoman convinces Ivy to allow her to retreive the plant from the confiscated goods vault  During the effort to break into the vault  Catwoman overhears Strange s plans to wipe out Arkham  and has apparently killed Batman  Against her better judgement  Catwoman proceeds to rescue Batman with success  Once outside  Batman realizes that Protocol 10 is actually missile strikes against Arkham  It was a ploy to gather every criminal in Gotham in one place and wipe them out  Batman orders Oracle and Alfred to remotely hack Wonder Tower and stop Protocol 10 while he goes to rescue Talia from Joker  Instead  Alfred and Oracle cut Batman off from Wayne Tech telemetry and force him to stop Protocol 10 first  Determining that the Tower is on lockdown  Batman hacks the TYGER Patrol helicopters and eventually finds the Master Control Chip  With it  he sneaks into the tower to confront Strange  Once inside  Strange accuses Batman that the super villain problem is his fault and he has created an environment in which the criminal element has spiraled out of control  Like a plague  they have been forced to mutate and evolve  but never completely wiped out  until now  Batman proceeds to eliminate TYGER forces and confront Strange  Batman gives Oracle access to the system and she shuts down Protocol 10  At this point Ra s arrives  revealing himself to be the mastermind behind the whole plot  When Strange came to him with Batman s identity  he was so impressed that he offered this one chance to prove his worth and succeed him  which now he has failed  and Ra s stabs him in the back  With Strange s dying breath he activates  Protocol 11   a self destruct sequence for Wonder Tower  Batman attempts to save Ra s during the fall  However  Ra s tries to take advantage of the situation attempts and stab himself and Batman midfall  but only succeeds in killing himself  Joker announces that he has taken Talia to the Monarch Theater and is planning on killing her  Batman arrives at the theater where Joker demands  at gun point  that Batman will hand over the cure  Batman is confused at Joker s statement  as he is apparently healthy and had already stolen the cure  At this point  Talia runs her sword through Joker and reveals that she stole the cure from Harley Quinn  Batman then pieces together clues taken throughout the night  revealing that there has been two Jokers all along  a healthy Joker standing in for a sick one  The Sick Joker kills Talia  while the healthy one reveals himself to be Clayface  who accepted Joker s offer to fill in for him simply for the role of a lifetime and steals the cure from Talia s corpse before Batman can get to it  Clayface and Batman fight  Batman using freeze bombs to freeze Clayface and carve him up with Talia s sword  With Clayface apparently defeated  Joker detonates high explosives on the floor of the theater  causing it to collapse  and bringing the fight into the very Lazarus Pit Joker had been looking for  Batman defeats Clayface a second time and retreives the cure  sipping it immediately  Joker comes down into the room and demands that Batman gets out of the way to the Lazarus Pit  Instead  Batman throws the sword into the electrical equipment for the Pit and destroys it  After this Joker  still dying  states that despite all that he s done  Batman will still save him and demands the antidote immediately  Batman briefly contemplates allowing Joker to die but the impatient Joker tries to get the antidote by force  causing Batman to drop the antidote and shattering it on the floor  Batman states that the sad part is that he decided to give Joker the antidote despite all that he s done  Joker thinks the comment is hilarious and dies laughing  Batman carries Joker s body out of Arkham and leaves it on the hood of a GCPD patrol car  Later that night  Batman and Catwoman meet in the ruins of Arkham  Batman states that there is still a lot of work left to do in Arkham City  for the both of them  CharactersEdit Heroes AlliesEdit Bruce Wayne Batman Skins   Certain skins were

thrown objects by catching them and throwing back  and he can flip over an enemy and attack another in a fluid movement  Batman also has a few new moves in the game  Beatdown  performed by pressing X and B  360  or Square and Circle  PS3  that unleashes a flurry of punches and kicks on his opponent  A demonstrated use of this is to takedown armoured enemies  Batman also has combat abilties added in addition to the new movement abilities He can pull off a new move called Dive Bomb  Batman can drop from either a great height  or execute the manoeuvre mid glide  plummeting towards the ground to either reach his destination quicker  or make a dramatic entrance to a fight  Rocksteady have confirmed that thugs will jump back in fear  and are not forced back by a form of shockwave generated by Batman s impact  As well as the Glide kick  Batman can perform and a throat slam by firing his grapple gun at an enemy whilst gliding  which fire Batman into his opponent  slamming them into the ground  Batman will use the environment against his enemies  thanks to context sensitive animations Batman will slam thugs heads against walls if he is close enough  You can employ Explosive Gel into combat  executing a quick flip  Batman can spray either the ground or an enemy  and detonate the gel at his leisure for explosive effect  Batman s attacks can knock thugs into each other  potentially taking multiple enemies out at the same time  DetectiveEdit In Arkham City Detective Vision has been given an overhaul  in Arkham Asylum DV made the environment transparent and enemies illuminated  To combat a frequent problem of players simply leaving the mode on  and severally reducing the visual experience of the game  in Arkham City DV will highlight enemies and interactive objects in more detail and at greater range than before  though the environment will be very hard to distinguish  forcing players to use DV sparsely if they want to navigate effectively  Detective vision will highlight all characters  weapons and interactive objects in the area  GadgetsEdit BatarangsEdit The standard batarang remains the same as in Batman  Arkham Asylum  However  three Batarangs  Multibatarang  can no longer be fired simultaneously  Explosive GelEdit Also returns from Arkham Asylum  the gel can be deployed in combat  either against the environment  or onto an attacker  It s less useful than its predecessor  due to the loss of selective and automatic detonation  BatclawEdit Can pull thugs towards Batman  who are then promptly finished off with a brutal takedown  Can also be used to grab items like Riddler Trophies  In contrast to its predecessor  it can t be upgraded to the Ultrabatclaw  Cryptographic SequencerEdit Batman s remote hacking device allows him to decode encrypted data sticks and listen in on radio broadcasts throughout Arkham City  such as GCPD comms  which may alert him to crimes  It is also used to hack into Riddler communications to locate Riddler hostages  Line LauncherEdit An improved version to it s predecessors  in Arkham Asylum  able to fire multiple lines  hold a static line across two points  and be utilised for a special drop kick  for more details please refer to the in depth description in the Movement section  Remote Control BatarangEdit Another returnee from Arkham Asylum  this new RC Batarang has new features that enable it to perform a 180 degree turn  boost through the air and brake  Previews have also stated the RC  rang is capable of carrying an electrical charge  to solve a Riddler riddle  Sonic BatarangEdit Another addition from Arkham Asylum  this the sonic batarang remains the same  However it can be used much more frequently  Smoke BombsEdit A new addition to Batman s arsenal  allowing him to make a hasty escape if discovered  For more information  please read our Silent Predator section  Remote Electric ChargeEdit A combination tool and weapon used by Batman in Arkham City  the REC fires electronic pulses at enemies to stun them or to power electronic generators  DisruptorEdit Although originally designed to shut down Mr  Freeze s gun  the disruptor can be used to disable guns and detonate mines as well  Freeze TechnologyEdit New to the game  these gadgets are based upon equipment designed by Victor Fries and are used like grenades  They can be used to freeze environmental hazards  create chunks of ice to cross water  and against enemies  MovementEdit Arkham City is five times bigger then Arkham Asylum  Because of that  there is a less constrictive feel to the game  and a lot more movement options for Batman has been given  Gliding has been given a major overhaul in Arkham City  in Asylum  the player was limited to a very simple glide mechanic that allowed the player to slow descent  allowing them to cover more ground whilst airborne  and perform turns in the air  In Arkham City  Batman swoops across the rooftops  and can execute two new moves that allow him to maintain his glide indefinitely  The first move  the Dive Boost  is very similar to the Dive Bomb  where Batman will pull his cape in and hurtle towards the ground  opening his cape at the last second  and using the newfound boost to make him soar back upwards into the sky  The second move is the Grapple Boost  Batman can fire the grappling gun from the first game in mid glide  and use the line to pull himself through the city  If Batman is feeling tired  or perhaps wants to travel around in a stealthier fashion  he can now use his Grappel Gun to zip up to a helicopter and hang off it  as well as a sneaky way to travel around Arkham City  Batman can also use this elevated position to plan out his next plan of attack  before dropping into the frey  The Line Launcher from Arkham Asylum makes a return  but the gadget has been heavily upgraded since the last time we saw it  Batman is still able to use it to quickly get from one place to another  though in Arkham City it will open up a whole new range of movement and strategic possibilities  Rocksteady have confirmed that the player is able to fire and travel along the rope line  in the same manner as which they did in Asylum  however this time around the player can swivel the camera around Batman  and at any point during the Line Launcher transportation  execute a flip into the air  following up with a quick second shot from the Line Launcher  Batman can perform this move with 360 degrees of flexibility  and similar to the Grapple Boost  this tactic can be repeated to keep Batman off the ground indefinitely  When travelling down the line  the player can press a button that will slow down time  allowing for easier line launcher shots  Batman can also anchor his line between any two points  and then flip up on to it  balancing in place  Batman can move the distance of line  using his position to plan an attack  More aggressive players can then choose a target  and swing down using the line  slamming their chosen enemy into the ground  The Silent Predator missions have returned  In Arkham Asylum Batman could perform many exotic environment based takedowns  Such as the Corner Takedown or Ledge Takedown  Arkham City is set to increase the variety of these takedowns  Similar to combat  we ve excluded certain gadgets like the Ultra Sonic Emitter  which can summon bats to aid you  and will go into the stealthier aspects of the Dark Knight at a later date  Batman can burst through thin walls to grab an enemy and choke him unconscious  in gameplay terms it s a combination of Asylum s explosive gel and a standard silent takedown  Batman can now perform double silent takedowns  as well as hanging takedowns  Batman also has a new smokebomb gadget  small smoke grenade that distracts the enemy and obscures Batman from view just long enough for the Dark Knight to make his escape  To use the smoke bomb  the player must hit the Y or Triangle button when he is spotted by enemies  Batman can also sabotage his enemies weapons  so that when enemies spot and attempt to fire at him  the guns will misfire  NotesEdit Buying the game will grant you access to the Gotham City Imposters Beta come it s release  The song playing during the first official gameplay reveal trailer is  Short Change Hero  by The Heavy  Though Tim Drake is Robin in the game  the Animated Series skin is Dick Grayson rather than the Tim Drake design from the revamped New Batman Adventures  Also his standard skin features a hooded cape  which is more closely linked to Damian Wayne  Tim s successor as Robin  and Bruce Wayne s son  The Scarecrow is the only villain who appeared physically in the first game that did not return in the second game  However a Riddle and an Easter Egg were made for him  Thugs have a much wider variety of appearances than in the first game  Most thugs are grouped into gangs  each headed by a staple Batman villain  Gang members and territories are heavily stylized and individualized based on the gang s leader  You can keep track of the gangs in your criminal database  Thugs not attached to a gang roam the streets  Riddler thugs have replaced Riddler maps in the new game  and will require interrogation before they will talk  There are many side quests apart from the main story  One of them involves Batman following a string of payphones being called by Victor Zsasz before finally confronting him  Another involves Batman teaming up with Bane to track down a chemical contriband  Arkham City features dynamic music  that directly mirrors and reacts to the actions you chose and undertake whilst playing the game  Arkham City is at least five times the size of Arkham Asylum  Arkham City s storyline takes place approximately 80  outdoors  and 20  indoors  One of Arkham City s main quadrants  Amusement Mile  is heavily flooded and damaged  This may be an allusion to the No Man s Land storyline  during which Gotham falls victim to a massive earthquake and is isolated from the outside world  The damage may even be a result of the earthquake in question  The primary storyline of Arkham City is very similar to that of Batman Begins  specifically the story of Ra s al Ghul manipulating events from behind the scenes to destroy Gotham from within  The game s story is also reminiscent of Batman  No Man s Land The Arkham City Lockdown tie in for IOS devices features Deathstroke in an exclusive Boss Fight Added by Lastsonofkrypton During the game  various characters will reference the TV Drama series Lost   Joker        Imagine your favorite show  You ve been through it all  The ups  the downs  the crazy coincidences  And then  BANG  They tell you what it s all about  Would you be happy  Does it make sense  How come it all ended in a church    Wait did they ever explain what the island was     Paul Dini  one of the creators of the game  had previously worked on Lost  Some thugs mention villains that don t appear in the game such as Crazy Quilt  Ratcatcher and Scarecrow  Characters in the game mention previous events  such as Talia referencing a past relationship with Batman  While using the Cryptographic Sequencer  a voice can be heard at three location each of which gives a different code through numbers  Find the coordinates X700 00  Y490 00 on the Sequencer to intercept a radio frequency that contains the following repeating numbers

Decoding this message is more complicated  First  match each number to its corresponding letter in the alphabet  A 1  B 2  C 3  etc    This gives the sequence  C T Z R Z P X A K D X I C H E B L R F P G K C J Q E M D U H  Using an Atbash cipher  A is substituted for Z  Y for B  X for C  and so on  This gives the sequence  X G A I A K C Z P W C R X S V Y O I U K T P X Q J V N W F S  Finally  a Vigenere ciphere is used  A keyword is needed to solve the cipher  and the keyword for the code is  SCARECROW   Once decoded  it reads   Fear will tear Gotham City to shreds   Some inmates jokes that
