k b  s d umhu ije ti    is a Eurasian island country located in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea  5  6  east of Greece  south of Turkey  west of Syria  Lebanon and Israel and north of Egypt  Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea and the Republic of Cyprus is a member state of the European Union  The earliest known human activity on the island dates back to around the 10th millennium BCE  Archaeological remains from this period include the well preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia  which has been declared a World Heritage Site with an  enhanced protection  status in the event of armed conflict 7  by UNESCO  along with the archaeological sites of Paphos and the Painted Churches of the Troodos Region  Cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world  8  and is the site of the earliest known example of feline domestication  9  10  At a strategic location in the Middle East  11  12  13  14  Cyprus has been occupied by several major powers  including the empires of the Hittites  Assyrians  Egyptians  Persians  Rashidun and Umayyad Arab caliphates  Lusignans  Venetians  and Ottomans  Settled by Mycenean Greeks in the 2nd millennium BCE  the island also experienced long periods of Greek rule under the Ptolemaic Egyptians and the Byzantines  In 333 BCE  Alexander the Great conquered the island from the Persians  The Ottoman Empire conquered the island in 1571 and it remained under Ottoman control for over three centuries  It was placed under British administration in 1878 until it was granted independence in 1960  15  becoming a member of the Commonwealth the following year  In 1974  following 11 years of intercommunal violence between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots  16  an attempted coup d  tat by Greek Cypriot nationalists 17  18  and elements of the Greek military junta 19  with the aim of achieving enosis  union of the island with Greece  took place  19  Turkey used this as a pretext to invade the northern portion of the island  Turkish forces remained after a cease fire  resulting in the partition of the island  an objective of Turkey since 1955  19  The intercommunal violence and subsequent Turkish invasion led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Cypriots and the establishment of a separate Turkish Cypriot political entity in the north  These events and the resulting political situation are matters of ongoing dispute  The Republic of Cyprus has de jure 20 sovereignty over the island of Cyprus and its surrounding waters  except for the British military bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia  The Republic of Cyprus is de facto partitioned into two main parts  the area under the effective control of the Republic of Cyprus  comprising about 59  of the island s area  and the Turkish controlled area in the north  21  calling itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and recognised only by Turkey  covering about 36  of the island s area  Cyprus is the third most populous island in the Mediterranean Sea and one of its most popular tourist destinations  22  An advanced  23 high income economy with a very high Human Development Index  24  25  the Republic

The earliest attested reference to Cyprus is the 15th century BC Mycenaean Greek ku pi ri jo  28  meaning  Cypriot   written in Linear B syllabic script  29  The classical Greek form of the name is        Kupros  The etymology of the name is unknown  Suggestions include  the Greek word for the Mediterranean cypress tree  Cupressus sempervirens               kyp rissos  the Greek name of the henna plant  Lawsonia alba           k pros  an Eteocypriot word for copper  Georges Dossin  for example  suggests that it has roots in the Sumerian word for copper  zubar  or for bronze  kubar   from the large deposits of copper ore found on the island  Through overseas trade  the island has given its name to the Classical Latin word for copper through the phrase aes Cyprium   metal of Cyprus   later shortened to Cuprum  30  Cyprus  more specifically the seashore at Paphos  was also one of the birthplaces given in Greek mythology for Aphrodite  who was known as Kupria  This was because Astarte  goddess of love and beauty in Phoenician mythology  for whom Cyprus was an important cult centre  was later identified with Aphrodite  The standard demonym relating to Cyprus or its people or culture is Cypriot  The terms Cypriote and Cyprian are also  less frequently  used   edit  History Main articles  History of Cyprus and Timeline of Cypriot history  edit  Ancient times Main articles  Prehistoric Cyprus and Ancient history of Cyprus Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates  Kourion  The earliest confirmed site of human activity on Cyprus is Aetokremnos  situated on the south coast  indicating that hunter gatherers were active on the island from around 10 000 BCE  31  with settled village communities dating from 8200 BC  The arrival of the first humans correlates with the extinction of the dwarf hippos and dwarf elephants  32  Water wells discovered by archaeologists in western Cyprus are believed to be among the oldest in the world  dated at 9 000 to 10 500 years old  8  Remains of an 8 month old cat were discovered buried with its human owner at a separate Neolithic site in Cyprus  9  The grave is estimated to be 9 500 years old  predating ancient Egyptian civilization and pushing back the earliest known feline human association significantly  10  The remarkably well preserved Neolithic village of Khirokitia is a UNESCO World Heritage Site dating to approximately 6800 BCE  33  The island was part of the Hittite empire during the late Bronze Age until the arrival of two waves of Greek settlement  34  The first wave consisted of Mycenaean Greek traders who started visiting Cyprus around 1400 BCE  35  36  A major wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place following the Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece in the period 1100 1050 BCE  with the island s predominantly Greek character dating from this period  36  37  Cyprus occupies an important role in Greek mythology being the birthplace of Aphrodite and Adonis  and home to King Cinyras  Teucer and Pygmalion  38  Beginning in the 8th century BCE Phoenician colonies were founded on the south coast of Cyprus  near present day Larnaca and Salamis  36  Cyprus was ruled by Assyria for a century starting in 708 BCE  before a brief spell under Egyptian rule and eventually Persian rule in 545 BCE  36  The Cypriots  led by Onesilus  king of Salamis  joined their fellow Greeks in the Ionian cities during the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt in 499 BCE against the Achaemenid Empire  The revolt was suppressed  but Cyprus managed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and remained oriented towards the Greek world  36  The island was brought under permanent Greek rule by Alexander the Great and the Ptolemies of Egypt following his death  Full Hellenization took place during the Ptolemaic period  which ended when Cyprus was annexed by the Roman Republic in 58 BCE  36   edit  Middle Ages Main articles  Cyprus in the Middle Ages and Kingdom of Cyprus Paphos Castle  When the Roman Empire was divided into Eastern and Western parts in 395  Cyprus became part of the East Roman  or Byzantine Empire  and would remain part of it until the Crusades some 800 years later  Under Byzantine rule  the Greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong Hellenistic Christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the Greek Cypriot community  36  Beginning in 649  Cyprus suffered from devastating raids launched from the Levant  which continued for the next 300 years  36  Many were quick piratical raids  but others were large scale attacks in which many Cypriots were slaughtered and great wealth carried off or destroyed  36  Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Cyprus  There are no Byzantine churches which survive from this period  thousands of people were killed  and many cities   such as Salamis   were destroyed and never rebuilt  36  Byzantine rule was restored in 965  when Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas scored decisive victories on land and sea  36  In 1191  during the Third Crusade  Richard I of England captured the island from Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus 39  He used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the Saracens  A year later Richard sold the island to the Knights Templar  who  following a bloody revolt  in turn sold it to Guy of Lusignan  His brother and successor Amalric was recognized as King of Cyprus by Henry VI  Holy Roman Emperor  36  Following the death in 1473 of James II  the last Lusignan king  the Republic of Venice assumed control of the island  while the late king s Venetian widow  Queen Catherine Cornaro  reigned as figurehead  Venice formally annexed Cyprus in 1489  following the abdication of Catherine  36  The Venetians fortified Nicosia by building the famous Venetian Walls  and used it as an important commercial hub  Throughout Venetian rule  the Ottoman Empire frequently raided Cyprus  In 1539 the Ottomans destroyed Limassol and so fearing the worst  the Venetians also fortified Famagusta and Kyrenia  36  During the almost four centuries of Latin rule  there existed two societies on Cyprus  The first consisted of Frankish nobles and their retinue  as well as Italian merchants and their families  The second  the majority of the population  consisted of Greek Cypriots  serfs and laborers  Although a determined effort was made to supplant native traditions and culture  the effort failed  36   edit  Ottoman Empire Main article  Ottoman Cyprus In 1570  a full scale Ottoman assault with 60 000 troops brought the island under Ottoman control  despite stiff resistance by the inhabitants of Nicosia and Famagusta  20 000 Nicosians were put to death  and every church  public building  and palace was looted  40  The previous Latin elite was destroyed and the first significant demographic change since antiquity took place when Ottoman Janissaries were settled on the island  17  Historical map of Cyprus by Piri Reis  The Ottomans abolished the feudal system previously in place and applied the millet system to Cyprus  under which non Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities  In a reversal from the days of Latin rule  the head of the Church of Cyprus was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities  40  Ottoman rule of Cyprus was at times indifferent  at times oppressive  depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials  and during this period the island fell into economic decline  40  In 1828  modern Greece s first president Ioannis Kapodistrias whose maternal ancestors were Greek Cypriots  41  42  called for union of Cyprus with Greece  and numerous minor uprisings took place  43  Reaction to Ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots  although none was successful  By 1872  the population of the island had risen to 144 000 comprising 44 000 Muslims and 100 000 Christians  44  Centuries of neglect by the Turks  the unrelenting poverty of most of the people  and the ever present tax collectors fuelled Greek nationalism  and by 19th century the idea of enosis  or union  with newly independent Greece was firmly rooted among Greek Cypriots  40   edit  British Empire Main article  Modern history of Cyprus Hoisting the British flag at Nicosia  In the aftermath of the Russo Turkish War  1877 1878  and the Congress of Berlin  Cyprus was leased to the British Empire which de facto took over its administration in 1878  though  in terms of sovereignty  it remained a de jure Ottoman territory until 1914  together with Egypt and Sudan  in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible Russian aggression  36  The island would serve Britain as a key military base in its colonial routes  By 1906  when the Famagusta harbour was completed  Cyprus was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the Suez Canal  the crucial main route to India which was then Britain s most important overseas possession  Following the outbreak of World War I and the decision of the Ottoman Empire to join the war on the side of the Central Powers  the British Empire formally annexed Cyprus  Egypt and Sudan on 5 November 1914 as a response  36  Cypriot demonstrations for Enosis  Union  with Greece in 1930  In 1915  Britain offered Cyprus to Constantine I of Greece on condition that Greece join the war on the side of the British  which he declined  In 1923  under the Treaty of Lausanne  the nascent Turkish republic relinquished any claim to Cyprus  and in 1925 it was declared a British crown colony  36  Many Greek Cypriots fought in the British Army during both World Wars  in the hope that Cyprus would eventually be united with Greece  45  During World War II many enlisted in the Cyprus Regiment  In January 1959  the Church of Cyprus organized a referendum  which was boycotted by the Turkish Cypriot community  where over 90  clarification needed  voted in favor of  enosis   meaning union with Greece  46  47  Restricted autonomy under a constitution was proposed by the British administration but eventually rejected  In 1955 the EOKA organisation was founded  seeking independence and union with Greece through armed struggle  At the same time the Turkish Resistance Organisation  TMT   calling for Taksim  or partition  was established by the Turkish Cypriots as a counterweight  48  Turmoil on the island was met with force by the British   edit  Independence The first president of Cyprus Makarios III  On 16 August 1960  Cyprus attained independence after the Z rich and London Agreement between the United Kingdom  Greece and Turkey  The UK retained the two Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia  while government posts and public offices were allocated by ethnic quotas  giving the minority Turkish Cypriots a permanent veto  30  in parliament and administration  and granting the three mother states guarantor rights  In 1963  inter communal violence broke out  partially sponsored by both  motherlands   As a result  Turkish Cypriots were forced into enclaves and Cypriot President Archbishop Makarios III called for unilateral constitutional changes as a means to ease tensions over the whole island  The United Nations deployed forces in Cyprus  UNFICYP  at flash points  49  In 1964  Turkey tried to intervene in Cyprus 50  in response to the ongoing Cypriot intercommunal violence  But Turkey was stopped by a strongly worded telegram from the US President Lyndon B  Johnson on 5 June  warning that the United States would not stand beside Turkey in case of a consequential Soviet invasion of Turkish territory  51   edit  Contemporary era Main articles  Cypriot intercommunal violence  Greek military junta of 1967 1974  and Turkish invasion of Cyprus On 15 July 1974  the Greek military junta carried out a coup d  tat in Cyprus  to unite the island with Greece  The coup ousted president Makarios III and replaced him with pro enosis nationalist Nikos Sampson  52  Five days later  on the 20th July 1974  the Turkish army invaded the island on the pretext of restoring the constitutional order of the Republic of Cyprus by claiming a right to intervene as one of the guarantors of the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee  The Turkish air force began bombing Greek positions on Cyprus  hundreds of paratroops were dropped in the area between Nicosia and Kyrenia  where well armed Turkish Cypriot enclaves had been long established  while off the Kyrenia coast  30 Turkish troop ships protected by destroyers landed 6 000 men as well as tanks  trucks  and armored vehicles  Three days later  when a ceasefire had been agreed  Turkey had landed 30 000 troops on the island and captured Kyrenia  the corridor linking Kyrenia to Nicosia  and Turkish Cypriot quarter of Nicosia itself  The junta in Athens  and then the Sampson regime in Cyprus fell from power  In Nicosia  Glafkos Clerides assumed the presidency and constitutional order was restored  removing the pretext for the Turkish invasion  But during the negotiations  the Turks reinforced their Kyrenia bridgehead and prepared for a second invasion  The invasion began on 14 August and resulted in the seizure of Morphou  Karpass  Famagusta and the Mesaoria  The Greek Cypriot forces were unable to resist the Turkish advance  International pressure led to a ceasefire  and by then 37  of the island had been taken over by the Turks and 180 000 Greek Cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north  53  At the same time  around 50 000 Turkish Cypriots moved to the areas under the control of the Turkish Forces and settled in the properties of the displaced Greek Cypriots  Among a variety of sanctions against Turkey  in mid 1975 the US Congress imposed an arms embargo on Turkey for using American supplied equipment during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974  54  After the restoration of constitutional order and the return of Archbishop Makarios III to Cyprus in December 1974  the Turkish troops remained on the island occupying the northeastern portion of the island  In 1983  Turkish Cypriots proclaimed the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  which is recognised only by Turkey  As of today  there are 1 534 Greek Cypriots 55  and 502 Turkish Cypriots 56  missing as a result of the fighting  The events of the summer of 1974 dominate the politics on the island  as well as Greco Turkish relations  Around 150 000 settlers from Turkey are believed to be living in the north in violation of the Geneva Convention and various UN resolutions  57  58  Following the invasion and the capture of its northern territory by Turkish troops  the Republic of Cyprus announced that all of its ports of entry in the north were closed  as they were effectively not under its control  citation needed  The Turkish invasion and occupation and the self declaration of independence of the TRNC have been condemned by several United Nations Resolutions  The Security Council reaffirms this every year  59  The last major effort to settle the Cyprus dispute was the Annan Plan in 2004  It gained the support of the Turkish Cypriots but was rejected by the Greek Cypriots  who perceived it to disproportionately favor Turks  60  On May 1  2004 Cyprus joined the European Union together with nine other countries  61  In July 2006  the island served as a safe haven for people fleeing Lebanon because of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah  62  In March 2008  a wall that for decades had stood at the boundary between the Republic of Cyprus and the UN buffer zone was demolished  63  The wall had cut across Ledra Street in the heart of Nicosia and was seen as a strong symbol of the island s 32 year division  On 3 April 2008  Ledra Street was reopened in the presence of Greek and Turkish Cypriot officials  64   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Cyprus Topographic

island in the Mediterranean Sea  after the Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia  both in terms of area and population   It is also the world s 81st largest by area and world s 49th largest by population  It measures 240 kilometres  149 mi  long from end to end and 100 kilometres  62 mi  wide at its widest point  with Turkey 75 kilometres  47 mi  to the north  It lies between latitudes 34  and 36  N  and longitudes 32  and 35  E  Other neighbouring territories include Syria and Lebanon to the east  105 kilometres  65 mi  and 108 kilometres  67 mi   respectively   Israel 200 kilometres

249 mi  to Rhodes  and 800 kilometres  497 mi  to the Greek mainland  The physical relief of the island is dominated by two mountain ranges  the Troodos Mountains and the smaller Kyrenia Range  and the central plain they encompass  the Mesaoria  The Mesaoria plain is drained by the Pedieos River  the longest on the island  The Troodos Mountains cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area  The highest point on Cyprus is Mount Olympus at 1 952 m  6 404 ft   located in the centre of the Troodos range  The narrow Kyrenia Range  extending along the northern coastline  occupies substantially less area  and elevations are lower  reaching a maximum of 1 024 m  3 360 ft   Geopolitically  the island is subdivided into four main segments  The Republic of Cyprus occupies the southern two thirds of the island  59 74    The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus occupies the northern third  34 85    and the United Nations controlled Green Line provides a buffer zone that separates the two and covers 2 67  of the island  Lastly  two bases under British sovereignty are located on the island  Akrotiri and Dhekelia  covering the remaining

suffering from an ongoing shortage of water  The country relies heavily on rain to provide household water and for many years now  the average annual rainfall seemed to be falling  Between 2001 and 2004  exceptionally heavy annual rainfall pushed water reserves up  with supply exceeding demand  allowing total storage in the island s reservoirs to rise to an all time high by the start of 2005  However  since then demand has increased annually   a result of local population growth  foreigners relocating to Cyprus and the number of visiting tourists   while supply has fallen  Cyprus has a total of 107 dams  plus one currently under construction  and reservoirs  with a total water storage capacity of about 330 000 000 m3  1 2 1010 cu ft   70  Dams remain the principal source of water both for domestic and agricultural use  Water desalination plants are gradually being constructed in order to deal with recent years of prolonged drought  The Government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 percent of domestic water since 2001  Efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Cyprus Cyprus is a Presidential republic  The head of state and of the government is elected by a process of Universal suffrage for a five year term  Executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the House of Representatives whilst the Judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature  The 1960 Constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive  legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots  The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice president elected by their respective communities for five year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions  Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters  rolls  Cyprus has been a member state of the European Union since 2004 Following clashes between the two communities the Turkish Cypriot seats in the House remain vacant since 1965  Turkish Cypriots refused to establish the state of affairs before the invasion of Cyprus as is evident in the Secretary General of the United Nations who said  The Turkish Cypriot leaders have adhered to a rigid stand against any measures which might involve having members of the two communities live and work together  or which might place Turkish Cypriots in situations where they would have to acknowledge the authority of Government agents  Indeed  since the Turkish Cypriot leadership is committed to physical and geographical separation of the communities as a political goal  it is not likely to encourage activities by Turkish Cypriots which may be interpreted as demonstrating the merits of an alternative policy  The result has been a seemingly deliberate policy of self segregation by the Turkish Cypriots   71  By 1974 the two communities had returned to a more tolerant state of living  71  Cyprus president Dimitris Christofias and Cyprus first lady with U S  President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama  In 1974 Cyprus was divided de facto when the Turkish army occupied the northern third of the island  The Turkish Cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus but were recognized only by Turkey  In 1985 the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections  The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island of Cyprus  The House of Representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five year term  56 members by proportional representation and 3 observer members representing the Armenian  Latin and Maronite minorities  24 seats are allocated to the Turkish community but remain vacant since 1964  The political environment is dominated by the communist AKEL  the liberal conservative Democratic Rally  the centrist 72

Cantonment in south southwest Cyprus  Cyprus has four exclaves  all in territory that belongs to the British Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia  The first two are the villages of Ormidhia and Xylotymvou  The third is the Dhekelia Power Station which is divided by a British road into two parts  The northern part is an exclave  like the two villages  whereas the southern part is located by the sea and therefore not an exclave although it has no territorial waters of its own  74  The UN buffer zone runs up against Dhekelia and picks up again from its east side off Ayios Nikolaos and is connected to

complete list  see List of universities and colleges in Cyprus  Faneromeni School is the oldest all girl primary school in Cyprus  Cyprus has a highly developed system of primary and secondary education offering both public and private education  The high quality of instruction can be attributed to a large extent to the above average competence of the teachers citation needed  but also to the fact that nearly 7  of the GDP is spent on education which makes Cyprus one of the top three spenders of education in the EU along with Denmark and Sweden  132  State schools are generally seen as equivalent in quality of education to private sector institutions  However  the value of a state high school diploma is limited by the fact that the grades obtained account for only around 25  of the final grade for each topic  with the remaining 75  assigned by the teacher during the semester  in a minimally transparent way  Cypriot universities  like universities in Greece  ignore high school grades almost entirely for admissions purposes  While a high school diploma is mandatory for university attendance  admissions are decided almost exclusively on the basis of scores at centrally administered university entrance examinations that all university candidates are required to take  The majority of Cypriots receive their higher education at Greek  British  Turkish  other European and North American universities  It is noteworthy that Cyprus currently has the highest percentage of citizens of working age who have higher level education in the EU at 30  which is ahead of Finland

community maintains its own culture  linked to the cultures of Greece and Turkey  and there is little cultural interchange between the two groups  The Greek culture first has been present on the island since antiquity  36  The Turkish culture arrived with the invasion of the Ottoman Empire in 1570  and it was under this rule that the divide between the two communities became prominent and encouraged by government policies  The British did nothing to change this  leaving the island in its divided state with no unified culture  133   edit  Art Aphrodite  Greek goddess of love  beauty and sexuality is said to be born in Cyprus  The art history of Cyprus can be said to stretch back up to 10 000 years  following the discovery of a series of Chalcolithic period carved figures in the villages of Khoirokoitia and Lempa 134  and the island is also the home to numerous examples of high quality religious icon painting from the Middle Ages  Cypriot architecture was heavily influenced by French Gothic and Italian renaissance introduced in the island during the era of Latin domination  1191 1571   In modern times Cypriot art history begins with the painter Vassilis Vryonides  1883 1958  who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice  135  Arguably the two founding fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis  1900 1994  who studied at London s Royal College of Art and Christopheros Savva  1924 1968  who also studied in London  at St Martins School of Art  136  In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day  In particular the majority of Cypriot artists still train in England 137  although art schools in Greece are also popular and local art institutions such as the Cyprus College of Art  University of Nicosia and the Frederick Institute of Technology are becoming more popular  One of the features of Cypriot art is a tendency towards figurative painting although conceptual art is being rigorously promoted by a number of art  institutions  and most notably the Nicosia Municipal Art Centre  16   Municipal art galleries exist in all the main towns and there is a large and lively commercial art scene  Cyprus was due to host the international art festival Manifesta in 2006 but this was cancelled at the last minute following a dispute between the Dutch organizers of Manifesta and the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture over the location of some of the Manifesta events in the Turkish sector of the capital Nicosia  138

abroad is Michael Cacoyannis  The Cypriot cinema was born much later than other countries and in the last decades the first coordinated steps have been taken to create a distinct Cypriot cinematography  The main reason for this delay was the belated entry of Cyprus into international society as an independent state in 1960  and the dramatic events that followed which left the island
