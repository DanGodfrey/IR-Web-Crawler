Imperial General Headquarters  Operation Z in planning  9  and the Battle of Pearl Harbor 10   was a surprise military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor  Hawaii  on the morning of December 7  1941  December 8 in Japan   The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U S  Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom  the Netherlands  and the United States  The base was attacked by 353 11  Japanese fighters  bombers and torpedo planes in two waves  launched from six aircraft carriers  11  All eight U S  Navy battleships were damaged  with four being sunk  Of the eight damaged  six were raised  repaired and returned to service later in the war  The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers  three destroyers  an anti aircraft training ship  nb 2  and one minelayer  188 U S  aircraft were destroyed  2 402 Americans were killed 13  and 1 282 wounded  The power station  shipyard  maintenance  and fuel and torpedo storage facilities  as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building  also home of the intelligence section  were not attacked  Japanese losses were light  29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost  and 65 servicemen killed or wounded  One Japanese sailor was captured  The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters  The following day  December 8   the United States declared war on Japan  Domestic support for isolationism  which had been strong 14   disappeared  Clandestine support of Britain  for example the Neutrality Patrol  was replaced by active alliance  Subsequent operations by the U S  prompted Germany and Italy to declare war on the U S  on December 11  which was reciprocated by the U S  the same day  There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan  However  the lack of any formal warning  particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing  led President Franklin D  Roosevelt to proclaim December 7  1941   a date which will live in infamy   Contents 1 Background to conflict 1 1 Anticipating war 1 2 Objectives 2 Approach and attack 2 1

Pearl Harbor was intended to neutralize the U S  Pacific Fleet  and hence protect Japan s advance into Malaya and the Dutch East Indies  where she sought access to natural resources such as oil and rubber  War between Japan and the United States had been a possibility each nation had been aware of  and developed contingency plans for  since the 1920s  though tensions did not begin to grow seriously until Japan s 1931 invasion of Manchuria  Over the next decade  Japan continued to expand into China  leading to all out war in 1937  Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and achieve sufficient resource independence to attain victory on the mainland  the  Southern Operation  was designed to assist these efforts  15  From December 1937  events such as the Japanese attack on the USS Panay and the Nanking Massacre  more than 200 000 killed in indiscriminate massacres  swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan and increased their fear of Japanese expansion  16  which prompted the United States  the United Kingdom  and France to provide loan assistance for war supply contracts to the Republic of China  In 1940  Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to control supplies reaching China  The United States halted shipments of airplanes  parts  machine tools  and aviation gasoline  which was perceived by Japan as an unfriendly act  nb 3  The U S  did not stop oil exports to Japan at that time in part because prevailing sentiment in Washington was that such an action would be an extreme step  given Japanese dependence on U S  oil  18  19  and likely to be considered a provocation by Japan  Early in 1941  President Franklin D  Roosevelt moved the Pacific Fleet to Hawaii from its previous base in San Diego and ordered a military buildup in the Philippines in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East  Because the Japanese high command was  mistakenly  certain any attack on the British Southeast Asian colonies would bring the U S  into the war  a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to avoid U S  naval interference  20  An invasion of the Philippines was also considered to be necessary by Japanese war planners  The U S  War Plan Orange had envisioned defending the Philippines with a 40 000 man elite force  This was opposed by Douglas MacArthur  who felt that he would need a force ten times that size  and was never implemented  21  By 1941  U S  planners anticipated abandonment of the Philippines at the outbreak of war and orders to that effect were given in late 1941 to Admiral Thomas Hart  commander of the Asiatic Fleet  22  Pearl Harbor on October 30  1941  The U S  ceased oil exports to Japan in July 1941  following Japanese expansion into French Indochina after the fall of France  in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption  23  This in turn caused the Japanese to proceed with plans to take the Dutch East Indies  an oil rich territory  nb 4  The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource rich  European controlled colonies of South East Asia  Preliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the  Southern Resource Area   the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally  had begun very early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto  then commanding Japan s Combined Fleet  25  He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters  including a threat to resign his command  26  Full scale planning was underway by early spring 1941  primarily by Captain Minoru Genda  citation needed  Japanese planning staff studied the 1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto intensively  It was of great use to them when planning their attack on U S  naval forces in Pearl Harbor  nb 5  nb 6  Over the next several months  pilots trained  equipment was adapted  and intelligence collected  Despite these preparations  the attack plan was not approved by Emperor Hirohito until November 5  after the third of four Imperial Conferences called to consider the matter  29  Final authorization was not given by the emperor until December 1  after a majority of Japanese leaders advised him the  Hull Note  would  destroy the fruits of the China incident  endanger Manchukuo and undermine Japanese control of Korea   30  By late 1941  many observers believed that hostilities between the U S  and Japan were imminent  A Gallup poll just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52  of Americans expected war with Japan  27  did not expect war  and 21  had no opinion  31  While U S  Pacific bases and facilities had been placed on alert on multiple occasions  U S  officials doubted Pearl Harbor would be the first target  They expected the Philippines to be attacked first  This presumption was due to the threat that the air bases throughout the country and the naval base at Manila posed to sea lanes  as well as the shipment of supplies to Japan from territory to the south  32  They also incorrectly believed that Japan was not capable of mounting more than one major naval operation at a time  33  Objectives The attack had several major aims  First  it intended to destroy important American fleet units  thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya  Second  it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 Vinson Walsh Act erased any chance of victory  34  35  Finally  it was meant to deliver a severe blow to American morale  one which would discourage Americans from committing to a war extending into the western Pacific Ocean and Dutch East Indies  To maximize the effect on morale  battleships were chosen as the main targets  since they were the prestige ships of any navy at the time  The overall intention was to enable Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference  34  Striking the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor carried two distinct disadvantages  the targeted ships would be in very shallow water  so it would be relatively easy to salvage and possibly repair them  and most of the crews would survive the attack  since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor  A further important disadvantage this of timing  and known to the Japanese was the absence from Pearl Harbor of all three of the U S  Pacific Fleet s aircraft carriers  Enterprise  Lexington  and Saratoga   Ironically  the IJN top command was so imbued with Admiral Mahan s  decisive battle  doctrine especially that of destroying the maximum number of battleships that  despite these concerns  Yamamoto decided to press ahead  Japanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short  victorious war also meant other targets in the harbor  especially the navy yard  oil tank farms  and submarine base  could safely be ignored  since by their thinking the war would be over before the influence of these facilities would be felt  36  Approach and attack See also  Order of battle of the Attack on Pearl Harbor Route followed by the Japanese fleet to Pearl Harbor and back On November 26  1941  a Japanese task force  the Striking Force  of six aircraft carriers  Akagi  Kaga  S ry   Hiry   Sh kaku  and Zuikaku  departed northern Japan en route to a position northwest of Hawaii  intending to launch its aircraft to attack Pearl Harbor  In all  408 aircraft were intended to be used  360 for the two attack waves  48 on defensive combat air patrol  CAP   including nine fighters from the first wave  An Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi A6M2  Zero  fighter on the aircraft carrier Akagi  The first wave was to be the primary attack  while the second wave was to finish whatever tasks remained  The first wave contained the bulk of the weapons to attack capital ships  mainly specially adapted Type 91 aerial torpedoes which were designed with an anti roll mechanism and a rudder extension that let them operate in shallow water  37  The aircrews were ordered to select the highest value targets  battleships and aircraft carriers  or  if these were not present  any other high value ships  cruisers and destroyers   Dive bombers were to attack ground targets  Fighters were ordered to strafe and destroy as many parked aircraft as possible to ensure they did not get into the air to counterattack the bombers  especially in the first wave  When the fighters  fuel got low they were to refuel at the aircraft carriers and return to combat  Fighters were to serve CAP duties where needed  especially over US airfields  Before the attack commenced  two reconnaissance aircraft launched from cruisers were sent to scout over Oahu and report on enemy fleet composition and location  Another four scout planes patrolled the area between the Japanese carrier force  the Kido Butai  and Niihau  in order to prevent the task force from being caught by a surprise counterattack  38  Submarines Fleet submarines I 16  I 18  I 20  I 22  and I 24 each embarked a Type A midget submarine for transport to the waters off Oahu  39  The five I boats left Kure Naval District on November 25  1941  40  coming to 10 Nm  19 km  off the mouth of Pearl Harbor 41  and launched their charges at about 01 00 on December 7  42  At 03 42 43 Hawaiian Time  the minesweeper USS Condor spotted a midget submarine periscope southwest of the Pearl Harbor entrance buoy and alerted the destroyer USS Ward  44  The midget may have entered Pearl Harbor  However  Ward sank another midget submarine at 06 37 44  nb 7  in the first American shots in the Pacific Theater  A midget submarine on the north side of Ford Island missed the seaplane tender Curtiss with her first torpedo and missed the attacking destroyer Monaghan with her other one before being sunk by Monaghan at 08 43  44  A third midget submarine grounded twice  once outside the harbor entrance and again on the east side of Oahu  where it was captured on December 8  46  Ensign Kazuo Sakamaki swam ashore and was captured  becoming the first Japanese prisoner of war  nb 8  A fourth had been damaged by a depth charge attack and was abandoned by its crew before it could fire its torpedoes  47  A United States Naval Institute analysis of photographs from the attack conducted in 1999 indicated a midget submarine may have successfully fired a torpedo into USS West Virginia  Japanese forces received a radio message from a midget submarine at 00 41 December 8 claiming damage to one or more large war vessels inside Pearl Harbor  48  The submarine s final disposition is unknown  49  but she did not return to her  mother  sub  50  On December 7  2009  the Los Angeles Times reported that there is circumstantial evidence that three pieces of a submarine discovered three miles south of Pearl Harbor between 1994 and 2001 could be that of the missing submarine  The publication also reported that there is strong circumstantial evidence that the submarine fired two torpedoes at Battleship Row  The debris was dumped outside the harbor as part of an effort to conceal the West Loch Disaster  a 1944 ammunition explosion that destroyed six tank landing ships preparing for Operation Forager  the invasion of the Marianas  51  Japanese declaration of war See also  Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire The attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan  but this was not Admiral Yamamoto s intention  He originally stipulated that the attack should not commence until thirty minutes after Japan had informed the United States that peace negotiations were at an end  52  53  The Japanese tried to uphold the conventions of war while still achieving surprise  but the attack began before the notice could be delivered  Tokyo transmitted the 5 000 word notification  commonly called the  14 Part Message   in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington  but transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it in time   In fact  U S  code breakers had already deciphered and translated most of the message hours before he was scheduled to deliver it   54  The final part of the  14 Part Message  is sometimes described as a declaration of war  While it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations  it was viewed by a number of senior U S government and military officials as a very strong indicator that negotiations were likely to be terminated  55  and that war might break out at any moment  56  A declaration of war was printed on the front page of Japan s newspapers in the evening edition of December 8  57  but not delivered to the U S  government until the day after the attack  For decades  conventional wisdom held that Japan attacked without any official warning of a break in relations only because of accidents and bumbling that delayed the delivery of a document hinting at war to Washington  In 1999  however  Takeo Iguchi  a professor of law and international relations at International Christian University in Tokyo  discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how  and indeed whether  to notify Washington of Japan s intention to break off negotiations and start a war  including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying   our deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success   Of this  Iguchi said   The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war  or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations      a nd they clearly prevailed   58  First wave composition The Japanese attacked in two waves  The

Point near the island s northern tip  a post not yet operational  having been in training mode for months  detected it and called in a warning  Radar had been in use in a training mode by the U S Army Hawaiian Department for some time  but was not fully operational  62  Although the operators  Privates George Elliot Jr  and Joseph Lockard  63  reported a target  a newly assigned officer at the thinly manned Intercept Center  Lieutenant Kermit A  Tyler  presumed it was the scheduled arrival of six B 17 bombers  The direction from which the aircraft were coming was close  only a few degrees separated the two inbound courses   64  while the operators had never seen a formation as large on radar  65  they neglected to tell Tyler of its size  66  while Tyler  for security reasons  could not tell them the B 17s were due 66   even though it was widely known   66  Several U S  aircraft were shot down as the first wave approached land  and one at least radioed a somewhat incoherent warning  Other warnings from ships off the harbor entrance were still being processed or awaiting confirmation when the attacking planes began bombing and strafing  Nevertheless  it is not clear any warnings would have had much effect even if they had been interpreted correctly and much more promptly  The results the Japanese achieved in the Philippines were essentially the same as at Pearl Harbor  though MacArthur had almost nine hours warning that the Japanese had already attacked at Pearl  The air portion of the attack on Pearl Harbor began at 7 48 a m  Hawaiian Time 67   3 18 a m  December 8 Japanese Standard Time  as kept by ships of the Kido Butai   68  nb 10  with the attack on Kaneohe  A total of 353 11  Japanese planes in two waves reached Oahu  Slow  vulnerable torpedo bombers led the first wave  exploiting the first moments of surprise to attack the most important ships present  the battleships   while dive bombers attacked U S  air bases across Oahu  starting with Hickam Field  the largest  and Wheeler Field  the main U S  Army Air Force fighter base  The 171 planes in the second wave attacked the Air Corps  Bellows Field near Kaneohe on the windward side of the

almost simultaneously from several directions  Ninety minutes after it began  the attack was over  2 386 Americans died  55 were civilians  most killed by unexploded American anti aircraft shells landing in civilian areas   a further 1 139 wounded  Eighteen ships were sunk or run aground  including five battleships  nb 14  5  USS Arizona  BB 39  during the attack Of the American fatalities  nearly half of the total  1 177  were due to the explosion of Arizona s forward magazine after it was hit by a modified 40 cm  16 in   shell  nb 15  Already damaged by a torpedo and on fire amidships  Nevada attempted to exit the harbor  She was targeted by many Japanese bombers as she got under way and sustained more hits from 250 lb  113 kg  bombs  which started further fires  She was deliberately beached to avoid blocking the harbor entrance  California was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes  The crew might have kept her afloat  but were ordered to abandon ship just as they were raising power for the pumps  Burning oil from Arizona and West Virginia drifted down on her  and probably made the situation look worse than it was  The disarmed target ship Utah was holed twice by torpedoes  West Virginia was hit by seven torpedoes  the seventh tearing away her rudder  Oklahoma was hit by four torpedoes  the last two above her belt armor  which caused her to capsize  Maryland was hit by two of the converted 40 cm shells  but neither caused serious damage  Although the Japanese concentrated on battleships  the largest vessels present   they did not ignore other targets  The light cruiser Helena was torpedoed  and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer Oglala  Two destroyers in dry dock  Cassin and Downes were destroyed when bombs penetrated their fuel bunkers  The leaking fuel caught fire  flooding the dry dock in an effort to fight fire made the burning oil rise  and both were burned out  Cassin slipped from her keel blocks and rolled against Downes  The light cruiser Raleigh was holed by a torpedo  The light cruiser Honolulu was damaged but remained in service  The repair vessel Vestal  moored alongside Arizona  was heavily damaged and beached  The seaplane tender Curtiss was also damaged  The destroyer Shaw was badly damaged when two bombs penetrated her forward magazine  72  This message denotes the first US ship  USS

friendly fire returning from the fight  74  Of 33 PBYs in Hawaii  24 were destroyed  and six others damaged beyond repair   The three on patrol returned undamaged   Friendly fire brought down some U S  planes on top of that  including five from an inbound flight from Enterprise  Japanese attacks on barracks killed additional personnel  Fifty five Japanese airmen and nine submariners were killed in the action  and one was captured  Of Japan s 414 60  available planes  29 were lost during the battle 75   nine in the first attack wave  20 in the second   nb 16  with another 74 damaged by antiaircraft fire from the ground  Possible third wave Several Japanese junior officers  including Mitsuo Fuchida and Minoru Genda  the chief architect of the attack  urged Nagumo to carry out a third strike in order to destroy as much of Pearl Harbor s fuel and torpedo nb 17  storage  maintenance  and dry dock facilities as possible  76  and the captains of the other five carriers in the formation reported they were willing and ready to carry out a third strike  77  Military historians have suggested the destruction of these would have hampered the U S  Pacific Fleet far more seriously than loss of its battleships  78  If they had been wiped out   serious  American  operations in the Pacific would have been postponed for more than a year   79  according to American Admiral Chester Nimitz  later Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet   it would have prolonged the war another two years   80  Nagumo  however  decided to withdraw for several reasons  American anti aircraft performance had improved considerably during the second strike  and two thirds of Japan s losses were incurred during the second wave  81  Nagumo felt if he launched a third strike  he would be risking three quarters of the Combined Fleet s strength to wipe out the remaining targets  which included the facilities  while suffering higher aircraft losses  81  The location of the American carriers remained unknown  In addition  the admiral was concerned his force was now within range of American land based bombers  81  Nagumo was uncertain whether the U S  had enough surviving planes remaining on Hawaii to launch an attack against his carriers  82  A third wave would have required substantial preparation and turnaround time  and would have meant returning planes would have had to land at night  At the time  only the  British  Royal Navy had developed night carrier techniques  so this was a substantial risk  83  The task force s fuel situation did not permit him to remain in waters north of Pearl Harbor much longer  since he was at the very limit of logistical support  To do so risked running unacceptably low on fuel  perhaps even having to abandon destroyers en route home  84  He believed the second strike had essentially satisfied the main objective of his mission the neutralization of the Pacific Fleet and did not wish to risk further losses  85  Moreover  it was Japanese Navy practice to prefer the conservation of strength over the total destruction of the enemy  86  At a conference aboard Yamato the following morning  Yamamoto initially supported Nagumo  85  In retrospect  sparing the vital dockyards  maintenance shops  and oil depots meant the U S  could respond relatively quickly to Japanese activities in the Pacific  Yamamoto later regretted Nagumo s decision to withdraw and categorically stated it had been a great mistake not to order a third strike  87  Photographs The first aerial photographs of the attack on Pearl Harbor were taken by Lee

civilian contractors  Pacific Bridge and others  began work on the ships that could be refloated  They patched holes  cleared debris  and pumped water out of ships  Navy divers worked inside the damaged ships  Within six months  five battleships and two cruisers were patched or refloated so they could be sent to shipyards in Pearl Harbor and on the mainland for extensive repair  Intensive salvage operations continued for another year  a total of some 20 000 man hours under water  93 Oklahoma  while successfully raised  was never repaired  and capsized while under tow to the mainland in 1947  Arizona and the target ship Utah were too heavily damaged for salvage  though much of their armament and equipment was removed and put to use aboard other vessels  Today  the two hulks remain

States declaration of war upon Japan  and United Kingdom declaration of war on Japan  1941  USS Pennsylvania  behind the wreckage of the USS Downes and USS Cassin  In the wake of the attack  15 Medals of Honor  51 Navy Crosses  53 Silver Stars  four Navy and Marine Corps Medals  one Distinguished Flying Cross  four Distinguished Service Crosses  one Distinguished Service Medal  and three Bronze Star Medals were awarded to the American servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat at Pearl Harbor  95  Additionally  a special military award  the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal  was later authorized for all military veterans of the attack  The day after the attack  Roosevelt delivered his famous Infamy Speech to a Joint Session of Congress  calling for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan  Congress obliged his request less than an hour later  On December 11 Germany and Italy  honoring their commitments under the Tripartite Pact  declared war on the United States  The Tripartite Pact was an earlier agreement between Germany  Italy and Japan which had the principal objective of limiting U S  intervention in any conflicts involving the three nations  96  The United States Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day  Britain actually declared war on Japan nine hours before the US did  partially due to Japanese attacks on Malaya  Singapore and Hong Kong  and partially due to Winston Churchill s promise to declare war  within the hour  of a Japanese attack on the United States  97  The attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater  Further losses compounded the alarming setback  Japan attacked the Philippines hours later  because of the time difference  it was December 8 in the Philippines   Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor  the Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk off the coast of Malaya  causing British Prime Minister Winston Churchill later to recollect  In all the war I never received a more direct shock  As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me  There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California  Over this vast expanse of waters Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked   98  Throughout the war  Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda  99  One further consequence of the attacks on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath  notably the Niihau Incident  was that Japanese American residents and citizens were relocated to nearby Japanese American internment camps  Within hours of the attack  hundreds of Japanese American leaders were rounded up and brought to high security camps such as Sand Island at the mouth of Honolulu harbor and Kilauea Military Camp on the island of Hawaii  100  101  Later  over 110 000 Japanese Americans  including United States citizens  were removed from their homes and transferred to internment camps in California  Idaho  Utah  Arizona  Wyoming  Colorado  and Arkansas  102  103  Niihau Incident Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi s aircraft shown ten days after it crashed Main article  Niihau Incident The Japanese planners had determined that some means of rescuing fliers whose aircraft were too badly damaged to return to the carriers was required  The island of Niihau  only 30 minutes flying time from Pearl Harbor  was designated as the rescue point  The Zero flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of Hiryu was damaged in the attack on Wheeler  and he flew to the rescue point on Niihau  The aircraft was further damaged on landing  and Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiian inhabitants  The island s residents had no telephones or radio and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor  The pilot s maps and other documents had been retained by his local rescuers  and when Nishikaichi realized this he enlisted the support of two Japanese American residents of the island in an attempt to recover them  During the ensuing struggles  Nishikaichi was killed  the resident committed suicide  and his wife was sent to prison  The ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents apparently went to the assistance of Nishikaichi was a source of concern for many  and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted   104  Strategic implications Admiral Hara Tadaichi summed up the Japanese result by saying   We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war   105  While the attack accomplished its intended objective  it turned out to be largely unnecessary  Unbeknownst to Yamamoto  who conceived the original plan  the U S  Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon  charging  across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war  in keeping with the evolution of Plan Orange   20  The U S  instead adopted  Plan Dog  in 1940  which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia while the U S  concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany  106  Fortunately for the United States  the American aircraft carriers were untouched by the Japanese attack  otherwise the Pacific Fleet s ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or so  given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet   As it was  the elimination of the battleships left the U S  Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines the very weapons with which the U S  Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance  While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service  their relatively slow speed limited their deployment  and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles  A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships  in keeping with the doctrine of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan  As a result  Yamamoto  and his successors  hoarded battleships for a  decisive battle  that never happened  107  Pearl Harbor survivor Bill Johnson stares at the list of names inscribed in the USS Arizona Memorial  Ultimately  targets not on Genda s list  such as the submarine base and the old headquarters building  proved more important than any battleship  It was submarines that immobilized the Imperial Japanese Navy s heavy ships and brought Japan s economy to a virtual standstill by crippling the transportation of oil and raw materials  import of raw materials was down by half what it had been at the end of 1942   to a disastrous ten million tons   while oil import  was almost completely stopped   108  Also  the basement of the Old Administration Building was the home of the cryptanalytic unit which contributed significantly to the Midway ambush and the Submarine Force s success  Present day Today  the USS Arizona Memorial on the island of Oahu honors the lives lost on the day of the attack  Visitors to the memorial reach it via boats from the naval base at Pearl Harbor  Alfred Preis is the architect responsible for the memorial s design  The structure has a sagging center and its ends strong and vigorous  It commemorates  initial defeat and ultimate victory  of all lives lost on December 7  1941  109  Although December 7 is known as Pearl Harbor Day  it is not considered a federal holiday in the United States  The nation does however  continue to pay homage remembering the thousands injured and killed when attacked by the Japanese in 1941  Schools and other establishments across the country respectfully lower the American flag to half staff  110  Media FDR Pearl Harbor

this book provides a detailed overview of the attack  At Dawn We Slept  The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor by Gordon W  Prange is an extremely comprehensive account of the events leading up to the Pearl Harbor attack and is considered by most scholars to be the best single work about the raid  It is a balanced account that gives both the Japanese and American perspectives  Prange spent 37 years researching the book by studying documents about Pearl Harbor and interviewing surviving participants to attempt the most exhaustive account of what happened  the Japanese planning and execution  why US intelligence failed to warn of it  and why a peace agreement was not attained  The book is the first in the so called  Prange Trilogy  of Pearl Harbor books co written with Donald Goldstein and

Through his comprehensive treatment of the life and times of Admiral James O  Richardson  Steely explores four decades of American foreign policy  traditional military practice  U S  intelligence  and the administrative side of the military  exposing the largely untold story of the events leading up to the Japanese attack  Pearl Harbor Papers  Inside the Japanese Plans  released by Goldstein and Dillon in 1993  used materials from Prange s library to further flesh out the Japanese perspective of the attack  including diaries from some officers and ship logs  Alternate history Days of Infamy is a novel by Harry Turtledove in which the Japanese attack on Hawaii is not limited to a strike on Pearl Harbor  but is instead a full scale invasion and eventual occupation after U S  forces are driven off the islands  something one of the key planners of the attack  Commander Minoru Genda wanted but the senior officers realized was impossible   115  The many viewpoint characters  a Turtledove trademark  are drawn from Hawaiian civilians  both white and Japanese  as well as soldiers and sailors from both Japan and the USA  Turtledove has to date written one sequel  The End of the Beginning  The airstrike and Hawaii invasion premise of Days of Infamy was earlier used in the first episode of the anime OVA series Konpeki no Kantai  In the episode  Japan carries out the attack in the early hours of the morning  having perfected night carrier operations  The raid begins with a flare drop by pathfinders  The entire base  including the repair facilities  and a number of supply ships in the harbor are destroyed by daybreak  As for the main body of the Pacific Fleet  the Combined Fleet regroups and annihilates them while they return to Pearl Harbor  The episode  which is divided into three stages in the series  game version  ends with Japanese troops landing at all islands in Hawaii  See also World War II portal Military of the United States portal War portal

Ambassador Horinouchi protested to Secretary Hull on October 8  1940 warning this might be considered an  unfriendly act   17    This was mainly a Japanese Navy preference  the Japanese Army would have chosen to attack the Soviet Union  24     The Dorn report did not state with certainty that Kimmel and Short knew about Taranto  There is  however  no doubt that they did know  as did the Japanese  Lt  Cdr  Takeshi Naito  the assistance naval attach  to Berlin  flew to Taranto to investigate the attack first hand  and Naito subsequently had a lengthy conversation with Cdr  Mitsuo Fuchida about his observations  Fichida led the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941   27     A torpedo bomber needed a long  level flight  and when released  its conventional torpedo would plunge nearly a hundred feet deep before swerving upward to strike a hull  Pearl Harbor deep averages 42 feet  But the Japanese borrowed an idea from the British carrier based torpedo raid on the Italian naval base of Taranto  They fashioned auxiliary wooden tail fins to keep the torpedoes horizontal  so they would dive to only 35 feet  and they added a breakaway  nosecone  of soft wood to cushion the
