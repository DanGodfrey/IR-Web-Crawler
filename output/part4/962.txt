Electrical engineering From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Electrical engineers design complex power systems       and electronic circuits  Electrical engineering is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity  electronics and electromagnetism  The field first became an identifiable occupation in the late nineteenth century after commercialization of the electric telegraph and electrical power supply  It now covers a range of subtopics including power  electronics  control systems  signal processing and telecommunications  Electrical engineering may include electronic engineering  Where a distinction is made  usually outside of the United States  electrical engineering is considered to deal with the problems associated with large scale electrical systems such as power transmission and motor control  whereas electronic engineering deals with the study of small scale electronic systems including computers and integrated circuits  1  Alternatively  electrical engineers are usually concerned with using electricity to transmit energy  while electronic engineers are concerned with using electricity to process information  More recently  the distinction has become blurred by the growth of power electronics  Contents 1 History 1 1 Modern developments 2 Education 3 Practicing engineers

Electricity has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early 17th century  The first electrical engineer was probably William Gilbert who designed the versorium  a device that detected the presence of statically charged objects  He was also the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static electricity and is credited with establishing the term electricity  2  In 1775 Alessandro Volta s scientific experimentations devised the electrophorus  a device that produced a static electric charge  and by 1800 Volta developed the voltaic pile  a forerunner of the electric battery  3  However  it was not until the 19th century that research into the subject started to intensify  Notable developments in this century include the work of Georg Ohm  who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the electric current and potential difference in a conductor  Michael Faraday  the discoverer of electromagnetic induction in 1831  and James Clerk Maxwell  who in 1873 published a unified theory of electricity and magnetism in his treatise Electricity and Magnetism  4  From the 1830s  efforts were made to apply electricity to practical use in telegraphy  By the end of the 19th century the world had been forever changed by the rapid communication made possible by engineering development of land line  underwater and  eventually  wireless telegraphy  Practical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardized units of measure  it led to the international standardization of the units ohm  volt  ampere  coulomb  and watt  This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago 1893  5  The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardisation in various industries  and in many countries the definitions were immediately recognised in relevant legislation  6  Thomas Edison built the world s first large scale electrical supply network  During these years  the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of physics  It was not until the late 19th century that universities started to offer degrees in electrical engineering  The Darmstadt University of Technology founded the first chair and the first faculty of electrical engineering worldwide in 1882  In the same year  under Professor Charles Cross  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology began offering the first option of Electrical Engineering within a physics department  7  In 1883 Darmstadt University of Technology and Cornell University introduced the world s first courses of study in electrical engineering  and in 1885 the University College London founded the first chair of electrical engineering in the United Kingdom  8  The University of Missouri subsequently established the first department of electrical engineering in the United States in 1886  9  Nikola Tesla made long distance electrical transmission networks possible  During this period  the work concerning electrical engineering increased dramatically  In 1882  Edison switched on the world s first large scale electrical supply network that provided 110 volts direct current to fifty nine customers in lower Manhattan  In 1884 Sir Charles Parsons invented the steam turbine which today generates about 80 percent of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources  In 1887  Nikola Tesla filed a number of patents related to a competing form of power distribution known as alternating current  In the following years a bitter rivalry between Tesla and Edison  known as the  War of Currents   took place over the preferred method of distribution  AC eventually replaced DC for generation and power distribution  enormously extending the range and improving the safety and efficiency of power distribution  The efforts of the two did much to further electrical engineering Tesla s work on induction motors and polyphase systems influenced the field for years to come  while Edison s work on telegraphy and his development of the stock ticker proved lucrative for his company  which ultimately became General Electric  However  by the end of the 19th century  other key figures in the progress of electrical engineering were beginning to emerge  10   edit  Modern developments During the development of radio  many scientists and inventors contributed to radio technology and electronics  In his classic UHF experiments of 1888  Heinrich Hertz transmitted  via a spark gap transmitter  and detected radio waves using electrical equipment  In 1895  Nikola Tesla was able to detect signals from the transmissions of his New York lab at West Point  a distance of 80 4 km   49 95 miles   11  In 1897  Karl Ferdinand Braun introduced the cathode ray tube as part of an oscilloscope  a crucial enabling technology for electronic television  12 John Fleming invented the first radio tube  the diode  in 1904  Two years later  Robert von Lieben and Lee De Forest independently developed the amplifier tube  called the triode  13  In 1895  Guglielmo Marconi furthered the art of hertzian wireless methods  Early on  he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles  In December 1901  he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth  Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu  Cornwall  and St  John s  Newfoundland  a distance of 2 100 miles  3 400 km   14  In 1920 Albert Hull developed the magnetron which would eventually lead to the development of the microwave oven in 1946 by Percy Spencer  15  16  In 1934 the British military began to make strides toward radar  which also uses the magnetron  under the direction of Dr Wimperis  culminating in the operation of the first radar station at Bawdsey in August 1936  17  Jack Kilby s original integrated circuit In 1941 Konrad Zuse presented the Z3  the world s first fully functional and programmable computer  18  In 1946 the ENIAC  Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer  of John Presper Eckert and John Mauchly followed  beginning the computing era  The arithmetic performance of these machines allowed engineers to develop completely new technologies and achieve new objectives  including the Apollo missions and the NASA moon landing  19  The invention of the transistor in 1947 by William B  Shockley  John Bardeen and Walter Brattain opened the door for more compact devices and led to the development of the integrated circuit in 1958 by Jack Kilby and independently in 1959 by Robert Noyce  20  Starting in 1968  Ted Hoff and a team at Intel invented the first commercial microprocessor  which presaged the personal computer  The Intel 4004 was a 4 bit processor released in 1971  but in 1973 the Intel 8080  an 8 bit processor  made the first personal computer  the Altair 8800  possible  21   edit  Education Main article  Education and training of electrical and electronics engineers Electrical engineers typically possess an academic degree with a major in electrical engineering  electronics engineering  or electrical and electronic engineering  The same fundamental principles are taught in all programs  though emphasis may vary according to title  The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Engineering  Bachelor of Science  Bachelor of Technology or Bachelor of Applied Science depending upon the university  The degree generally includes units covering physics  mathematics  computer science  project management and specific topics in electrical engineering  Initially such topics cover most  if not all  of the sub disciplines of electrical engineering  Students then choose to specialize in one or more sub disciplines towards the end of the degree  In many institutions electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical award  sometimes explicitly  such as a  Bachelor of Engineering   Electrical and Electronic   in others electrical and electronic engineering are considered sufficiently broad and complex to be considered separately  22  Some electrical engineers choose to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a Master of Engineering Master of Science  M Eng  M Sc    a Master of Engineering Management  a Doctor of Philosophy  Ph D   in Engineering  an Engineering Doctorate  Eng D    or an Engineer s degree  The Master and Engineer s degree may consist of either research  coursework or a mixture of the two  The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to academia  In the United Kingdom and various other European countries  the Master of Engineering is often considered an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering  23   edit  Practicing engineers In most countries  a Bachelor s degree in engineering represents the first step towards professional certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body  After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements  including work experience requirements  before being certified  Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer  in the United States  Canada and South Africa    Chartered Engineer or Incorporated Engineer  in India  Pakistan  the United Kingdom  Ireland and Zimbabwe   Chartered Professional Engineer  in Australia and New Zealand  or European Engineer  in much of the European Union   The advantages of certification vary depending upon location  For example  in the United States and Canada  only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients   24  This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as Quebec s Engineers Act  25  In other countries  no such legislation exists  Practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion  26  In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession  Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work  engineers are subject to contract law  In cases where an engineer s work fails he or she may be subject to the tort of negligence and  in extreme cases  the charge of criminal negligence  An engineer s work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as building codes and legislation pertaining to environmental law  Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  IEEE  and the Institution of Engineering and Technology  IET   The IEEE claims to produce 30  of the world s literature in electrical engineering  has over 360 000 members worldwide and holds over 3 000 conferences annually  27  The IET publishes 21 journals  has a worldwide membership of over 150 000  and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe  28  29  Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers  Membership and participation in technical societies  regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency  MIET Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology  is recognised in Europe as Electrical and computer  technology  engineer  30  In Australia  Canada and the United States electrical engineers make up around 0 25  of the labor force  see note   Outside of Europe and North America  engineering graduates per capita  and hence probably electrical engineering graduates also  are most numerous in Taiwan  Japan  and South Korea  31   edit  Tools and work From the Global Positioning System to electric power generation  electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies  They design  develop  test and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices  For example  they may work on the design of telecommunication systems  the operation of electric power stations  the lighting and wiring of buildings  the design of household appliances or the electrical control of industrial machinery  32  Satellite communications is one of many projects an electrical engineer might work on  Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to obtain both a qualitative and quantitative description of how such systems will work  Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use computer aided design programs when designing electrical systems  Nevertheless  the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others  Although most electrical engineers will understand basic circuit theory  that is the interactions of elements such as resistors  capacitors  diodes  transistors and inductors in a circuit   the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do  For example  quantum mechanics and solid state physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI  the design of integrated circuits   but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems  Even circuit theory may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use off the shelf components  Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs  which emphasize strong numerical skills  computer literacy and the ability to understand the technical language and concepts that relate to electrical engineering  For many engineers  technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do  A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients  preparing budgets and determining project schedules  33  Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason project management skills are important  Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important  The workplaces of electrical engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do  Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a fabrication plant  the offices of a consulting firm or on site at a mine  During their working life  electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including scientists  electricians  computer programmers and other engineers   edit  Sub disciplines Electrical engineering has many sub disciplines  the most popular of which are listed below  Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these sub disciplines  many deal with a combination of them  Sometimes certain fields  such as electronic engineering and computer engineering  are considered separate disciplines in their own right   edit  Power Main article  Power engineering Power pole Power engineering deals with the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity as well as the design of a range of related devices  These include transformers  electric generators  electric motors  high voltage engineering and power electronics  In many regions of the world  governments maintain an electrical network called a power grid that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy  Users purchase electrical energy from the grid  avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own  Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it  Such systems are called on grid power systems and may supply the grid with additional power  draw power from the grid or do both  Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid  called off grid power systems  which in some cases are preferable to on grid systems  The future includes Satellite controlled power systems  with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts   edit  Control Main article  Control engineering Control systems play a critical role in space flight  Control engineering focuses on the modeling of a diverse range of dynamic systems and the design of controllers that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner  To implement such controllers electrical engineers may use electrical circuits  digital signal processors  microcontrollers and PLCs  Programmable Logic Controllers   Control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial airliners to the cruise control present in many modern automobiles  It also plays an important role in industrial automation  Control engineers often utilize feedback when designing control systems  For example  in an automobile with cruise control the vehicle s speed is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the motor s power output accordingly  Where there is regular feedback  control theory can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback   edit  Electronics Main article  Electronic engineering Electronic components Electronic engineering involves the design and testing of electronic circuits that use the properties of components such as resistors  capacitors  inductors  diodes and transistors to achieve a particular functionality  The tuned circuit  which allows the user of a radio to filter out all but a single station  is just one example of such a circuit  Another example  of a pneumatic signal conditioner  is shown in the adjacent photograph  Prior to the second world war  the subject was commonly known as radio engineering and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and radar  commercial radio and early television  Later  in post war years  as consumer devices began to be developed  the field grew to include modern television  audio systems  computers and microprocessors  In the mid to late 1950s  the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name electronic engineering  Before the invention of the integrated circuit in 1959  electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans  These discrete circuits consumed much space and power and were limited in speed  although they are still common in some applications  By contrast  integrated circuits packed a large number often millions of tiny electrical components  mainly transistors  into a small chip around the size of a coin  This allowed for the powerful computers and other electronic devices we see today   edit  Microelectronics Main article  Microelectronics Microprocessor Microelectronics engineering deals with the design and microfabrication of very small electronic circuit components for use in an integrated circuit or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component  The most common microelectronic components are semiconductor transistors  although all main electronic components  resistors  capacitors  inductors  can be created at a microscopic level  Nanoelectronics is the further scaling of devices down to nanometer levels  Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon  at higher frequencies  compound semiconductors like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide  to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current  The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of quantum mechanics   edit  Signal processing Main article  Signal processing A Bayer filter on a CCD requires signal processing to get a red  green  and blue value at each pixel  Signal processing deals with the analysis and manipulation of signals  Signals can be either analog  in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information  or digital  in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information  For analog signals  signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunications  For digital signals  signal processing may involve the compression  error detection and error correction of digitally sampled signals  Signal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of digital signal processing and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications  control  radar  TV Audio Video engineering  power electronics and bio medical engineering as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts  Although in the classical era  analog signal processing only provided a mathematical description of a system to be designed  which is actually implemented by the analog hardware engineers  Digital Signal Processing both provides a mathematical description of the systems to be designed and also actually implements them  either by software programming or by hardware embedding  without much dependency on hardware issues  which exponentiates the importance and success of DSP engineering  The deep and strong relations between signals and the information they carry makes signal processing equivalent of information processing  Which is the reason why the field finds so many diversified applications  DSP processor ICs are found in every type of modern electronic systems and products including  SDTV   HDTV sets  radios and mobile communication devices  Hi Fi audio equipments  Dolby noise reduction algorithms  GSM mobile phones  mp3 multimedia players  camcorders and digital cameras  automobile control systems  noise cancelling headphones  digital spectrum analyzers  intelligent missile guidance  radar  GPS based cruise control systems and all kinds of image processing  video processing  audio processing and speech processing systems   edit  Telecommunications Main article  Telecommunications engineering Satellite dishes are a crucial component in the analysis of satellite information  Telecommunications engineering focuses on the transmission of information across a channel such as a coax cable  optical fiber or free space  Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier wave in order to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission  this is known as modulation  Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation  The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer  Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined  telecommunication engineers design the transmitters and receivers needed for such systems  These two are sometimes combined to form a two way communication device known as a transceiver  A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their power consumption as this is closely related to their signal strength  If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal s information will be corrupted by noise   edit  Instrumentation Main article  Instrumentation engineering Flight instruments provide pilots the tools to control aircraft analytically  Instrumentation engineering deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as pressure  flow and temperature  The design of such instrumentation requires a good understanding of physics that often extends beyond electromagnetic theory  For example  flight instruments measure variables such as wind speed and altitude to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically  Similarly  thermocouples use the Peltier Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two points  Often instrumentation is not used by itself  but instead as the sensors of larger electrical systems  For example  a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace s temperature remains constant  For this reason  instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control engineering   edit  Computers Main article  Computer engineering Supercomputers are used in fields as diverse as computational biology and geographic information systems  Computer engineering deals with the design of computers and computer systems  This may involve the design of new hardware  the design of PDAs and supercomputers or the use of computers to control an industrial plant  Computer engineers may also work on a system s software  However  the design of complex software systems is often the domain of software engineering  which is usually considered a separate discipline  Desktop computers represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on  as computer like architectures are now found in a range of devices including video game consoles and DVD players   edit  Related disciplines Mechatronics is an engineering discipline which deals with the convergence of electrical and mechanical systems  Such combined systems are known as electromechanical systems and have widespread adoption  Examples include automated manufacturing systems  heating  ventilation and air conditioning systems and various subsystems of aircraft and automobiles  The term mechatronics is typically used to refer to macroscopic systems but futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices  Already such small devices  known as Microelectromechanical systems  MEMS   are used in automobiles to tell airbags when to deploy  in digital projectors to create sharper images and in inkjet printers to create nozzles for high definition printing  In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve optical communication  34  Biomedical engineering is another related discipline  concerned with the design of medical equipment  This includes fixed equipment such as ventilators  MRI scanners and electrocardiograph monitors as well as mobile equipment such as cochlear implants  artificial pacemakers and artificial hearts   edit  See also Electronics portal Engineering portal Analog signal processing Computer engineering Electronic design automation Electronic engineering
