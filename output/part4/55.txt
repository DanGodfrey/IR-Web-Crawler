edit  Name The Black Panther s name predates the October 1966 founding of the Black Panther Party  though not the black panther logo of the party s predecessor  the Lowndes County Freedom Organization  nor the segregated World War II Black Panthers Tank Battalion  1  2  He is the first Black modern superhero in mainstream comic books  few black heroes were created before him  none with actual super powers  These included Waku  Prince of the Bantu  who starred in his own feature in the omnibus series Jungle Tales  from Marvel s 1950s predecessor  Atlas Comics and the Dell Comics Western character Lobo  the first Black man to star in his own comic book  Previous non caricatured Black supporting characters in comics include Daily Bugle managing editor Joseph  Robbie  Robertson in The Amazing Spider Man  and U S  Army infantry private Gabriel Jones of Sgt  Fury and his Howling Commandos   edit  Publication history Following his debut in Fantastic Four  52 53  July Aug  1966  and subsequent guest appearance in Fantastic Four Annual  5  1967  and with Captain America in Tales of Suspense  97 99  Jan  March 1968   the Black Panther sojourned from the fictional African nation of Wakanda to New York City  New York to join the titular American superhero team in The Avengers  52  May 1968   appearing in that comic for the next few years  During his time with the Avengers  he made solo guest appearances in three issues of Daredevil  and fought Doctor Doom in Astonishing Tales  6 7  June  amp  Aug  1971   in that supervillain s short lived starring feature  He later returned in a guest appearance capacity in Fantastic Four  119  Feb  1972  during which he briefly tried using the name Black Leopard to avoid connotations invoking the Black militant political party the Black Panthers  3  He received his first starring feature with Jungle Action  5  July 1973   a reprint of the Panther centric story in the superhero team comic The Avengers  62  March 1969   A new series began running the following issue  written by Don McGregor  with art by pencilers Rich Buckler  Gil Kane  and Billy Graham  and which gave inkers Klaus Janson and Bob McLeod some of their first professional exposure  The critically acclaimed 4  series ran in Jungle Action  6 24  Sept  1973   Nov  1976   5  One now common innovation McGregor pioneered was that of the self contained  multi issue story arc  6  The first   Panther s Rage   ran through the first 13 issues  initially as 13  to 15 page stories  Starting with Jungle Action  14  they were expanded to 18  to 19 page stories  there was additionally a 17 page epilogue  Two decades later  writer Christopher Priest s 1998 series The Black Panther utilized Erik Killmonger  Venomm  and other characters introduced in this arc  Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc  Marvel s first graphic novel    T here were real character arcs in Spider Man and the Fantastic Four  comics  over time  But      Panther s Rage  is the first comic that was created from start to finish as a complete novel  Running in two years  issues of Jungle Action   s 6 through 18    Panther s Rage  is a 200 page novel that journeys to the heart of the African nation of Wakanda  a nation ravaged by a revolution against its king  T Challa  the Black Panther  6  The second and final arc   Panther vs  the Klan   ran as mostly 17 page stories in Jungle Action  19 24  Jan  Nov  1976   except for issue  23  a reprint of Daredevil  69  Oct  1970   in which the Black Panther guest starred  5  The subject matter of the Ku Klux Klan was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time  creating difficulties for the creative team  7  The arc ended mid story and Jungle Action folded  with Jack Kirby newly returned to Marvel after having decamped to rival DC Comics for a time immediately writing and drawing the new series Black Panther  which ran 15 issues  Jan  1977   May 1979   8  African American writer editor Dwayne McDuffie said of the Jungle Action  Black Panther  feature  This overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi part superhero epic ever  If you can get your hands on it     sit down and read the whole thing  It s damn near flawless  every issue  every scene  a functional  necessary part of the whole  Okay  now go back and read any individual issue  You ll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures  clearly introduced characters and situations  a concise  sometimes even transparent  recap  beautifully developed character relationships  at least one cool new villain  a stunning action set piece to test our hero s skills and resolve  and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite and satisfying conclusion  That s what we should all be delivering  every single month  Don  McGregor  and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue  4  A four issue miniseries  Black Panther vol  2 9   July Oct  1988   was written by Peter B  Gillis and penciled by Denys Cowan  10  McGregor revisited his Panther saga with Gene Colan in  Panther s Quest   published as 25 eight page installments within the bi weekly anthology series Marvel Comics Presents  issues  13 37  Feb  Dec  1989   11  He later teamed with artist Dwayne Turner in the square bound miniseries Black Panther  Panther s Prey  Sept  1990   March 1991   12  Writer Christopher Priest s and penciller Mark Texeira s 1998 series The Black Panther vol  3 utilized Erik Killmonger  Venomm  and other characters introduced in  Panther s Rage   together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross  the Black Panther s adopted brother  Hunter  and Panther s prot g   Queen Divine Justice  The Priest Texeira series  which was under the Marvel Knights imprint in its first year  earned critical plaudits  citation needed  but sales of the comic were never high  citation needed  Priest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision to write the series   I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to   adding that in his opinion  the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his creation  13  The last 13 issues   50 62  saw the main character replaced by a multiracial New York City police officer named Kasper Cole  with T Challa relegated to a supporting character  This Black Panther  who became the White Tiger  was placed in the series The Crew  running concurrently with the final few Black Panther issues  The Crew was canceled with issue  7  In 2005  Marvel began publishing Black Panther vol  4  14  which ran 41 issues  April 2005   Nov  2008   15  It was initially written by filmmaker Reginald Hudlin  through issue  38  and penciled by John Romita  Jr   through  6   Hudlin said he wanted to add  street cred  to the title  although he noted that the book was not necessarily or primarily geared toward an African American readership  16  As influences for his characterization of the character  Hudlin has cited comic character Batman  film director Spike Lee  and music artist Sean Combs  16  Black Panther vol  5 17  launched in February 2009  with Hudlin  again scripting  introducing a successor Black Panther  T Challa s sister Shuri  18  19  20  Hudlin co wrote issue  7 with Jonathan Maberry  who then became the new writer  21  joined by artist Will Conrad  22  The Panther was also a featured player  with members of the Fantastic Four and the X Men  in the Doctor Doom based  six issue miniseries Doomwar  April Sept  2010   23  T Challa then accepted an invitation from Matt Murdock  the superhero Daredevil  to become the new protector of New York City s Hell s Kitchen neighborhood  He became the lead character in Daredevil beginning with issue  513  Feb  2011   when that series was retitled Black Panther  The Man Without Fear  24  Under writer David Liss and artist Francesco Francavilla  he took on the identity of Mr  Okonkwo  an immigrant from the Democratic Republic of the Congo  and becomes the owner of a small diner in order to be close to the people  25   edit  Fictional character biography This section describes a work or element of fiction in a primarily in universe style  Please help rewrite it to explain the fiction more clearly

is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the advanced African nation of Wakanda  In addition to ruling the country  he is also chief of its various tribes  collectively referred to as the Wakandas   The Panther habit is a symbol of office  head of state  and is used even during diplomatic missions  The Panther is a hereditary title  but one still must earn it  In the distant past  a meteorite made of the  fictional  vibration absorbing mineral vibranium crashed in Wakanda  and was unearthed  Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource  the ruler at the time  King T Chaka  like his father and other Panthers before him  concealed his country from the outside world  T Chaka s first wife  T Challa s birth mother N Yami  died while in labor with T Challa  so T Challa would be raised by his father and his father s second wife Ramonda  at least until T Chaka was murdered by the adventurer Ulysses Klaw  With his people still in danger  a young T Challa used Klaw s sound weapon on him  gravely injuring him and forcing him to flee  Around the same time  his stepmother Ramonda visited her old home in South Africa  While on this trip she was kidnapped and taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius  T Challa would not learn of this until years later   T Challa was next line to be the king of Wakanda and Black Panther  but until he was ready to become the leader of the nation  his uncle S yan  T Chaka s younger brother  successfully passed the trials to become the Black Panther  While on his Wakandan walkabout rite of passage  T Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen Ororo Munroe  who would grow up to become the X Men member Storm  26  The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father s death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda  but they would see each other over the years when they could  T Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes  One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zeraze the Wakandan secret police and its leader  his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf  Later  to keep peace  he picked dora milaje   adored ones   from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives in training  He then studied abroad for a time before returning to his kingship  T Challa next invited the American superhero team the Fantastic Four to Wakanda  then attacked and neutralized them individually in order to prove himself worthy as his people s defender and to test the team to see if it could be an effective ally against Klaw  who had become a supervillain made of living sound  27  28  After the ruler made proper amends to the superhero team  the four befriended and helped T Challa  and he in turn aided the heroes against the supervillain the Psycho Man  29  T Challa later joined the Avengers  30  beginning a long association with that superhero team  He first battled the Man Ape while with the group  31  and then met the American singer Monica Lynne  32  with whom he became romantically involved  He helped the Avengers defeat the second Sons of the Serpent  and then revealed his true identity on American television  33  He encountered Daredevil  and revealed to him that he had deduced Daredevil s secret identity  34   edit  Return to Wakanda The Panther eventually leaves his active Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of civil war  bringing Lynne with him  After defeating would be usurper Erik Killmonger and his minions  35  the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the Ku Klux Klan  36  He later gains possession of the mystical time shifting artifacts known as King Solomon s Frogs  37  These produced an alternate version of T Challa from a future 10 years hence  a merry  telepathic Panther with a terminal brain aneurysm  whom T Challa placed in cryogenic stasis  Later  while searching for and finding his mother  the Panther contends with South African authorities during Apartheid  38  T Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica Lynne  39  though the couple never married  Years later  the Panther accepts a Washington  D C  envoy  Everett K  Ross  and faces multiple threats to Wakanda s sovereignty  Ross assists him in many of these threats  often fighting side by side  or attempting to   In gratitude  the Panther often risks much for Ross in return  The first main threat to Wakandan soveriengty he and Ross encounter is  Xcon  an alliance of rogue intelligence agents backs a coup led by the sorcerer Reverend Achebe  Afterward  Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda s economy  This forces T Challa to nationalize foreign companies  Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat  thus inheriting the role of Black Panther  but falls into a coma upon eating the heart shaped herb poisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline  which had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects  T Challa preserves his rival s life rather than allowing him to die  Later  T Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self  and succumbs to instability and hallucinations  After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare  the Panther hands power to his council and hides in New York City  There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole  who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume   an experience that gives T Challa the strength to face his illness  reclaim his position  and return to active membership in the Avengers  whom he helps secure special United Nations status   edit  Marriage and superhero Civil War Main article  Civil War  comics  The marriage of Storm and the Black Panther  Promotional art

accumulate a replacement  50  He has since made a pact with another unknown Panther deity  returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as placing incantations on his body  making himself highly resistant to most magic and mystic assaults  This has all been done in preparation for the imminent battle with Doctor Doom  51  which culminated in T Challa rendering all of the processed vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild without their dependence on the element  52   edit  The Man Without Fear This section s plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed  Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise   October 2011  After the events of Shadowland  Matt Murdock asked T Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell s Kitchen  giving T Challa a chance to discover himself  53  With the help of Foggy Nelson  T Challa became Mr  Okonkwo  an immigrant from the Congo and manager of the Devil s Kitchen  That was his choice of learning to understand the denizens as an ordinary man  like Murdock did as a lawyer  He learned quickly and got on well with two of the Kitchen s staff   Sofija  a migrant from Serbia who was formerly involved in violent Serbian nationalism  and the busboy Brian  He also got to know some of the neighbors from his apartment block   Mr  Nantakarn and his son Alec  as well as Iris  a social worker assigned to handle cases of child abuse  53  T Challa soon found himself up against an ambitious new crime lord  an ethnic Romanian  Vlad Dinu  who styled himself  the Impaler   He also sought an understanding with the police through Detective Alex Kurtz  Luke Cage and Spider Man kept an eye on T Challa and helped despite the latter s rejection of their assistance  Meanwhile  a serial killer ran loose seemingly to target victims at random  53  Vlad turned out to be a survivor of an earlier Romanian program which sought to produce their own super soldier  Feigning the treatment he received failed  Vlad managed to escape to USA and became a henchman of the Kingpin  He successfully kept a low profile while observing Wilson Fisk in his dealings  and vowed not to make the same mistakes  Vlad had his own powers which allowed him to transmute matter into energy briefly  He also successfully created a facade of a well to do businessman residing in Greenwich Village with his older son Nicolae from his deceased Romanian wife  and Gabe from a beautiful American wife  Angela  53  During an attempt by Vlad to terminate the Panther  as T Challa came to be known in his new disguise  Brian from the Devil s Kitchen was seriously injured after suffering an energy blast from Vlad  and was shortly reported dead  The conflict between Vlad and the Panther became more intense and personal  especially after Vlad arrived home and discovered the Panther over his wife Angela dead from a gunshot wound  53  It was revealed in the end that Iris was the serial shooter who killed abusers of children   Gabe was apparently abused secretly by Angela  Brian was actually still alive and kidnapped by his doctor  Dr  Holman  at the behest of Nicolae who wanted to use someone who received a dose of Vlad s power  After being subjected to torturous experiments  Brian lost the ability to think for himself but was rescued by Gabe who also stole the serum produced from the experiment meant to endow the recipient with Vlad s powers  53  The Panther managed to obtain evidence of Vlad Dinu s crimes as well as clues to Iris as the serial shooter  and turned the evidence over to Kurtz  In the final showdown  Vlad killed his own son Nicolae before being subdued by the Panther  Gabe had injected the serum on himself but was too new to his powers and was arrested for attempting to take Iris  life  Before being taken away  Gabe revealed to the Panther Brian s fate  53  Despite being aware of the Panther s identity as Mr  Okonkwo  both Iris and Sofija promised to keep silent  In the epilogue  Dr  Holman was shown hiring Kraven the Hunter to hunt down Brian to avoid exposure of her culpability  53   edit  Powers and abilities The title  Black Panther  is a rank

hero and a force to be reckoned with regardless of his technology and resources  62   edit  Volume 2 Journalist Joe Gross praised Christopher Priest for his characterization of the Black Panther  stating  that the writer  turned an underused icon into the locus of a complicated high adventure by taking the Black Panther to his logical conclusion  T Challa  the title character  is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced  slightly xenophobic African nation  so he acts like it   Gross applauded the title s  endless wit  sharp characterization  narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels   63  Comics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo  however  criticized the narrative structure   Christopher Priest s fractured writing is getting on my nerves  Like the Spider Man comics  I want to like Black Panther  but Priest s deliberately jumbled approach to writing is simply silly  I know it s a style  but does he have to do it every issue   64  Reporter Bill Radford cited similar concerns when the title had just launched   I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman  but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book  And Ross  narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss  who  in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened  complains   This is like watching  Pulp Fiction  in rewind  My head is exploding    65   edit  Volume 4 Publishers Weekly gave a negative review to the first arc   Who Is The Black Panther    a modern retelling of the character s origin  saying   Hudlin s take is caught between a rock and a hard place  His over the top narrative is not likely to appeal to fans of the most recent version of the character  but it s too mired in obscure Marvel continuity to attract the more general reader  The plot manages to be convoluted without ever becoming absorbing   66  Journalist Shawn Jeffords  citing the lack of appearances of the title character in the first issue  called the new series a  fairly unimpressive launch   Jeffords also said general audience unfamiliarity was a hindrance   He s never been a marquee character and to make him one will be tough   67   edit  Other versions  edit  Amalgam Comics Bronze Panther   Is the ruler of Wakanda and is named B Nchalla  An amalgamation of the Bronze Tiger  DC  and the Black Panther  Marvel
