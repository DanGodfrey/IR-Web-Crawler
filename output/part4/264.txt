Marvel Legends From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article is about the action figure line of Marvel characters  For the video game formerly titled  Marvel Legends   see Marvel  Ultimate Alliance  For the comic book  see Marvel Legends  comics   Marvel Legends 4   6   8   and 12  Action Figure Toy Line Toy Biz  2002 2006 Hasbro  2007 2012 Marvel Legends is an action figure line based on the characters of Marvel Comics  initially produced by Toy Biz  then by Hasbro  This line is in the 6 inch  150 mm  scale  with spin off lines in the 4 inch  100 mm   8 inch  200 mm   and 12 inch  300 mm  scale   edit  History The Marvel Legends line is a spin off of the Spider Man Classics line also produced by Toy Biz  At its inception in 2002  the Marvel Legends line took over the clamshell packaging and the included comic book that had shipped with the Spider Man Classics line  The first Marvel Legends series included representations of the Hulk  Captain America  Iron Man  and Toad  Beginning January 1  2007  Hasbro was the new license holder of the rights to produce toys and games based upon the Marvel Universe  while Toy Biz was renamed Marvel Toys  The new Hasbro packaging did not include a comic  In recent years  production on the Marvel Legends line slowed down to the point that it was rumored it would be cancelled  but Hasbro employees revealed at the 2010 San Diego Comic Con that due to fan requests and upcoming movies based on Marvel characters  the line would be making a comeback in 2012  and in January of 2012  Marvel Legends returned to store shelves  1   edit  Chase figures From the beginning  the Marvel Legends line has used the  chase  concept to introduce figures based on less popular or recognizable characters  These got their nickname by being shipped in fewer quantities than the rest of the figures  thus causing collectors to chase after them  Eventually  rather than entirely new figures  the chase concept was limited to variations  such as an alternate head or a different color scheme  of a figure released in that same series  These figures became high in demand by collectors   edit  Build A Figure In 2005  Toy Biz introduced the  Build A Figure   referred to as a  BAF  in the collector community  to the Marvel Legends line  starting with series 9  Each figure in the series was packaged with a piece of a larger figure   in the initial case  a 16 inch  410 mm  tall figure of Galactus  A consumer who bought each figure in the assortment would then have all the complete components to assemble a character unavailable in individual packaging  The concept was re employed in the tenth Toy Biz series  where each figure was packaged with a piece of a mutant hunting robot known as a Sentinel  Additional BAFs would include Apocalypse  Onslaught  Giant Man  Mojo  MODOK  From Toy Biz   Annihilus  Blob  Brood Queen  Red Hulk  Sandman  Spider Man Trilogy Limited Edition   Ronan the Accuser  Fantastic Four Limited Edition   Fin Fang Foom  Hulk Limited Edition   Ares  and Nemesis  From Hasbro   With the release of the Giant Man BAF  Toy Biz packaged smaller parts with each character  requiring 10 figures to be purchased to create the BAF  including one of the variant figures   Starting with the Onslaught BAF and continuing with the Mojo and MODOK BAFs  Toy Biz returned to the six piece formula  Hasbro continued the six piece formula with the Annihilus BAF in its first series  and temporarily moved to an eight piece formula with the Blob BAF in its second series  but switched back to the six figure format in series 4   edit  6 inch figures  edit  Toy Biz  edit  Series 1  2002  Figure Accessories Description Comic Captain America Captain America vol  1  109 Hulk Bendable

Human Torch was originally distributed with the 4 on his chest  but some collectors asked for the 4 to be removed  since it would be more comic accurate  So as a running change  later shipments had the 4 removed  At the beginning  the figure with the 4 was plentiful  but as time went on  it became more common to see him without it  and eventually it became rare to see him with the 4   edit

exhibit comparable articulation  and are similar in scale  With the exception of Spider Man Classics  which actually pre date Marvel Legends  these lines do not include comic books and do not ship in the same clamshell packaging  The figures in these related lines also usually include some sort of  action feature   sometimes limiting their articulation and ostensibly intended to make the toys more appealing to children  Several popular characters  usually villains  that have not appeared under the Marvel Legends brand have made appearances in these lines  and thus are usually the most desired among collectors  These include most of Spider Man s rogues gallery  as well as some of the Hulk s  Fantastic Four s and X Men s  Fantastic Four Classics  two series  canceled  Hulk Classics  two
