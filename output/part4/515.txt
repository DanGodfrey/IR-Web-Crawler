   sign     code  EUR  is the official currency of the eurozone  17 of the 27 member states of the European Union  It is also the currency used by the Institutions of the European Union  The eurozone consists of Austria  Belgium  Cyprus  Estonia  Finland  France  Germany  Greece  Ireland  Italy  Luxembourg  Malta  the Netherlands  Portugal  Slovakia  Slovenia  and Spain  2  3  The currency is also used in a further five European countries and consequently used daily by some 332 million Europeans  4  Additionally  over 175 million people worldwide   including 150 million people in Africa   use currencies which are pegged to the euro  The euro is the second largest reserve currency as well as the second most traded currency in the world after the United States dollar  5  6  As of February 2012 update   with more than  890 billion in circulation  the euro has the highest combined value of banknotes and coins in circulation in the world  having surpassed the US dollar  note 14  Based on International Monetary Fund estimates of 2008 GDP and purchasing power parity among the various currencies  the eurozone is the second largest economy in the world  7  The name euro was officially adopted on 16 December 1995  8  The euro was introduced to world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999  replacing the former European Currency Unit  ECU  at a ratio of 1 1  Euro coins and banknotes entered circulation on 1 January 2002  9  Since late 2009 the euro has been immersed in the European sovereign debt crisis which has led to the creation of the European

articles  European Central Bank  Maastricht Treaty  and Euro Group The euro is managed and administered by the Frankfurt based European Central Bank  ECB  and the Eurosystem  composed of the central banks of the eurozone countries   As an independent central bank  the ECB has sole authority to set monetary policy  The Eurosystem participates in the printing  minting and distribution of notes and coins in all member states  and the operation of the eurozone payment systems  The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU member states to adopt the euro upon meeting certain monetary and budgetary convergence criteria  although not all states have done so  The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions  10  while Sweden  which joined the EU in 1995  after the Maastricht Treaty was signed  turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum  and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements  All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course   edit  Issuing modalities for banknotes Since 1 January 2002  the national central banks  NCBs  and the ECB have issued euro banknotes on a joint basis  11  Euro banknotes do not show which central bank issued them  Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro banknotes put into circulation by other Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated  The ECB issues 8  of the total value of banknotes issued by the Eurosystem  11  In practice  the ECB s banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs  thereby incurring matching liabilities vis   vis the ECB  These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB  The other 92  of the euro banknotes are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares in the capital key of the ECB  11  calculated using national share of European Union population and national share of European Union GDP  equally weighted  12   edit  Characteristics  edit  Coins and banknotes All euro coins have a common side  and a national side chosen by the issuing bank  Main articles  Euro coins and Euro banknotes The euro is divided into 100 cents  sometimes referred to as euro cents  especially when distinguishing them from other currencies  and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins   In Community legislative acts the plural forms of euro and cent are spelled without the s  notwithstanding normal English usage  13  14  Otherwise  normal English plurals are recommended and used  15  with many local variations such as  centime  in France  All circulating coins have a common side showing the denomination or value  and a map in the background  Due to the linguistic plurality of Europe  the Latin alphabet version of euro is used  as opposed to the less common Greek or Cyrillic  and Arabic numerals  other text is used on national sides in national languages  but other text on the common side is avoided   For the denominations except the 1   2  and 5 cent coins  that map only showed the 15 member states which were members when the euro was introduced  Beginning in 2007 or 2008  depending on the country  the old map is being replaced by a map of Europe also showing countries outside the Union like Norway  The 1   2  and 5 cent coins  however  keep their old design  showing a geographical map of Europe with the 15 member states of 2002 raised somewhat above the rest of the map  All common sides were designed by Luc Luycx  The coins also have a national side showing an image specifically chosen by the country that issued the coin  Euro coins from any member state may be freely used in any nation which has adopted the euro  The common and national sides of the  2 coin The coins are issued in  2   1  50c  20c  10c  5c  2c  and 1c denominations  In order to avoid the use of the two smallest coins  some cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents in the Netherlands  by voluntary agreement  and in Finland  by law   16  This practice is discouraged by the Commission  as is the practice of certain shops to refuse to accept high value euro notes  17  Commemorative coins with  2 face value have been issued with changes to the design of the national side of the coin  These include both commonly issued coins  such as the  2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome  and nationally issued coins  such as the coin to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics issued by Greece  These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone  Collector s coins with various other denominations have been issued as well  but these are not intended for general circulation  and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them  18  The design for the euro banknotes has common designs on both sides  The design was created by the Austrian designer Robert Kalina  19  Notes are issued in  500   200   100   50   20   10   5  Each banknote has its own colour and is dedicated to an artistic period of European architecture  The front of the note features windows or gateways while the back has bridges  While the designs are supposed to be devoid of any identifiable characteristics  the initial designs by Robert Kalina were of specific bridges  including the Rialto and the Pont de Neuilly  and were subsequently rendered more generic  the final designs still bear very close similarities to their specific prototypes  thus they are not truly generic  20   edit  Payments clearing  electronic funds transfer Main article  Single Euro Payments Area Capital within the EU may be transferred in any amount from one country to another  All intra EU transfers in euro are considered as domestic payments and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs  21  This includes all member states of the EU  even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro  22  Credit debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also charged as domestic  however paper based payment orders  like cheques  have not been standardised so these are still domestic based  The ECB has also set up a clearing system  TARGET  for large euro transactions  23        edit  Currency sign The euro sign  logotype and handwritten  Main article  Euro sign A special euro currency sign     was designed after a public survey had narrowed the original ten proposals down to two  The European Commission then chose the design created by the Belgian Alain Billiet  The official story of the design history of the euro sign is disputed by Arthur Eisenmenger  a former chief graphic designer for the EEC  who claims to have created it as a generic symbol of Europe  24  Inspiration for the   symbol itself came from the Greek epsilon     note 15    a reference to the cradle of European civilisation   and the first letter of the word Europe  crossed by two parallel lines to  certify  the stability of the euro   European Commission 13  The European Commission also specified a euro logo with exact proportions and foreground background colour tones  25  While the Commission intended the logo to be a prescribed glyph shape  font designers made it clear that they intended to design their own variants instead  26 Typewriters lacking the euro sign can create it by typing a capital  C   backspacing and overstriking it with the equal       sign  Placement of the currency sign relative to the numeric amount varies from nation to nation  but for texts in English the symbol  and the ISO standard  EUR   should precede the amount  27   edit  Introduction of the euro Main article  History of the euro v t e Preceding national currencies of the Eurozone Currency Code  ISO 4217  Rate 28  Fixed on Yielded Austrian

the 1992 Maastricht Treaty  To participate in the currency  member states are meant to meet strict criteria  such as a budget deficit of less than three per cent of their GDP  a debt ratio of less than sixty per cent of GDP  both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction   low inflation  and interest rates close to the EU average  In the Maastricht Treaty  the United Kingdom and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of monetary union which would result in the introduction of the euro  Economists who helped create or contributed to the euro include Fred Arditti  Neil Dowling  Wim Duisenberg  Robert Mundell  Tommaso Padoa Schioppa and Robert Tollison  citation needed   For macro economic theory  see below   The name  euro  was officially adopted in Madrid on 16 December 1995  8  Belgian Esperantist Germain Pirlot  a former teacher of French and history is credited with naming the new currency by sending a letter to then President of the European Commission  Jacques Santer  suggesting the name  euro  on 4 August 1995  29  Due to differences in national conventions for rounding and significant digits  all conversion between the national currencies had to be carried out using the process of triangulation via the euro  The definitive values of one euro in terms of the exchange rates at which the currency entered the euro are shown at right  The rates were determined by the Council of the European Union  30  based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998  They were set so that one European Currency Unit  ECU  would equal one euro  The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU  based on the currencies of the member states  it was not a currency in its own right  They could not be set earlier  because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non euro currencies  principally the pound sterling  that day  The procedure used to fix the irrevocable conversion rate between the Greek drachma and the euro was different  since the euro by then was already two years old  While the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced  the conversion rate for the Greek drachma was fixed several months beforehand  31  The currency was introduced in non physical form  traveller s cheques  electronic transfers  banking  etc   at midnight on 1 January 1999  when the national currencies of participating countries  the eurozone  ceased to exist independently  Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other  The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit  ECU   The notes and coins for the old currencies  however  continued to be used as legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002  The changeover period during which the former currencies  notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months  until 28 February 2002  The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state  The earliest date was in Germany  where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001  though the exchange period lasted for two months more  Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender  they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from several years to forever  the latter in Austria  Germany  Ireland and Spain   The earliest coins to become non convertible were the Portuguese escudos  which ceased to have monetary value after 31 December 2002  although banknotes remain exchangeable until 2022   edit  Direct and indirect usage Further

euro  see below   In 2009 Zimbabwe abandoned its local currency and used major currencies instead  including the euro and the United States dollar  34   edit  Use as reserve currency Since its introduction  the euro has been the second most widely held international reserve currency after the US dollar  The share of the euro as a reserve currency has increased from 18  in 1999 to 27  in 2008  at the expense of the US dollar  its share fell from 71  to 64  in the same timeframe  and the Yen  it fell from 6 4  to 3 3    The euro inherited and built on the status of the second most important reserve currency from the Deutsche Mark  The euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies  according to the International Monetary Fund 35  the total of euro held as a reserve in the world at the end of 2008 was equal to  1 1 trillion or  850 billion  with a share of 22  of all currency reserves in advanced economies  but a total of 31  of all currency reserves in emerging and developing economies  The possibility of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency is now widely debated among economists  36  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave his opinion in September 2007 that it is  absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency  or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency   37  In contrast to Greenspan s 2007 assessment the euro s increase in the share of the worldwide currency reserve basket has slowed considerably since the year 2007 and since the beginning of the worldwide credit crunch related recession and European sovereign debt crisis  35   edit  Currencies pegged to the euro Worldwide use of

currency to the euro  38  With the exception of Bosnia  which pegged its currency against the Deutsche Mark  and Cape Verde  formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo  all of these non EU countries had a currency peg to the French Franc before pegging their currencies to the euro  Pegging a country s currency to a major currency is regarded as a safety measure  especially for currencies of areas with weak economies  as the euro is seen as a stable currency  prevents runaway inflation and encourages foreign investment due to its stability  Within the EU several currencies have a peg to the euro  in most instances as a precondition to joining the eurozone  The Bulgarian lev was formerly pegged to the Deutsche Mark  other EU member states have a direct peg due to ERM II  the Danish krone  the Lithuanian litas and the Latvian lats  In total  over 150 million people in Africa use a currency pegged to the euro  25 million people outside the eurozone in Europe and another 500 000 people on Pacific islands   edit  Economics  edit  Optimal currency area Further information  Optimum currency area In economics  an optimum currency area  or region   OCA  or OCR  is a geographical region in which it would maximize economic efficiency to have the entire region share a single currency  There are two models  both proposed by Robert Mundell  the stationary expectations model and the international risk sharing model  Mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing model and thus concludes in favour of the euro  39  However  even before the creation of the single currency  there were concerns over diverging economies  Before the Late 2000s recession the chances of a state leaving the euro  or the chances that the whole zone would collapse  were considered extremely slim  40  However the Greek sovereign debt crisis led to former British foreign secretary Jack Straw claiming the Eurozone could not last in its current form  41  Part of the problem seems to be the rules that were created when the Euro was set up  John Lanchester  writing for The New Yorker explains it thusly  The guiding principle of the currency  which opened for business in 1999  were supposed to be a set of rules to limit a country s annual deficit to three per cent of gross domestic product  and the total accumulated debt to sixty per cent of G D P  It was a nice idea  but by 2004 the two biggest economies in the euro zone  Germany and France  had broken the rules for three years in a row  42   edit  Transaction costs and risks Most traded currencies by valueCurrency distribution of

Total 44  200  The most obvious benefit of adopting a single currency is to remove the cost of exchanging currency  theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades  For consumers  banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra member cross border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments  e g   credit cards  debit cards and cash machine withdrawals   The absence of distinct currencies also removes exchange rate risks  The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones  Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost  This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal  particularly the Mediterranean nations  Financial markets on the continent are expected to be far more liquid and flexible than they were in the past  The reduction in cross border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone   edit  Price parity Another effect of the common European currency is that differences in prices   in particular in price levels   should decrease because of the  law of one price   Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage  i e  speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential  Therefore  prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge  causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition  Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets  45   edit  Macroeconomic stability Low levels of inflation are the hallmark of stable and modern economies  Because a high level of inflation acts as a tax  seigniorage  and theoretically discourages investment  it is generally viewed as undesirable  In spite of the downside  many countries have been unable or unwilling to deal with serious inflationary pressures  Some countries have successfully contained them by establishing largely independent central banks  One such bank was the Bundesbank in Germany  as the European Central Bank is modelled on the Bundesbank  46  it is independent of the pressures of national governments and has a mandate to keep inflation low  Member countries that join the euro hope to enjoy the macroeconomic stability associated with low levels of inflation  The ECB  unlike the Federal Reserve in the United States of America  does not have a second objective to sustain growth and employment  Many national and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have lower interest rates than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies  While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond  denominating the bond in a currency with low levels of inflation arguably plays a much larger role  A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future  allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate   edit  Trade The consensus from the studies of the effect of the introduction of the euro is that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5  to 10   47  On the lower bound  one study suggested an increase of 3   48  A recent study estimates this effect to be between 9 and 14   49  Nevertheless  a recent meta analysis of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible  50   edit  Investment Physical investment seems to have increased by 5  in the eurozone due to the introduction  51  Regarding foreign direct investment  a study found that the intra eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20  during the first four years of the EMU  52  Concerning the effect on corporate investment  there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe  The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies  A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22  of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency  53   edit  Inflation The introduction of the euro has led to extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation  In the short term  there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the introduction of the euro had led to an increase in prices  but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies  54  55  A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the introduction of the euro on prices  while it had no effect on most goods  it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the introduction of the euro  The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased  56  It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction  retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction of the euro to do so  57   edit  Exchange rate risk One of the advantages of the adoption of a common currency is the reduction of the risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates  It has been found that the introduction of the euro created  significant reductions in market risk exposures for nonfinancial firms both in and outside of Europe  58  These reductions in market risk  were concentrated in firms domiciled in the eurozone and in non Euro firms with a high fraction of foreign sales or assets in Europe    edit  Financial integration The introduction of the euro seems to have had a strong effect on European financial integration  According to a study on this question  it has  significantly reshaped the European financial system  especially with respect to the securities markets       However  the real and policy barriers to integration in the retail and corporate banking sectors remain significant  even if the wholesale end of banking has been largely integrated   59  Specifically  the euro has significantly decreased the cost of trade in bonds  equity  and banking assets within the eurozone   60  On a global level  there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has led to an integration in terms of investment in bond portfolios  with eurozone countries lending and borrowing more between each other than with other countries  61   edit  Effect on interest rates Long term interest rates of Euro countries  1993 2011 The introduction of the euro has decreased the interest rates of most members countries  in particular those with a weak currency  As a consequence the market value of firms from countries which previously had a weak currency has very significantly increased  62  The countries whose interest rates fell most as a result of the euro are Greece  Ireland  Portugal  Spain  and Italy  63  The effect of such low interest rates made it easier for banks within the countries in which interest rates fell and the countries themselves to borrow significant amounts  above the 3  of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially  and increase their public deficit and levels of privately held consumer debt  64  Following the Late 2000s financial crisis  governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks in order to prevent systemic failure of the banking system  65  This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable  via increasing government bond interest rates  producing the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis   edit  Price convergence The evidence on the convergence of prices in the eurozone with the introduction of the euro is mixed  Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s  66  67  Other studies have found evidence of price convergence  68  69  in particular for cars  70  A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear  slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003  and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study  2009   71   edit  Tourism A study suggests that the introduction of the euro has had a positive effect on the amount of tourist travel within the EMU  with an increase of 6 5   72   edit  European sovereign debt crisis Main article  European sovereign debt crisis Budget deficit of the euro area compared to USA and total OECD  Following the US financial crisis in 2008  fears of a sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among fiscally conservative investors concerning some European states  with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010  73  74  This included eurozone members Greece  75 Ireland and Portugal and also some EU countries outside the area  76 Iceland  the country which experienced the largest crisis in 2008 when its entire international banking system collapsed  has emerged less affected by the sovereign debt crisis as the government was unable to bail the banks out  In the EU  especially in countries where sovereign debts have increased sharply due to bank bailouts  a crisis of confidence has emerged with the widening of bond yield spreads and risk insurance on credit default swaps between these countries and other EU members  most importantly Germany  77  78  To be included in the euro zone  the countries had to fulfil certain convergence criteria  but the meaningfulness of such criteria were diminished by the fact they have not been applied to different countries with the same strictness  79  According to the Economist Intelligence Unit   if the  euro area  is treated as a single entity  its  economic and fiscal  position looks no worse and in some respects  rather better than that of the US or the UK  and the budget deficit for the euro area as a whole is much lower and the euro area s government debt GDP ratio of 86  in 2010 was about the same level as that of the US   Moreover   they write   private sector indebtedness across the euro area as a whole is markedly lower than in the highly leveraged Anglo Saxon economies   The authors conclude that the crisis  is as much political as economic  and the result of the fact that the euro area lacks the support of  institutional paraphernalia  and mutual bonds of solidarity  of a state   80  The crisis continues into the present  most recently with S amp P downgrading 9 euro area countries  including France  then downgrading the entire EFSF fund   edit  Exchange rates Euro US Dollar exchange rate  1999 2011 Euro Japanese Yen exchange rate  1999 2011 Euro Swiss Franc exchange rate  1999 2011 See also  Exchange rate  Floating exchange rate  Exchange rate regime  Foreign exchange market  and Reserve currency  edit  Flexible exchange rates The ECB targets interest rates rather than exchange rates and in general does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets  because of the implications of the Mundell Fleming model which implies a central bank cannot maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously  unless there are capital controls  because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency  In the years following the Single European Act  the EU has liberalised its capital markets  and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy  the exchange rate regime of the euro is flexible  or floating   edit  Against other major currencies The euro is one of the major reserve currencies together with the US dollar  Japanese yen  Pound sterling and Swiss franc  After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate against the other major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000  25 Oct vs the US Dollar  26 Oct vs Japanese Yen  3 May vs Pound Sterling   Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008  15 July vs US Dollar  23 July vs Japanese Yen  29 Dec vs Pound Sterling   With the advent of the current global financial crisis the euro initially fell  only to regain later  Despite pressure due to the European sovereign debt crisis the euro remained stable  81  The euro s exchange rate index   measured against currencies of the bloc s major trading partners   is trading almost two percent higher on the year  approximately at the same level as it was before the crisis
