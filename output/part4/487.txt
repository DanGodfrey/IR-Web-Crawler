by the Gulf of Mexico  16  Covering almost two million square kilometres  over 760 000 sq mi   2  Mexico is the fifth largest country in the Americas by total area and the thirteenth largest independent nation in the world  With an estimated population of over 112 million  9  it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish speaking country  Mexico is a federation comprising thirty one states and a Federal District  the capital city  In Pre Columbian Mesoamerica many cultures matured into advanced civilizations such as the Olmec  the Toltec  the Teotihuacan  the Zapotec  the Maya and the Aztec before the first contact with Europeans  In 1521  Spain conquered and colonized the territory from its base in M xico Tenochtitlan  which was administered as the Viceroyalty of New Spain  This territory would eventually become Mexico as the colony s independence was recognized in 1821  The post independence period was characterized by economic instability  the Mexican American War and territorial cession to the United States  a civil war  two empires and a domestic dictatorship  The latter led to the Mexican Revolution in 1910  which culminated with the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution and the emergence of the country s current political system  Elections held in July 2000 marked the first time that an opposition party won the presidency from the Institutional Revolutionary Party  Mexico has one of the world s largest economies  and is considered both a regional power and middle power  by the Japan s Ministry of Foreign Affairs  17  18  In

Bibliography 15 External links Etymology Main article  Name of Mexico Image of Mexico Tenochtitlan from the Codex Mendoza After New Spain won independence from Spain  it was decided that the new country would be named after its capital  Mexico City  which was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient Aztec capital of M xico Tenochtitlan  The name comes from the Nahuatl language  but its meaning is not well known  M xihco was the Nahuatl term for the heartland of the Aztec Empire  namely  the Valley of Mexico  and its people  the Mexica  and surrounding territories which became the future State of Mexico as a division of New Spain prior to independence  compare Latium   It is generally considered to be a toponym for the valley which became the primary ethnonym for the Aztec Triple Alliance as a result  or vice versa  The suffix  co is the Nahuatl locative  making the word a place name  Beyond that  the etymology is uncertain  It has been suggested that it is derived from Mextli or M xihtli  a secret name for the god of war and patron of the Aztecs  Huitzilopochtli  in which case M xihco means  Place where Huitzilopochtli lives   31  Another hypothesis 32  suggests that M xihco derives from a portmanteau of the Nahuatl words for  moon   m tztli  and navel  x ctli   This meaning   Place at the Center of the Moon   might then refer to Tenochtitlan s position in the middle of Lake Texcoco  The system of interconnected lakes  of which Texcoco formed the center  had the form of a rabbit  which the Mesoamericans pareidolically associated with the moon  Still another hypothesis suggests that it is derived from M ctli  the goddess of maguey  32  The name of the city state was transliterated to Spanish as M xico with the phonetic value of the letter  lt x gt  in Medieval Spanish  which represented the voiceless postalveolar fricative      This sound  as well as the voiced postalveolar fricative      represented by a  lt j gt   evolved into a voiceless velar fricative  x  during the 16th century  This led to the use of the variant M jico in many publications in Spanish  most notably in Spain  whereas in Mexico and most other Spanish speaking countries M xico was the preferred spelling  In recent years the Real Academia Espa ola  which regulates the Spanish language  determined that both variants are acceptable in Spanish but that the normative recommended spelling is M xico  33  The majority of publications in all Spanish speaking countries now adhere to the new norm  even though the alternative variant is still occasionally used  citation needed  In English  the  lt x gt  in Mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound  but the consonant cluster  ks   The official name of the country has changed as the form of government has changed  On two occasions  1821 1823 and 1863 1867   the country was known as Imperio Mexicano  Mexican Empire   All three federal constitutions  1824  1857 and 1917  the current constitution  used the name Estados Unidos Mexicanos 34  or the variants Estados Unidos mexicanos 35  and Estados Unidos Mexicanos  36  all of which have been translated as  United Mexican States   The term Rep blica Mexicana   Mexican Republic  was used in the 1836 Constitutional Laws  37  History Main article  History of Mexico Archaeological sites of Chich n Itz   one of the New Seven Wonders

depicting the god Xipe Totec  Ancient cultures Archaic period The earliest human remains in Mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the Valley of Mexico and radiocarbon dated to c  23 000 years ago  38  Mexico is the site of the domestication of maize and beans which caused a transition from paleo Indian hunter gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 7000 BCE  Classic periods In the subsequent formative areas maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a complex mythological and religious complex  a vigesimal numeric system  were diffused from the Mexican cultures to the rest of the Mesoamerican culture area  39  In this period villages began to become socially stratified and develop into chiefdoms  and the development of large ceremonial centers  40  Among the earliest complex civilizations in Mexico was the Olmec culture which flourish on the gulf coast from around 1500 BCE  Olmec cultural traits diffused through Mexico into other formative era cultures in Chiapas  Oaxaca and the Valley of Mexico  The formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions  as well as artistic and architectural complexes  41  In the subsequent pre classical period  complex centers began to develop among the Maya with centers at Calakmul and the Zapotec at Monte Alb n  During this period the first true Mesoamerican writing systems were developed in the Epi Olmec and the Zapotec cultures  and the Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic Maya Hieroglyphic script  42  In Central Mexico  the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of Teotihuacan which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the Maya area and north  At its peak  Teotihuacan  containing some of the largest pyramidal structures built in the pre Columbian Americas  had a population of more than 150 000 people  43  At the collapse of Teotihuac n around 600 CE  competition between several important political centers in central Mexico such as Xochicalco and Cholula ensued  At this time during the Epi Classic Nahua peoples began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North  and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico  as they displaced speakers of Oto Manguean languages  Post classic period During the early post classic Central Mexico was dominated by the Toltec culture  Oaxaca by the Mixtec and the lowland Maya area had important centers at Chich n Itz  and Mayap n  Towards the end of the post Classic period the Aztecs of Central Mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central Mexico  44  The Aztecs were noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale  45  The distinct Mesoamerican cultural tradition ended with the Spanish conquest in the 16th century  and over the next centuries Mexican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to Spanish colonial rule  46  Conquest The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire began in February 1519 when Hern n Cort s arrived on the coast of Veracruz with ca  500 conquistador  Following a strategy of allying with Indigenous city states that were subject to the Aztec empire and supporting them in a rebellion against the Aztecs  Cort s and his men were able to defeat the Aztecs after two years of campaigning on August 13  1521  New Spain In 1519  Hern n Cort s arrived at the port in Veracruz  and later moved on to the Aztec capital  On his search for gold and other riches  Cort s decided to invade and conquer the Aztec empire  47  The ruler of the Aztec empire upon the arrival of the Spaniards was Moctezuma II  who was later killed  his successor and brother Cuitl huac took control of the Aztec empire  but was among the first to fall from the smallpox epidemic a short time later  48  Unintentionally introduced by Spanish conquerors  smallpox ravaged Mesoamerica in the 1520s  killing more than 3 million Aztecs  49  Other sources  however  mentioned that the death toll of the Aztecs might have reached up to 15 million  out of a population of less than 30 million   50  Severely weakened  the Aztec empire was easily defeated by Hern n Cort s and his forces on his second return  51  Smallpox was a devastatingly selective disease it generally only killed the Aztecs  while the Spaniards were immune to the disease  52  The deaths caused by smallpox are believe to have triggered a rapid growth of Christianity in Mexico and the Americas  At first  the Aztecs believed the epidemic was a punishment from an angry god  but they later accepted their fate and no longer resisted the Spanish rule  53  Many of the surviving Aztecs blamed the cause of smallpox to the superiority of the Christian god  which resulted in the acceptance of Catholicism and yielding to the Spanish rule throughout Mexico  54  The territory became part of the Spanish Empire under the name of New Spain  Mexico City was systematically rebuilt by Cort s following the Fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521  Much of the identity  traditions and architecture of Mexico were created during the colonial period  55  Independence Territorial evolution of Mexico after independence  noting losses to the US in the north  red  white and orange colored   and territories annexed from  blue and red  and lost to  purple  Guatemala  the Yucat n Peninsula also annexed from Guatemala but later disputed by Mayan rebels  On September 16  1810  independence from Spain was declared by priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla  in the small town of Dolores  Guanajuato  56  The first insurgent group was formed by Hidalgo  the Spanish viceregal army captain Ignacio Allende  the militia captain Juan Aldama and  La Corregidora  Josefa Ortiz de Dom nguez  Hidalgo and some of his soldiers were captured and executed by firing squad in Chihuahua  on July 31  1811  Following his death  the leadership was assumed by priest Jos  Mar a Morelos  who occupied key southern cities  In 1813 the Congress of Chilpancingo was convened and  on November 6  signed the  Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America   Morelos was captured and executed on December 22  1815  In subsequent years  the insurgency was near collapse  but in 1820 Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca sent an army under the criollo general Agust n de Iturbide against the troops of Vicente Guerrero  Instead  Iturbide approached Guerrero to join forces  and in 1821 representatives of the Spanish Crown and Iturbide signed the  Treaty of C rdoba  and the  Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire   which recognized the independence of Mexico under the terms of the  Plan of Iguala   Ju rez reforms and territorial losses President Benito Ju rez  resisted the french occupation  dissoluted

himself emperor of the First Mexican Empire  A revolt against him in 1823 established the United Mexican States  In 1824  a Republican Constitution was drafted and Guadalupe Victoria became the first president of the newly born country  The first decades of the post independence period were marked by economic instability  which led to the Pastry War in 1836  and a constant strife between liberales  supporters of a federal form of government  and conservadores  proposals of a hierarchical form of government  citation needed  General Antonio L pez de Santa Anna  a centralist and two time dictator  approved the Siete Leyes in 1836  a radical amendment that institutionalized the centralized form of government  When he suspended the 1824 Constitution  civil war spread across the country  and three new governments declared independence  the Republic of Texas  the Republic of the Rio Grande and the Republic of Yucat n  Texas successfully achieved independence and was annexed by the United States  A border dispute led to the Mexican American War  which began in 1846 and lasted for two years  the War was settled via the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo  which forced Mexico to give up over half of its land to the U S   including Alta California  New Mexico  and the disputed parts of Texas  A much smaller transfer of territory in what is today southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico   the Gadsden Purchase   occurred in 1854  The Caste War of Yucat n  the Mayan uprising that began in 1847  57  was one of the most successful modern Native American revolts  58  Maya rebels  or Cruzob  59  maintained relatively independent enclaves until the 1930s  citation needed  Dissatisfaction with Santa Anna s return to power led to the liberal  Plan of Ayutla   initiating an era known as La Reforma  after which a new Constitution was drafted in 1857 that established a secular state  federalism as the form of government  and several freedoms  As the conservadores refused to recognize it  the Reform War began in 1858  during which both groups had their own governments  The war ended in 1861 with victory by the Liberals  led by Amerindian President Benito Ju rez  In the 1860s Mexico underwent a military occupation by France  which established the Second Mexican Empire under the rule of Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria with support from the Roman Catholic clergy and the conservadores  who later switched sides and joined the liberales  Maximilian surrendered  was tried on June 14 and was executed on June 19  1867  Porfiriato Porfirio D az  a republican general during the French intervention  ruled Mexico from 1876 1880 and then from 1884 1911 in five consecutive reelections  period known as the Porfiriato  characterized by remarkable economic achievements  investments in the arts and sciences  but also of economic inequality and political repression  citation needed  Mexican Revolution Francisco I  Madero with Emiliano Zapata  in Cuernavaca during the Mexican revolution  A likely electoral fraud that led to Diaz s fifth reelection sparked the 1910 Mexican Revolution  initially led by Francisco I  Madero  D az resigned in 1911 and Madero was elected president but overthrown and murdered in a coup d  tat two years later directed by conservative general Victoriano Huerta  That event re ignited the civil war  involving figures such as Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata  who formed their own forces  A third force  the constitutional army led by Venustiano Carranza  managed to bring an end to the war  and radically amended the 1857 Constitution to include many of the social premises and demands of the revolutionaries into what was eventually called the 1917 Constitution  It is estimated that the war killed 900 000 of the 1910 population of 15 million  60  61  Assassinated in 1920  Carranza was succeeded by another revolutionary hero   lvaro Obreg n  who in turn was succeeded by Plutarco El as Calles  Obreg n was

Revolutionary Party  PRI   and started a period known as the Maximato  which ended with the election of L zaro C rdenas  who implemented many economic and social reforms  and most significantly expropriated the oil industry into Pemex on March 18  1938  but sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose citizens had lost businesses by C rdenas  radical measure  Between 1940 and 1980  Mexico experienced a substantial economic growth that some historians call the  Mexican miracle   62  Although the economy continued to flourish  social inequality remained a factor of discontent  Moreover  the PRI rule became increasingly authoritarian and at times oppressive 63   see the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre  64  which claimed the life of around 30 800 protesters   65  Electoral reforms and high oil prices followed the administration of Luis Echeverr a  66  67  mismanagement of these revenues led to inflation and exacerbated the 1982 Crisis  That year  oil prices plunged  interest rates soared  and the government defaulted on its debt  President Miguel de la Madrid resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked inflation  In the 1980s the first cracks emerged in PRI s monopolistic position  In Baja California  Ernesto Ruffo Appel was elected as governor  In 1988  electoral fraud prevented leftist candidate Cuauht moc C rdenas from winning the national presidential elections  giving Carlos Salinas de Gortari the Presidency and leading to massive protests in Mexico City  68  Salinas embarked on a program of neoliberal reforms which fixed the exchange rate  controlled inflation and culminated with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   which came into effect on January 1  1994  The same day  the Zapatista Army of National Liberation  EZLN  started a two week long armed rebellion against the federal government  and has continued as a non violent opposition movement against neoliberalism and globalization  Democratization In December 1994  a month after Salinas was succeeded by Ernesto Zedillo  the Mexican economy collapsed  with a rapid rescue packaged authorized by U S  President Bill Clinton and major macroeconomic reforms started by president Zedillo  the economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost 7  by the end of 1999  69  In 2000  after 71 years  the PRI lost a presidential

during the winter months  South of the twenty fourth parallel  temperatures are fairly constant year round and vary solely as a function of elevation  This gives Mexico one of the world s most diverse weather systems  Areas south of the twenty fourth parallel with elevations up to 1 000 m  3 281 ft   the southern parts of both coastal plains as well as the Yucat n Peninsula   have a yearly median temperature between 24 to 28  C  75 2 to 82 4  F   Temperatures here remain high throughout the year  with only a 5  C  9  F  difference between winter and summer median temperatures  Both Mexican coasts  except for the south coast of the Bay of Campeche and northern Baja  are also vulnerable to serious hurricanes during the summer and fall  Although low lying areas north of the twentieth fourth parallel are hot and humid during the summer  they generally have lower yearly temperature averages  from 20 to 24  C or 68 to 75 2  F  because of more moderate conditions during the winter  Many large cities in Mexico are located in the Valley of Mexico or in adjacent valleys with altitudes generally above 2 000 m  6 562 ft   This gives them a year round temperate climate with yearly temperature averages  from 16 to 18  C or 60 8 to 64 4  F  and cool nighttime temperatures throughout the year  Many parts of Mexico  particularly the north  have a dry climate with sporadic rainfall while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than 2 000 mm  78 7 in  of annual precipitation  For example  many cities in the north like Monterrey  Hermosillo  and Mexicali
