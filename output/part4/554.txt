United States  emergence as one of the largest nations in the world as well as the most technologically powerful nation in the world  The availability of land and labor  the diversity of climate  the ample presence of navigable canals  rivers  and coastal waterways  and the abundance of natural resources facilitating the cheap extraction of energy  fast transport  and the availability of capital all contributed to America s rapid industrialization  Most historians agree citation needed  that the period in which the greatest economic and technological progress occurred was between the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 20th  During this period the nation was transformed from an agricultural economy to the foremost industrial power in the world  with more than a third of the global industrial output  This can be illustrated by the index of total industrial production  which increased from 4 29 in 1790 to 1975 00 in 1913  an increase of 460 times  base year 1850   100   1  American colonies gained independence in 1783 just as profound changes in industrial production and coordination were beginning to shift production from artisans to factories  Growth of the nation s transportation infrastructure with internal improvements and a confluence of technological innovations before the Civil War facilitated an expansion in organization  coordination  and scale of industrial production  Around the turn of the 20th century  American industry had superseded its European counterparts economically and the nation began to assert its military power  Although the Great Depression challenged its technological momentum  America emerged from it and World War II as one of two global superpowers  In the second half of the 20th century  as the United States was drawn into competition with the Soviet Union for political  economic  and military primacy  the government invested heavily in scientific research and technological development which spawned advances in spaceflight  computing  and biotechnology  Science  technology  and industry have not only profoundly shaped America s economic success  but have also contributed to its distinct political institutions  social structure  educational system  and cultural identity  American values of meritocracy  entrepreneurship  and self sufficiency are drawn from its legacy of pioneering technical

peoples in the Plains  North America has been inhabited continuously since approximately 10 000 BC  The earliest inhabitants were nomadic  big game hunter gatherers who crossed the Bering land bridge  These first Native Americans relied upon chipped stone spearheads  rudimentary harpoons  and boats clad in animal hides for hunting in the Arctic  As they dispersed within the continent  they encountered the varied temperate climates in the Pacific northwest  central plains  Appalachian woodlands  and arid southwest where they began to make permanent settlements  The peoples living in the Pacific northwest built wooden houses  used nets and weirs to catch fish  and practiced food preservation  although substantial agriculture was not developed  2  Peoples living on the plains remained largely nomadic  some practiced agriculture for parts of the year  and became adept leather workers as they hunted buffalo while people living in the arid southwest built adobe buildings  fired pottery  domesticated cotton  and wove cloth  Tribes in the eastern woodlands and Mississippian Valley developed extensive trade networks  built pyramid like mounds  and practiced substantial agriculture while the peoples living in the Appalachian Mountains and coastal Atlantic practiced highly sustainable forest agriculture and were expert woodworkers  However  the populations of these peoples were small and their rate of technological change was very low  3  Indigenous peoples did not domesticate animals for drafting or husbandry  develop writing systems  or create bronze or iron based tools like their European Asian counterparts   edit  European exploration and settlement See also  European colonization of the Americas and The First European colonization wave The discovery of the  New World  by Europeans explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries and subsequent Columbian Exchange profoundly changed the direction of technological development in North America  State sponsored explorers like the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in the New World with technology unknown to the native inhabitants caravels  domesticated horses  iron armour and swords   edit  Agriculture Main article  Agricultural history of the United States In the 17th century  Pilgrims  Puritans  and Quakers fleeing religious persecution in Europe brought with them plowshares  guns  and domesticated animals like cows and pigs  These immigrants and other European colonists initially farmed subsistence crops like corn  wheat  rye  and oats as well as rendering potash and maple syrup for trade  4  In the more temperate southern climates  large scale plantations grew labor intensive cash crops like sugarcane  rice  cotton  and tobacco requiring native and imported African slave labor to maintain  Early American farmers were not self sufficient  they relied upon other farmers  specialized craftsman  and merchants to provide tools  process their harvests  and bring them to market  5   edit  Artisanship Colonial artisanship emerged slowly as harsh travel and living conditions in America discouraged skilled craftsman from crossing the Atlantic and bringing their tools with them  However  because of this  American craftsmen were unencumbered by the various long standing allegiances of European craft guilds that sometimes stifled advances in technology out of economic self interest  American artisans developed their own apprenticeship system for educating and employing the young  Despite the fact that mercantilist  export heavy economy impaired the emergence of a robust self sustaining economy  these craftsman and merchants developed a growing interdependence on each other for their trades  6  In the mid 18th century  attempts by the British to subdue or control the colonies by means of taxation sowed increased discontent among these artisan and merchants in urban Boston  New York  and Philadelphia who increasingly advocated independence from British rule   edit  Early industrialization American industrialization was facilitated by a unique confluence of geographical  social  and economic factors  The post Revolution American population remained low relative to its European counterparts and the demand for manual labor created strong incentives to mechanize labor intensive tasks  The eastern seaboard of the United States  with a great number of rivers and streams along the Atlantic seaboard  provided many potential sites for constructing mills and infrastructure necessary for early industrialization  A vast supply of natural resources along with a large labor supply consisting of surplus domestic rural workers and massive immigration from European nations enabled industrialization  The ready supply of labor was an advantage American industrialism had over European  After the close of the American Revolution in 1783  the new government provided strong property rights and a nonrigid class structure  The idea of issuing patents was brought to North America by English  French  and Dutch settlers in the 17th and 18th centuries and adopted into Article I  Section 8 of the United States Constitution authorizing Congress  to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries    edit  Factories and mills In the mid 1780s  Oliver Evans invented an automated flour mill that included a grain elevator and hopper boy  Evans  design eventually displaced the traditional gristmills  By the turn of the century  Evans also developed one of the first high pressure steam engines and began establishing a network of machine workshops to manufacture and repair these popular inventions  In 1789  the widow of Nathanael Greene recruited Eli Whitney to develop a machine to separate the seeds of short fibered cotton from the fibers  The resulting cotton gin could be made with basic carpentry skills but reduced the necessary labor by a factor of 50 and generated huge profits for cotton growers in the South  7  While Whitney did not realize financial success from his invention  he moved on to manufacturing rifles and other armaments under government contract that could be made with  expedition  uniformity  and exactness  the foundational ideas for interchangeable parts  8  However  Whitney s vision of interchangeable parts would not be achieved for over two decades with firearms and even longer for other devices  Between 1800 and 1820  new industrial tools that rapidly increased the quality and efficiency of manufacturing emerged  Simeon North suggested using division of labor to increase the speed with which a complete pistol could be manufactured which led to the development of a milling machine in 1798  In 1819  Thomas Blanchard created a lathe that could reliably cut irregular shapes  like those needed for arms manufacture  By 1822  Captain John H  Hall had developed a system using machine tools  division of labor  and an unskilled workforce to produce a breech loading rifle a process that came to be known as  Armory practice  in the U S  and the American system of manufacturing in England  9  10  Francis Cabot Lowell s Boston Manufacturing Company revolutionized the role of manufactories  The textile industry  which had previously relied upon labor intensive production methods  was also rife with potential for mechanization  In the late 18th century  the English textile industry had adopted the spinning jenny  water frame  and spinning mule which greatly improved the efficiency and quality of textile manufacture  but were closely guarded by the British government which forbade their export or the emigration of those who were familiar with the technology  The 1787 Beverly Cotton Manufactory was the first cotton mill in the United States  but it relied on horse power  Samuel Slater  an apprentice in one of the largest textile factories in England  immigrated to the United States in 1789 upon learning that American states were paying bounties to British expatriates with a knowledge of textile machinery  11  With the help of Moses Brown of Providence  Slater established America s oldest currently existing cotton spinning mill with a fully mechanized water power system at the Slater Mill in Pawtucket  Rhode Island in 1793  Slater went on to build several more cotton and wool mills throughout New England  but when faced with a labor shortage  resorted to building housing  shops  and churches for the workers and their families adjacent to his factories  Slater s Mill was established in the Blackstone Valley  which extended into neighboring Massachusetts   Daniel Day s Woolen Mill  1809   and became one of the earliest industrialized region in the United States  second to the North Shore of Massachusetts  Slater s business model of independent mills and mill villages  the  Rhode Island System   began to be replaced by the 1820s by a more efficient system  the  Waltham System   based upon Francis Cabot Lowell s replications of British power looms  The first power looms for woolens were installed in 1820  at Uxbridge  Massachusetts  by John Capron  of Cumberland  Rhode Island  These added automated weaving under the same roof  a step which Slater s system outsourced to local farms  Lowell looms were managed by specialized employees  employed with unmarried young women   mill girls    and owned by a corporation  12  Unlike the previous forms of labor  apprenticeship  family labor  slavery  and indenture   the Lowell system popularized the concept of wage laborer who sells his labor to an employer under contract a socio economic system which persists in many modern countries and industries   edit  Turnpikes and canals Main article  History of turnpikes and canals in the United States A lock on the Erie Canal  USA canals circa 1825 Highways in the USA circa 1825 Even as the country grew even larger with the admission of Kentucky  Tennessee  and Ohio by 1803  the only means of transportation between these landlocked western states and their coastal neighbors was by foot  pack animal  or ship  Recognizing the success of Roman roads in unifying that empire  political and business leaders in the United States began to construct roads and canals to connect the disparate parts of the nation  13  Early toll roads were constructed and owned by joint stock companies that sold stock to raise construction capital like Pennsylvania s 1795 Lancaster Turnpike Company  In 1808  Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin s Report on the Subject of Public Roads and Canals suggested that the federal government should fund the construction of interstate turnpikes and canals  While many Anti Federalists opposed the federal government assuming such a role  the British blockade in the War of 1812 demonstrated the United States  reliance upon these overland roads for military operations as well as for general commerce  14  Construction on the National Road began in 1815 in Cumberland  Maryland and reached Wheeling  Virginia in 1818  but political strife thereafter ultimately prevented its western advance to the Mississippi River  Nevertheless  the road became a primary overland conduit through Appalachian Mountains and was the gateway for thousands of antebellum westward bound settlers  Numerous canal companies had also been chartered  but of all the canals projected  only three had been completed when the War of 1812 began  the Dismal Swamp Canal in Virginia  the Santee Canal in South Carolina  and the Middlesex Canal in Massachusetts  It remained for New York to usher in a new era in internal communication by authorizing in 1817 the construction of the Erie Canal  This bold bid for Western trade alarmed the merchants of Philadelphia  particularly as the completion of the national road threatened to divert much of their traffic to Baltimore  In 1825  the legislature of Pennsylvania grappled with the problem by projecting a series of canals which were to connect its great seaport with Pittsburgh on the west and with Lake Erie and the upper Susquehanna on the north  15  The Blackstone Canal  1823 1828  in Rhode Island and Massachusetts  and the Morris Canal across northern New Jersey  1824 1924  soon followed  along with the Illinois and Michigan Canal from Chicago to the Illinois River 1824 1848   Like the turnpikes  the early canals were constructed  owned  and operated by private joint stock companies but later gave way to larger projects funded by the states  The Erie Canal  proposed by Governor of New York De Witt Clinton  was the first canal project undertaken as a public good to be financed at the public risk through the issuance of bonds  16  When the project was completed in 1825  the canal linked Lake Erie with the Hudson River through 83 separate locks and over a distance of 363 miles  584 km   The success of the Erie Canal spawned a boom of other canal building around the country  over 3 326 miles  5 353 km  of artificial waterways were constructed between 1816 and 1840  17  Small towns like Syracuse  New York  Buffalo  New York  and Cleveland  Ohio that lay along major canal routes boomed into major industrial and trade centers  while canal building pushed some states like Pennsylvania  Ohio  and Indiana to the brink of bankruptcy  17  The magnitude of the transportation problem was such  however  that neither individual states nor private corporations seemed able to meet the demands of an expanding internal trade  As early as 1807  Albert Gallatin had advocated the construction of a great system of internal waterways to connect East and West  at an estimated cost of  20 000 000   317 454 545 in 2011 consumer dollars   But the only contribution of the national government to internal improvements during the Jeffersonian era was an appropriation in 1806 of two percent of the net proceeds of the sales of public lands in Ohio for the construction of a national road  with the consent of the states through which it should pass  By 1818 the road was open to traffic from Cumberland  Maryland  to Wheeling  West Virginia  18  In 1816  with the experiences of the war before him  no well informed statesman could shut his eyes to the national aspects of the problem  citation needed  Even President Madison invited the attention of Congress to the need of establishing  a comprehensive system of roads and canals   Soon after Congress met  it took under consideration a bill drafted by Calhoun which proposed an appropriation of  1 500 000   20 541 176 in 2011 consumer dollars  for internal improvements  Because this appropriation was to be met by the moneys paid by the National Bank to the government  the bill was commonly referred to as the  Bonus Bill   But on the day before he left office  President Madison vetoed the bill because it was unconstitutional  The policy of internal improvements by federal aid was thus wrecked on the constitutional scruples of the last of the Virginia dynasty  Having less regard for consistency  the House of Representatives recorded its conviction  by close votes  that Congress could appropriate money to construct roads and canals  but had not the power to construct them  As yet the only direct aid of the national government to internal improvements consisted of various appropriations  amounting to about  1 500 000 for the Cumberland Road  19  As the country recovered from financial depression following the Panic of 1819  the question of internal improvements again forged to the front  In 1822  a bill to authorize the collection of tolls on the Cumberland Road had been vetoed by the President  In an elaborate essay  Monroe set forth his views on the constitutional aspects of a policy of internal improvements  Congress might appropriate money  he admitted  but it might not undertake the actual construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them  For the moment  the drift toward a larger participation of the national government in internal improvements was stayed  Two years later  Congress authorized the President to institute surveys for such roads and canals as he believed to be needed for commerce and military defense  No one pleaded more eloquently for a larger conception of the functions of the national government than Henry Clay  He called the attention of his hearers to provisions made for coast surveys and lighthouses on the Atlantic seaboard and deplored the neglect of the interior of the country  Of the other presidential candidates  Jackson voted in the Senate for the general survey bill  and Adams left no doubt in the public mind that he did not reflect the narrow views of his section on this issue  Crawford felt the constitutional scruples which were everywhere being voiced in the South  and followed the old expedient of advocating a constitutional amendment to sanction national internal improvements  20  In President Adams  first message to Congress  he advocated not only the construction of roads and canals but also the establishment of observatories and a national university  President Jefferson had recommended many of these in 1806 for Congress to consider for creation of necessary amendments to the Constitution  Adams seemed oblivious to the limitations of the Constitution  citation needed  In much alarm  Jefferson suggested to Madison the desirability of having Virginia adopt a new set of resolutions  bottomed on those of 1798  and directed against the acts for internal improvements  In March 1826  the general assembly declared that all the principles of the earlier resolutions applied  with full force against the powers assumed by Congress  in passing acts to protect manufacturers and to further internal improvements  That the administration would meet with opposition in Congress was a foregone conclusion  21   edit  Steamboats Fulton s North River Steamboat on the Hudson  Despite the new efficiencies introduced by the turnpikes and canals  travel along these routes was still time consuming and expensive  The idea of integrating a steam boiler and propulsion system can be first attributed to John Fitch and James Rumsey who both filed for patents or state monopolies on steamboats in the late 1780s  However  these first steamboats were complicated  heavy  and expensive  It would be almost 20 years until Robert R  Livingston contracted a civil engineer named Robert Fulton to develop an economical steamboat  Fulton s paddle steamer  The North River Steamboat  erroneously referred to as the Clermont   made its first trip from New York City north on the Hudson River to Albany on August 17  1807  By 1820  steamboat services had been established on all the Atlantic tidal rivers and Chesapeake Bay  The shallow bottomed boats were also ideally suited navigating the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and the number of boats on these rivers increased from 17 boats to 727 boats between 1817 and 1855  22  The speed of the steamboats decreased travel times between coastal ports and upstream cities by weeks and costs for transporting goods along these rivers by as much as 90   23  Steamboats profoundly altered the relationships between the federal government  state governments  and private property owners  Livingston and Fulton had obtained monopoly rights to operate a steamboat service within the state of New York  but Thomas Gibbons  who operated a competing New Jersey ferry service  was enjoined from entering New York waters under the terms of the monopoly  In 1824  the Supreme Court ruled in Gibbons v  Ogden that Congress could regulate commerce and transportation under the Commerce Clause which compelled the state of New York to allow steamboat services from other states  Because the physics and metallurgy of boilers were poorly understood  steamboats were prone to boiler explosions that killed hundreds of people between 1810s and 1840s  24  In 1838  legislation was enacted that mandated boiler inspections by federal agents under the threat of revocation of the operator s navigation licenses and lowered the threshold for liability in suits arising from such accidents  While Americans long resisted any government s power to regulate private property  these new rules demonstrated that many Americans believed that property rights did not override civil rights and set the precedent for future federal safety regulations  25   edit  Mining See also  History

 edit  Technological systems and infrastructure See also  Second Industrial Revolution Progress of America by Domenico Tojetti  The period after the Civil War was marked by increasing intense and pervasive industrialization and successive technological advances like the railroad  telegraph  amp  telephone  and internal combustion engine  This facilitated America s westward expansion and economic development by connecting the frontier with the industrial  financial  and political centers of the East  Americans increasingly relied upon technological infrastructures like the railroad  electric  and telecommunications systems for economic and social activities   edit  Railroads See also  History of rail transport in the United States The DeWitt Clinton was one of the first locomotives in the United States  Between 1820 and 1830  many inventors and entrepreneurs began to apply emerging steamboat technology to engines that could travel on land  The earliest proposal came in 1813 from Oliver Evans  idea of a railway to connect New York and Philadelphia with  carriages drawn by steam engines   26  Many individuals and companies have a claim to being the first railroad in the United States  but by the mid 1830s several companies were using steam powered locomotives to move train cars on rail tracks  Between 1840 and 1860 the total length of railroad trackage increased from 3 326 miles  5 353 km  to 30 600 miles  49 250 km   27  The efficiency of railroad to move large  bulk items contributed enabled further drops in cost of transporting goods to market but in so doing undermined the profitability of the earlier turnpikes and canals which began to fold and fall into disrepair  However  the early railroads were poorly integrated  there were hundreds of competing companies using different gauges for their track requiring cargo to be trans shipped rather than traveling directly between cities  The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 and its attendant profit and efficiency had the effect of stimulating a period of intense consolidation and technological standardization that would last another 50 years  It was during this time that railroad magnates such as Jay Gould and Cornelius Vanderbilt amassed great power and fortunes from consolidation of smaller rail lines into national corporations  By 1920  254 000 miles  408 800 km  of standard gauge railroad track had been laid in the United States  all of it owned or controlled by seven organizations  28  The need to synchronize train schedules and the inefficiencies introduced by every city having its own local time  also led to introduction of Standard time by railway managers in 1883   edit  Iron and steel making See also  History of ferrous metallurgy and History of the steel industry Molten iron being poured from a blast furnace  Because iron occurs in nature commonly as an oxide  it must be smelted to drive off the oxygen to obtain the metallic form  Bloomery

larger scale industry  gunmaking  shipbuilding  wheelmaking   29 Blast furnaces creating cast iron and pig iron emerged on large self sufficient plantations in the mid 17th century to meet these demands  but production was expensive and labor intensive  forges  furnaces  and waterwheels had to be constructed  huge swaths of forest had to be cleared and the wood rendered into charcoal  and iron ore and limestone had to be mined and transported  By the end of the 18th century  the threat of deforestation forced the English to use coke  a fuel derived from coal  to fire their furnaces  This shift precipitated a drop in iron prices since the process no longer required charcoal  the production of which was labor intensive  This was a practice that was later adopted in the US as well  30  Although steel is an alloy of iron and a small amount of carbon  historically steel and iron making were intended for different products given the high costs of steel over wrought iron  The main difficulty with making steel is that its higher melting point than pig or cast iron was not easily achievable in large scale production until methods that introduced air or oxygen to oxidize the carbon in the molten pig iron were developed  allowing the direct conversion of molten pig iron to molten steel  Throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries  the English steelmakers produced blister and crucible steel which required specialized equipment like finery forges and puddling furnaces and cost over  50 per long ton  citation needed  In the 18th century  innovations like steamboats  railroads  and guns increased demand for wrought iron and steel  In the 1850s  American William Kelly and Englishman Henry Bessemer independently discovered that air blown through the molten iron increases its temperature by oxidizing the carbon and separating additional impurities into the slag  The Kelly Bessemer process  because it reduces the amount of coke needed for blasting and increases the quality of the finished iron  revolutionized the mass production of high quality steel and facilitated a drastic drop in steel prices and expansion of its availability  In 1868  Andrew Carnegie saw an opportunity to integrate new coke making methods with the recently developed Kelly Bessemer process to supply steel for railroads  In 1872  he built a steel plant in Braddock  Pennsylvania at the junction of several major railroad lines  Carnegie earned enormous profits by pioneering vertical integration  he owned the iron ore mines in Minnesota  the transport steamboats on the Great Lakes  the coal mines and coke ovens  and the rail lines delivering the coke and ore to his Pennsylvania mills  By 1900  the Carnegie Steel Company was producing more steel than all of Britain and in 1901 Carnegie sold his business to J P  Morgan s U S  Steel earning Carnegie  480 million personally   edit  Telegraph and telephone See also  Invention of the telephone An old telephone  The ability to quickly transmit information over long distances would prove to have an enormous impact on many diverse fields like journalism  banking  and diplomacy  Between 1837 and 1844  Samuel F B  Morse and Alfred Vail developed a transmitter that could send  short  or  long  electric currents which would move an electromagnetic receiver to record the signal as dots and dashes  Morse established the first telegraph line  between Baltimore and Washington D C   in 1844 and by 1849 almost every state east of the Mississippi had telegraph service  31  Between 1850 and 1865  the telegraph business became progressively more consolidated and the 1866 incorporation of Western Union emerged with a near monopoly over 22 000 telegraph offices and 827 000 miles  1 330 900 km  of cable throughout the country  31  The telegraph was used to dispatch news from the fronts of the Mexican American War  coordinate Union troop movements during the Civil War  relay stock and commodity prices and orders between markets on ticker tape  and conduct diplomatic negotiations after the Transatlantic telegraph cable was laid in 1866  Alexander Graham Bell obtained a patent in 1876 to a device that could transmit and reproduce the sound of a voice over electrical cables  Bell realized the enormous potential for his telephone and formed the Bell Telephone Company which would control the whole system from the manufacture the telephones and exchange equipment to leasing the equipment to customers and operators  Between 1877 and 1893  the term of Bell s patent coverage  the number of phones leased by Bell s company increased from 3 000 to 260 000  although these were largely limited to businesses and government offices that could afford the relatively high rates  32  After the Bell patents expired  thousands of independent operators became incorporated and their competition for services to middle and low class households as well as rural farmers drove prices down significantly  By 1920  there were 13 million phones in the United States providing service to 39 percent of all farm households and 34 percent of non farm households  33   edit  Petroleum See also  History of petroleum Drilling and refining petroleum would become major industries  The 1859 discovery of crude oil in western Pennsylvania set off an  oil rush  reminiscent of the 1849 California Gold Rush and would prove to be a valuable resource on the eve of the Civil War  Because crude oil needs to be distilled to extract usable fuel oils  oil refining quickly became a major industry in the area  However  the rural and mountainous terrain of these Pennsylvania oilfields allowed neither economical in situ refining nor efficient railroad transportation of extracted oil  Beginning in 1865  the construction of oil pipelines to connect the oilfields with railroads or oil refineries alleviated this geographical bottleneck but also put thousands of coopers and teamsters  who made the barrels and drove the wagons to transport oil  out of business  34  As the network of oil pipelines expanded  they became more integrated with both the railway and telegraph systems which enabled even greater coordination in production  scheduling  and pricing  John D  Rockefeller was a forceful driver of consolidation in the American oil industry  Beginning in 1865  he bought refineries  railroads  pipelines  and oilfields and ruthlessly eliminated competition to his Standard Oil  By 1879  he controlled 90  of oil refined in the US  34  Standard Oil used pipelines to directly connect the Pennsylvanian oilfields with the refineries in New Jersey  Cleveland  Philadelphia  and Baltimore  rather than loading and unloading railroad tank cars  which enabled huge gains in efficiency and profitability  Given the unprecedented scale of Standard Oil s network  the company developed novel methods for managing  financing  and organizing its businesses  Because laws governing corporations limited their ability to do business across state lines  Standard Oil pioneered the use of a central trust that owned and controlled the constituent companies in each state  34  The use of trusts by other industries to stifle competition and extract monopoly prices led to the 1890 passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act  In the 1911 case of Standard Oil Co  of New Jersey v  United States  the Supreme Court ordered the Standard Oil Trust be disbanded into competing companies that would become Exxon  Standard Oil of New Jersey   Mobil  Standard Oil of New York   and Chevron  Standard Oil of California   The demand for petroleum products increased rapidly after the turn of the century as families relied upon kerosene to heat and light their houses  industries relied upon lubricants for machinery  and the ever more prevalent internal combustion engine demanded gasoline fuel  Between 1880 and 1920  the amount of oil refined annually jumped from 26 000 000 barrels  4 100 000 m3  to 442 million  34  The discovery of large oil fields in Texas  Oklahoma  Louisiana  and California in the early 20th century touched off  oil crazes  and contributed to these states  rapid industrialization  Because these previously agrarian western states lay outside of the various Standard Oil s production and refining networks  cities like Long Beach  California  Dallas  Texas  and Houston  Texas emerged as major centers for refining and managing these new fields under companies like Sunoco  Texaco  and Gulf Oil   edit  Electricity Main article  Electrification See also  History of electromagnetism and War of currents Electrification revolutionized American industry and commerce  Benjamin Franklin pioneered the study of electricity by being the first to describe positive and negative charges  35  as well as advancing the principle of conservation of charge  36  Franklin is best known for the apocryphal feat of flying a kite in thunderstorm to prove that lightning is a form of electricity which  in turn  led to the invention of the lightning rod to protect buildings  Major advances were made by Europeans for the next century  By the early 1880 generators were beginning to power arc lamps in Britain and France  but they generated high temperatures and sparks that prevented widespread adoption  In 1880  Thomas Alva Edison developed and patented a long lasting incandescent lamp based upon the previous work of many inventors  Like Bell  Edison immediately set about commercializing his invention through a shrewd business plan involving companies that would manufacture the whole technological system upon which the  light bulb  would depend   generators  Edison Machine Company   cables  Edison Electric Tube Company   generating plants and electric service  Edison Electric Light Company   sockets  and bulbs  37  As in other industries of the era  these companies achieved greater efficiencies by merging to form a conglomerated General Electric company  Lighting was immensely popular  between 1882 and 1920 the number of generating plants in the US increased from one in downtown Manhattan to nearly 4 000  37  While the earliest generating plants were constructed in the immediate vicinity of consumers  plants generating electricity for long distance transmissions were in place by 1900  To help finance this great expansion  the utility industry exploited a financial innovation known as the  holding company   a favorite holding company investment among many was the Electric Bond and Share Company  later much changed  and known as Ebasco   created by the General Electric company in 1905  The abuse of holding companies  like trusts before it  led to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935  38  but by 1920  electricity had surpassed petroleum based lighting sources that had dominated the previous century  In addition to lighting  electric motors  analogous to generators operating in reverse  or using a current to spin a magnet to perform work  became extremely important to industry  Speed control of early DC motors limited their use  Frank J  Sprague developed the first successful DC motor  ca  1886  by solving the problem of varying speed with load  Within a few years DC motors were used in electric street railways  39  In 1883  a Serbian immigrant  Nikola Tesla  a former employee of Edison s  invented the alternating current  AC  electric motor and licensed the invention to the Westinghouse Corporation  Electric motors quickly replaced steam engines in factories around the nation as they required neither complex mechanical transmissions from a central engine nor water sources for steam boilers in order to operate  40 Frank Sprague  an electrical engineer who also previously worked for Edison  pioneered the use motors to power electric street carriages in 1888  Edison s patents on direct current generation and illumination allowed him to dominate the initial years of electric power distribution  However  DC transmission was hampered by the difficulty in changing voltages between industrial generation and residential commercial consumption as well as low transmission efficiency  In 1887  Tesla introduced system for alternating current generators  transformers  motors  wires and lights that allowed for convenient voltage transformation and greater transmission efficiencies and licensed the inventions to George Westinghouse to commercialize  Despite the apparent technical superiority of Tesla s system  Edison s GE began a campaign to disparage the competing AC system in the war of currents by holding animal executions such as Topsy the elephant using AC current  which led to the invention of the electric chair   publicizing accounts of injuries related to AC power  and lobbying state legislatures  In 1893  the Niagara Falls Commission awarded Tesla Westinghouse  backed by J P  Morgan  Lord Rothschild  and John Jacob Astor IV  their hydroelectric dam contract over opposition from GE  thereby establishing AC generation and transmission on a large scale as well as creating the 60 Hz standard   edit  Automobiles See also  History of the automobile and Interstate Highway System The Model T revolutionized transportation in the 1900s as well as increased production by use of the assembly line  Shown is a test of mounting the body on the chassis  which was actually done inside the factory by using an overhead crane  The technology for creating an automobile emerged in Germany in the 1870 and 1880s  Nicolaus Otto created a four stroke internal combustion engine  Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach modified the Otto engine to run at higher speeds  and Karl Benz pioneered the electric ignition  The Duryea brothers and Hiram Percy Maxim were among the first to construct a  horseless carriage  in the US in the mid 1890s  but these early cars proved to be heavy and expensive  Henry Ford revolutionized the automobile manufacturing process by employing interchangeable parts on assembly lines the beginning of industrial mass production  In 1908  the Ford Motor Company released the Model T which could generate 20 horsepower  was lightweight  and easy to repair  Demand for the car was so great  he had to relocate his assembly plant to Highland Park  Michigan in 1912  The new plant was a model of industrial efficiency for the time  it was well lit and ventilated  employed conveyors to move parts along an assembly line  and workers  stations were orderly arranged along the line  The efficiency of the assembly line allowed Ford to realize great gains in economy and productivity  in 1912  Ford sold 6 000 cars for approximately  900 and by 1916 approximately 577 000 Model T automobiles were sold for  360  41  Ford was able to scale production rapidly because assembly line workers were unskilled laborers performing repetitive tasks  Ford hired European immigrants  African Americans  ex convicts  and the disabled and paid comparatively high wages  but was quick to dismiss anyone involved in labor unions or radical political associations  42  California  like much of the United States  is dependent on the Interstate Highway System  which  with larger junctions like this stack interchange  is quite complicated and expensive  With growth of American automobile usage  urban and rural roads were gradually upgraded for the new traffic  Local automobile clubs formed the American Automobile Association to lobby city  state  and federal governments to widen and pave existing roads and build limited access highways  Some federal road aid was passed in the 1910s and 20s  resulting in highways like U S  Route 1 and U S  Route 66   The coverage and quality of many roads would greatly improve following Depression era Works Progress Administration investment in road infrastructure  43  New Automobile sales were temporarily slowed during World War II when wartime rationing and military production lines limited the number of automobiles that could be manufactured the largest companies like Ford  GM  and Chrysler would survive those lean years  After the war  rising family sizes  increasing affluence  and government subsidized mortgages for veterans fueled a boom in single family homes  44  Many were automobile owners  In 1956  Congress passed the Interstate and National Defense Highway Act which provided funding for the construction of 41 000 miles  66 000 km  of toll free expressways throughout the country laying the legislative and infrastructural foundations for the modern American highway system   edit  Effects of industrialization  edit  Agricultural production Main article  Agricultural history of the United States  Gleaner  Mechanical combine harvester  In the 1840s  as more and more western states joined the Union  many poor and middle class Americans increasingly agitated for free land in these large  undeveloped areas  Early efforts to pass a Homestead Act by George Henry Evans and Horace Greeley were stymied by Southern states who feared that free land would threaten the plantation system  The Homestead Act was passed in 1862 after the opposing Southern states had seceded  The Homestead Act granted 160 acres  65 hectares  to farmers who lived on the land for 5 years or allowed the farmer to purchase the land after 6 months for  1 25 per acre   3 ha   Even as America s westward expansion allowed over 400 million acres  1 600 000 km   of new land to be put under cultivation  between 1870 and 1910 the number of Americans involved in farming or farm labor dropped by a third  45  New farming techniques and agricultural mechanization facilitated both processes  Cyrus McCormick s reaper  invented in 1834  allowed farmers to quadruple their harvesting efficiency by replacing hand labor with a mechanical device  John Deere invented the steel plow in 1837  keeping the soil from sticking to the plow and making it easier to farm in the rich prairies of the Midwest  The harvester  self binder  and combine allowed even greater efficiencies  wheat farmers in 1866 achieved an average yield of 9 9 bushels per acre but by 1898 yields had increased to 15 3 bushels per acre even as the total area had tripled  46  Railroads allowed harvests to reach markets more quickly and Gustavus Swift s refrigerated railroad car allowed fresh meat and fish to reach distant markets  Food distribution also became more mechanized as companies like Heinz and Campbell distributed previously perishable foods by canning and evaporation  Commercial bakeries  breweries  and meatpackers replaced locally owned operators and drove demand for raw agricultural goods  Despite increasing demand  rising production caused a drop in prices  creating substantial discontent among farmers  Organizations like The Grange and Farmers Alliance emerged to demand conservative monetary policy  railroad regulations  and protective tariffs   edit  Urbanization The period between 1865 and 1920 was marked by the increasing concentration of people  political power  and economic activity in urban areas  In 1860  there were nine cities with populations over 100 000 and by 1910 there were fifty  45  These new large cities were not coastal port cities  like New York  Boston  and Philadelphia  but laid inland along new transportation routes  like Denver  Chicago  and Cleveland   The first twelve presidents of the United States had all been born into farming communities  but between 1865 and 1912 the Presidency was filled by men with backgrounds of representing businesses and cities  Industrialization and urbanization reinforced each other and urban areas became increasingly congested  As a result of unsanitary living conditions  diseases like cholera  dysentery  and typhoid fever struck urban areas with increasing frequency  Cities responded by paving streets  digging sewers  sanitizing water  constructing housing  and creating public transportation systems   edit  Labor issues and immigration See also  Labor unions in the United States and Immigration to the United States As the nation deepened its technological base  old fashioned artisan and craftsman became  deskilled  and replaced by specialized workers and engineers who used machines to replicate in minutes or hours work that would require a journeyman hours or days to complete  Frederick W  Taylor  recognizing the inefficiencies introduced by some production lines  proposed that by studying the motions and processes necessary to manufacture each component of a product  reorganizing the factory and manufacturing processes around workers  and paying workers piece rates would allow great gains in process efficiency  Scientific management  or  Taylorism  as it came to be known  was soon being applied by progressive city governments to make their urban areas more efficient and by suffragettes to home economics  47  Increasing industrialization outpaced the supply of laborers able or willing to work in dangerous  low paying  and dead end jobs  However  the demand for low or unskilled jobs drove wages up and attracted waves of Irish  Italian  Polish  Russian  and Jewish immigrants who could earn more in America than in their homelands  The earliest unions emerged before the Civil War as trade guilds composed of journeyman carpenters  masons  and other artisans who would engage in strikes to demand better hours and pay from their masters  All branches of government generally sought to stop labor from organizing into unions or from organizing strikes   edit  Banking  trading

laissez faire  High tariffs sheltered U S  factories and workers from foreign competition  federal railroad subsidies enriched investors  farmers and railroad workers  and created hundreds of towns and cities  Powerful  robber baron  industrialists such as J P  Morgan  Andrew Carnegie  John D  Rockefeller and Jay Gould held great wealth and power during this period  The Progressive movement and the Progressive Era that emerged from it was in part a reaction to excesses of the new industrial age   Muckraking  journalists reported on a wide array of social issues  and the reaction of the public lent urgency to reforms that led to increased government regulation  such as the Meat Inspection Act and Pure Food and Drug Act  1906   Antitrust legislation sought to break up monopolies and increase competition   edit  Great Depression See also  Great Depression in the United States The Hoover Dam was completed at the height of the Depression  edit  Military industrial academic complex See also  Military industrial complex In the 20th century  the pace of technological developments increasingly became tied into a complex set of interactions between Congress  the industrial manufacturers  university research  and the military establishment  This set of relations  known more popularly as the  military industrial complex   emerged because the military s unique technological demands  concentration of funding  large scale application  and highly centralized control played a dominant role in driving technological innovation  Fundamental advances in medicine  physics  chemistry  computing  aviation  material science  naval architecture  and meteorology  among other fields  can be traced back to basic and applied research for military applications  Smokestack America became a nickname applied to traditional manufacturing core of U S  industry  used to represent particular industries  48  regions  or towns  49  50  51  52  53  54  55   edit  Research universities See also  Land grant university and Education in the United States Land grant universities expanded access to post secondary education for many Americans  The first universities in the United States were modeled on the liberal curricula of the great English universities and were meant to educate clergymen and lawyers rather than teach vocational skills or conduct scientific research  The U S  Military Academy  established in 1811  broke the mold of traditional universities and military academies alike by including practical engineering related subjects in its earliest curricula  By the middle of the 19th century  polytechnic institutes were being founded in increasing numbers to train students in the scientific and technical skills needed to design  build  and operate increasingly complex machines  In 1824  Stephen van Rensselaer established the first American institute granting a bachelor s degree in technical subjects and in the 1850s several Ivy League schools began to offer courses of study in scientific fields  Congressional legislators  recognizing the increasing importance and prevalence of these eastern polytechnic schools  passed the 1862 Morrill Land Grant Colleges Act providing large grants of land 56  that were to be used toward establishing and funding the educational institutions that would teach courses on military tactics  engineering  and agriculture  Many of the United States  noted public research universities can trace their origins back to land grant colleges  Between 1900 and 1939  enrollments in post secondary institutes increased from 238 000 to 1 494 000 57  and higher education had become so available and affordable that a college degree was increasingly required for scientific  engineering  and government jobs that previously only required only vocational or secondary education  58  After World War II  the GI Bill caused university enrollments to explode as millions of veterans earned college degrees   edit  World wars Main articles  Technology during World War I and Technology during World War II Strategic aerial bombing caused massive damage to cities  Great White fleet  Spanish

radical changes in the history of warfare  citation needed  The history of flight spans hundreds of years and the distinction of building the first flying machine is complicated  but in December 1903 the Wright Brothers achieved sustained  manned  and controlled heavier than air flight  The Wright brothers had difficulty raising funding from the government and military  but after World War I began in 1914  airplanes quickly assumed great tactical importance for both sides  see Aviation in World War I   the US government appropriated  640 million in 1917 to procure 20 000 airplanes for the war for aerial reconnaissance  dogfighting  and aerial bombing  59  After the close of the war in 1918  the US government continued to fund peacetime aeronautical activities like airmail and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  Throughout the 1920s and 1930s  industrial  university  and military research continued to realize gains in the power  maneuverability  and reliability of airplanes  Charles Lindbergh completed a solo non stop transatlantic flight in 1927  Wiley Post flew around the world in nine days in 1931  and Howard Hughes shattered flight airspeed records throughout the decade  In the 1930s  passenger airlines boomed as a result of the Kelley Act  state and local governments began constructing airports to attract airlines  and the federal government began to regulate air traffic control and investigate aviation accidents and incidents   edit  Cold War and Space Race See also  Space Race and History of nuclear weapons Nuclear test Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the

in Worcester  Massachusetts  Goddard worked with liquid oxygen and gasoline to propel rockets into the atmosphere  and in 1926 successfully fired the world s first liquid fuel rocket which reached a height of 12 5 meters  Over the next 10 years  Goddard s rockets achieved modest altitudes of nearly two kilometers  and interest in rocketry increased in the United States  Britain  Germany  and the Soviet Union  At the close of World War II  both the American and Russian forces recruited or smuggled top German scientists like Wernher von Braun back to their respective countries to continue defense related work  Expendable rockets provided the means for launching artificial satellites  as well as manned spacecraft  In 1957 the Soviet Union launched the first satellite  Sputnik I  and the United States followed with Explorer I in 1958  The first manned space flights were made in early 1961  first by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin and then by American astronaut Alan Shepard  From those first tentative steps  to the 1969 Apollo program landing on the Moon  to today s reusable Space Shuttle  the American space program has brought forth a breathtaking display of applied science

research in the U S  60  Funding by private industry increased 102  from 1994 to 2003  61  The National Institutes of Health consists of 24 separate institutes supporting the prevention  detection  diagnosis  and treatment of diseases and disabilities  At any given time  grants from the NIH support the research of about 35 000 principal investigators  working in every US state and several foreign countries  Between 1971 and 1991  mortality from heart disease dropped 41 percent  strokes decreased by 59 percent  And today more than 70 percent of children who get cancer are cured  Molecular genetics and genomics research have revolutionized biomedical science  In the 1980s and 1990s  researchers performed the first trial of gene therapy in humans and are now able to locate  identify  and describe the function of many genes in the human genome  Research conducted by universities  hospitals  and corporations also contributes to improvement in diagnosis and treatment of disease  NIH funded the basic research on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome  AIDS   for example  Many of the drugs used to treat the disease have emerged from the laboratories of the American
