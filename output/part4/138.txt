Republic of Indonesia  Indonesian  Republik Indonesia   is a country in Southeast Asia and Oceania  Indonesia is an archipelago comprising approximately 17 508 islands  5  It has 33 provinces with over 238 million people  and is the world s fourth most populous country  Indonesia is a republic  with an elected legislature and president  The nation s capital city is Jakarta  The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea  East Timor  and Malaysia  Other neighboring countries include Singapore  Philippines  Australia  and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands  Indonesia is a founding member of ASEAN and a member of the G 20 major economies  The Indonesian economy is the world s seventeenth largest economy by nominal GDP and fifteenth largest by purchasing power parity  The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the 7th century  when Srivijaya and then later Majapahit traded with China and India  Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural  religious and political models from the early centuries CE  and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished  Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources  Muslim traders brought Islam  and European powers brought Christianity and fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery  Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism  Indonesia secured its independence after World War II  Indonesia s history has since been turbulent  with challenges posed by natural disasters  corruption  separatism  a democratization process  and periods of rapid economic change  Across its many islands  Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic  linguistic  and religious groups  The Javanese are the largest and the politically dominant ethnic group  Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language  ethnic diversity  religious pluralism within a majority Muslim population  and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it  Indonesia s national motto   Bhinneka Tunggal Ika    Unity in Diversity  literally   many  yet one    articulates the diversity that shapes the country  Despite its large population and densely populated regions  Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world s second highest level of biodiversity  The country is richly endowed with natural resources  yet poverty remains widespread  6  7  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 3 Government and politics 4 Foreign relations and military 5 Administrative

Greek Indus  and the Greek n sos  meaning  island   8  The name dates to the 18th century  far predating the formation of independent Indonesia  9  In 1850  George Windsor Earl  an English ethnologist  proposed the terms Indunesians   and  his preference  Malayunesians   for the inhabitants of the  Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago   10  In the same publication  a student of Earl s  James Richardson Logan  used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago  11  12  However  Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia  Instead  they used the terms Malay Archipelago  Maleische Archipel   the Netherlands East Indies  Nederlandsch Oost Indi    popularly Indi   the East  de Oost   and Insulinde  13  From  1900  the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands  and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression  13 Adolf Bastian  of the University of Berlin  popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels  1884 1894  The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat  Ki Hajar Dewantara   when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers bureau in 1913  9   edit  History Main article  History of Indonesia A Borobudur ship carved on Borobudur  c  800 CE  Indonesian outrigger boats may have made trade voyages to the east coast of Africa as early as the 1st century CE  14  Ancient fossils and the remains of primitive tools show that the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited by Homo erectus  popularly known as the  Java Man   between 1 5 million years 15  ago and 550 000 to 143 000 16  years ago  17  18  19  In 2003  on the island of Flores  fossils of a new small hominid dated between 74 000 and 13 000 years old and named  Flores Man   Homo floresiensis  were discovered much to the surprise of the scientific community  20  21  This 3 foot tall hominid is thought to be a species descended from Homo Erectus and reduced in size over thousands of years by a well known process called island dwarfism  Flores Man seems to have shared the island with modern Homo sapiens until only 12 000 years ago  when they became extinct  Homo sapiens reached the region by around 45 000 years ago  22  In 2011 evidence was uncovered in neighbouring East Timor  showing that 42 000 years ago these early settlers had high level maritime skills  and by implication the technology needed to make ocean crossings to reach Australia and other islands  as they were catching and consuming large numbers of big deep sea fish such as tuna  23  Austronesian peoples  who form the majority of the modern population  migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan  They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE  and as they spread through the archipelago  confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions  24  Ideal agricultural conditions  and the mastering of wet field rice cultivation as early as the 8th century BCE  25  allowed villages  towns  and small kingdoms to flourish by the 1st century CE  Indonesia s strategic sea lane position fostered inter island and international trade  including links with Indian kingdoms and China  which were established several centuries BCE  26  Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history  27  28  The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia s Banda Islands  Once one of the world s most valuable commodities  it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia  From the 7th century  the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it  29  30  Between the 8th and 10th centuries  the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java  leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra s Borobudur and Mataram s Prambanan  The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century  and under Gajah Mada  its influence stretched over much of Indonesia  31  Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era  the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra  32  Other Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam  and it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century  For the most part  Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences  which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia  particularly in Java  33 The first regular contact between Europeans and the peoples of Indonesia began in 1512  when Portuguese traders  led by Francisco Serr o  sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg  cloves  and cubeb pepper in Maluku  34  Dutch and British traders followed  In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company  VOC  and became the dominant European power  Following bankruptcy  the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800  and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony  35  For most of the colonial period  Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous outside of coastal strongholds  only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia s current boundaries  36  Despite major internal political  social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution  Indonesians  on the whole  found unity in their fight for independence  Japanese occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule  37  38  and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement  39  A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of famine and forced labor during the Japanese occupation  40  Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945  Sukarno  an influential nationalist leader  declared independence and was appointed president  41  42  43  44  The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule  and an armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949  when in the face of international pressure  the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence 42  45   with the exception of the Dutch territory of West New Guinea  which was incorporated into Indonesia following the 1962 New York Agreement  and the UN mandated Act of Free Choice of 1969   46  Sukarno  Indonesia s founding president Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism  and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the military and the Communist Party of Indonesia  PKI   47 An attempted coup on 30 September 1965 was countered by the army  who led a violent anti communist purge  during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed  48  49  50  Around 500 000 people are estimated to have been killed  51  52  The head of the military  General Suharto  out maneuvered the politically weakened Sukarno  and was formally appointed president in March 1968  His New Order administration 53  was supported by the US government  54  55  56  and encouraged foreign direct investment in Indonesia  which was a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth  However  the authoritarian  New Order  was widely accused of corruption and suppression of political opposition  37  57  58  Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the late 1990s Asian financial crisis  59  This increased popular discontent with the New Order and led to popular protest across the country  Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998  60  In 1999  East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia  after a twenty five year military occupation that was marked by international condemnation of repression of the East Timorese  61  Since Suharto s resignation  a strengthening of democratic processes has included a regional autonomy program  and the first direct presidential election in 2004  Political and economic instability  social unrest  corruption  and terrorism slowed progress  however  in the last five years the economy has performed strongly  Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious  sectarian discontent and violence has occurred  62  A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005  63   edit  Government and politics Main article  Politics of Indonesia A session of the People s Representative Council in Jakarta Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system  As a unitary state  power is concentrated in the central government  Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998  Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms  Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia 64  have revamped the executive  judicial  and legislative branches  65  The president of Indonesia is the head of state  commander in chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces  and the director of domestic governance  policy making  and foreign affairs  The president appoints a council of ministers  who are not required to be elected members of the legislature  The 2004 presidential election was the first in which the people directly elected the president and vice president  66  The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five year terms  67  The highest representative body at national level is the People s Consultative Assembly  MPR   Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution  inaugurating the president  and formalizing broad outlines of state policy  It has the power to impeach the president  68  The MPR comprises two houses  the People s Representative Council  DPR   with 560 members  and the Regional Representative Council  DPD   with 132 members  69  The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch  party aligned members are elected for five year terms by proportional representation  65  Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR s role in national governance  70  The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management  71  Most civil disputes appear before a State Court  Pengadilan Negeri   appeals are heard before the High Court  Pengadilan Tinggi   The Supreme Court  Mahkamah Agung  is the country s highest court  and hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews  Other courts include the Commercial Court  which handles bankruptcy and insolvency  a State Administrative Court  Pengadilan Tata Negara  to hear administrative law cases against the government  a Constitutional Court  Mahkamah Konstitusi  to hear disputes concerning legality of law  general elections  dissolution of political parties  and the scope of authority of state institutions  and a Religious Court  Pengadilan Agama  to deal with codified Sharia Law cases  72   edit  Foreign relations and military Main articles  Foreign relations of Indonesia and Indonesian National Armed Forces President of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono with Barack Obama  the President of United States  in ceremony at the Istana Merdeka in Jakarta  9 November 2010  Obama has been quite popular in Indonesia since his experience about being a child in Jakarta was unveiled  73  In contrast to Sukarno s anti imperialistic antipathy to western powers and tensions with Malaysia  Indonesia s foreign relations since the Suharto  New Order  have been based on economic and political cooperation with Western nations  74  Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia  and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit  69  The nation restored relations with the People s Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti communist purges early in the Suharto era  72  Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950  75  and was a founder of the Non Aligned Movement  NAM  and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference  OIC  now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation   69  Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement  the Cairns Group  and the WTO  and has historically been a member of OPEC  although it withdrew in 2008 as it was no longer a net exporter of oil  Indonesia has received humanitarian and development aid since 1966  in particular from the United States  western Europe  Australia  and Japan  69  The Indonesian Government has worked with other countries to apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of major bombings linked to militant Islamism and Al Qaeda  76  The deadliest bombing killed 202 people  including 164 international tourists  in the Bali resort town of Kuta in 2002  77  The attacks  and subsequent travel warnings issued by other countries  severely damaged Indonesia s tourism industry and foreign investment prospects  78  Indonesia s 300 000 member armed forces  TNI  include the Army  TNI AD   Navy  TNI AL  which includes marines   and Air Force  TNI AU   79  The army has about 400 000 active duty personnel  Defense spending in the national budget was 4  of GDP in 2006  and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations  80  One of the reforms following the 1998 resignation of Suharto was the removal of formal TNI representation in parliament  nevertheless  its political influence remains extensive  81  Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict  and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides  82  83  Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement  GAM  and the Indonesian military  a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005  84  In Papua  there has been a significant  albeit imperfect  implementation of regional autonomy laws  and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses  since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  85   edit  Administrative divisions Main articles  Provinces of Indonesia and Administrative divisions of Indonesia Provinces of Indonesia Administratively  Indonesia consists of 33 provinces  five of which have special status  Each province has its own political legislature and governor  The provinces are subdivided into regencies  kabupaten  and cities  kota   which are further subdivided into districts  kecamatan   and again into village groupings  either desa or kelurahan   Furthermore  a village is divided into several citizen groups  Rukun Warga  RW   which are further divided into several neighbourhood groups  Rukun Tetangga  RT    Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001  the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units  responsible for providing most government services  The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen s daily life  and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa  village chief   The provinces of Aceh  Jakarta  Yogyakarta  Papua  and West Papua have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces  The Acehnese government  for example  has the right to create certain elements of an independent legal system  in 2003  it instituted a form of Sharia  Islamic law   86  Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution  87  Papua  formerly known as Irian Jaya  was granted special autonomy status in 2001 and was separated into Papua and West Papua in February 2003  88  89  Jakarta is the country s special capital region  Indonesian provinces and their capitals   listed

between latitudes 11 S and 6 N  and longitudes 95 E and 141 E  It consists of 17 508 islands  about 6 000 of which are inhabited  90  These are scattered over both sides of the equator  The largest are Java  Sumatra  Borneo  shared with Brunei and Malaysia   New Guinea  shared with Papua New Guinea   and Sulawesi  Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo  Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea  and East Timor on the island of Timor  Indonesia shares maritime borders across narrow straits with Singapore  Malaysia  and the Philippines to the north  and with Australia to the south  The capital  Jakarta  is on Java and is the nation s largest city  followed by Surabaya  Bandung  Medan  and Semarang  91  At 1 919 440 square kilometers  741 050 sq mi   Indonesia is the world s 16th largest country in terms of land area  92  Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer  347 per sq mi   79th in the world  93  although Java  the world s most populous island  94  has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer  2 435 per sq mi   At 4 884 metres  16 024 ft   Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia s highest peak  and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake  with an area of 1 145 square kilometers  442 sq mi   The country s largest rivers are in Kalimantan  and include the Mahakam and Barito  such rivers are communication and transport links between the island s river settlements  95  Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java  Indonesia s seismic and volcanic activity is among the world s highest  Indonesia s location on the edges of the Pacific  Eurasian  and Australian tectonic plates makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes  Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes  96  including Krakatoa and Tambora  both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century  The eruption of the Toba supervolcano  approximately 70 000 years ago  was one of the largest eruptions ever  and a global catastrophe  Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167 736 in northern Sumatra  97  and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006  However  volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali  98  Lying along the equator  Indonesia has a tropical climate  with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons  Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1 780 3 175 millimeters  70 125 in   and up to 6 100 millimeters  240 in  in mountainous regions  Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra  West Java  Kalimantan  Sulawesi  and Papua receive the highest rainfall  Humidity is generally high  averaging about 80   Temperatures vary

Environment of Indonesia The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan  a great ape endemic to Indonesia  Indonesia s size  tropical climate  and archipelagic geography  support the world s second highest level of biodiversity  after Brazil   100  and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species  101  The islands of the Sunda Shelf  Sumatra  Java  Borneo  and Bali  were once linked to the Asian mainland  and have a wealth of Asian fauna  Large species such as the tiger  rhinoceros  orangutan  elephant  and leopard  were once abundant as far east as Bali  but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically  Forests cover approximately 60  of the country  102  In Sumatra and Kalimantan  these are predominantly of Asian species  However  the forests of the smaller  and more densely populated Java  have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture  Sulawesi  Nusa Tenggara  and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna  103  Papua was part of the Australian landmass  and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia  including over 600 bird species  104  Indonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species  with 36  of its 1 531 species of bird and 39  of its 515 species of mammal being endemic  105  Indonesia s 80 000 kilometers  50 000 mi  of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country s high level of biodiversity  Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems  including beaches  sand dunes  estuaries  mangroves  coral reefs  sea grass beds  coastal mudflats  tidal flats  algal beds  and small island ecosystems  8  Indonesia is one of Coral Triangle countries with the world s greatest diversity of coral reef fish with more than 1 650 species in eastern Indonesia only  106  The British naturalist  Alfred Wallace  described a dividing line between the distribution and peace of Indonesia s Asian and Australasian species  107  Known as the Wallace Line  it runs roughly north south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf  between Kalimantan and Sulawesi  and along the deep Lombok Strait  between Lombok and Bali  West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian  moving east from Lombok  they are increasingly Australian  In his 1869 book  The Malay Archipelago  Wallace described numerous species unique to the area  108  The region of islands between his line and New Guinea is now termed Wallacea  107  Indonesia s high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues  which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak  under resourced governance  109  Issues include large scale deforestation  much of it illegal  and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia  Malaysia and Singapore  over exploitation of marine resources  and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development  including air pollution  traffic congestion  garbage management  and reliable water and waste water services  109  Deforestation and the destruction of peatlands make Indonesia the world s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases  110 Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species  including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union  IUCN  as threatened  and 15 identified as critically endangered  including Bali Starling  111 Sumatran Orangutan  112  and Javan Rhinoceros  111  Melati  Jasminum sambac  is the national flower of Indonesia  113  together with Anggrek Bulan  Phalaenopsis amabilis  and Padma Raksasa Rafflesia  Rafflesia arnoldii   All three were chosen on World Environment Day in 1990  114  115  On the other occasion Bunga Bangkai  Titan arum  was also added as puspa langka together with Rafflesia  Each of Indonesian provinces also have their own floral emblems   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Indonesia Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java  Agriculture had been the country s largest employer for centuries  Indonesia has a mixed economy in which both the private sector and government play significant roles  116  The country is the largest economy in Southeast Asia and a member of the G 20 major economies  117  Indonesia s estimated gross domestic product  nominal   as of 2010 was US 706 73 billion with estimated nominal per capita GDP was US 3 015  and per capita GDP PPP was US 4 394  international dollars   118  June 2011  At World Economic Forum on East Asia  Indonesian president said Indonesia will be in the top ten countries with the strongest economy within the next decade  The Gross domestic product  GDP  is about  1 trillion 3  and the debt ratio to the GDP is 26   119  The industry sector is the economy s largest and accounts for 46 4  of GDP  2010   this is followed by services  37 1   and agriculture  16 5    However  since 2010  service sector has employed more people than other sectors  accounting 48 9  of the total labor force  this has been followed by agriculture  38 3   and industry  12 8    120 Agriculture  however  had been the country s largest employer for centuries  121  122  According to World Trade Organization data  Indonesia was the 27th biggest exporting country in the world in 2010  moving up three places from a year before  123  Indonesia s main export markets  2009  are Japan  17 28    Singapore  11 29    the United States  10 81    and China  7 62    The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Singapore  24 96    China  12 52    and Japan  8 92    In 2005  Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US 83 64 billion and import expenditure of US 62 02 billion  The country has extensive natural resources  including crude oil  natural gas  tin  copper  and gold  Indonesia s major imports include machinery and equipment  chemicals  fuels  and foodstuffs  And the country s major export commodities include oil and gas  electrical appliances  plywood  rubber  and textiles  124  Jakarta  the capital of Indonesia and the country s largest commercial center  In the 1960s  the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability  a young and inexperienced government  and economic nationalism  which resulted in severe poverty and hunger  By the time of Sukarno s downfall in the mid 1960s  the economy was in chaos with 1 000  annual inflation  shrinking export revenues  crumbling infrastructure  factories operating at minimal capacity  and negligible investment  Following President Sukarno s downfall in the mid 1960s  the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down  stabilized the currency  rescheduled foreign debt  and attracted foreign aid and investment   See Berkeley Mafia   Indonesia was until recently Southeast Asia s only member of OPEC  and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates  averaging over 7  from 1968 to 1981  125  Following further reforms in the late 1980s  126  foreign investment flowed into Indonesia  particularly into the rapidly developing export oriented manufacturing sector  and from 1989 to 1997  the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7   127  128  Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the Asian financial crisis of 1997 98  Against the US dollar  the rupiah dropped from about Rp  2 600 to a low point of 14 000  and the economy

corruption slowed the recovery  6  7  Transparency International  for example  has since ranked Indonesia below 100 in its Corruption Perceptions Index  131  132  Since 2007  however  with the
