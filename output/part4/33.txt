National Allied Publications debuted with the tabloid sized New Fun  The Big Comic Magazine  1 in February 1935  The company s second title  New Comics  1  cover date December 1935   appeared in a size close to what would become comic books  standard during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books  with slightly larger dimensions than today s update   That title evolved into Adventure Comics  which continued through issue  503 in 1983  becoming one of the longest running comic book series  Wheeler Nicholson s third and final title  Detective Comics  advertised with a cover illustration dated December 1936  eventually premiered three months late with a March 1937 cover date  The themed anthology series would become a sensation with the introduction of Batman in issue  27  May 1939   By then  however  Wheeler Nicholson had gone  In 1937  in debt to printing plant owner and magazine distributor Harry Donenfeld   who also published pulp magazines and operated as a principal in the magazine distributorship Independent News   Wheeler Nicholson was compelled to take Donenfeld on as a partner in order to publish Detective Comics  1  Detective Comics  Inc  was formed  with Wheeler Nicholson and Jack S  Liebowitz  Donenfeld s accountant  listed as owners  Major Wheeler Nicholson remained for a year  but cash flow problems continued  and he was forced out  Shortly afterward  Detective Comics Inc  purchased the remains of National Allied  also known as Nicholson Publishing  at a bankruptcy auction  Detective Comics Inc  soon launched a fourth title  Action Comics  and the premiere of which introduced Superman  a character with which Wheeler Nicholson had no direct involvement  editor Vin Sullivan chose to run the feature after Sheldon Mayer rescued it from the slush pile   Action Comics  1  June 1938   the first comic book to feature the new character archetype   soon known as  superheroes    proved a major sales hit  The company quickly introduced such other popular characters as the Sandman and Batman  On February 22  2010  a copy of Action Comics  1  June 1938  sold at auction from an anonymous seller to an anonymous buyer for  1 million  besting the  317 000 record for a comic book set by a different copy  in lesser condition  the previous year  8   edit  The Golden Age Main article  Golden Age of Comic Books National Allied Publications soon merged with Detective Comics Inc  to form National Comics  which in 1944 absorbed an affiliated concern  Max Gaines s and Liebowitz s All American Publications  That year  Gaines let Liebowitz buy him out  and kept only Picture Stories from the Bible as the foundation of his own new company  EC Comics  At that point   Liebowitz promptly orchestrated the merger of All American and Detective Comics into National Comics    Next he took charge of organizing National Comics   the self distributorship  Independent News  and their affiliated firms into a single corporate entity  National Periodical Publications   9  National Periodical Publications became publicly traded on the stock market in 1961  10  Despite the official names  National Comics  and  National Periodical Publications   the line used the logo  Superman DC  throughout  the DC logo could be seen on their covers and ads as early as 1940   and the company became known colloquially as DC Comics for years before the official adoption of that name in 1977  11  The company began to move aggressively against what it saw as copyright violating imitations from other companies  such as Fox Comics  Wonder Man  which  according to court testimony  Fox started as a copy of Superman  This extended to DC suing Fawcett Comics over Captain Marvel  at the time comics  top selling character  Despite the fact that parallels between Captain Marvel and Superman seemed more tenuous  Captain Marvel s powers came from magic  unlike Superman s   the courts ruled that substantial and deliberate copying of copyrighted material had occurred  Faced with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy if it lost  Fawcett capitulated in 1955 and ceased comics publication  Years later  Fawcett ironically sold the rights for Captain Marvel to DC   which in 1973 revived Captain Marvel in the new title Shazam  featuring artwork by his creator  C  C  Beck  In the meantime  the abandoned trademark had been seized by Marvel Comics in 1967  disallowing the DC comic itself to be called that  While Captain Marvel did not recapture his old popularity  he later appeared in a Saturday morning live action TV adaptation and gained a prominent place in the mainstream continuity DC calls the DC Universe  When the popularity of superheroes faded in the late 1940s  the company focused on such genres as science fiction  Westerns  humor  and romance  DC also published crime and horror titles  but relatively tame ones  and thus avoided the mid 1950s backlash against such comics  A handful of the most popular superhero titles  most notably Action Comics and Detective Comics  the medium s two longest running titles  continued publication   edit  The Silver Age Main article  Silver Age of Comic Books In the mid 1950s  editorial director Irwin Donenfeld and publisher Liebowitz directed editor Julius Schwartz  whose roots lay in the science fiction book market  to produce a one shot Flash story in the try out title Showcase  Instead of reviving the old character  Schwartz had writers Robert Kanigher and John Broome  penciler Carmine Infantino  and inker Joe Kubert create an entirely new super speedster  updating and modernizing the Flash s civilian identity  costume  and origin with a science fiction bent  The Flash s reimagining in Showcase  4  October 1956  proved sufficiently popular that it soon led to a similar revamping of the Green Lantern character  the introduction of the modern all star team Justice League of America  JLA   and many more superheroes  heralding what historians and fans call the Silver Age of comic books  National did not reimagine its continuing characters  primarily Superman  Batman  and Wonder Woman   but radically overhauled them  The Superman family of titles  under editor Mort Weisinger  introduced such enduring characters as Supergirl  Bizarro  and Brainiac  The Batman titles  under editor Jack Schiff  introduced the successful Batwoman  Bat Girl  Ace the Bat Hound  and Bat Mite in an attempt to modernize the strip with non science fiction elements  Schwartz  together with artist Infantino  then revitalized Batman in what the company promoted as the  New Look   re emphasizing Batman as a detective  Meanwhile  editor Kanigher successfully introduced a whole family of Wonder Woman characters having fantastic adventures in a mythological context  DC s introduction of the reimagined superheroes did not go unnoticed by other comics companies  In 1961  with DC s JLA as the specific spur  12 Marvel Comics writer editor Stan Lee and legendary creator Jack Kirby ushered in the sub Silver Age  Marvel Age  of comics with the debut issue of The Fantastic Four  13  Since the 1940s  when Superman  Batman  and many of the company s other heroes began appearing in stories together  DC s characters inhabited a shared continuity that  decades later  was dubbed by whom   the DC Universe  With the story  Flash of Two Worlds   in Flash  123  September 1961   editor Schwartz  with writer Gardner Fox and artists Infantino and Joe Giella  introduced a concept that allowed slotting the 1930s and 1940s Golden Age heroes into this continuity via the explanation that they lived on an other dimensional  Earth 2   as opposed to the modern heroes   Earth 1    in the process creating the foundation for what would later be called the DC Multiverse  A 1966 Batman TV show on the ABC network sparked a temporary spike in comic book sales  and a brief fad for superheroes in Saturday morning animation  Filmation created most of DC s initial cartoons  and other media  DC significantly lightened the tone of many DC comics   particularly Batman and Detective Comics   to better complement the  camp  tone of the TV series  This tone coincided with the famous  Go Go Checks  checkerboard cover dress which featured a black and white checkerboard strip at the top of each comic  a misguided attempt by then managing editor Irwin Donenfeld to make DC s output  stand out on the newsracks   14  In 1967  Batman artist Infantino  who had designed popular Silver Age characters Batgirl and the Phantom Stranger  rose from art director to become DC s editorial director  With the growing popularity of upstart rival Marvel Comics threatening to topple DC from its longtime number one position in the comics industry  he attempted to infuse the company with new titles and characters  also recruiting major talents such as ex Marvel artist and Spider Man co creator Steve Ditko and promising newcomer Neal Adams  He also replaced some existing DC editors with artist editors  including Joe Kubert and Dick Giordano  to give DC s output a more artistic critical eye  These new editors recruited youthful new creators  in part in an effort to capture a market which had grown from being dominated by children  to include older teens and even college students  Some new talent  such as Dennis O Neil  who had worked for both Marvel and Charlton  gained critical and popular acclaim on titles including Batman and Green Lantern  his Green Lantern run with artist Neal Adams became a key title in the burgeoning 1970s Bronze Age  and the move away from the Comics Code Authority   Nevertheless  the period was plagued by short lived series that started out strong but petered out rapidly  In 1969  National Periodical Publications was purchased by Kinney National Company  which later purchased Warner Bros  Seven Arts and became Warner Communications  15   edit  The Fourth World Main article  Fourth World  comics  In 1970  Jack Kirby moved from Marvel Comics to DC  at the end of the Silver Age of Comics  in which Kirby s contributions to Marvel played a large  integral role  Given carte blanche to write and illustrate his own stories  he created a handful of thematically linked series he called collectively The Fourth World  In the existing series Superman s Pal Jimmy Olsen and in his own  newly launched series New Gods  Mister Miracle  and The Forever People  Kirby introduced such enduring characters and concepts as archvillain Darkseid and the otherdimensional realm Apokolips  While sales were respectable  they did not meet DC management s initially high expectations  and also suffered from a lack of comprehension and internal support from Infantino  By 1973 the  Fourth World  books was all cancelled  although Kirby s conceptions would soon become integral to the broadening of the DC Universe  Kirby went on to create other  daring and different  series for DC  including Kamandi  about a teenaged boy in a post apocalyptic world of anthropomorphic talking animals  when directed by the publisher to come up with something resembling Planet of the Apes   edit  The Bronze Age Main article  Bronze Age of Comic Books Following the science fiction innovations of the Silver Age  the comics of the 1970s and 1980s would become known as the Bronze Age  as fantasy gave way to more naturalistic and sometimes darker themes  Illegal drug use  banned by the Comics Code Authority  explicitly appeared in comics for the first time in Marvel Comics  The Amazing Spider Man in early 1971  and after the Code s updating in response  DC offered a drug fueled storyline in writer Dennis O Neil and artist Neal Adams  Green Lantern  beginning with the story  Snowbirds Don t Fly  in the retitled Green Lantern   Green Arrow  85  September 1971   which depicted Speedy  the teen sidekick of superhero archer Green Arrow  as having become a heroin addict  Jenette Kahn  a former children s magazine publisher  replaced Infantino as editorial director in January 1976  DC had attempted to compete with the now surging Marvel by dramatically increasing its output and attempting to win the market by flooding it  This included launching series featuring such new characters as Firestorm and Shade  the Changing Man  as well as an increasing array of non superhero titles  in an attempt to recapture the pre Wertham days of post War comicdom  In June 1978  five months before the release of the first Superman movie  Kahn expanded the line further  increasing the number of titles and story pages  and raising the price from 35 cents to 50 cents  Most series received eight page back up features while some had full length twenty five page stories  This was a move the company called the  DC Explosion   16  The move was not successful  however  and corporate partner Warner dramatically cut back on these largely unsuccessful titles  firing many staffers in what industry watchers dubbed  the DC Implosion   17  In September 1978  the line was dramatically reduced and standard size books returned to 17 story pages but for a still increased 40 cents  18  By 1980  the books returned to 50 cents with a 25 page story count but the story pages replaced house ads in the books  Seeking new ways to boost market share  the new team of publisher Kahn  vice president Paul Levitz  and managing editor Giordano addressed the issue of talent instability  To that end   and following the example of Atlas Seaboard Comics and such independent companies as Eclipse Comics   DC began to offer royalties in place of the industry standard work for hire agreement in which creators worked for a flat fee and signed away all rights  giving talent a financial incentive tied to the success of their work  In addition  emulating the era s new television form  the miniseries while addressing the matter of an excessive number of ongoing titles fizzling out within a few issues of their start  DC created the industry concept of the comic book limited series  This publishing format allowed for the deliberate creation of finite storylines within a more flexible publishing format that could showcase creations without forcing the talent into unsustainable openended commitments  These changes in policy shaped the future of the medium as a whole  and in the short term allowed DC to entice creators away from rival Marvel  and encourage stability on individual titles  In November 1980 DC launched the ongoing series The New Teen Titans  by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George P rez  two popular talents with a history of success  Their superhero team comic  superficially similar to Marvel s ensemble series X Men  but rooted in DC history  earned significant sales 19  in part due to the stability of the creative team  who both continued with the title for six full years  In addition  Wolfman and P rez took advantage of the limited series option to create a spin off title  Tales of the New Teen Titans  to present origin stories of their original characters without having to break the narrative flow of the main series or oblige them to double their work load with another ongoing title   edit  Late 1980s Main article  Modern Age of Comic Books This successful revitalization of the Silver Age Teen Titans into The New Teen Titans led DC s editors to seek the same for the entire line and for the wider DC Universe  The result  the Wolfman P rez 12 issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths  gave the company an opportunity to realign and jettison some of the  baggage  of its history  address  errors  in the characters  long histories and   particularly   revise  update and streamline major characters such as Superman and Wonder Woman  A companion publication in the new prestige format  two volumes entitled The History of the DC Universe  set out briefly the revised history of the major DC characters  and set the scene for an effective reboot of all titles  while still rooted in the long tradition and history of the DC Universe  Effectively moving from the realism of the Bronze Age towards the era sometimes called the  Dark Age   Crisis featured many key and resonant deaths which would shape the DC Universe for the following decades  and separate the timeline of DC publications into pre  and post  Crisis   Meanwhile  a parallel revolution had started in the non superhero and horror titles  Since the start of 1984  British writer Alan Moore had re energized the horror series The Saga of the Swamp Thing  and his acclaimed work sparked the comic book equivalent of rock music s British Invasion  Building on the dark naturalism of the Bronze Age  numerous British writers  including Neil Gaiman and Grant Morrison  subsequently began freelancing for the company  The resulting influx of sophisticated horror fantasy material led not only to DC abandoning the Comics Code for particular titles scripted by those talents  but also to establishing in 1993 the Vertigo mature readers imprint  Key titles in the subtle shift towards the Modern Age include the two DC published limited series Batman  The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller and Watchmen by Moore and artist Dave Gibbons  These titles drew attention to changes at DC for their dark psychological complexity and promotion of the antihero  The new creative freedom and attendant publicity that allowed Miller to produce a dark  future Batman and Moore to create a similarly dystopian alternate history allowed DC to challenge Marvel s industry lead  These titles also paved the way for comics to be more widely accepted in literary criticism circles as suitable reading for adults  and to make inroads into the book industry  with collected editions of these key series selling particularly well as trade paperbacks  Conversely  while the mainstream DC Universe got a shade darker  the mid 1980s also saw the end of many long running DC war comics  including venerable series that had been in print since the 1960s  These titles  all with over 100 issues  included Sgt  Rock  G I  Combat  The Unknown Soldier  and Weird War Tales  In March 1989  Warner Communications merged with Time Inc   making DC Comics a subsidiary of Time Warner  In June  the first non camp Batman movie was released  and DC began publishing its hardcover series of DC Archive Editions  collections of many of their early  key comics series  featuring rare and expensive stories unseen by many modern fans  Restoration for many of the Archive Editions was handled by Rick Keene with color restoration by DC s long time resident colorist  Bob LeRose  These collections attempted to retroactively credit many of the writers and artists who had worked without much recognition for DC during the early period of comics  when individual credits were few and far between   edit  1990s The comics industry experienced a brief boom in the early 1990s  thanks to a combination of speculative purchasing  mass purchase of the books as collectible items  with intent to resell at a higher value as the rising value of older issues was thought to imply that all comics would rise dramatically in price  and several storylines which gained attention from the mainstream media  DC s extended storylines in which Superman was killed  Batman was crippled  and superhero Green Lantern turned into the supervillain Parallax resulted in dramatically increased sales  but the increases were as temporary as the hero s replacements  Sales dropped off as the industry went into a major slump  while manufactured  collectibles  numbering in the millions replaced quality with quantity until fans and speculators alike deserted the medium in droves  DC s Piranha Press and other imprints  including the mature readers line Vertigo  and Helix  a short lived science fiction imprint  were introduced to facilitate compartmentalized diversification and allow for specialized marketing of individual product lines  They increased the use of non traditional contractual arrangements  including the dramatic rise of creator owned projects  leading to a significant increase in critically lauded work  much of it for Vertigo  and the licensing of material from other companies  DC also increased publication of book store friendly formats  including trade paperback collections of individual serial comics  as well as original graphic novels  DC entered into a publishing agreement with Milestone Media that gave DC a line of comics featuring a culturally and racially diverse range of superhero characters  Although the Milestone line ceased publication after a few short years  it yielded the popular animated series Static Shock  DC established Paradox Press to publish material such as the large format Big Book of    series of multi artist interpretations on individual themes  and such crime fiction as the graphic novel Road to Perdition  In 1998  DC purchased Wildstorm Comics  Jim Lee s imprint under the Image Comics banner  continuing it for many years as a wholly separate imprint   and fictional universe   with its own style and audience  As part of this purchase  DC also began to publish titles under the fledgling WildStorm sub imprint America s Best Comics  ABC   a series of titles created by Alan Moore  including The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  Tom Strong  and Promethea  Moore strongly contested this situation  and DC eventually stopped publishing ABC   edit  2000s In March 2003  DC acquired publishing and merchandising rights to the long running fantasy series Elfquest  previously self published by creators Wendy and Richard Pini under their WaRP Graphics publication banner  This series then followed another non DC title  Tower Comics  series T H U N D E R  Agents  in collection into DC Archive Editions  In 2004  DC temporarily acquired the North American publishing rights to graphic novels from European publishers 2000 AD and Humanoids  It also rebranded its younger audience titles with the mascot Johnny DC  and established the CMX imprint to reprint translated manga  In 2006  CMX took over from Dark Horse Comics publication of the webcomic Megatokyo in print form  DC also took advantage of the demise of Kitchen Sink Press and acquired the rights to much of the work of Will Eisner  such as his The Spirit series and his graphic novels  In 2004  DC began laying the groundwork for a full continuity reshuffling sequel to Crisis on Infinite Earths  promising substantial changes to the DC Universe  and side stepping the 1994 Zero Hour event which similarly tried to ret con the history of the DCU   In 2005  the critically lauded Batman Begins film was released  also  the company published several limited series establishing increasingly escalated conflicts among DC s heroes  with events climaxing in the Infinite Crisis limited series  Immediately after this event  DC s ongoing series jumped forward a full year in their in story continuity  as DC launched a weekly series  52  to gradually fill in the missing time  Concurrently  DC lost the copyright to  Superboy   while retaining the trademark  when the heirs of Jerry Siegel used a provision of the 1976 revision to the copyright law to regain ownership  In 2005  DC launched a new  All Star  line  evoking the title of the 1940s publication   designed to feature some of the company s best known characters in stories that eschewed the long and convoluted continuity of the DC Universe  and were produced by  all star  creative teams  All Star Batman  amp  Robin the Boy Wonder launched in July 2005  with All Star Superman beginning in November 2005  All Star Wonder Woman and All Star Batgirl were announced in 2006  with the release of Superman Returns in movie theaters  but neither have been released or scheduled as of the end of 2009  Adam Hughes  who was initially announced as the writer artist on All Star Wonder Woman in 2006  20  21  explained at the 2010 San Diego Comic Con International that that project was  in the freezer  for the time being  due to the difficulty involved in both writing and illustrating himself  22  DC Entertainment In September 2009  Warner Bros  announced that DC Comics would become a subsidiary of DC Entertainment  Inc   with Diane Nelson  President of Warner Premiere  becoming president of the newly formed company and DC Comics President and Publisher Paul Levitz moving to the position of Contributing Editor and Overall Consultant there  23   edit  2010s On February 18  2010  DC Entertainment named Jim Lee and Dan DiDio as Co Publishers of DC Comics  Geoff Johns as Chief Creative Officer  John Rood as EVP of Sales  Marketing and Business Development  and Patrick Caldon as EVP of Finance and Administration  24  25  In May 2011  DC announced it would become the first comic book publisher to begin releasing digital versions of their comics on the same day as paper versions  26   edit  Relaunch Main article  The New 52 On June 1  2011  DC announced that it would end all ongoing series set in the DC Universe in August and relaunch its comic line with 52 issue  1s  starting with Justice League on August 31  2011  written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Jim Lee   with the rest to follow later on in September  27  28   edit  Logo 1977 2005 logo  known as the  DC Bullet  DC s first logo appeared on the April 1940 issues of its titles  The letters  DC  stood for Detective Comics  the name of Batman s flagship title  The small logo  with no background  read simply   A DC Publication   The November 1941 DC titles introduced an updated logo  This version was almost twice the size of the previous one  and was the first version with a white background  The name  Superman  was added to  A DC Publication   effectively acknowledging both Superman and Batman  This logo was the first to occupy the top left corner of the cover  where the logo has usually resided since  The company now referred to itself in its advertising as  Superman DC   In November 1949  the logo was modified to incorporate the company s formal name  National Comics Publications  This logo would also serve as the round body of Johnny DC  DC s mascot in the 1960s  1987 test logo In October 1970  DC briefly retired the circular logo in favor of a simple  DC  in a rectangle with the name of the title  or the star of the book  the logo on many issues of Action Comics  for example  read  DC Superman   An image of the lead character either appeared above or below the rectangle  For books that did not have a single star  such as anthologies like House of Mystery or team series such as Justice League of America  the title and  DC  appeared in a stylized logo  such as a bat for House of Mystery  This use of characters as logos helped to establish the likenesses as trademarks  and was similar to Marvel s contemporaneous use of characters as part of its cover branding  DC s  100 Page Super Spectacular  titles and later 100 page and  Giant  issues published from 1972 to 1974 featured a logo exclusive to these editions  the letters  DC  in a simple sans serif typeface within a circle  A variant had the letters in a square  The July 1972 DC titles featured a new circular logo  The letters  DC  were rendered in a block like typeface that would remain through later logo revisions until 2005  The title of the book usually appeared inside the circle  either above or below the letters  In December 1973  this logo was modified with the addition of the words  The Line of DC Super Stars  and the star motif that would continue in later logos  This logo was placed in the top center of the cover from August 1975 to October 1976  2005 2012 logo When Jenette Kahn became DC s publisher in late 1976  she commissioned graphic designer Milton Glaser to design a new logo  Popularly referred to as the  DC bullet   this logo premiered on the February 1977 titles  Although it varied in size and color and was at times cropped by the edges of the cover  or briefly rotated 4 degrees  it remained essentially unchanged for nearly three decades  In July 1987  DC released variant editions of Justice League  3 and The Fury of Firestorm  61 with a new DC logo  It featured a picture of Superman in a circle surrounded by the words  SUPERMAN COMICS   The company released these variants to newsstands in certain markets as a marketing test  29  On May 8  2005  a new logo was unveiled  debuting on DC titles in June 2005 with DC Special  The Return of Donna Troy  1 and the rest of the titles the following week  In addition to comics  it was designed for DC properties in other media  which was used for movies since Batman Begins  And the TV series Smallville  Justice League Unlimited and The Batman  as well as for collectibles and other merchandise  The logo was designed by Josh Beatman of Brainchild Studios 30  and DC executive Richard Bruning  31  In January 2012  a new logo was unveiled and is confirmed to  re capture the older branding    edit  Imprints  edit  Active DC  1935 present  DC Archive Editions  1989 present  Johnny DC  2004 present  Mad Books  1992 present  Vertigo  1993 present  Will Eisner Library  2000

Publishers of Comic Books Showing Decline  New York Times  September 23  1962  p 166   DC Comics  Inc  at Bloomberg Businessweek Retrieved December 18  2010   Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961  either Jack Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of DC Comics  then known as National Periodical Publications  bragged about DC s success with the Justice League  which had debuted in The Brave and the Bold  28  February 1960  before going on to its own title  to publisher Martin Goodman  whose holdings included the nascent Marvel Comics  during a game of golf  However  film producer and comics historian Michael Uslan partly debunked the story in a letter published in Alter Ego  43  December 2004   pp  43 44   Irwin said he never played golf with Goodman  so the story is untrue  I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC s 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as Sol Harrison and  production chief  Jack Adler were schmoozing with some of us     who worked for DC during our college summers      T he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News  not DC Comics  though DC owned Independent News       As the distributor of DC Comics  this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman      Of course  Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces      Sol worked closely with Independent News  top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse s mouth   Goodman  a publishing trend follower aware of the JLA s strong sales  confirmably directed his comics editor  Stan Lee  to create a comic book series about a team of superheroes  According to Lee in Origins of Marvel Comics  Simon and Schuster Fireside Books  1974   p  16   Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most  It was a book called The  sic  Justice League of America and it was composed of a team of superheroes        If the Justice League is selling    spoke he   why don t we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes      Integrative Arts 10   The Silver Age  by Jamie Coville  Retrieved June 11  2008     Irwin Donenfeld  R I P   by Mark Evanier  December 1  2004  Retrieved June 11
