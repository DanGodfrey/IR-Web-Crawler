Years Wolverine s life began in Alberta  Canada  1882  The mutant who would come to be known simply as  Logan  was born James Howlett  the second son of Elizabeth and John Howlett  Sr   owners of a large estate  As a boy  James was notably frail and prone to bouts of allergic attacks  James was constantly under the pressure of his grandfather  Mister Howlett  who believed that James required constant punishment by a strong hand  in order to be raised properly   Firm  but fair  was what Mister Howlett used to say to justify any of his cruel actions  Logan spent most of his early years on the estate grounds with two playmates that lived on the Howlett Estate with him  Rose O Hara  a red headed Irish girl who was brought in from town to be a companion to young James  and a boy nicknamed  Dog   the grounds keeper  Thomas Logan s  son  The children were close friends  but  as they reached adolescence  the abuse inflicted upon Dog warped his mind  Dog made unwanted advances towards Rose  which James reported to his father  In retaliation  Dog killed James  puppy  in turn leading to the expulsion of Thomas and Dog from the estate  Young James Howlett pops his claws for the first time  Added by ChaosTheory07 Thomas  in a drunken stupor and armed with a shotgun  invaded the Howlett Estate with his son and attempted to take Elizabeth  implied to be his former lover  with him  John  Sr  attempted to stop him and Thomas struck him in the head  in cold blood  James had just entered the room when this occurred and his mutation finally manifested  his claws extended from the backs of his hands and he attacked the intruders with uncharacteristic ferocity  killing Thomas and scarring Dog s face with three claw marks  Already an emotionally disturbed woman since the mysterious death of her first son  John Howlett  Jr   Elizabeth took her life  immediately afterward  with a blast from Thomas  gun  Fearing for their safety  Rose fled the estate with James  who appeared to have been deeply traumatized and had somehow repressed or forgotten most of the memories of life back at the estate  Dog falsely reported to the police and James  grandfather that Rose had murdered John  Sr  and Thomas  Rose led James to his grandfather s house  but Mr  Howlett simply sent them into exile  with cold  cruel eyes  but still used his influence in town to help the pair escape  due to blood ties  James Howlett  now known as  Logan   leads a pack of wolves  Added by ChaosTheory07  Little Smitty  James and Rose later found themselves in the Yukon Territories  in Canada around 1910  taking refuge in a British Columbia stone quarry  under the guise of being cousins  James also assumed the name of  Logan   in order to hide his identity  As the hard work of mining toughened his body and his mutant powers developed  Logan grew to be unusually strong and ferocious  learning to break the rocks by hating and bullying them  Later  Logan stated that it was a piece of his grandfather s devil personality  In his adulthood  James came to resemble the appearance of the groundskeeper much more closely than his legal father  James  Logan  became a valuable and admirable figure amongst the small community of miners  due to his hard work and strong ethics  earning him the respect of his peers  Even the foreman  Smitty  who became a surrogate father figure to Logan  was impressed with him  Logan even gained the nickname  Little Smitty   due to their similar work ethics  and this brought him into conflict with Cookie Malone  Smitty s original favorite  Cookie took an instant dislike to Logan and continually hurt him  until Smitty came to his rescue  Cookie even shorten the fuse to an explosive of Logan s  killing five men  Cookie cut Logan and Rose s rations  so Logan hunted deer in the woods and gave the extra to the neighbors  which made him more loved  Logan was immune to the elements  due to his healing factor  and even ran with the wolves in the forest  learning to hunt like an animal  Logan even fought Cookie in cage matches  where he earned the nickname  Wolverine   It was said that no one could beat Logan in a cage fight  After his victories  Logan would hear  It s not the size of the dog in the fight  It s the size of the fight in the dog  a phrase that he repeated out loud to make it come true  During this period  Logan developed strong feelings for Rose  but could not act on them for the sake of their guise as cousins  Smitty  who had been mentoring Logan all these years  had also grown close to Rose and the two eventually fell in love and became engaged  much to the scorn and surprise of Logan  who later accepted the situation for the sake of Rose s happiness  Meanwhile  his grandfather  Mr  Howlett  was in failing health and asked Dog to find Rose and his grandson  so he could make peace with them before he died  Dog agreed  however  Dog  who had become a physically formidable man himself  decided to track them down  so he could kill Logan  Dog hunted Logan and Rose down so easily that it seemed he had a preternatural skill for tracking  On the night that Smitty was due to leave the mining town with Rose  Dog finally found and confronted Logan  Dog reminded Logan of his past as James Howlett and that fateful night back on the estate that had changed all their lives  The two fought fiercely in the middle of the street and  despite being the physically stronger of the two  Dog was eventually overpowered by the enraged Logan  As Dog lay unconscious  Logan unsheathed his claws  for the first time in public  to the shock of everyone watching   and was about to deal the deathblow  when Rose leaped in to stop him  but was accidentally impaled by his claws  Horrified  Logan held her in his arms as she died and then fled into the woods  where he lived in self imposed exile with a pack of wolves  presumably for many years  Around this time  Logan met and fell in love with many women  Unknown to him  Logan also fathered a number of children  Logan  amp  Silver Fox Added by Copycat989 Birthday Surprise Later  regaining his humanity  Logan traveled to another frontier community in the Canadian Rockies and met a young Blackfoot woman  named Silver Fox  with whom he fell in love  The two shared a cabin together and lived happily for a time  Logan had made a new life for himself  hunting and farm chores around the homestead now his daily routine  but  as ever  there were other forces at work in his life  On Logan s birthday  Victor Creed  later known as Sabretooth  murdered Silver Fox  the first of many birthday  surprises  from him to come  Enraged  Logan battled him in a bar  only to be defeated and left for dead  Creed and a mysterious cloaked figure then manipulated a feral  mindless Logan to slaughter the inhabitants of the town  persuading him that  the townspeople are afraid of you  they don t want you around  So  they got rid of the one thing keeping you here   Later  employed by The Hudson s Bay Company as a fur trader to the Blackfoot Indians  Logan defeated the demonic snake worm  known as Uncegila  a feat which earned him the Blackfoot warrior name of  Skunk Bear   or  Wolverine    A broad  largely unseen conspiracy thus began to shape Logan  now robbed of his conscience and free will  into the perfect killer  Wherever Logan went  Creed  one of his handlers  was not far behind  On one occasion in Madripoor  Logan was rescued from Victor  by Viper and Seraph  and became a pupil of Seraph  Seraph died  but not before making Logan swear an oath of loyalty to Viper  Corporal Logan serving in the Devil s Brigade in WWI Belgium  Added by ChaosTheory07 World War I Sometime later  Logan joined the Canadian Army  where he was assigned to a special unit known as the Devil s Brigade  just before the first World War  Although  under the Canadian flag  the Devil s Brigade s orders originated from the same mysterious figure that was responsible for the death of Silver Fox  Logan s commanding officer was a super humanly strong  man known as Silas Burr  who would later become the mercenary Cyber   who was formerly an agent of the Pinkerton Private Detective Agency  where he abused his position  committing several atrocities  even burning down a schoolhouse full of children once  After being sentenced to death for his crimes  Burr was rescued from the courthouse  by Creed  and brought to the facility  hired by Frederick Hudson due to his sadistic nature  Burr  under orders  killed Logan s girlfriend  Janet and then fought Logan  After severely beating him  Burr gouged out one of Logan s eyes  reducing him to his feral  animal like state and sending him running through the woods once again  Burr and Creed retrieved him  his memory of the event evaporated due to his healing factor and their brainwashing  Later in the war  while fighting in Ypres  Belgium  on April 22  1915  Logan encountered a being  called Lazaer  an anagram of Azrael  the Angel of Death   who was armed with a large broadsword and had been using it to kill soldiers on the same battlefield  They began to fight one another  with Lazaer initially gaining the upper hand  but  after being impaled with Lazaer s sword  Logan pulled it from his chest and stabbed it through his surprised opponent  Besting Lazaer in combat sent Logan in to a deep depression  even causing him to put a gun to his own head at one point  Logan started drinking considerably more as the war dragged on and ate less and less  until Lazaer finally confronted him  Lazaer explained that the depression was a punishment for defeating him and defying the natural order of things  It was also later revealed that because Logan defeated Lazaer  every time he receives an injury serious enough to threaten him  he gets a second chance by battling Lazaer for his life  Logan and Mystique in 1921  Added by ChaosTheory07 Kansas City Bank Robbery In 1921  Logan found himself in the Mexican Sondran Desert beaten  locked up by the local police  and accused of horse thievery  As Logan was blindfolded and tied to a post to be shot  by a firing squad  a voice next to him asked if he was a murderer  Logan answered     worse  a horse thief    and the person next to him turned out to be Raven Darkholme  who was also about to be killed for being blue  The locals thought she was a witch  even though she explained that she was simply born different  and Logan laughed at meeting someone like him there of all places  Raven managed to untie herself  just before the firing squad shot  and Logan survived  due  once again  to his healing factor  and killed the guards  After they both escaped  Raven stood surprised that Logan was able to survive and asked how he knew she would be able to free herself and escape  Logan responded   I didn t    and  when she asked where he was going to next  he said the nearest bar  Raven introduced herself to Logan and said that she had a group of friends in Kansas City  that he would probably like to meet  Once in Kansas City  Raven told Logan about her group  who scammed people  After meeting Raven s crew  and saving one of them from an angry customer that was scammed  Raven informed Logan that she and her crew were planning a bank heist and she wanted him to take part in it  When Logan expressed his reluctance to get attached to people  likely due to the loss of his parents  Rose  Smitty  Silver Fox  Seraph and Janet   Raven told him that she knew it was hard to trust people  but that they could be a family and to trust her  They both kiss and Logan decided to help her  However  the bank robbery did not go quite as planned  and Raven cut and ran  leaving her crew to take the fall  Logan again found himself alone and with a festering hatred for the woman he had come to trust  Logan during World War II  Added by ChaosTheory07 World War II Years later  Logan met Nick Fury  Captain America  and Black Widow  while fighting the Nazis in Madripoor and Europe during World War II  Afterward  Logan participated as a paratrooper for the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion  during the Normandy landings on D Day  as well as the liberation of the Netherlands  Logan may have also been a spy for the Allied Forces and may have spent time in the Sobibor concentration camp in Poland  where he psychologically tortured three commandants by simply never speaking and returning every time they ordered him executed  While at Sobibor  Logan was known as  Prisoner Zero   In 1945  Logan unwittingly participated in another landmark of World War II  when he was captured by Japanese soldiers while performing sabotage missions in Japan  where he was sent to a prison camp in Nagasaki  Logan escaped from his cell along with Lt  Ethan Warren  an American soldier who was also captured  and found refuge and love in a local Japanese girl  named Atsuko  Unfortunately  Lt  Warren  himself a mutant  returned and murdered the girl and the two men fought  until both were caught in the atomic blast that destroyed much of the city  Logan survived  but was devastated to lose another woman in his life  Samurai Added by ChaosTheory07 Fathering Daken After WWII  Logan traveled to China  where he met a Chinese businessman  named Chang  an employee of Landau  Luckman  and Lake  LLL   In Shanghai  Logan met Ogun  an immortal Japanese samurai and sorcerer  Impressed by Logan s skill  Ogun offered to instruct him in the martial arts and even taught him Sun Tzu and ideograms  Wolverine soon developed a deep and lasting love for Japan  After his training with Ogun  Logan traveled to the village of Bando Saburo  in order to learn how to be a man  There  Logan met and fell in love with a local woman  named Itsu Akihiro and they married and conceived a child together  unknown to Logan  Logan  amp  Itsu Added by ChaosTheory07 While Logan was proving himself worthy of being a father in combat  the demon sword smith  Muramasa  created an explosion  that caused Logan to accidentally stab a villager with his claws  Logan was banned from the village  but wanted to say good bye to Itsu  Returning to their self built home  Logan found Itsu murdered  by the Winter Soldier  Unbeknown to Logan  the mysterious cloaked figure  who accompanied Creed when he murdered Silver Fox  took the child from Itsu s womb  Logan gave himself to Muramasa  thinking the villagers were responsible for the murder of Itsu  and Muramasa vowed to build a sword capable of killing even Logan himself  Logan was later rescued by the Winter Soldier and taken to Madripoor  CIA and Team X Logan once again fell under the manipulation of the mysterious puppeteer in his life  the callous man who stole Logan s baby from Itsu s womb  Working for the CIA  Logan helped participate in turning a boy  named Frank Simpson  into the deranged super soldier  Nuke  Frank  growing up watching his alcoholic mother constantly verbally abuse his meek father  was influenced by his babysitter  another operative of the mysterious manipulator  into killing his mother  Meanwhile  as Frank s father drove the babysitter home  she abruptly pulled out his flask and began to drink it and then seduced him  After pulling over into the nearby woods  the couple was interrupted by a police officer  who was revealed to be Logan  Logan asked Frank s father to sit back in his seat and shot the babysitter  with Frank s gun  Logan then suggested that Frank s father had taken advantage of the babysitter  plying her with alcohol and even going so far as to shooting her because she resisted  Frank s father realized the gravity of the situation and  seeing no other way  he shot himself  Logan would go to Chang to handle the finances that he acquired over his missions  Logan with fellow Team X member Victor Creed  Sabretooth  Added by Dann Fonda Later  during the Vietnam War  Logan tortured the already unstable soldier  carving stars and stripes into his face all the while screaming  No V C    Frank then escaped  fleeing into a local village  hearing several of the villagers shout  No Vee See    he thought back to his painful torture  It pushed Frank over the edge and he brutally murdered the whole village  just like Logan did in vengeance for Silver Fox  Logan continued his espionage work  becoming a favorite of both America s and Canada s secret services  even teaming up with Ben Grimm  later known as the Thing  to participate in a Cold War era government mission  Logan was then placed on the Black Ops squad run by the CIA  called Team X  with Creed  Maverick  Kestrel  Mastodon  and somehow  Silver Fox  The group was apparently disbanded  after a botched mission concerning Arkady Gregorivich  later known as Omega Red   During their time with the group  Logan and the others had their memories tampered with  in order for them to better controlled  This was another reason why Logan would suffer from amnesia  with the exception of false memories  for many years to come  Wolverine prepped for adamantium bonding process Added by Wolverine and Phoenix The Weapon X Program While in his Lotus Seven  Logan was pumped full of Thorazine  beaten  and kidnapped  by a group of armed men from the Weapon X Program  the tenth installment of the Weapon Plus Project  The man known only as the Professor  Dr  Abraham Cornelius  and Dr  Carol Hines began to examine Logan  while he floated in a containment tank  Logan s bones  including his claws  were bonded with the indestructible metal  known as Adamantium  making them unbreakable  and was brain washed  While in the tank  Logan was put under deep hypnosis  telling him that he was not a man or individual  and being a man disgusted him  The Program wanted Logan to believe that he was an obedient animal and that individuality lead to suffering and death  This Adamantium bonding process was apparently stolen  by the Weapon X Program  from the Japanese scientist  known as Dr  Kenji Oyama  the father of Yuriko Oyama  later known as Lady Deathstrike   which was why Yuriko would come to despise Logan in later years  After becoming Weapon X  Logan was used simply as a killing machine  Logan was sent on a town and killed everyone of the inhabitants  women and children included  After each mission  Logan was subjected to advanced memory wipes and even had false memories implanted  Logan proved too difficult for the Weapon X Program to control and  after many years  he escaped the facility  with the help of the Winter Soldier  killing nearly everyone except for the Professor  Dr  Cornelius  Dr  Hines  and Malcolm Colcord  who later became the Director of a new Weapon X Program  Wolverine escaping Weapon X Added by ChaosTheory07 Driven into savagery by the experiment  Logan wandered the forests of the Canadian Rockies for weeks  living in a feral state  ironically  not far from the place of his birth  It was during this period Logan saved the life of a creature  known as a Hunter in Darkness  one of a race of feral beings apparently mystical in origin  A psychic link of some sort was established between the two  to resurface in later years  On occasion  Logan s human personality surfaced  to the extent that  years later  he was able to recall pleasant experiences in these woods  Years after this experience  Logan s memories of much of his past would remain clouded  as a result of the Weapon X experiment and additional false memories during the procedure as well  Logan even believed that Weapon X surgically implanted his claws  Battling against the Hulk Added by ChaosTheory07 Department H Wandering the woods  Logan was eventually discovered  by Heather and James  Mac  Hudson  a young couple honeymooning in the Rockies  who helped him regain his humanity  but not his memories   After much persuasion from the couple  Logan became a member of Canada s Department H  Donning what would become his famous blue and yellow costume for the first time  Wolverine was conscripted by Department H to join and lead  The Flight   the forerunner of Alpha Flight  Canada s government run super team  After leaving  The Flight   Wolverine was dispatched to halt the destruction caused by a savage fight  between the Incredible Hulk and the Wendigo  Wolverine s speed and maneuverability proved to be a match for the two plodding powerhouses  but after realizing Hulk was a more formidable opponent  he changed tactics  Teaming up with Hulk to take out the Wendigo  Hulk threw the Wendigo into a patch of trees and Wolverine then delivered the finishing blow  The Hulk and Wolverine kept on fighting  with the Hulk emerging victorious and Hulk abandoned the unconscious Wolverine  unaware of his healing factor  The defeated Wolverine returned to Department H  1  Logan becomes Wolverine Added by Moshikal15 Joining the X Men After his encounter with the Hulk  Wolverine was conscripted by Department H to join and lead Alpha

X Men  at the School for Gifted Youngsters  with fellow new recruits Storm  Nightcrawler  Colossus  Thunderbird  and Banshee  for reasons which included that he had fallen for Marvel Girl  despite the fact that the original team left to pursue a normal life  Logan remained with the X Men for quite some time  at one time being their field commander  At first skeptical of Professor Xavier s hope for

revered as an  animal cast in a semblance of human form   for using deadly force in a non lethal duel  With this act  Logan had dishonored himself to Mariko and was cast into the streets  where he was rescued by Yukio  later his close friend and sometimes lover  After being attacked by the Hand  Yukio manipulated Logan into helping her  which lead to further embarrassment in front of Mariko  Upon realizing his deceit  Logan took the fight directly to Shingen  After Yukio killed Mariko s husband  Wolverine was forced to kill Lady Mariko s father  Lord Shingen  in a duel  Afterward  Mariko gave

large number of costumed criminals  including the Absorbing Man  Doctor Doom  Doctor Octopus  the Enchantress  Kang  the Lizard  the Molecule Man  Ultron  the Wrecker and the Wrecking Crew  as well as the planet devourer Galactus  found themselves in another construct within this same area of spacetime  Aboard the constructs the passengers watched in awe as the galaxy nearest to them was annihilated by an unseen force  except for a single star  Then  before their eyes  a planet  which became known as Battleworld  was created to orbit that star  Finally  a rift opened in spacetime  from which poured a blinding light  and the passengers within the constructs heard a voice telling them   I am from beyond  Stay your enemies and all you desire shall be yours  Nothing you dream of is impossible for me to accomplish   The passengers were then sent to Battleworld  There  over the next several days  they engaged in a  secret war  amongst themselves  most of the criminals sought to destroy the heroic adventurers in order to gain the prize that the Beyonder had promised  The X Men  who quickly decided to stay out of the direct conflicts and become a third party  were unwelcome by the heroes for siding with Magneto  even battling Spider Man  While on Battleworld  Logan severely wounded Molecule Man  After Professor X noticed Galactus was attempting to feed on Battleworld  the X

Wolverine Following a distress call from teammate Ariel  Wolverine later traveled to Japan to confront his ex mentor  Ogun  Years before  Ogun was defeated in combat and ever since  his malicious spirit has had to find host bodies  Kitty was captured and put under the mental control of Ogun  Ogun mentally had Kitty believe that she was his daughter and had been training in the art of ninjitsu since birth  After arriving in Japan  Kitty was sent to kill Wolverine and injured him greatly  but with help from Yukio  she was restored  Wolverine undertook a crash program to teach Kitty s body  just as Ogun had taught her mind  to become skillful enough in the Japanese martial arts to contend against Ogun and to help her overcome his evil  Kitty went to face Ogun herself  who was attempting to kill Mariko and Amiko to punish Wolverine  After being defeated by Ogun  he offered Kitty  calling herself Shadowcat  to join him or die  At that time  Wolverine came to her rescue  Sadly  Wolverine was also overwhelmed and the two of them sat helplessly at Ogun s mercy  In a turn of events  Kitty informed Wolverine that she was scared until he arrived and when he apologized  she stated that she did not want an apology  but life  At that moment  Wolverine turned the battle and defeated Ogun and Kitty regained her innocence that Ogun had taken  After killing Ogun  Logan and Kitty

berserker rage as he began to search for the woman he secretly loved  After defeating the Crimson Commando in combat  Storm decided that the X Men would be more proactive and attack their enemies before they are attacked  On the anniversary of his wedding to Mariko  the team was abducted by Horde  to use as his lackeys to retrieve the Crystal of Ultimate Vision  of which he wore a shard on his forehead  The X Men were sent to the Citadel of Light and Shadow  where the crystal was hidden  As the X Men progressed through it  the citadel created illusions of each of their most powerful desires  Only Wolverine  Storm  and Psylocke were able to resist  Wolverine reached the Crystal and Horde cut him down and removed his heart as a trophy  However  a lone drop of Logan s blood splattered on the Crystal  which gave out enough energy for Wolverine to be restored  Empowered to godhood  Wolverine plucked the crystal shard from Horde s forehead and the tyrant quickly aged and crumbled to dust

last time Logan had seen Charlie  she was working in West Berlin  It was a mission that Logan had protested  but Charlie insisted and her handler double crossed her  Charlie called for Logan s help and he understood that it was serious  After fifty Soviet operatives couldn t take them down  they sent in KGB agents that had been undercover for years and Wolverine s beserker rage finished them all  After the slaughter  all that was left was a little heart shaped pendant  After leaving the X Men in a time of need  Logan traveled to Potsdammer Platz  West Berlin  where two KGB agents blew their cover by killing muggers and Charlemagne killed them while Logan s back was turned  While in Kurfurstendamm  Logan got the scent of Spider Man in civilian clothing and deciphered his secret identity

gunfight broke out  After loosing Charlie in the fight  Wolverine and Spider Man attempted to track her down  by getting to her marks before she did  but were always one step behind  After the pair split  Charlemagne called Wolverine to a Soviet cemetery at Teptow and he understood that she wanted him to end her life  so that the Soviets wouldn t have the chance to torture her  After flinching  Wolverine pulled too much and Charlemagne was bleeding to death  At that time  Spider Man arrived and attempted to stop Logan from killing her  A brutal fight broke out between the two  until Wolverine stated that the only way that Spider Man could stop him would be to kill him and killing was second nature to him  At that time  a government chopper arrived and the two split  In the

Dallas  Texas  where they were attacked by the Freedom Force  After the initial battle  a rift opened in the sky of Dallas and a chaos ensued of different weather patterns right next to each other and beings and creatures from the past appearing and attacking  The X Men and Freedom Force formed a temporary alliance with each other to save the citizens of Dallas  until Colossus  recently recovered  decided to enter Eagle Plaza  After gaining access into the Starlight Citadel  the X Men battled the Adversary and  after Rogue absorbed his power and opened a portal to seal him in  gave their life to imprison the Adversary  with a spell used from Forge  However  the Omniversal Guardian  named Roma  restored the X Men to life and freed the Adversary  under the notion that there could be no order without chaos  The events had been broadcast over a live television news feed and the world believed the heroes to be dead  After being resurrected  the X Men decided to use the opportunity to go underground and keep their rebirth secret  The X Men resurfaced in Australia  where they defeated the Reavers  who were holding Jess n Hoan as a hostage  They released Jess n and claimed their base and teleporter  Gateway  a mute  mutant aborigine with the ability to create gates with his bull roarer  Roma appeared and presented them with the Siege Perilous  a gem that created a portal which granted any person who walked through it judgment and a new chance at life  with a new career  home  and so forth and had magically made them invisible to any sort of mechanical perception  Around this time  Logan ordered a new armor costume for Psylocke from Landau  Luckman  amp  Lake  Patch After finding Dave Chapel in the desert tortured and dying from exposure  Wolverine returned to Madripoor  to the Princess Bar  and saved O Donnell from thugs of a crime boss  Roche  while searching for  the Tiger   While at the bar  Logan realized that he was being watched and confronted the woman  who turned out to be Jess n Hoan  After a brief battle with Jess n  Wolverine was beaten by Sapphire Styx and Razor Fist and delivered to Roche  After surviving torture from Inquisitor  Wolverine escaped and was brutally attacked by Razor Fist  who stabbed him in his throat and torso and left him for dead  Wolverine was rescued from a harbor and looked after by Jess n  After healing

of Mariko s  Kojima Noburo  Logan killed Banapur Khan and his pirates and found out about the Cult of the Black Blade s quest to steal the Muramasa Blade  a blade that all who wielded were possessed by it s demonic essence  except for the one warrior destined to be it s true master  Returning to Madripoor  Logan saved Lindsay McCabe  who he met while the X Men lived in San Francisco with Jessica Drew  but didn t recognize him  due to his Patch identity  After intentionally holding back in a fight with the Silver Samurai  Patch chased Jessica  who had been corrupted by the sword  through the streets of Madripoor  until he caught the blade with his bare hands and defeated her  claiming the sword  Holding the sword  a voice came from within the Black Blade  telling Patch that he and the Blade were destined to be one  The blade transformed Patch s clothing to a leather ninja outfit and he attempted to sacrifice Jessica  Patch was tracked to the Cult s hide out and Lindsay stopped him from killing Jessica  by snipping him in the head  After fighting the Silver Samurai  Patch fought the influence of the blade and the Samurai left with the sword  The X Men next investigated a Brood Star shark Havok had found and tracked the source to Harry Palmer  who was unaware he was infected and had made an entire cr che of mutant hosts  The X Men were too conflicted with killing the human hosts and Wolverine was captured and implanted with an embryo again  Once again  Logan s healing factor fought off the transformation in time for him to kill Temptress  freeing Psylocke  and kill Harry  ending the Brood threat  Following Storm  who abruptly left in the middle of the night  the X Men tracked her to the Savage Land  Upon arrival  the Savage Land was scorched and barren and the X

them  Later  Havok tracked the Marauders  in The Alley  and the X Men ambushed them  The Marauders fled and  as the X Men gave chase  they found themselves also battling a demonic invasion of New York  slowing becoming demonic themselves  Wolverine recognized familiar scents and the X Men confronted X Factor  the original X Men  harassing Madelyne and her baby  After Logan forcibly kissed Jean  Madelyne instigated a battle between the X Men and X Factor  having the X Men under her demonic influence and believing that X Factor was attempting to kidnap Nathan Summers  her and Scott s child  After the demon  N Astirh  attacked  the X Men and X Factor combined efforts to defeat him  assuming that he was controlling Madelyne  calling herself the Goblin Queen  and Havok  calling himself the Goblin Prince  At that moment  Marvel Girl was captured  by Maddie  and another battle was instigated between the X Men and X Factor  The Goblin Queen attempted to sacrifice baby Nathan atop the Empire State Building to permanently open a gateway between Earth and the demonic Limbo  The Goblin Queen locked herself  Nathan  and Jean inside a psionic barrier  Both the X Men and X Factor s combined efforts seemed to be futile in an effort to break through the telekinetic bubble  The invasion was thwarted after Madelyne committed suicide in combat with Jean  attempting to kill everyone in her power  but the X Men and X Factor protected each other while Jean protected Nathan Christopher 9   After Madelyne s death  Jean began to scream in pain and Storm ordered Psylocke to take Scott

after the recent loss of both the women he loved  Wolverine suggested that the men of the X Men go to a bar in Sydney  taking the idea from Dazzler who took all of the women out  While at the bar  the four X Men stopped an alien invasion of the many aliens in The Conquest  Shortly after  Wolverine and Havok were vacationing in Mexico and saved a woman from terrorist attackers  The woman was actually Scarlett McKenzie and was working for the Russian scientist  Dr  Neutron  Meltdown   who wanted to use Havok as a means to absorb the entire energy of a breaking down atom reactor and transmute it into himself  Scarlett gave Alex Summers false information that terrorists were trying to sabotage the plant and when he ventured into the heart of the reactor  he found it shortly before reaching critical limit  The timely arrival of Wolverine prevented a full disaster and after Logan killed the scientist  Alex redirected the nuclear radiation into space  For Alex s sake  Logan kept Scarlett s betrayal secret  as he was still trying to get over the back plotting of Madelyne  Later  the Deviant priest lord  Ghaur  and the former Lemurian empress  Llyra  contacted the Serpent Society to find certain mystical objects they needed to reconstruct the Serpent Crown and  due to the interference of Mister Jip  Diamondback briefly switched bodies with Dazzler  The X Men thwarted

worked together  to stop a power vacuum and war zone in Madripoor and Patch convinced Tyger to accept  Next  Patch began his quest to save Karma from her uncle s service  but was sidetracked when he learned that disrupting General Coy s drug activities planted a target on the General s head and Karma needed him to help her find her missing brother and sister  Patch accompanied Xi an Coy Manh to the airport to witness the arrival of Joe Fixit  who Patch smelled right away and recognized as the Hulk  Patch went on to use Joe to disrupt General Coy s drug and slave operations  Later  Police Chief Tai informed Patch that he was aware the Patch and Wolverine were one and the same  Remembering his first  birthday gift  from Creed  Patch saved a couple from being mugged and was later

Patch returned to San Fransisco with Jessica  when Archie Corrigan asked for help with his mentally unbalanced brother  Burt Corrigan  who was in danger of losing his inheritance  While at the trail  Burt burst through the window  dressed as Indiana Jones  screaming that he needed help from Ba al  When the X Men temporarily relocated to the Australian Outback  Wolverine took the runaway mutant Jubilee under his wing  after she saved his life from an attack by Lady Deathstrike and the Reavers  10  Jubilee eventually became like a daughter to him  much like Kitty before  While based in Australia  a man would ask Wolverine to go to the Savage Land  where he encountered a tribe of humans  Arriving in a lightweight plane  the tribe believed him a god  with the exception of Gahck  the tribe s female chieftain  Gahck challenged Wolverine to combat  and once it was established that he wasn t a god  he offered to help their hunting parties  Logan subsequently started a relationship with Gahck  When members of the tribe were captured  Wolverine discovered that a robotic Tyrannosaurus Rex would attack the tribe and take their members to a secret base  Wolverine discovered that experiments were performed on the tribe members by Apocalypse  and after freeing himself and the captured Gahck  he battled Apocalypse  though it turned out to be a robot  In the Apocalypse robot s lab  Logan learned that Apocalypse was the man who had told him to journey to the Savage Land  Wolverine then left  not realizing that he had fathered a son with Gahck named Erista  Logan s return to blue and gold Added by Jamie After the X Men returned to America  Wolverine began wearing his original blue and gold uniform again and finally returned to the Weapon X base in Canada  There  he inadvertently activated the Shiva program  which was designed to kill rogue Weapon X graduates  11  Wolverine also became much darker  as he learned many of his memories were implants  Mariko s Death Added by Ayancillo Wolverine then finally reunited with Mariko  However  almost immediately after they were reunited  she was promptly poisoned by a Yakuza assassin working for Matsu o  a business man who bore a great grudge against Wolverine  Mariko asked Wolverine to end her life quickly rather than let her die a slow and painful death from the toxin  Wolverine reluctantly complied  12  This changed Wolverine s character significantly  making him even more disciplined and emotionally distant  Wolverine then vowed to Matsu o that on each and every one of his birthdays he would slice off a body part until there was nothing of him left  Shortly after Mariko s death  he rejoined his former Team X members Silver Fox  Sabretooth  Maverick  John Wraith  and Mastodon  with Jubilee  and Hines of the Weapon X Program  in hunting down Aldo Ferro a k a Vole  a powerful psi talent who brainwashed many of them for Weapon X  Wolverine was shocked to learn that Silver Fox was still alive  To his surprise  Silver Fox despised him for something she believed he had done  She was subsequently killed by Sabretooth  who was controlled by Ferro  before Wolverine could figure out what she believed he had done  Ferro himself died soon afterward  After his encounter with the mutant assassin Omega Red  Logan began to question the memories he possessed  but his searches to find his true identity and memories proved fruitless  Logan possessed memories of being a Samurai in Japan  a mercenary operative for the CIA  and a  wild man  in the Canadian wilderness  He also had remembered romances with Mariko Yashida and Silverfox  Wolverine suffered a mental breakdown which stemmed from the deaths of Mariko and Silver Fox and Weapon X s mental tampering  Due to extensive memory implants given to Logan through the Weapon X Project  any or all of these memories are suspect  Logan has at least one memory of meeting Captain America in World War II while he was in the Canadian Army which has been verified as true  13  Wolverine s adamantium is removed by Magneto  Added by BTCS13 Magneto s Revenge During an encounter with Magneto on his space station called Avalon  Wolverine slashed Magneto with his claws  Magneto retaliated  using his powers of the magnetic field to tear the adamantium out of Wolverine s skeleton  causing extensive injuries  14  These injuries shorted out Wolverine s healing factor for a time  and Logan also discovered that the claws that he believed a result of the Weapon X program were in fact part of his actual bone structure due to his mutation  Around this time Professor Xavier  Beast  and Heather Hudson conducted experiments on Wolverine  These showed that Logan s mutation was actually ongoing  and whilst his healing factor and senses would accelerate it would also cost him his humanity  for it would slowly change him into a bestial  wild  animal like creature  It also turned out that the presence of the adamantium slowed his mutation process down  his healing factor treated it like a foreign substance in the body and tried constantly to expel it  Feral Fury  Added by Sasquatch1201 As a result of his injuries  Logan left the X Men for a time  He visited Muir Island at the request of Kitty Pryde  and was also attacked by Cyber  During the Phalanx invasion  Logan and Cable were asked by Prof  Charles Xavier to find and rescue the captured X Men  They joined with Cyclops and Jean Grey  returning from their honeymoon  and secretly the future   and freed their teammates in Tibet  Later  Logan was kidnapped by Tyler Dayspring  calling himself Genesis  who wanted to make Wolverine one of his new Horsemen  Genesis had acquired adamantium by destroying the body of the mercenary known as Cyber  and had planned to recreate the bonding process used on Logan years ago  This time  however  Logan s body rejected the adamantium  and he regressed for a time to a feral like state  Logan slowly regained his lucidity and rejoined the X Men  Wolverine as the third incarnation of Death  a Horseman of Apocalypse Added by Bjarni Horseman of Apocalypse Logan was subsequently kidnapped by the would be conqueror Apocalypse and forced to fight the savage assassin Sabretooth for the mantle of the Horseman Death  Knowing that he might be able to resist Apocalypse s programming and that Sabretooth would be a very dangerous villain with the support of Apocalypse  Logan fought and defeated his nemesis  As a result  his skeleton again was laced with Adamantium  Under the control of Apocalypse  Wolverine fought the X Men ferociously in his Death persona  But with the help of his teammates  he eventually broke free from Apocalypse s control  15  Weapon Plus Later on a mission with the X Men  Wolverine and Jean were lured onto a Weapon Plus satellite by the villain Xorn  Although Logan was able to access detailed files on his past  they realized it was a trap as it hurtled toward the sun  As the heat slowly began to intensify  Jean could no longer stand the pain and asked Logan to take her life with his claws  Obliging his love s last wish  Jean s death unlocked the power of the Pheonix  Thus empowered  Jean returned Wolverine and herself back to earth as Logan slowly healed  However  as the duo confronted Xorn alongside their fellow X Men  he injected Jean with a lethal electromagnetic pulse and she died in Cyclops arms  Wolverine greatly mourned Jean s loss and was not pleased with Cyclops  and Emma Frost s new relationship  but he has remained a valued member of the X Men  serving on as many missions as he can while also indulging in the occasional solo mission  Enemy of the State Wolverine was ambushed by The Hand and Hydra  Transformed into a killing machine and outfitted with several devices  he battled various other heroes  He stabbed both Hornet and Northstar  SHIELD was able to deprogram Logan  Wolverine with the New Avengers Added by Moshikal15 The New Avengers While on a mission in the Savage Land  he met the recently reformed Avengers and eventually accepted membership  As a result of the House of M  Wolverine regained all of his memories  finally being able to sort between what was true and implanted  He was last seen traveling to Japan in an attempt to come to terms with his past  He went to visit the Silver Samurai  who serves as a guard to the prime minister of Japan  Wolverine battled with Silver Samurai  cutting his hand in the process  Later  he visited the site of the original Weapon X program  which led to a clash with Captain America regarding a man named Bucky  who apparently killed Wolverine s wife  the Japanese Itsu  and unborn child  Bucky apologized to Wolverine  telling him that he was not in control of his actions at the time  Wolverine then began to reminisce about his wife  a Japanese woman named Itsu  and the events that led up to him meeting her  After WWII  but before he had been given his Adamantium skeleton by Weapon X  Wolverine trained under the martial arts master Ogun  After completing his training  Ogun sent Wolverine to a village where another master  Bando Saburo  taught men who had been made into weapons how to become men once more  There  Wolverine met Itsu and they fell in love  eventually marrying and conceiving a child together  Saburo s village was surrounded by mountains belonging to the demon sword smith Muramasa  After Bucky Winter Soldier s murder of Itsu  Wolverine  believing it was the people of the village who had killed his pregnant wife  pledged his allegiance to the demon  Muramasa boasted that he would make a sword in honor of Wolverine  one that could defeat even him  Through unknown means  Muramasa began the process  which Weapon X most likely completed  that made Wolverine into a living weapon  What followed remains unclear  but Wolverine apparently returned to North America where he met Silver Fox for the first time  It can then be gathered that following Silver Fox s murder  he was recruited by Team X and then given his adamantium skeleton by Weapon X  After remembering this  Wolverine went back to Muramasa s mountain and reclaimed the Muramasa Blade which belonged to him  Muramasa willingly gave the sword to Wolverine and told him to  wield it like an angry god   Currently  Wolverine wants revenge  and he now remembers who deserves his vengeance  Logan vs  Daken Added by Copycat989 After the destruction of Stamford by the supervillain Nitro  which started the Civil War  Wolverine went after Nitro himself  Although the X Men were neutral in this conflict  Wolverine

Leading X Force A new X Force consisting of Wolverine as team leader  Warpath  Wolfsbane and X 23 was born to take care of the dirty business the rest of the X Men wouldn t do normally  including murder  Their first mission involved infiltrating a North Dakota SHIELD facility to route out a group of Purifiers who had infiltrated the base and stolen valuable technology required to resurrect the Sentinel known as Bastion  In the planned raid Wolfsbane and X 23 disobeyed Wolverine s orders and entered ahead of the team and got Wolfsbane captured  Wolfsbane was later rescued but suffered from a seizure  The Return of Weapon X Logan s former Team X teammate  Maverick  contacted Logan to inform him that a private military contractor called Blackguard had got their hands on the old Weapon X files  including the recipe for synthesizing adamantium  and created a group of twelve mercenaries called Strikeforce X  an elite unite of men armed with healing factors  unbreakable skeletons and laser claws  Not only that  but they were being used to carry out atrocities in the name of Blackguard s corporate interests  With the help of reporter Melita Garner  Logan was able to expose Blackguard to the world and kill most of Strikeforce X  but the Chief Executive somehow managed to survive  What Logan didn t know was that Maverick was the man who stole the Weapon X files in the first place and sold them on the black market  In an effort to cover up his involvement in kick starting the Strikeforce X program from Wolverine  Maverick killed the man whom he sold the files to  Wolverine in his X Force uniform Added by Bogota X The Asylum Later  Wolverine found himself in Dunwitch Sanatorium in a foggy haze with a hospital full of misfits and few memories of a past that seemed to point to the fact that he was insane  A fellow patient warned him that the director  Dr  Rottwell  has a penchant for harvesting brains  which seemed to be proven out when  the very next day  Logan discovered that the patient has been lobotomized  16  Logan lost his identity in an insane asylum and Dr  Rottwell tried to get him to release the aggressive killer inside of him while still sublimating the rest of his past  A pair of mob goons came looking for someone to pull off a contract killing and Dr  Rottwell offers them Charlie Chainsaws from whom he has removed his hands and attached actual chainsaws  as Logan reached the end of his tolerance for abuse and torture  he finally popped his claws and took out an orderly while Rottwell looked on and smiled  17  Unable to warp Logan s mind into becoming a feral killer using conventional brainwashing  Dr  Rottwell decided to take the direct approach by cutting directly into his skull  When Rotwell kept wrecking blades on adamantium  he plugged Wolverine into his innovative God Brain machine to get some readings  Logan was able to make a mental cry for help to reporter Melita Garner  the very same journalist who helped him expose blackguard  before the machine takes full effect  18  Melita received the desperate psychic message from Wolverine and called in the X Men to help  Nightcrawler and Psylocke invaded Dunwitch Sanatorium and dismantled Rotwell s God Brain machine  The mob later showed up looking for their missing goons  with chaos abounding as the mob  the patients and the staff all try their best to kill each other  Logan took the opportunity to try and carve up Dr  Rottwell but finds his tormentor impossible to kill  Rottwell then escaped as Wolverine made his way to Melita to recuperate  19  As his relationship with Melita blossomed into something more  Logan received relationship advice from the women in his life  He tried to warn Melita away from him because of his lifestyle and his past history with women who end up dead but she simply replied that she can handle it  Mystique finds out about the affair  20  Wolverine Added by Artful Dodger The Terminators Wolverine took Steve

the Avengers during the Serpent s attacks on Midgard  first fighting the secret organization S T R I K E  that planned to destroy New York with an Atomic Bomb  and later  using one of the armors Tony Stark made with the mystical metal Uru and fighting the Worthy  Uncanny X Force After the Second Coming event  Cyclops ordered Wolverine to dissolve his X Force team  But Logan believed that his team was still necessary  so he formed a new X Force with Archangel  Psylocke  Fantomex  and Deadpool  During their first mission  they found Clan Akkaba who was indoctrinating a young Apocalypse  to resume his duties  Clan Akkaba was protecting Apocalypse with a new group of Horsemen  but X Force defeated them  While the rest of the group was still discussing the moral implications of killing a child  Fantomex shot the kid Apocalypse in the head  After this event  Angel lost control of his Archangel personality  and went on a killing spree  Trying to kill Apocalypse s influence on him  X

restart evolution  After a heavy battle between the forces of Archangel and X Force  Psylocke was able to stab Archangel with a different life seed  killing his alter ego  and saving Earth from the Age of Archangel  Schism The opinions of Wolverine and Cyclops diverge  Added by Drakolord7 When the return of Kid Omega set off a new wave of anti Mutant sentiment  Wolverine and Cyclops steadily grew divided  Wolverine wished to hand Quire over to Commander Steven Rogers  while Cyclops wished to deal with him within the mutant community  When a new Hellfire Club attacked and incapacitated the X Men at the opening of a Mutant History Museum Oya  whom Wolverine had taken a liking to  was the last one standing  As Logan tried to convince Idie to stay hidden Cyclops pressured her to act  leading to Idie killing a dozen men  Logan was enraged and blamed Cyclops  Eventually it got worse when Wolverine saw that the idea of Cyclops raising and training the teenage mutants as soldiers were only going to get them killed and after demolishing a Sentinel that was sent to destroy Utopia  Wolverine and a number of X Men quit the team and left with a number of the teenage mutants to return to their former home in New York with it clear that Cyclops has clearly crossed the line with his actions  Regenesis Wolverine founded the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning  spending all the fortune that he had amassed over the years upon it  On its first day it was assaulted by the new Hellfire Club  whom had been a major force in causing the Schism of the X Men 23   Wolverine made it clear that he didn t want lose none of the kids and fought as hard as he could against the Frankenstein Monsters whom Iceman defeated by making Ice clones of himself  Then  they were attacked by the Hellfire Club  that were in possesion of a spawn of the original Krakoa 24   Kid Omega who wanted to prove himself to Broo  Idie and Kid Gladiator who told him they never heard of him  reasoned with Krakoa who then joined Wolverine s X Men  Stay away from my School Added by Drakolord7 Wolverine with everyone in the school confronted the Hellfire club and he made it clear to them to stay away from his school  As the Hellfire club members were leaving  Krakoa almost attacked them but Logan stopped him as he had a better idea on how to deal with them  The next day Matt Murdock told Kade Kilgore that he was being sued by Wolverine for the sum of 879 million dollars for the damage he had done to the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and if he didn t pay they would take control of his company  As the school was being rebuilt  Logan was informed that Krakoa was glad they allowed him to stay and Logan found it good to have a school ground that could fight back 25   Personality Wolverine is a gruff loner who has a strong sense of personal honor  He also has a wild  animal like nature to him and a savage  or  berserker   rage which he tries to control  He is also perfectly at home in the wilderness  He is known as one of the most fearless  brave  and dangerous men in the world  stated by Steve Rogers  Wolverine has established himself quickly as the X Man most willing to permanently deal with their adversaries  He developed close friendships with his teammates Nightcrawler  whose personality diametrically opposed Wolverine s  and Colossus  who often performed the  fastball special  with him  He is something of a father figure to Natasha Romanoff  Shadowcat  Rogue  X 23  and Jubilee  He loved many women  including Rose  Itsu  Viper  Silver Fox  Phoenix  and Mariko  Only a few Wolverine truly trusts  which are Captain America and Jean Grey  Powers and AbilitiesEdit Powers Wolverine is a mutant who has been given an unbreakable skeleton from Weapon X Program and augmented by Apocalypse  Logan s healing factor keeps him alive Added by Dann Fonda Regenerative Healing Factor  Wolverine s primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process that enables him to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue with far greater efficiency than an ordinary human  Wolverine s accelerated healing powers have been commonly referred to as his mutant healing factor  The full extent and speed of Wolverine s healing factor isn t known  He has been shown to fully heal from numerous gunshot wounds 26   severe burns covering most of his body 27   and regenerate missing eyes 28  within a matter of seconds  Among the more extreme depictions of his accelerated healing factor involves him having his skin  muscles  and internal organs incinerated from his skeleton only to fully regenerate the tissue within minutes  Adamantium plays a crucial role in the speed of Wolverine s healing as well because of the fact that it produces a poison that his immune system fights off regularly  It is said that without the adamantium  his healing rate increases  29  This power even amends psychological wounds inflicted as a result of traumatic experiences  However  Wolverine s healing powers force his mind to suppress the memories  sometimes resulting in amnesia  Wolverine sometimes calls this his mental scar tissue  Wolverine healing factor has cured him from mystical curse of the Werewolf after he had been bitten and turned into a werewolf 30  and from vampirism 31   though it should be noted that the time it took to cure the Werewolf curse was longer than the time it took to cure him from vampirism  Foreign Chemical Immunity  Wolverine s natural healing also affords him the virtual immunity to poisons and most drugs  except in massive doses  For example  it is extremely difficult for him to become intoxicated from alcohol  Immunity To Disease  Wolverine s highly efficient immune system  which is part of his accelerated healing factor  renders him immune against all known Earthly diseases and infections  Logan uses his animal keen senses to track his target Added by ChaosTheory07 Superhumanly Acute Senses  Wolverine possesses superhumanly acute senses that are comparable to those of certain animals  He can see at far greater distances  with perfect clarity  than an ordinary human  He retains this same level of clarity even in near total darkness  His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner  allowing him to detect sounds ordinary humans couldn t hear at a greater distances  enough to hear a teardrop in another room that have thick walls with enough focus  He is able to recognize people and objects by scent  even if they are well hidden  He can track a target by scent  even if the scent has been greatly eroded by time and weather factors  with an extraordinary degree of success  Wolverine can also use his keen sense of smell to detect lies due to chemical changes within a person s scent  These senses stem from  at least partially  his constant cellular regeneration  as are his enhanced physical capabilities  Superhuman Strength  Wolverine s mutant healing factor enables him to push his muscles beyond the natural limits of the human body without injury  granting him some degree of superhuman strength  His natural strength is augmented by the demand placed on his musculature due to the presence of over 100 pounds of Adamantium bonded to his skeleton  which also removes the natural limitations of the human skeletal structure by allowing him to lift weights that would damage a human skeleton  Wolverine has been depicted with sufficient strength to break steel chains 32  33   support the weight of a dozen men with one arm 34  and lift the 955 lb Ursa Major over his head before tossing him across a room  35  Wolverine s strength is enough to allow him to press somewhere in excess of 800 lbs but no more than 2 tons  Superhuman Stamina  Wolverine s mutant healing factor grants him high immunity against lactic acid and other fatigue toxins generated by his muscles during physical activity  Wolverine can sustain himself at peak capacity for several days  Wolverine has shown himself capable of fighting Arkady Rossovich  Omega Red  for over 24 hours  despite regular exposure to Omega Red s death spores  36   His lung capacity is at peak human level enabling him to hold breath for 6 minutes under water  making his lungs as healthy as human s lungs can get  Wolverine vs Cyclops Added by Captain america360 Superhuman Agility  Wolverine s agility  balance and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels far beyond the natural physical limits and capabilities of the finest human specimen  Wolverine s agility is sufficient to allow him to dodge multiple bullets and Scott Summers   Cyclops  optic blasts at near point blank range  Other times  able to jump extremely high and evade several yards Sample  Wolverine  Added by Captain america360 Superhuman Reflexes  Wolverine s reflexes are similarly enhanced  they are also superior to those possessed by the finest human specimen and are equal to the likes of Steve Rogers   Captain America  due to his superhumanly acute senses  although most of the time he relies highly on his regenerative healing factor  Insulated Weather Adaptation  Wolverine s body is highly resistant to certain elemental extremes  particularly cold  to the extent that he can sleep nude in subarctic conditions with no apparent injury  Delayed Aging  In addition  Wolverine s healing factor provides him with an extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process  Wolverine was born sometime during the late 19th Century  37  Although well over 100 years of age  Wolverine retains the health  appearance and physical vitality of a man in the physical prime of his life  Animal Empathy  Wolverine has the ability to sense the emotional state of animals on a basic level such as fear  anger  happiness or pain  He can even communicate with them to make the animal aware of his actions and or his intent  Logan brandishes his claws Added by Sasquatch1201 Bone Claws  Wolverine s skeleton includes six retractable 12 inch long bone claws  three in each arm  that are housed beneath the skin and muscle of his forearms  Wolverine can  at will  release these slightly curved claws through his skin beneath the knuckles on each hand  The skin between the knuckles tears and bleeds  but the blood loss is quickly halted by his healing factor  Wolverine can unsheathe any number of his claws at once  although he must keep his wrists straight at the moment his claws pass from his forearms into his hands  When unsheathed  the claws are entirely within his hands  allowing him to bend his wrists when they are extended  The claws are made of bone  unlike the claws of normal mammals which are made of keratin  and were originally believed to be bionic adamantium implants  Like his son Daken  the bone claws are sharp and dense enough to slice through substances as durable as most metals  wood  and stone  Psionic Resistance  Wolverine reveals that his mind is highly resistant to telepathic probing and assault due to the high level psionic shields implanted in his mind by Professor Charles Xavier  38  Power Grids Official Ratings 39  Intelligence  2 Strength 4  Speed  2 Durability 4  Energy Projection  1 Fighting Skills 7  Fan Ratings Intelligence 4  Strength 4  Speed  2 Durability 6  Energy Projection  1 Fighting Skills 7  Abilities Master Tactician  Though seemingly brutish  Wolverine is highly intelligent  When Forge monitored Wolverine s vitals during a Danger Room training session  he reported Logan s physical and mental state as  equivalent to an Olympic level gymnast performing a Gold medal winning routine whilst simultaneously beating four chess computers in his head   40  which gives something of an idea of the level of sophistication and tactical processing Logan is capable of utilizing while in combat  He remembers Ogun teaching him Sun Tzu s The Art of War  Master Martial Artist  Due to his extensive training as a soldier  a CIA operative  a samurai and a member of the X Men  Logan is an exceptional martial artist and has mastered all areas of combat including hand to hand and various weapons  His extraordinary hand to hand combat ability makes him one of the finest combatants on Earth  Expert Marksman  He is an expert marksman skilled in throwing weapons and firearms  but operates more efficiently without them  Expert Swordsman  Logan is proficient in Japanese sword fighting having studied under Ogun  Skilled Acrobat  He is skilled in gymnastics  acrobatics and aerials  but is not on the same scale as others fighters like Captain America and Daredevil  Advanced Covert Ops Expert  Due to his experience traveling the world and working for various government agencies  Wolverine is also a trained expert in multiple types of weapons  vehicles  computer systems  explosives  and assassination techniques  In the Weapon X comic he said  I can put six shots into a quarter    an  get change for the gum machine  Skilled Mechanic  Along with Kurt Wagner  Nightcrawler   Wolverine has also been the mechanic of the X Men s Blackbird jet for a long time  Multi lingual  A polyglot  Wolverine is fluent in many languages including English  Arabic  Japanese  Russian  Chinese  Cheyenne  Lakota  and Spanish  he has some knowledge of French  German  Thai  Vietnamese  and Portuguese  Ogun taught him Japanese ideograms  With his increased lifespan and journeys across the globe  he has been able to amass an intimate knowledge of many foreign customs and cultures  Once he saw a kabuki play of The 47 Ronin  Genroku Ch shingura  and remarked how it was one of the finest kabuki troupes he had seen  His exploits have further endowed him with vast awareness of literature and philosophy Strength level As a result of Wolverine s constant cellular regeneration and the additional weight and tensile strength of his skeleton he has some degree of superhuman strength enabling him to press somewhere in excess of 800 lbs but not more than 2 tons and he is able to place this strength in his strikes  The latest official handbook entry says that Wolverine is capable of lifting in excess of 800 lbs for brief periods due to his adamantium skeleton  41 Weaknesses Muramasa Blade  Wolverine s only specific vulnerability known to date  Created by having his soul infused into the katana  the efficiency of his mutant healing factor is decreased dramatically if he sustains injury from the Muramasa Blade  Wolverine has been wounded once with the blade 42  and  though the injury was very minor  it did not heal completely for 2 days  43  Carbonadium Digestion  Wolverine s healing factor is also affected  though to a far less degree  if he ingests Carbonadium  Wolverine s only other  weakness  is the fact that his heightened senses can be taken advantage of  For instance  when he was fighting the Bruce Banner  Hulk   he was nearly killed by the Hulk s thunder claps due to his heightened sense of hearing  Decapitation Severe Spinal Damage  Professor X once stated that Wolverine could be killed if his head becomes separated from his body  causing his brain the inability to send signals to the section s  of his body that needs healing  But because of the addition of his adamantium laced skeleton  the idea seems very unlikely  44  Adamantium Poisoning  Adamantium has proven to secrete poison which stunts Wolverine s healing factor and feral rage by a very small degree  Even though he has it laced throughout his entire body it has not made a significant change in his abilities  However  the poisoning will endanger Wolverine s life if his healing factor fails on him  such as when an inhibitor field cancels out his mutant powers  Adamantium Allotropes  Adamantium has thirteen different allotropes  variants  that are very unstable compared to adamantium because of their different molecular configurations and thus physical properties  Some have caused Wolverine to become dizzy or weak just by being in close contact with these adamantium specimens  ParaphernaliaEdit Equipment As Death  Logan was given an armor to wear to conceal his true identity  Normally he wears a standard X Men uniform or street clothes  His gloves often have grooves in the forearm so they do not tear when he unsheathes his claws  The best at what he does Added by Vaderlives Adamantium Laced Skeleton  Not part of Wolverine s natural mutant attributes  Wolverine s entire skeleton  including his bone claws  are laced with the rare  artificial  and virtually indestructible alloy known as adamantium or True Adamantium  As a result  Wolverine s bones are virtually unbreakable  The presence of the Adamantium has further enhanced the already razor sharp edge of Wolverine s bone claws  Aside from being practically indestructible  the claws are capable of cutting any solid material  with the known exception of True Adamantium and Proto Admantium  Captain America s Shield   However  Wolverine s ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon the thickness of the substance and the amount of force he can exert  The Adamantium also weights his blows  dramatically increasing the effectiveness of his punches and kicks  Adamantium Beta  The only known occurrence of Adamantium Beta was during the Weapon X Project  By the second part of the procedure when they laced his bones with Adamantium there was a reaction with his healing factor that bonded metal and bone  As a result the Adamantium  heals  just as his bones do Transportation Various motorcycles  X Men Blackbird  Gateway  formerly Gateway  X Men Stratojet  Professor Xavier s Rolls RoyceWeapons Throughout his life  Wolverine has used a variety of bladed weapons  most frequently daggers and  at times  swords  as a samurai  he is especially skilled with the katana  He has also wielded many different types of firearms throughout his careers as a soldier  a mercenary  and a spy  While he is highly skilled with firearms and becasue of his perfect eyesight it is very difficult for him miss when firing a gun  he has stated on multiple occasions that he isn t fond of them and prefers to use bladed weapons  He had been shortly carrying the Muramasa  but  in Wolverine  Origins  4  he passed it to Cyclops  so he could use it against him  should there be no other way of stopping Logan  Later it was stolen by Wolverine s son  Daken and laced to the underside of his two wrist s bone claws  similar to his father s bonding process  by Phineas Mason  Tinkerer   NotesEdit Enemies Wolverine s most prolific enemies  nemesis  and enemy organizations include Sabretooth  Roughouse  Apocalypse  Zachariah Ravenscraft  Bloodscream   Silas Burr  Cyber   Damage Control  Sentinels  Silver Samurai  Dark Riders  Wade Wilson  Deadpool   Tyler Dayspring  Genesis   The Hand  The Hellfire Club  Hulk  HYDRA  Yuriko Oyama  Lady Deathstrike   Magneto  Mister X  Robert Hunter  Nitro   Ogun  Viper  Weapon X  Team   Omega Red  Wendigo  Frank Castle  Punisher   Rapture  Reavers and Romulus  Relationships Logan s love interests include  but are not limited to Atsuko  Mariko Yashida  Silverfox  Itsu  Rose  Jean Grey Summers  Phoenix   even though the interest was unreciprocated   Ororo Munroe  Storm   Felicia Hardy  Black Cat   Elektra Natchios  Rogue  Native  Seraph  Yukio  Doreen Green  Squirrel Girl   Alison Blaire  Dazzler   Jean Grey  Earth 295  and even X Men foe Raven Darkholme  Mystique   However  Itsu Akihiro and Ophelia Sarkissian  Viper  were the only women he ever actually married  TriviaEdit While Wolverine has slain many henchmen  and even a few of his own super powered rogues  he has only ever killed two superheroes  Jean Paul Beaubier  Northstar  45  and the Ed McDonough  Hornet   46  The former was eventually ressurrected  In the 2007 Transformers movie  a scratched wall makes someone say  Freddy Krueger ruined the place   Then  Glen Whitmann  Anthony Anderson   said   Freddy Krueger had four claws  and it s three  It s Wolverine      Wolverine would later interact with Transformers in New Avengers Transformers 1  Work in adamantium bonding was also done by American scientist Dr  Ronald Rankin  whose son Calvin would  years later  develop superhuman powers and become known as the Calvin Rankin  Mimic   Whether or not Rankin was directly involved in the experiment upon Logan is unknown  Years later  upon being confronted by his fellow X Man  Warren Worthington  Archangel   after the latter has been surgically altered by the immortal mutant En Sabah Nur  Apocalypse   Logan sensed something  familiar   pain  in Archangel s scent  suggesting that technology created by Apocalypse was also involved in Logan s own transformation  curiously  Logan sensed no such familiarity when visiting a lair of Apocalypse himself  and a later allegation that Apocalypse was directly responsible for Wolverine s transformation appears to be misinformation  At this time the Weapon X Program is supposedly a joint US Canadian operation  although some evidence indicates that it is being manipulated by an outside source  apparently the same individual who chose Logan as a subject  Wolverine was rumored to originally intended to be a real wolverine  artificially evolved by the Herbert Wyndham  High Evolutionary   However  in 1976  Marvel rushed the character Jessica Drew  Spider Woman  into publication  and unable to come up with an origin in such a short time  used the origin they d put aside for Wolverine  with the animal changed to a spider  obviously   This left Wolverine without an origin story for a number of years  The idea was later thrown out with the creators saying  we are interested in stories about humans  not evolved animals   Wolverine was intended to be a teenager by co creator Len Wein but that idea was dropped  It was originally intended for Wolverine s Adamantium claws to be part of his gloves rather than part of his body  During his first full appearance in Incredible Hulk  181  the claws were shown as flat  straight  double edged blades that were never extracted or retracted  This idea was changed by Chris Claremont because he felt that by not having the claws as part of his anatomy  then anyone could be Wolverine by simply putting on the gloves  During Wolverine s first appearance  in Incredible Hulk vol  1  181  Wolverine s height it said to be 5 5   Wolverine s height is later retconned to 5 3  in his first writeup in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1  13  Wolverine made a cameo appearance in the pages of DC s JLA  1  In the scene  Wolverine and Victor von Doom  Doctor Doom  are executed by a super villain team known as the Hyperclan  Click here to see the image  In the 1994 video game Wolverine  Adamantium Rage  Wolverine s height is incorrectly listed at 5 7  in a brief character bio the game provides for the primary characters  A version of Wolverine appears in every X Men Cartoon and Video Game ever made  Marvel had a large number of fans in Canada and thought it would be a smart decision to create the first Canadian hero for Marvel  Thus the basis for Wolverine was created  Wolverine carries a medical card stating that he is a war veteran who has had metal implants to help when at metal detectors in airports  In the comic magazine   Wizard   of their top 200 heroes  Wolverine was number 1  In New X Men Vol 1 148  Wolverine tells Jean Grey that he once survived for six months under a glacier by eating strips of his own arm  with the healing factor re growing it back   Wolverine was once captured by S H I E L D and imprisoned in  The Cage   His prisoner number was  412075  LinksEdit 2 478 Appearances of Wolverine  James  Logan  Howlett  1 519 Images featuring Wolverine  James  Logan  Howlett  162 Quotations
