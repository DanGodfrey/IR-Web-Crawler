New York  to William Robert Drake and Madeline Beatrice Bass Drake  Bobby s powers first manifest when he is on a date with Judy Harmon  and a local bully by the name of Rocky Beasely tries to take Judy away for himself  Knowing Judy cannot put up a good fight  Bobby points his hand at Beasely and encases him in a block of ice  Later  the local townspeople  having heard of the incident  come looking for him in the form of an angry mob  The local sheriff has no choice but to put Bobby in jail for his own  protection   While Bobby sits in his cell at the sheriff station  the outer wall is blown open  and a man named Scott Summers  Cyclops  walks in and offers to take Bobby with him  After Bobby turns him down  the two mutants get into a short battle  which is soon ended by Professor Charles Xavier  After Xavier has sat down and talked with Bobby and his parents  Bobby s parents suggest that he go with Professor Xavier to his  school for gifted youngsters   Bobby takes the suggestion and leaves with Professor Xavier and Cyclops to become the second member of the X Men  He is later joined by Henry  Hank  McCoy  Jean Grey  and Warren Worthington III as the founding members of the X Men  Iceman quickly befriends Hank McCoy  Beast   and the two serve as comic relief for the team  Drake  however  remains self conscious regarding the fact that he is the youngest member of the group  Appearing in his original snow covered form  he first battles Magneto along with the rest of the team  1  and later the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  2  Bobby Drake s first girlfriend is Zelda  3  Not long after  he takes on a new ice covered form  4  He then teams with the Human Torch for the first time  5  The two would become close friends as time went on  With the X Men  he visits the Savage Land and meets Ka Zar for the first time  6  He then battles the Juggernaut  7  and is badly injured in his first battle against the Sentinels  8  He next battles Magneto by

Factor The original X Men  including Iceman  reunite to form the superhero team X Factor  22  With this new team  he encounters Apocalypse for the first time  23  During his time with the team  the Asgardian trickster god Loki captures Bobby  hoping to use him to gain control over the Frost Giants  Loki enhances Bobby s powers and then extracts them to restore the size of the Frost Giants  Iceman is rescued by Thor  24  Loki s tampering increases Bobby s powers to such an extent that he begins to lose control of his abilities  During a later battle with the Right  he is fitted with a power dampening belt which actually helps him control his abilities  Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice  Bobby finds he can encase the entirety of the Empire State Building  With time  Bobby gains sufficient control over his augmented powers that he is able to stop using the inhibitor belt  Believing he has achieved his full potential  Bobby does not attempt to develop his abilities further  With X Factor  Bobby then defeats Apocalypse s Horsemen  25  Iceman helps watch over many of the younger superheroes  something he once was  Most notably  he and Beast help Boom Boom gain a more normal life  For a brief while  he also helps supervise the New Mutants and their sister team  the X Terminators  They  in turn  save him from the deadly kiss of Infectia  26  Bobby also develops a romantic relationship with Opal Tanaka  After a session of ice sledding  she discovers threatening mail in her mailbox  a precursor to harassment by her cybernetically enhanced relatives of the Tatsu Clan of the Yakuza  something Bobby helps her out with  27  After the Muir Island Saga  Iceman rejoins the X Men along with the rest of X Factor  28   edit  Back with the X Men When he rejoined the X Men it seemed that he learned to control his powers and no longer needed the inhibitor belt  this made him believed he reached the limit of his powers  29  The X Men were separated into two groups  Iceman was placed in the gold team  led by Storm  along with fellow original X Men Jean Grey  now sans codename  and Archangel  30  One day he took Opal to eat with his parents  however his dad began humiliating her because of her Japanese heritage  As things were not bad enough  they are attacked by the Cyber Samurai once again  which only added to William Drake s prejudices about the girl  31  The fight eventually ends when Hiro who   sacrificed himself in order to save Opal and Bobby  but their relationship was never the same again after this  32  When Bobby came across Mikhail Rasputin he used his mutant abilities on him  Bobby discovered that his potential was still far from being reached as he converted his body into ice  not just covered by it  33  By turning his entire body to ice  instead of just wearing an icy exterior  Bobby now was capable of using his power in new  aggressive ways  adding spikes and padding to his ice structure  34  Too busy with the many threats that the X Men faced every day  Bobby let his relationship with Opal deteriorate and  when they finally saw each other again after weeks  it was only to save her from an attack by mutant haters  Annoyed that she could only gain his attention by nearly getting killed  Opal broke off their relationship  35  Later  as he was checking on Emma Frost who was in a comatose state after the mutant Trevor Fitzroy unleashed the mutant hunting Sentinels on Emma Frost and her students known as the Hellions  the mansion was hit by an electricity breakdown  36  Emma woke up disoriented  possesses Bobby s mind and used his powers in ways Bobby never had  she froze an entire river and traveled through water  She was looking for her pupils but after finding out they were dead  she left Bobby s body  37  Bobby invites Rogue to tag along on a visit to his parents  Wrongly assuming a romantic relation  his father disapproves of Rogue  verbally attacking them with the same prejudices he expressed with Opal  This time  Bobby had enough and left after telling his father that he should just accept the fact that he is a mutant and he would never fit the definition he has of normal  He was upset that Emma exhibited greater control of his powers than he had  Since Rogue was having problems with Gambit  the two of them go on a road trip to ease their minds  38  During the Legion Quest  Iceman was one of the X Men who goes back in time to stop Legion from killing Magneto  They succeed  but only partially  Legion does not kill Magneto  but instead accidentally murdered Xavier  his own father  years before Legion had been conceived much less born  This paradox caused the events of the Age of Apocalypse  At the last moment before the original reality ended  Iceman s fellow X Men  Rogue and Gambit shared a kiss  When reality resumed  Rogue s mind absorbing touch renders Gambit comatose  Having absorbed some secret haunting memories  she needs to get away from the X Men and Iceman volunteers to join her on a road trip  though at the same time he was starting to see visions of Emma Frost  When Gambit awoke from his coma  he tracked them down and confronted Rogue about what she saw in his mind  She broke off their relationship officially and left for good  Iceman and Gambit returned to the X Men  39  When the entity known as Onslaught first appeared  Iceman was chosen as one of his test subjects  along with Storm  Cyclops and Wolverine  They were pitted against a servant of Onslaught named Post  in a specific battle area of harsh environment to test the extent of their abilities  They won and were returned to the mansion  However  Iceman s chest had been shattered in his iceform during battle  making it impossible to change back to human form  40  He confronted Emma Frost and demanded to know what she did to his powers in his body and how to save himself  She refused to help since she knew that Bobby would have to do it himself  When he captured her with his ice powers  she telepathically showed him his insecurities  By confronting Opal and his father in her simulation  Iceman realized that Emma was right and managed to transform back to his human body with his chest fully intact  41  When Graydon Creed was running for President  with a heavy anti mutant campaign  Bobby was chosen to infiltrate in the campaign  his father stand out in a crowd and spoke in favor of the mutants  this came as a surprise to Bobby  His father connection with Bobby was discovered  so the people that worked for Graydon captured him and almost beat him up to death  Bobby decided to stay away from the X Men for a while to be with his dad  42  Zero Tolerance came across and Bobby found and helped Cecilia Reyes who was trying to keep a secret that she was a mutant  they also joined with Charlotte Jones and the morlock Marrow  after Bastion was defeated he took Cecilia and Marrow to the mansion  and soon left the X Men again for a while to be with his parents  43  Much later  the X Men found evidence in one of Destiny s journals of a group known as the Twelve  including Xavier  Magneto  Cyclops  Phoenix  Iceman  Polaris  Storm  Cable  Bishop  Sunfire  Mikhail Rasputin and the Living Monolith  They also learned that the Apocalypse s Horsemen had been kidnapping these mutants from around the globe  Iceman was captured in the woods near his home by Deathbird  who had become the Horseman War  44  Gathering the remaining Twelve  the X Men traveled to Egypt and confronted Apocalypse and the Skrulls  Apocalypse and his forces captured all of the Twelve during the battle  using them in a ritual to give the Chaos Bringer a new body and incredible power  Magneto and Polaris created opposite magnetic polarities  Iceman  Storm  and Sunfire provided elemental extremes  Cyclops  Phoenix  and Cable gave the sheer power of family  Xavier represented the power of mind and Bishop and Mikhail stood for time and space  while the Monolith linked all their energies together  Nate Grey was to be Apocalypse s new host  a powerhouse to store his massive lifeforce  The Twelve managed to free themselves and Cyclops sacrificed his own body and lifeforce to keep Apocalypse from getting Nate  Though the new Apocalypse was defeated  Cyclops seemed lost forever  45  Following that incident  Iceman helped the Beast to secretly enter Genosha  as he wanted to study the legacy infected mutates  However  when the High Evolutionary released his anti mutation wave  they were trapped in the war ravaged country  With the aid of Magneto  they escaped and joined forces with the rest of the scattered X Men  They raided the Evolutionary s satellite  disabled the mutation field and defeated Sinister  who had been manipulating the Evolutionary  46  47  48  Iceman was recruited by the living ship Prosh  along with other mutants  like Jean Grey  Mystique  Toad and Juggernaut  their mission was to preserve evolution and save it  in this journey Iceman developed his powers even further  this made him to not be afraid anymore of the natural course of his powers and returned to the X Men  49  He joined a new team of X Men  consisting of Angel  Nightcrawler  Wolverine and Chamber  he was using his powers in a whole new way now  he was just channeling it and not turning his body into ice  50   edit  Second Mutation During a heated battle with a recently evolved Black Tom  he received a chest wound  After returning to normal his chest did not fully recover and some parts of it remained icy  he was unable to return them to normal  he became afraid of it and it made him gain a new attitude in life  even rude at some times  51  Nobody seemed to realize it at the time  but evidently this was an early sign of Iceman undergoing a secondary mutation of his own  When he repeatedly tried to evade his regular medical check ups  school nurse Annie Ghazikhanian recognized that something odd was going on with him and pressured him to show her the wound  Bobby made her promise not to tell anyone and showed her that parts of his chest are now made of ice and he is unable to change them back to flesh and blood  Iceman wonders if he will entirely turn into ice on a permanent basis  52  He developed an attitude that  to some of the newer addition to the X Men  like Stacy X  Juggernaut and Northstar  he comes across as rather arrogant  denouncing their status as team members  as they have not been around as long as he  Iceman even went as far as offending Nightcrawler by claiming that only the original five  and no one else  has the right to call themselves an X Man  53  Bobby was further frustrated when Havok and Polaris announced their imminent wedding  him having carried a torch for Lorna for quite some time  In his frustration he turned to Annie  who had problems with the wedding too  as she was secretly in love with Havok  The nurse surprised him with the accusation of him being a racist   feeling comfortable as a mutant who could pass like a human when needed  opposed to being a fully obvious mutant or a  mere  human  His secondary mutation kicking in  though  Iceman was in danger of losing this status  Shocked by the truth of her words  Bobby fully opened up about his fears  that as a man fully made of ice he could never feel the warmth of a physical relationship again  Touched  Annie allowed him to kiss her  but when Havok called off the wedding  wanting to be with Annie instead  she quickly dumped Bobby  54  Upon encountering Azazel and his followers  Iceman s body is shattered from the neck down  Afterward  he regains his entire ice form  but cannot change back to his human appearance  As a result  Bobby becomes both bitter and despondent because of this drastic change  55  Later as Havok decided to break the marriage and started a relation with nurse Annie  she immediately left Bobby  and him and Lorna began a relation that did not last  volume  amp  issue

while being held at gunpoint by the Leper Queen  Emma Frost  pushes  something in Bobby s mind that forces him to turn to ice  Further examination reveals that Drake had not lost his powers  but rather had unconsciously repressed them on his own  After this  Bobby is once again able to revert from ice to flesh  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Rogue s Team Iceman joins Rogue s team after she tells him that she wants him as a member  Their first mission as a team is to fight a new threat  a powerful group known as the Children of the Vault  56  The team is successful and during this time  Bobby learns that he can be completely destroyed but then pull himself back together again  It was shown several times during the arc  The next mission for the team was to locate a man called Pandemic and defeat him  The team was again successful  but Rogue was infected with a virus called Strain 88  Cable took the team  including Bobby  to his island so Rogue could get treatment  volume  amp  issue needed  While on Cable s island  the team and Iceman began working to defeat the Shi ar weapon known as the Hecatomb  During the chaos  he shared a passionate kiss with Mystique  57  Even as he did so  he saved many lives by containing the explosion of the Conquistador  and  later  the Hecatomb itself  58   edit  Blinded by the Light As the team recovers from Hecatomb attack in Rogue s childhood home  it appears that Mystique and Iceman begin a romantic relationship  59  This was a front  however  as Mystique was using Iceman and the X Men as a Marauder spy for Mister Sinister  60  Marauders soon infiltrated the house  they attempt to gain access to Destiny s Diaries on the order of Mr  Sinister  who has been gathering information about the future from anybody and anything that could foretell the future   Bobby and Cannonball escape from the Marauders in the X Jet  with help from Emma Frost  They are pursued by Sunfire  they manage to get the better of him and take him prisoner  but not before he manages to cripple the jet  While Sunfire is unconscious  Iceman and Sam discuss the Mauraders  plan to eliminate all precognitive mutants and anyone with knowledge of the future as well as retrieving Destiny s Diaries before the Marauders can  During this time  Bobby displayed sub atomic control of energy transfers when he prevented Sunfire from using his fire based powers  61  Cannonball and Bobby  telepathically prompted by Emma Frost  attempt to recover the diaries which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery  Mr  Sinister uses the reverse engineered version of Xavier s Cerebro to track the pair of X Men to the brewery  The Marauders attack Cannonball and Iceman and overtake them  Bobby  while in his ice form  suffers a gunshot wound from Mystique  which severs one of his arms above the elbow  Mister Sinister  who takes Cannonball prisoner  attempts to telepathically erase his mind so that the X Men will find him as an empty shell  Iceman attacks Sinister  distracting him  which allows both of the X Men to escape  62   edit  Messiah Complex Main article  X Men  Messiah Complex The New X Men team decided to raid the headquarters of the

Sentinels  With the help of Dust and X 23  the X Men were able to survive this battle but the nano Sentinel infected human escaped  64  Soon  Iceman participated in the final battle against the Marauders  the Acolytes  and Predator X  He was one of the X Men who came running in to fight Predator X after it swallowed Wolverine whole  Unfortunately  he also witnessed his mentor  Professor Xavier   killed  by Bishop s bullet that was not meant for him  65   edit  Manifest Destiny Main article  X Men  Manifest Destiny According to writer Mike Carey   the events leading up to Messiah Complex   when Iceman  got blindsided by Mystique  are  still preying on  Iceman  to a large extent  and  some of those events  will be revisited   Bobby is questioning his role as a member of the X Men and contemplating his trip west to San Francisco  but he s not entirely sure what his next move is going to be   66   Carey s Iceman story in Manifest Destiny takes place before the recent  Uncanny X Men  arc that saw Iceman arrive in San Francisco  and follows Iceman as he travels west on a cross country trip to the X Men s new home   66  Bobby was having problems controlling his powers once again  so he decided to visit Opal Tanaka  his ex girlfriend  Opal advised him to call Beast and ask him about it  Beast said that it may be the neural inhibitor toxins that Mystique used on him months ago  but only by running tests on Bobby  Beast could have a straight answer  When he entered a plane with Opal a bomb detonates  and Opal reveals herself as Mystique  Iceman subsequently asked if she did so to mess with his head and she replies  No lover  your melting point   She shoots him out of the plane  67  Mystique followed him to the hospital and injected him with more neural inhibitor  this time enough to kill him  Bobby managed to find a way to use his powers to counter the effect of the toxins and he rose  good as new   When he confronted her again  they exchanged a

to radically decrease the temperature of ambient water vapor in his immediate environment  thereby freezing it into ice  He is able to make unbreakable ice that will not break unless he wills it to break  In this manner he is able to quickly form a great variety of ice structures  including projectiles  shields  ladders  baseball bats  etc  He often makes ice slides which form rapidly beneath and behind his feet  moving him along the slick surface at high speeds  He is also able to form exceedingly complicated structures within relative short time like  for example  miniature cities  38  Originally  Iceman s own body temperature would lower dramatically when his powers were active  reaching  105  F   76  C  within a few tenths of a second  now his body usually converts to organic ice  see below   Iceman is immune to sub zero temperatures  he is also able to perceive the thermal energy level of objects around him  Because cold is the absence of heat  Iceman does not actually  emanate  cold  rather  he decreases thermal energy  As mentioned by writer Mike Carey  Iceman is  an Omega level mutant    and  has powers that can influence the ecosystem of the entire world   66  In his early appearances  Iceman generally covered his body in a thick layer of what appeared to be snow  hence he looked more like a traditional snowman than an ice man  Upon further training in the use of his powers  he was able to fashion an armor of solid ice around his body when using his powers  which afforded him some degree of protection against concussive force and projectiles  Later on  he manifested the ability to convert the tissue of his body into organic ice  He sometimes augments his organic ice form with razor sharp adornments to his shoulders  elbows  knees  and fists  Iceman has also been able to move rapidly to another distant location while in his organic ice form  being able to deposit his bodily mass into a river and reconstitute his entire mass a great distance away in a matter of minutes  by temporarily merging his molecules with those of the river   On one occasion  Iceman suffered a severe chest injury while in his ice form and was able to heal himself by converting back into his normal human form  volume  amp  issue needed  Iceman is also able to reconstitute his organic ice form if any part of it is damaged  or even if it is completely shattered  without permanently harming himself  He can temporarily add the mass of a body of water to his own  increasing his mass  size  and strength  He can survive not only as ice  but as liquid water and water vapor  He can also transform his body from a gaseous state back to a solid  although it is physically and mentally taxing  57  78  Iceman can also freeze sea water  as seen during the  Operation Zero Tolerance  story arc  While he usually does not use his powers in lethal ways his powers are so vast that it extends to the molecular level  to the point that he can freeze all of the molecules of an object being with a thought  he once froze every single molecule of water within the body of David Haller  79  Iceman is also able to dissolve his own icy constructs  38  Iceman s powers were pushed to their limit while possessed by Emma Frost  who used Iceman to discover the fate of her Hellions  During this time Iceman was able to control all forms of moisture  freeze fluids inside people s bodies  travel as a liquid  solid or gas  Not even the combined might of the X Men Gold team was able to stop Emma Frost in Iceman s body  80  Following this Bobby confronted Emma about how she was able to use his powers so effectively and while together they make some initial progress but she refuses to train him  41  Instead he turns to Storm because they share similar elemental powers and she agrees to tutor him  81  When Iceman was injected with Sinister s neuro inhibiter by Mystique  he was able to save himself by drawing in all of the ambient moisture around him  rapidly replacing his poisoned cells with healthy material before the injection could kill him  82  Aside from his superhuman powers  Iceman is also a fair hand to hand combatant  and received combat training at Xavier s School as well as coaching from the Black Widow and Hercules while serving with the Champions of Los Angeles  Iceman has as much combat training as Cyclops or Beast  66   edit  Characterization  edit  Personality According to writer Mike Carey  one of Iceman s best personality traits is that emotionally Bobby Drake is like the ice he manipulates    not cold but transparent   He s devastatingly honest  He is very up front with his emotions and his thoughts all the time    66   Also  he s obviously incredibly brave both in terms of facing external  physical danger as well as facing up to unpleasant situations and admitting his own mistakes   66  This emotional honesty can often complicate matters for Bobby  especially in matters of love  Bobby is sometimes looked at as being immature by his teammates  as well as outsiders   edit  Friendships and relationships This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding

is often well liked by his teammates  his moodiness and occasional insecurities sometimes push them away  Currently  Bobby s best friends among the X Men include Angel  Cannonball  and Rogue  Outside of the X Men  he is good friends with Spider Man for their shared sense of humor  He is also close friends with the Human Torch as their personalities complement each other and their respective powers are polar opposites  Originally  the Iceman Beast friendship was one of the cornerstones of the X Universe  but has recently been ignored by writers  With the other two original X Men  Cyclops and Phoenix  Bobby has a little brother big brother sister relationship  with the latter being much more pleasant  Bobby is fiercely protective of those he considers friends  going as far as to threaten to kill his teammate Northstar for leaving Angel in a potentially dangerous situation  keeping constant vigil by Cannonball s bedside while Sam recovered from his injury from Sinister  and engaging in physical confrontation with Cyclops for questioning Rogue s judgment as a team leader  Despite Iceman s often well liked personality  he has always seemed unable to maintain any sort of long time relationships  with one exception being Opal  although that too ended  Iceman also had strong feelings for his fellow X Man Polaris  but she did not return those feelings  due to her feelings towards Havok instead  Northstar formed an unrequited crush for Iceman during their time on the same team  though Iceman never did find out about Northstar s feelings  52  Iceman also began a brief relationship with the Xavier School s nurse  Annie  however she ended up leaving him for Havok  who had just left Polaris at the altar  54  When Iceman attempted to rekindle his relationship with Polaris  that too ended abruptly and Polaris returned to Havok  55  Iceman s latest attempt at romance was with the X Men s enemy Mystique  who later betrayed him  Oddly enough however  she still seemed fixated on him  stating that she will either kill him or cure him of his personal uncertainty  83   edit  Physical appearance Iceman s appearance while in ice form has changed significantly over the years  In the early X Men stories  his appearance is more reminiscent of a snowman  The explanation given is that frost formed on his skin when he used his abilities  At the prompting of team leader Cyclops  Drake learns to cover his body with hardened but flexible ice and adopts the hard crystalline appearance familiar to modern readers  4  After being kidnapped by the Norse God Loki and used as a pawn against Loki s half brother Thor  Iceman s powers are augmented to uncontrollable levels  through a cryo condenser  The process nearly kills him  however Loki is defeated  and Iceman is teleported back to his place of origin  84  85  With his powers greatly increased  Iceman temporarily loses control of his powers and is required to wear a bulky  metallic belt designed to keep his powers in control  Iceman later learns to control his augmented powers without the aid of his power dampening belt  Eventually  Iceman develops the ability to actually become organic ice  appearing almost translucent  He is virtually indestructible in this form  as he can reform his shattered body even if part of him is completely destroyed  For a time  Iceman became stuck in this ice form  due to a secondary mutation  However  after the events of M Day  Bobby feared losing his powers and reverts back to his human appearance  In an attempt on his life by the Leper Queen  believing him to be a mutant  Bobby is seconds away from death  Mentally alerting Scott and the others to come to Bobby s aid  Emma reaches out to Bobby through Cerebro to try and help him as quickly as she can  By reaching into his mind  Emma reactivates Bobby s powers through opening a series of mental blocks he has placed on himself  and saves him from near death  As a result of Emma  hacking  into Bobby s mind  Iceman donned a more grotesque transparent appearance  with organic bubbles  large veins  and spiky hair  Since this experience  Iceman has regained control over his powers and refined his appearance with jagged spikes on his limbs  back  and hair  On several more recent occasions  Iceman has also undergone another transformation due to his defeat in battle  or by extreme circumstances involving heat  While under attack by his fellow comrades Northstar and Aurora   under mind control  Bobby was essentially blown up in his human form  Unbeknownst to him  his body reacted by instantly disintegrating into snow  which in turn melted and he existed in a gaseous state for a short period of time  In an attempt gone wrong by his teammate Mystique to prevent Aurora from killing the others  Iceman was able to stop Aurora by putting her into a cryo sleep while still in his gaseous state  Iceman was then able to reconstitute his solid form by coalescing from steam to ice to flesh  This transformation left him weak  but he survived the experience to fight another day   edit  Other versions  edit  1602   Roberto Trefusis Iceman is Roberto Trefusis in the miniseries Marvel 1602  a

process that he calls  moisture molecular inversion   though it is a painful process for the passengers  Bobby is also able to reconstitute his body from broken pieces  Just before Apocalypse s defeat  Colossus stormed right through Iceman  causing him to fall into pieces in an attempt to reach his sister  A couple of months later  Iceman  Exodus  Wild Child  and Morph were sent on a secret mission by Magneto  only Wild Child s fate was revealed  He returns in the Uncanny X Force arc set in the AoA timeline  86  where it is revealed that he had actually defected from the X Men and was acting as a mole for Weapon X  His defection was later revealed to be due to Iceman having lost faith on his world as he was tired of seeing the people he cared about being murdered  He later travels to Earth

victim of misfortune  The Asgardian god Loki amplified Bobby s powers to a dangerous level  leaving him unable to make contact with any organic thing for fear of killing it  Unfortunately  Tony Stark did not invent the power dampening device that was invented in the main Marvel Universe  so Ice Man s powers remained permanently affected  Now going by Bob and calling himself Ice Man  he becomes very bitter from his circumstances  When Havok had a disagreement with Magneto and decided to leave the X Men  Ice Man was one of those who followed him  being a founding member of the Six  Not much is known of the early years of the team  but when Havok began to have an affair with Sue Storm of the Fantastic Four  Havok s wife Madelyne came running to Ice Man  Consumed with jealousy at their intimate friendship  Havok sabotaged the Brute s experiment to cure Ice Man  permanently damaging his brain and reducing Brute to a child like state  When the mental degeneration occurred  Ice Man

his family at the peak of government supported Sentinel attacks  fearing his family would be killed in such an attack  Ultimate Iceman never had the snowman look of his counterpart  instead generating a flexible ice armor from the beginning  Bobby establishes himself as a valuable asset  singlehandedly taking out the Ultimates once with a gigantic ice wall  see Ultimate War   as well as singlehandedly halting an invasion by Colonel Wraith and Weapon X  He was only able to be stopped by Rogue  who was in temporary possession of Marvel Girl s telepathy  Professor X has stated that Bobby is one of the three most powerful X Men  During the World Tour arc  after enlarging his armor to form a gigantic ice troll  Bobby is greatly injured by Proteus  which resulted in a lawsuit issued by his parents against Xavier  Bobby eventually rebels against his parents  and later returns to the X Men  While Bobby was away from the X Men on a vacation  he had a girlfriend  but Professor Xavier erased all memories of her from Bobby s mind when he told her too much about the X Men  he presumably also erased the girl s memories   Upon her acceptance into the X Men  Bobby begins to date Rogue  The pair date for a considerable amount of time  but eventually break up due to Bobby s growing feelings for Shadowcat and Rogue s feelings for Gambit  Eventually Rogue leaves  and Bobby starts to date Kitty until she dumps him after finding Bobby was still emailing Rogue  When Rogue returned to the X Men  her original powers had been replaced with those of Gambit s  During the Date Night

subsequently battling him   Bobby Drake  huh  The Legend  I can t believe you re so inept at this point in your life  It s been an honor to kick your     only for Wolverine to interrupt him  Bishop also hinted to Bobby that he has a lot of potential  but Iceman shrugs off the acknowledgment  In Ultimate X Men  80  Bishop talks to Bobby about his potential and comments  With minimal effort  you are taking moisture out of the air and slowing water molecules down to make them cold  What else can you slow down   While this description is different in wording than that of his 616 counterpart  thermal energy is fundamentally the vibration speed of molecules  Faster vibrations equate to higher temperatures  so Bishop s explanation is essentially no different from the classic Iceman s mutant abilities  He also asks Bobby about exploring the possibilities with his powers  but Bobby merely shrugs him off and continues to play his video game  Cyclops disbanded the X Men in Ultimate X Men  81
