Calling code 44 1 A second coat of arms is used in Scotland The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland nb 5   commonly known as the United Kingdom  the UK or Britain  is a sovereign state located off the north western coast of continental Europe  The country includes the island of Great Britain  the north eastern part of the island of Ireland and many smaller islands  Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state the Republic of Ireland  Apart from this land border the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean  the North Sea  the English Channel and the Irish Sea  The United Kingdom is a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system  with its seat of government in the capital city of London  It is a country in its own right 10  11  and consists of four countries  England  Northern Ireland  Scotland and Wales  12  There are three devolved national administrations  each with varying powers  13  14  based in Belfast  Cardiff and Edinburgh  the capitals of Northern Ireland  Wales and Scotland respectively  Associated with the UK  but not constitutionally part of it  are three Crown Dependencies  15  The United Kingdom has fourteen overseas territories  16  These are remnants of the British Empire which  at its height in 1922  encompassed almost a quarter of the world s land surface and was the largest empire in history  British influence can still be observed in the language  culture and legal systems of many of its former territories  The UK is a developed country and has the world s sixth largest economy by nominal GDP and seventh largest economy by purchasing power parity  It was the world s first industrialised country 17  and the world s foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries  18  The UK remains a great power with leading economic  cultural  military  scientific and political influence  19  It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks third or fourth in the world  20  The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946  it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations  the Council of Europe  the European Union  the G7  the G8  the G20  NATO  the OECD and the World Trade Organization  Contents 1 Etymology and terminology 2 History 2 1 Prior

also  Name of Britain  Terminology of Great Britain  and Terminology of the British Isles The name  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  was introduced in 1927 by the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act to reflect the granting of independence to the Irish Free State in 1922  which left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island of Ireland still within the UK  21  Prior to this  the Acts of Union 1800  that led to the uniting the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801  had given the new state the name of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland  Great Britain before 1801 is occasionally referred to as the  United Kingdom of Great Britain   22  23  24  25  However  Section 1 of both of the 1707 Acts of Union declare that England and Scotland are  United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain   26  27  nb 6  The term united kingdom is found in informal use during the 18th century to describe the new state but only became official with the union with Ireland in 1801  28  Although the United Kingdom  as a sovereign state  is a country  England  Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland are also referred to as countries  whether or not they are sovereign states or have devolved or other self government  29  30  The British Prime Minister s website has used the phrase  countries within a country  to describe the United Kingdom  11  With regard to Northern Ireland  the descriptive name used  can be controversial  with the choice often revealing one s political preferences   31  Other terms used for Northern Ireland include  region  and  province   32  33  The United Kingdom is often referred to as Britain  British government sources frequently use the term as a short form for the United Kingdom  whilst media style guides generally allow its use but point out that the longer term Great Britain refers only to England  Scotland and Wales  34  35  36  However  some foreign usage  particularly in the United States  uses Great Britain as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom  37  38  Also  the United Kingdom s Olympic team competes under the name  Great Britain  or  Team GB   39  40 GB and GBR are the standard country codes for the United Kingdom  see ISO 3166 2 and ISO 3166 1 alpha 3  and are consequently commonly used by international organisations to refer to the United Kingdom  citation needed  The adjective British is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom  Although the term has no definite legal connotation  it is used in legislation to refer to United Kingdom citizenship  41  However  British people use a number of different terms to describe their national identity  Some may identify themselves as British only  or British and English  Scottish  Welsh  or Northern Irish  Others may identify themselves as only English  Scottish  Welsh or Northern Irish and not British  In Northern Ireland  some describe themselves as only Irish  42  43  44  History See

History of the formation of the United Kingdom Settlement by anatomically modern humans of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30 000 years ago  45  By the end of the region s prehistoric period  the population is thought to have belonged  in the main  to a culture termed Insular Celtic  comprising Brythonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland  46  The Roman conquest  beginning in 43 AD  and the 400 year rule of southern Britain  was followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo Saxon settlers  reducing the Brythonic area mainly to what was to become Wales  47  The region settled by the Anglo Saxons became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century  48  Meanwhile  Gaelic speakers in north west Britain  with connections to the north east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century  49  50  united with the Picts to create the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century  51  The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings and the events leading to it  In 1066  the Normans invaded England and after its conquest  seized large parts of Wales  conquered much of Ireland and settled in Scotland bringing to each country feudalism on the Northern French model and Norman French culture  52  The Norman elites greatly influenced  but eventually assimilated with  each of the local cultures  53  Subsequent medieval English kings completed the conquest of Wales and made an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to annex Scotland  Thereafter  Scotland maintained its independence  albeit in near constant conflict with England  The English monarchs  through inheritance of substantial territories in France and claims to the French crown  were also heavily involved in conflicts in France  most notably the Hundred Years War  54  The early modern period saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state churches in each country  55  Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England  56  and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown  57  In what was to become Northern Ireland  the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and land given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland  58  In 1603  the kingdoms of England  Scotland and Ireland were united in a personal union when James VI  King of Scots  inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London  each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political institutions  59  60  In the mid 17th century  all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars  including the English Civil War  which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the short lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of England  Scotland and Ireland  61  62  Although the monarchy was restored  it ensured  with the Glorious Revolution of 1688  that  unlike much of the rest of Europe  royal absolutism would not prevail  The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system  63  During this period  particularly in England  the development of naval power  and the interest in voyages of discovery  led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies  particularly in North America  64  65  Since the Acts of Union of 1707 Main article  History of the United Kingdom The Treaty of Union led to a single united kingdom encompassing all Great Britain  On 1 May 1707 a new kingdom of Great Britain was created by the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland in accordance with the Treaty of Union  negotiated the previous year and ratified by the English and Scottish Parliaments passing Acts of Union  66  67  68  In the 18th century  the country played an important role in developing Western ideas of the parliamentary system and in making significant contributions to literature  the arts  and science  18  The British led Industrial Revolution transformed the country and fuelled the growing British Empire  During this time Britain  like other great powers  was involved in colonial exploitation  including the Atlantic slave trade  although with the passing of the Slave Trade Act of 1807 the UK took a leading role in battling the trade in slaves  69  The colonies in North America had been the main focus of British colonial activity  With their loss in the American War of Independence  imperial ambition turned elsewhere  particularly to India  70  In 1800  while the wars with France still raged  the Parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union  uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland  which came into being on 1 January 1801  71  The Battle of Waterloo marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the start of Pax Britannica  After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars  1792 1815   the UK emerged as the principal naval and economic power of the 19th century  with London the largest city in the world from about 1830 to 1930  72  and remained a foremost power into the mid 20th century  73 Unchallenged at sea  Britain adopted the role of global policeman  a state of affairs later known as the Pax Britannica  74  It was also a period of rapid economic  colonial  and industrial growth  Britain was described as the  workshop of the world   75  and the British Empire grew to include India  large parts of Africa  and many other territories  Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies  Britain s dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries  such as China  Argentina and Siam  76  77  Domestically  there was a shift to free trade and laissez faire policies and a very significant widening of the voting franchise  The country experienced a huge population increase during the century  accompanied by rapid urbanization  causing significant social and economic stresses  78  By the end of the century  other states began to challenge Britain s industrial dominance  79  Infantry of the Royal Irish Rifles during the Battle of the Somme  More than 885 000 British soldiers lost their lives on the battlefields of World War I  The UK  along with Russia  France and  after 1917  the USA  was one of the major powers opposing the German Empire and its allies in World War I  1914 18   80  The UK armed forces grew to over five million people 81  engaged across much of its empire and several regions of Europe  and increasingly took a major role on the Western front  The nation suffered some two and a half million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt  81  After the war the United Kingdom received the League of Nations mandate over former German and Ottoman colonies  and the British Empire had expanded to its greatest extent  covering a fifth of the world s land surface and a quarter of its population  82  The rise of Irish Nationalism and disputes within Ireland over the terms of Irish Home Rule led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921  83  and the Irish Free State became independent with Dominion status in 1922  while Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom  84  The Great Depression  1929 32  occurred when the UK had not recovered from the effects of the war  and led to hardship as well as political and social unrest  85  The United Kingdom was one of the Allies of World War II and an original signatory to the Declaration of the United Nations  Following the defeat of its European allies in the first year of the war  the United Kingdom continued the fight against Germany  notably in the Battle of Britain and the Battle of the Atlantic  After the victory  the UK was one of the Big Three powers that met to plan the postwar world  The war left the country financially damaged  Marshall Aid and loans from both the United States and Canada helped the UK on the road to recovery  86  Territories that were at one time part of the British Empire  Current British Overseas Territories are underlined in red  The Labour government in the immediate post war years initiated a radical programme of changes  with a significant impact on British society in the following decades  87  Domestically  major industries and public utilities were nationalized  a Welfare State was established  and a comprehensive publicly funded healthcare system  the National Health Service  was created  88  In response to the rise of local nationalism  the Labour government s own ideological sympathies and Britain s now diminished economic position  a policy of decolonisation was initiated  starting with the granting of independence to India and Pakistan in 1947  89  Over the next three decades  most territories of the Empire gained independence and became sovereign members of the Commonwealth of Nations  citation needed  Although the new postwar limits of Britain s political role were illustrated by the Suez Crisis of 1956  the UK nevertheless became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal  with its first atomic bomb test in 1952   The international spread of the English language also ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture  while from the 1960s its popular culture also found influence abroad  As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s  the British Government encouraged immigration from Commonwealth countries  thereby transforming Britain into a multi ethnic society in the following decades  90  In 1973  the UK joined the European Economic Community  EEC   and when the EEC became the European Union  EU  in 1992  it was one of the 12 founding members  From the late 1960s Northern Ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence  sometimes affecting other parts of the UK and also the Republic of Ireland  conventionally known as the Troubles  It is usually considered to have ended with the Belfast  Good Friday  Agreement of 1998  91  92  93  Following a period of global economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s  the Conservative Government of the 1980s initiated a radical policy of deregulation  particularly of the financial sector  flexible labour markets  the sale of state owned companies  privatisation   and the withdrawal of subsidies to others  94  Aided  from 1984  by the inflow of substantial North Sea oil revenues  the UK experienced a period of significant economic growth  95  Around the end of the 20th century there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of devolved national administrations for Northern Ireland  Scotland  and Wales following pre legislative referendums  96  and the statutory incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights  Domestic controversy surrounded some of Britain s overseas military deployments in the 2000s  decade   particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan  97  Geography Main article  Geography of the United Kingdom The topography of the UK The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 243 610 square kilometres  94 060 sq mi   The country occupies the major part of the British Isles 98 archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain  the north eastern one sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands  It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the south east coast coming within 35 kilometres  22 mi  of the coast of northern France  from which it is separated by the English Channel  99  As of 1993 update  10  of the UK was forested  46  used for pastures and 25  used for agriculture  100  The Royal Greenwich Observatory in London is the defining point of the Prime Meridian  citation needed  The United Kingdom lies between latitudes 49  to 61  N  and longitudes 9  W to 2  E  Northern Ireland shares a 360 kilometre  224 mi  land boundary with the Republic of Ireland  99  The coastline of Great Britain is 17 820 kilometres  11 073 mi  long  101  It is connected to continental Europe by the Channel Tunnel  which at 50 kilometres  31 mi   38 kilometres  24 mi  underwater  is the longest underwater tunnel in the world  102  England accounts for just over half of the total area of the UK  covering 130 395 square kilometres  50 350 sq mi   103  Most of the country consists of lowland terrain  100  with mountainous terrain north west of the Tees Exe line  including the Cumbrian Mountains of the Lake District  the Pennines and limestone hills of the Peak District  Exmoor and Dartmoor  The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames  Severn and the Humber  England s highest mountain is Scafell Pike  978 metres  3 209 ft   in the Lake District  Its principal rivers are the Severn  Thames  Humber  Tees  Tyne  Tweed  Avon  Exe and Mersey  100  Ben Nevis  in Scotland  is the highest point in the British Isles Scotland accounts for just under a third of the total area of the UK  covering 78 772 square kilometres  30 410 sq mi  104  and including nearly eight hundred islands  105  predominantly west and north of the mainland  notably the Hebrides  Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands  The topography of Scotland is distinguished by the Highland Boundary Fault a geological rock fracture which traverses Scotland from Arran in the west to Stonehaven in the east  106  The faultline separates two distinctively different regions  namely the Highlands to the north and west and the lowlands to the south and east  The more rugged Highland region contains the majority of Scotland s mountainous land  including Ben Nevis which at 1 343 metres  4 406 ft  is the highest point in the British Isles  107  Lowland areas  especially the narrow waist of land between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth known as the Central Belt  are flatter and home to most of the population including Glasgow  Scotland s largest city  and Edinburgh  its capital and political centre  citation needed  Wales accounts for less than a tenth of the total area of the UK  covering 20 779 square kilometres  8 020 sq mi   108  Wales is mostly mountainous  though South Wales is less mountainous than North and mid Wales  The main population and industrial areas are in South Wales  consisting of the coastal cities of Cardiff  Swansea and Newport  and the South Wales Valleys to their north  The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon  Welsh  Yr Wyddfa  which  at 1 085 metres  3 560 ft   is the highest peak in Wales  100  The 14  or possibly 15  Welsh mountains over 3 000 feet  914 m  high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s  Wales has over 1 200 km  750 miles  of coastline  There are several islands off the Welsh mainland  the largest of which is Anglesey  Ynys M n  in the northwest  Northern Ireland accounts for just 14 160 square kilometres  5 470 sq mi  and is mostly hilly  It includes Lough Neagh which  at 388 square kilometres  150 sq mi   is the largest lake in the British Isles by area  109  The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard in the Mourne Mountains at 852 metres  2 795 ft   100  Climate Main article  Climate of the United Kingdom The United Kingdom has a temperate climate  with plentiful rainfall all year round  99  The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below  11  C  12  F  or rising above 35  C  95  F   110  The prevailing wind is from the south west and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean  99  although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind as the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest  citation needed  Atlantic currents  warmed by the Gulf Stream  bring mild winters  especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground  Summers are warmest in the south east of England  being closest to the European mainland  and coolest in the north  Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground  and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills  111  Administrative divisions Main article  Administrative geography of the United Kingdom Administrative units of the United Kingdom Each country of the United Kingdom has its own system of administrative and geographic demarcation  which often has origins that pre date the formation of the United Kingdom itself  Consequently there is  no common stratum of administrative unit encompassing the United Kingdom   112  Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements  but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function  113  Change did not occur in a uniform manner and the devolution of power over local government to Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland means that future changes are unlikely to be uniform either  citation needed  The organisation of local government in England is complex  with the distribution of functions varying according to the local arrangements  Legislation concerning local government in England is decided by the UK parliament and the Government of the United Kingdom  as England does not have a devolved parliament  The upper tier subdivisions of England are the nine Government office regions or European Union government office regions  114  One region  Greater London  has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a referendum  115  It was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected regional assemblies but the rejection of a proposed assembly in the North East region  by a referendum in 2004  stopped this idea in its tracks  116  Below the region level England has either county councils and district councils or unitary authorities and London which consists of 32 London boroughs  Councillors are elected by the first past the post system in single member wards or by the multi member plurality system in multi member wards  117  Local government in Scotland is divided on a basis of 32 council areas  with wide variation in both size and population  The cities of Glasgow  Edinburgh  Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas as is the Highland Council which includes a third of Scotland s area but just over 200 000 people  The power invested in local authorities is administered by elected councillors  of which there are currently 1 222 118  and are each paid a part time salary  Elections are conducted by single transferable vote in multi member wards that elect either three or four councillors  Each council elects a Provost  or Convenor  to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area  Councillors are subject to a code of conduct enforced by the Standards Commission for Scotland  119  The representative association of Scotland s local authorities is the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities  COSLA   120  Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities  These include the cities of Cardiff  Swansea and Newport which are unitary authorities in their own right  121  Elections are held every four years under the first past the post system  122  The most recent elections were held in May 2008  The Welsh Local Government Association represents the interests of local authorities in Wales  123  Local government in Northern Ireland has  since 1973  been organised into 26 district councils  each elected by single transferable vote  Their powers are limited to services such as collecting waste  controlling dogs  and maintaining parks and cemeteries  124  On 13 March 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present system  125  The next local elections were postponed until 2011 to facilitate this  126  Dependencies Main articles  British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies The fourteen British Overseas Territories are indicated in red The United Kingdom has sovereignty over seventeen territories which do not form part of the United Kingdom itself  14 British Overseas Territories 127  and three Crown Dependencies  citation needed  The fourteen British Overseas Territories are  Anguilla  Bermuda  the British Antarctic Territory  the British Indian Ocean Territory  the British Virgin Islands  the Cayman Islands  the Falkland Islands  Gibraltar  Montserrat  Saint Helena  Ascension and Tristan da Cunha  the Turks and Caicos Islands  the Pitcairn Islands  South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands  and the Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus  128  British claims in Antarctica are not universally recognised  129  Collectively Britain s overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of 667 018 square miles  1 727 570 km2  and a population of approximately 260 000 people  130  They are the remnants of the British Empire and several have specifically voted to remain British territories  Bermuda in 1995 and Gibraltar in 2002   citation needed  The Crown Dependencies are British possessions of the Crown  as opposed to overseas territories of the UK  131  They comprise the Channel Island Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea  Being independently administered jurisdictions they do not form part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union  although the UK government manages their foreign affairs and defence and the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf  The power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies  with the assent of the Crown  Privy Council or  in the case of the Isle of Man  in certain circumstances the Lieutenant Governor   132  Since 2005 each Crown dependency has had a Chief Minister as its head of government  citation needed  Politics Main articles  Politics of the United Kingdom  Monarchy of the United Kingdom  and Elections in the United Kingdom HM Queen Elizabeth II  Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms The United Kingdom is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy  Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state of the UK as well as of fifteen other independent Commonwealth countries  The monarch has  the right to be consulted  the right to encourage  and the right to warn   133  The United Kingdom has an uncodified constitution  134  as do only three other countries in the world  nb 7  The Constitution of the United Kingdom thus consists mostly of a collection of disparate written sources  including statutes  judge made case law and international treaties  together with constitutional conventions  As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and  constitutional law  the UK Parliament can perform  constitutional reform  simply by passing Acts of Parliament and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution  However  no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change  135  Government The UK has a parliamentary government based on the Westminster system that has been emulated around the world a legacy of the British Empire  The parliament of the United Kingdom that meets in the Palace of Westminster has two houses  an elected House of Commons and an appointed House of Lords  citation needed  Any bill passed requires Royal Assent to become law  The position of prime minister  the UK s head of government  136  belongs to the member of parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in the House of Commons  usually the current leader of the largest political party in that chamber  The prime minister and cabinet are formally appointed by the monarch to form Her Majesty s Government  though the prime minister chooses the cabinet and  by convention  HM The Queen respects the prime minister s choices  137  The Palace of Westminster  seat of both houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom The cabinet is traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister s party in both legislative houses  and mostly from the House of Commons  to which they are responsible  Executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet  all of whom are sworn into the Privy Council of the United Kingdom  and become Ministers of the Crown  The Rt  Hon  David Cameron  leader of the Conservative Party  has been Prime Minister  First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service since 11 May 2010  138  For elections to the House of Commons  the UK is currently divided into 650 constituencies 139  with each electing a single member of parliament by simple plurality  General elections are called by the monarch when the prime minister so advises  The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 require that a new election must be called within five years of the previous general election  140  The UK s three major political parties are the Conservative Party  the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats  During the 2010 general election these three parties won 622 out of 650 seats available in the House of Commons  621 seats at the 2010 general election 141  and 1 more at the delayed by election in Thirsk and Malton  142  Most of the remaining seats were won by minor parties that only contest elections in one part of the UK  the Scottish National Party  Scotland only   Plaid Cymru  Wales only   and the Democratic Unionist Party  Social Democratic and Labour Party  Ulster Unionist Party  and Sinn F in  Northern Ireland only  though Sinn F in also contests elections in the Republic of Ireland   In accordance with party policy no elected Sinn F in member of parliament has ever attended the House of Commons to speak on behalf of their constituents   this is because members of parliament are required to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch  The current five Sinn F in MPs have however  since 2002  made use of the offices and other facilities available at Westminster  143  For elections to the European Parliament the UK currently has 72 MEPs  elected in 12 multi member constituencies  144  Devolved national administrations Main articles  Northern Ireland Executive  Scottish Government  and Welsh Government The Scottish Parliament Building in Holyrood is the seat of the Scottish Parliament Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland each have their own government or executive  led by a First Minister  and a devolved unicameral legislature  England  the largest country of the United Kingdom  has no devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK government and parliament on all issues  This situation has given rise to the so called West Lothian question which concerns the fact that MPs from Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland can vote  sometimes decisively  145  on matters affecting England that are handled by devolved legislatures for their own constituencies  146  The Scottish Government and Parliament have wide ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically  reserved  to the UK parliament  including education  healthcare  Scots law and local government  147  Following its victory at the 2007 elections the pro independence Scottish National Party  SNP  formed a minority government with its leader  Alex Salmond  becoming First Minister of Scotland  148  The pro union parties responded to the electoral success of the SNP by creating a Commission on Scottish Devolution 149  which reported in 2009 and recommended that additional powers should be devolved  including control of half the income tax raised in Scotland  150  At the 2011 elections the SNP won re election and achieved an overall majority in the Scottish parliament  151  The Welsh Government and the National Assembly for Wales have more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland  152  Following the passing of the Government of Wales Act 2006 the assembly was able to legislate in devolved areas through Assembly Measures once permission to legislate on that specific matter had been granted by Westminster through a Legislative Competence Order  153  but since May 2011 the Assembly has been able to legislate on devolved matters through Acts of the Assembly  which require no prior consent  The current Welsh Government was formed after the 2011 elections  and is a minority Labour administration lead by Carwyn Jones  who had been First Minister of a Labour Plaid Cymru administration since December 2009  154  The Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly have powers closer to those already devolved to Scotland  The Northern Ireland Executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly  Currently  Peter Robinson  Democratic Unionist Party  and Martin McGuinness  Sinn F in  are First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively  155  Devolution in Northern Ireland is subject to the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent British Irish Agreement between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland  Under those agreements  the participation of members of the Northern Ireland Executive in the North South Ministerial Council  and co operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on a number of devolved policy areas  are prerequisites of devolution in Northern Ireland  The British Irish Intergovernmental Conference was also established under the agreements  whereby  the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals  on non devolved matters with respect to Northern Ireland  However  the United Kingdom government remains sovereign over Northern Ireland unless a majority of the people of Northern Ireland vote to form a united Ireland  citation needed  The United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland  Wales or Northern Ireland  Under the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty  the UK Parliament could  in theory  therefore  abolish the Scottish Parliament  Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly  156  157  Indeed  in 1972  the UK Parliament unilaterally prorogued the Parliament of Northern Ireland  setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions  158  In practice  the circumstances in which the UK Parliament would abolish devolution given the political constraints created by referendum decisions are unclear  159  The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament s power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are greater than in relation to Scotland and Wales  given that devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the Government of Ireland  160  Law and criminal justice Main article  Law of the United Kingdom The Royal Courts of Justice of England and Wales The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system  as Article 19 of the 1706 Treaty of Union provided for the continuation of Scotland s separate legal system  161  Today the UK has three distinct systems of law  English law  Northern Ireland law and Scots law  A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords  162  163  The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  including the same members as the Supreme Court  is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries  the British Overseas Territories  and the Crown Dependencies  citation needed  Both English law  which applies in England and Wales  and Northern Ireland law are based on common law principles  164  The essence of common law is that  subject to statute  the law is developed by judges in courts  applying statute  precedent and common sense to the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles  which are reported and binding in future similar cases  stare decisis   165  The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales  consisting of the Court of Appeal  the High Court of Justice  for civil cases  and the Crown Court  for criminal cases   The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in England  Wales  and Northern Ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction  often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions  166  The High Court of Justiciary   the supreme criminal court of Scotland  Scots law applies in Scotland  a hybrid system based on both common law and civil law principles  The chief courts are the Court of Session  for civil cases  167  and the High Court of Justiciary  for criminal cases  168  The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law  169 Sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury  known as sheriff solemn court  or with a sheriff and no jury  known as sheriff summary Court  170  The Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts for a criminal trial   guilty    not guilty  and  not proven   Both  not guilty  and  not proven  result in an acquittal with no possibility of retrial  171  Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995  though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 48  in crime from 1995 to 2007 08  172  according to crime statistics  The prison population of England and Wales has almost doubled over the same period  to over 80 000  giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 147 per 100 000  173 Her Majesty s Prison Service  which reports to the Ministry of Justice  manages most of the prisons within England and Wales  Crime in Scotland fell to its lowest recorded level for 32 years in 2009 10  falling by ten percent  174  At the same time Scotland s prison population  at over 8 000  175  is at record levels and well above design capacity  176  The Scottish Prison Service  which reports to the Cabinet Secretary for Justice  manages Scotland s prisons  In 2006 a report by the Surveillance Studies Network found that the UK had the highest level of mass surveillance among industrialised western nations  177  Foreign relations Main

the 11th century  the Celts  Romans  Anglo Saxons  Norse and the Normans  Recent genetic studies have shown that more than 50 percent of England s gene pool contains Germanic Y chromosomes  267  though other recent genetic analysis indicates that  about 75 per cent of the traceable ancestors of the modern British population had arrived in the British isles by about 6 200 years ago  at the start of the British Neolithic or Stone Age   and that the British broadly share a common ancestry with the Basque people  268  269  270  The UK has a history of small scale non white immigration  with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s  271  and the oldest Chinese community in Europe  dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century  272  In 1950 there were probably less than 20 000 non white residents in Britain  almost all born overseas  273  Since 1945 substantial immigration from Africa  the Caribbean and South Asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the British Empire  Migration from new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe since 2004 has resulted in growth in these population groups but  as of 2008 update   the trend is reversing and many of these migrants are returning home  leaving the size of these groups unknown  274  As of 2001 update   92 1  of the population identified themselves as White

Parliament is sovereign and the Scottish Parliament is subordinate  The White Paper had indicated that this was to be the approach taken in the legislation  The Scottish Parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of Scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority  Following the logic of this argument  the power of the Scottish Parliament to legislate can be withdrawn or overridden       M  Elliot   United Kingdom  Parliamentary sovereignty under pressure   International Journal of Constitutional Law  vol  2  issue 3   2004   pp 553 554   Notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes  an important common factor is that the U K  Parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned  For example  the Scottish Parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters  save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied     but this power to legislate on what may be termed  devolved matters  is concurrent with the Westminster Parliament s general power to legislate for Scotland on any matter at all  including devolved matters     In theory  therefore  Westminster may legislate on Scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses       G  Walker  Scotland  Northern Ireland  and Devolution  1945 1979   Journal of British Studies  vol  39  no  1  January 2010   pp 124  amp  133   A  Gamble   The Constitutional Revolution in the United Kingdom   Publius  volume 36  issue 1  p 29   The British parliament has the power to abolish the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses  but since both were sanctioned by referenda  it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the people  In this way several of the constitutional measures introduced by the Blair government appear to be entrenched and not subject to a simple exercise of parliamentary sovereignty at Westminster     E  Meehan   The Belfast Agreement Its Distinctiveness and Points of Cross Fertilization in the UK s Devolution Programme   Parliamentary Affairs  vol  52  issue 1   1 January 1999   p 23    T he distinctive involvement of two governments in the Northern Irish problem means that Northern Ireland s new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement  If this can be equated with a treaty  it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between Westminister and Belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states    Although the Agreement makes the general proviso that Westminister s  powers to make legislation for Northern Ireland  remains  unaffected   without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters  it may be more difficult than in Scotland or Wales for devolved powers to be repatriated  The retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in Northern Ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an intergovernmental agreement      The Treaty  act  of the Union of
