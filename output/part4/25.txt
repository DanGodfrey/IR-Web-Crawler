day New York City was inhabited by various bands of Algonquian tribes of Native Americans  including the Lenape  whose homeland  known as Lenapehoking  included Staten Island  the western portion of Long Island including the area that would become Brooklyn and western Queens and lower Manhattan  63  The Weckquaesgeek  members of the Wappinger Confederation  inhabited the area of the present day Bronx and the northern portion of the island of Manhattan  64  and various bands of the Metoac  principally the Rockaway tribe  inhabited portions of present day western Queens 65  The first documented visit by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano  a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown  who sailed his ship La Dauphine into Upper New York Harbor  where he spent one night aboard ship and sailed out the next day  He claimed the area for France and named it  Nouvelle Angoul me   New Angoul me   66  In January a year later  Esteban Gomez  a Portuguese of African descent sailing for Emperor Charles V of Spain  entered New York Harbor and charted the mouth of the Hudson river which he named Rio de San Antonio  Heavy ice kept him from further exploration  67  The Battle of Long Island  the largest battle of the American Revolution  took place in Brooklyn in 1776  In 1609 English explorer Henry Hudson re discovered the region when he sailed his ship the Halve Maen  Half Moon  into New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for his employer the Dutch East India Company  He proceeded to sail up what he named the North River  also called the Mauritis River  to the site of the present day New York State capital of Albany in the belief that it may be a passage  When the river narrowed and was no longer salty he realized it wasn t a sea passage and sailed back downriver  He made a ten day exploration of the area and claimed the region for his employer  In 1614 the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay would be claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw Nederland  New Netherland   The year 1614 saw the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on the southern tip of Manhattan which would be called  Nieuw Amsterdam   New Amsterdam  in 1625  Dutch colonial Director General Peter Minuit purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie  a small band of the Lenape  68  in 1626 for a value of 60 guilders 69   about  1000 in 2006   70  a disproved legend says that Manhattan was purchased for  24 worth of glass beads  71  72  In 1664 Peter Stuyvesant  the Director General of the colony of New Netherland  surrendered New Amsterdam to the English without bloodshed  The English promptly renamed the fledgling city  New York  after the English Duke of York and Albany  73  At the end of the Second Anglo Dutch War the Dutch gained control of Run  then a much more valuable asset  in exchange for the English controlling New Amsterdam  New York  in North America  Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some epidemics brought on by the arrival of the Europeans caused sizable population losses for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670  74  By 1700  the Lenape population had diminished to 200  75  In 1702  the city lost 10  of its population to yellow fever  76  New York underwent no fewer than seven important yellow fever epidemics from 1702 to 1800  77  New Amsterdam in 1664  the year England took control and renamed it  New York  New York grew in importance as a trading port while under British rule  The city hosted the influential John Peter Zenger trial in 1735  helping to establish the freedom of the press in North America  In 1754  Columbia University was founded under charter by George II of Great Britain as King s College in Lower Manhattan  78  The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty organized in the city  skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there  The Battle of Long Island  the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War  was fought in August 1776 entirely within the modern day borough of Brooklyn  After the battle  in which the Americans were routed  leaving subsequent smaller engagements following in its wake  the city became the British military and political base of operations in North America  The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees  until the war ended in 1783  The only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates including Benjamin Franklin  and British general Lord Howe on September 11  1776  Shortly after the British occupation began the Great Fire of New York occurred  a large conflagration which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city  including Trinity Church  79  The assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York the national capital in 1785  shortly after the war  New York was the last capital of the U S  under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States  In 1789 the first President of the United States  George Washington  was inaugurated  the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time  and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted  all at Federal Hall on Wall Street  80  By 1790  New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States  Broadway circa 1840 In the 19th century  the city was transformed by immigration and development  81  A visionary development proposal  the Commissioners  Plan of 1811  expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Manhattan  and the 1819 opening of the Erie Canal connected the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the North American interior  82  Local politics fell under the domination of Tammany Hall  a political machine supported by Irish immigrants  83  Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s  including William Cullen Bryant  Washington Irving  Herman Melville  Rufus Wilmot Griswold  John Keese  Nathaniel Parker Willis  and Edgar Allan Poe  Public minded members of the old merchant aristocracy lobbied for the establishment of Central Park  which became the first landscaped park in an American city in 1857  A significant free black population also existed in Manhattan and Brooklyn  Slaves had been held in New York through 1827  but during the 1830s New York became a center of interracial abolitionist activism in the North  New York s black population was over 16 000 in 1840  84  The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants  and by 1860  one in four New Yorkers over 200 000 had been born in Ireland  85  Bird s eye view print of Manhattan  amp  New York City  1873  Anger at military conscription during the American Civil War  1861 1865  led to the Draft Riots of 1863  one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history  86  In 1898  the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn  until then a separate city   the County of New York  which then included parts of the Bronx   the County of Richmond  and the western portion of the County of Queens  87  The opening of the subway in 1904 helped bind the new city together  Throughout the first half of the 20th century  the city became a world center for industry  commerce  and communication  However  this development did not come without a price  In 1904  the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River  killing 1 021 people on board  In 1911  the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire  the city s worst industrial disaster until the 9 11 World Trade Center disaster  took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies  Garment Workers  Union and major improvements in factory safety standards  88  Midtown Manhattan  New York City  from Rockefeller Center  1932 New York s nonwhite population was 36 620 in 1890  89  In the 1920s  New York City was a prime destination for African Americans during the Great Migration from the American South  By 1916  New York City was home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America  The Harlem Renaissance flourished during the era of Prohibition  coincident with a larger economic boom that saw the skyline develop with the construction of competing skyscrapers  New York became the most populous urbanized area in the world in early 1920s  overtaking London  and the metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in early 1930s  becoming the first megacity in human history  90  The difficult years of the Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello LaGuardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance  91  United Airlines Flight 175 hits the South Tower of the former World Trade Center on September 11  2001  Returning World War II veterans created a postwar economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens  New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world  with Wall Street leading America s place as the world s dominant economic power  The United Nations Headquarters  completed in 1950  emphasized New York s political influence  and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York s displacement of Paris as the center of the art world  92  In the 1960s  New York City began to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates  which extended into the 1970s  93  While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city s economic health in the 1980s  New York s crime rate continued a steep uphill climb through the decade and into the beginning of the 1990s  94  By the 1990s  crime rates started to drop dramatically due to increased police presence and gentrification  and many American transplants and waves of new immigrants arrived from Asia and Latin America  Important new sectors  such as Silicon Alley  emerged in the city s economy  and New York s population reached all time highs in the 2000 Census and then again in the 2010 Census  The city was one of the sites of the September 11  2001 attacks  when nearly 3 000 people died in the destruction of the World Trade Center  95  A new complex  which includes One World Trade Center  a 9 11 memorial and museum  and three other office towers  are being built on the site and are scheduled for completion by 2014  96  Geography Main articles  Geography of New York City and Geography of New York Harbor Satellite imagery demonstrating the core of the New York City Metropolitan Area  New York City is located in the Northeastern United States  in southeastern New York State  approximately halfway between Washington  D C  and Boston  97  The location at the mouth of the Hudson River  which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean  has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city  Much of New York is built on the three islands of Manhattan  Staten Island  and Long Island  making land scarce and encouraging a high population density  The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay  Between New York City and Troy  New York  the river is an estuary  98  The Hudson separates the city from New Jersey  The East River a tidal strait flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island  The Harlem River  another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers  separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx  The Bronx River  which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County  is the only entirely fresh water river in the city  99  The city s land has been altered substantially by human intervention  with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times  Reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan  with developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s  100  Some of the natural variations in topography have been evened out  especially in Manhattan  101  The city s total area is 468 9 square miles  1 214 km2   164 1 square miles  425 km2  of this are water and 304 8 square miles  789 km2  is land  25  26  The highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island  which  at 409 8 feet  124 9 m

K ppen climate classification New York City has a humid continental climate  The area averages 234 days with at least some sunshine annually  and averages 58  of possible sunshine annually  104  accumulating 2 400 to 2 800 hours of sunshine per annum  105  Winters are cold and damp  and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean  yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding of the Appalachians keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities located at similar or lesser latitudes such as Pittsburgh  Cincinnati  and Indianapolis  The average temperature in January  the area s coldest month  is 32 1  F  0 1  C   However  temperatures in winter could for a few days be as low as 10  F   12  C  and as high as 50  F  10  C   106  Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from chilly to warm  although they are usually mild with low humidity  Summers are typically hot and humid with a July average of 76 5  F  24 7  C   Nighttime conditions are often exacerbated by the urban heat island phenomenon  and temperatures exceed 90  F  32  C  on average of 18 days each summer and can exceed 100  F  38  C  every 4 6 years  107  The city receives 49 7 inches  1 260 mm  of precipitation annually  which is fairly spread throughout the year  Average winter snowfall for 1971 to 2000 has been 22 4 inches  57 cm   but this usually varies considerably from year to year  107  Hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the New York area  but are not unheard of and always have the potential to strike the area  108  Extreme temperatures have ranged from  15 to 106  F   26 to 41  C   recorded on February 9  1934 and July 9  1936  respectively  109  v t e Climate data for New York  Central Park   1981 2010 normals

information  Architecture of New York City and List of tallest buildings in New York City The Empire State Building and Chrysler Building  built in Art Deco style  New York has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods from the saltbox style Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn  the oldest section of which dates to 1656  to the modern One World Trade Center  the skyscraper currently under construction at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan and currently the most expensive new office tower in the world  112  Manhattan s skyline with its many skyscrapers is universally recognized  and the city has been home to several of the tallest buildings in the world  As of 2011  New York City had 5 937 high rise buildings  of which 550 completed structures were at least 100 meters high  both second in the world after Hong Kong  113  114  with over 50 completed skyscrapers taller than 656 feet  200 m   These include the Woolworth Building  1913   an early gothic revival skyscraper built with massively scaled gothic detailing  The 1916 Zoning Resolution required setback in new buildings  and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size  to allow sunlight to reach the streets below  115  The Art Deco style of the Chrysler Building  1930  and Empire State Building  1931   with their tapered tops and steel spires  reflected the zoning requirements  The buildings have distinctive ornamentation  such as the eagles at the corners of the 61st floor on the Chrysler Building  and are considered some of the finest examples of the Art Deco style  116  A highly influential example of the international style in the United States is the Seagram Building  1957   distinctive for its fa ade using visible bronze toned I beams to evoke the building s structure  The Cond  Nast Building  2000  is a prominent example of green design in American skyscrapers  117  The character of New York s large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses  townhouses  and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930  118  In contrast  New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free standing dwellings  In neighborhoods such as Riverdale  Bronx  Ditmas Park  Brooklyn  and Douglaston  Queens large single family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian  119  120  121  Split two family homes are also widely available across the outer boroughs  Stone and brick became the city s building materials of choice after the construction of wood frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835  122  A distinctive feature of many of the city s buildings is the wooden roof mounted water towers  In the 1800s  the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations  which could break municipal water pipes  123 Garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas  such as Jackson Heights  124  Parks Main article  Parks and recreation in New York City The Statue

Brooklynese or New Yorkese  It is generally considered one of the most recognizable accents within American English  178  The classic version of this dialect is centered on middle and working class people of European American descent  and the influx of non European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect  179  The traditional New York area accent is non rhotic  so that the sound     does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant  hence the pronunciation of the city name as  New Yawk   179  There is no     in words like park  p  k  or  p  k   with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the low back chain shift   butter  b      or here  hi    In another feature called the low back chain shift  the     vowel sound of words like talk  law  cross  chocolate  and coffee and the often homophonous   r  in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in General American  In the most old fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect  the vowel sounds of words like  girl  and of words like  oil  become a diphthong       This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds  so that girl is pronounced  goil  and oil is pronounced  erl   this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like  Joizey   Jersey    Toidy Toid Street   33rd St   and  terlet   toilet   179  The character Archie Bunker from the 1970s sitcom All in the Family was a good example of a speaker who had this feature  This speech pattern is no longer prevalent  179  Sports This
