Multiverse  Marvel Comics  From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   June 2008  Within Marvel Comics  most tales take place within the fictional Marvel Universe  which in turn is part of a larger multiverse  Starting with issues of Captain Britain  the main continuity in which most Marvel storylines take place was designated Earth 616  and the multiverse was established as being protected by Merlyn  Each universe has a Captain Britain designated to protect its version of the British Isles  These protectors are collectively known as the Captain Britain Corps  This numerical notation was continued in the series Excalibur and other titles  Each universe of the Multiverse in Marvel also appears to be defended by a Sorcerer Supreme at nearly all times  appointed the mystic trinity of Vishanti to defend the world against threats primarily magical in nature from within and beyond and bearing the Eye of Agamotto  Later on  many writers would utilize and reshape the multiverse in titles such as Exiles  X Men  and Ultimate Fantastic Four  New universes would also spin out of storylines involving time travelling characters such as Rachel Summers  Cable  and Bishop  as their actions rendered their home times alternate timelines  Contents 1 Nature of the Multiverse 1 1 Other realities 1 1 1 Pocket universes 1 1 2 External realities 2 Definitions 2 1 Continuity 2 2 Multiverse 2 3 Megaverse 2 4 Omniverse 3 Known alternate universes 4 Bibliography 5 References 6 External links  edit  Nature of the Multiverse According to Forge  mutants living on these alternate Earths have lost their powers due to M Day  as stated in Endangered Species  however  this mass depowering has not been seen in any of Marvel s current alternate reality publications such as Exiles  the Ultimate titles  Amazing Spider Girl  the Marvel Adventures titles or GeNext  though it is possible that the issue of time may be related to their exclusion  This was apparently retconned during the  X Men  Messiah Complex  storyline  where Forge stated that all mutants in possible future timelines were depowered  not in parallel universes  1  This  in addition to A R M O R  s observation that Lyra arrived from an alternate reality 2  indicates that the topology of the Marvel multiverse is based on new realities branching off from key nodes of a timeline instead of strictly parallel dimensions   edit  Other realities See also  List of Marvel Comics dimensions Not every alternate reality is an entire independent universe  but instead maintain a parisitic relationship to a parent reality  Others can exist outside the multiversal structure altogether   edit  Pocket universes Counter Earth  Heroes Reborn   A pocket dimension where Franklin Richards stored many of Earth s superheroes after the events surrounding the appearance of Onslaught  Doom saved Counter Earth from the unstable pocket dimension  and placed it in an alternate orbit of the 616 Earth on the other side of the sun  The Encroachiverses  A series of universes deemed failures by extremely powerful  unnamed beings  includes the Dimension of Suicide  the Baloney verse  the 976 verse  the Trashi verse  the Don t Worry Be Happy verse  the Noriega verse  the Narcissi verse  the Media verse  the Puppet verse  and the Insipiverse  The Hill  A dangerous pocket dimension used by Mikhail Rasputin after flooding the Morlock tunnels  Rasputin brought all Morlocks to The Hill to raise them in a survival of the fittest mentality  In this dimension time runs several times faster  While in 616 only 1 or 2 years passed more than ten years passed in the Hill  Marrow and the other Gene Nation members grew up in this dimension  The Microverse  Originally  many microverses existed within the Marvel Multiverse  The most commonly visited is the one containing the regions known as Sub Atomica and the Micronauts Homeworld  The Mojoverse  A dimension where all beings are addicted to gladiator like television programs  Ruled by Mojo and home to Longshot and the X Babies  The Negative Zone  Mostly uninhabited  it is a universe parallel to Earth s with many similarities  One major difference is all matter in the Negative Zone is negatively charged  Negative Zone Prison Alpha is located here  Also the home of Blastaar and Annihilus  Otherplace  Also known as  Limbo  or  Demonic Limbo   A magical dimension of demons which were historically ruled by Belasco and was primarily featured in X Men comics  The Void  A pocket dimension that exists inside Shaman s medicine bag  The Soul Gem  A pocket dimension that exists inside the green infinity gem   edit  External realities Avalon  Also known as Otherworld  this realm is an access point to the entire Marvel multiverse utilized by the Captain Britain Corps  The Darkforce Dimension Limbo  Also known as  True Limbo  or  Temporal Limbo   Outside of time historically ruled by Immortus and the location to which Rom the Spaceknight banished the Dire Wraiths  The Panoptichron  Home base of the reality hopping Exiles  structurally dissimilar but functionally similar to Avalon   edit  Definitions The classification system for alternate realities was devised  in part  by Mark Gruenwald  3   edit  Continuity A Universe continuity is a single reality  4  such as Earth 616  the mainstream Marvel Universe Continuity  In Marvel Comics  the concept of a continuity is not the same as  dimension  or  universe   for example  characters like Mephisto and Dormammu hail from alternate dimensions and the Celestials from another universe  but they all nevertheless belong to Earth 616  A continuity should also not be confused with an imprint  for example  while the titles of some imprints  such as Ultimate Marvel  take place in a different continuity  some or all publications in other imprints  such as Epic Comics  MAX  and Marvel UK  take place within the Earth 616 continuity  Note that in context the Marvel Universe is sometimes used to refer to the Marvel Multiverse  and sometimes used to refer to the Earth 616 continuity  5   edit  Multiverse A Multiverse is the collection of alternate universes  6  with a similar nature and a universal hierarchy  The Marvel multiverse contains Earth 616  most of the What If  worlds  as well as the vast number of the alternate Earths seen in the Marvel Universe  The original term and concept were coined by Michael Moorcock for his  Eternal Champion  sequence  The lead characters from Moorcock s work are obviously the inspiration for the Captain Britain Corps   edit  Megaverse There are certain universes which are tied to the Marvel multiverse   such as the New Universe and the Ultraverse   which do not share any open similarities to it  and thus are not strictly part of the larger universal hierarchy that forms the Marvel multiverse  but at the same time  are not so far removed that they existed in a separate multiverse 7  The 21st century edition of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe citation needed  posits the term Megaverse citation needed   although Marvel does not actually endorse the use of this term because of Trademark issues citation needed   as the name for this larger grouping  though because there is always the chance that some future publications will increase the interactions between different Multiverses  this is a fluid definition   edit  Omniverse Originally according to The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe 2004   the omniverse is the collection of every single universe  multiverse  dimension  alternate or pocket  and realm  8  This includes not only Marvel Comics  but also DC Comics  Image  Dark Horse  Archie  TMNT  Harvey  and every universe ever mentioned or seen  and an infinite amount never mentioned or seen  including our own world  Everything is in the Omniverse  and there is only one Omniverse   According to the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Alternate Universes   It includes every single literary  television show  movie  urban legend  universe  realm  etc  ever   Indeed it does include everyone  from Hobbes  from Calvin and Hobbes  to Stewie Griffin to Homer Simpson to Popeye to Rocky Balboa to Ronald Reagan to Romeo and Juliet to Luke Skywalker to Snoopy to Jay and Silent Bob to Mickey Mouse to Harry Potter to Spider Woman to Green Arrow to Jason Voorhees  etc  The omniverse is very popular among fanfiction as it can create any crossover imaginable  Using the omniverse to make a universe that is inhabited by completely unrelated properties  Wolverine and Raphael  or Spider Man and Artemis Fowl  for example  is fairly common as is crossing from 616 and another world  commonly DC and Marvel    edit  Known alternate universes Below is a partial list of notable alternate worlds  and universes with known numerical designations  Beyond these  many other alternate worlds have been visited or explored in Marvel Comics  Most notably  almost every separate storyline of the What If    and Exiles series relates to a separate universe in the multiverse  although an occasional pair of issues in which characters and situations do not overlap could conceivably share a universe  The numerical designations for these are rarely revealed outside of reference works such as the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Alternate Universes 2005  A R M O R  and Project Pegasus however seem to possess vast knowledge of other Marvel realities  utilizing the same designations  whether this is simply narrative convenience on behalf of Marvel s authors or an unusual decision by these agencies to utilise an effectively alien catalogue method is as yet unstated  The numeric designations of these alternate universes have been confirmed by Marvel Comics throughout the years and compiled in 2005 s Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Alternate Universes  and in Marvel publications since the release of the Handbook  The prevalent method of labelling an unnamed universe is to derive numbers in some way from the publication date of the relevant issue featuring its first appearance  This is  in turn  based on the mistaken belief that  Earth 616  derived its number from the publication date of The Fantastic Four  1  Nov  1961   Name First Appearance Notes Earth 0000 Earth Prime Fantastic Four  511  2004  This is the designation given by A R M O R  to our world  the real  non fictional keystone world in which Marvel Comics is a comic book company that publishes books featuring the stories and characters referenced in this article  Earth 0000  also called Earth Prime  is the true  keystone Earth from which all the other Earths within the multiverse originate  The real Earth has been briefly  visited  on at least two occasions by both Marvel and DC characters  once  when the Fantastic Four paid a visit to  God   in this case Jack Kirby  to plead for the life of Ben Grimm  9  and once by Howard The Duck and Machine Man while tracking down the Zombie Virus across parallel Earths  10  Also  in the  90s Spider Man  The Animated Series  very last episode  Spider Man is taken here by Madame Web to
