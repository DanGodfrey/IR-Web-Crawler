20  Downey joined the cast of the weekly television comedy show Saturday Night Live  SNL   but was fired in 1986 following a cast overhaul that was done in order to save the show from cancellation due to low Nielsen ratings and critics panning the show for its mediocre cast at the time  10  In 1985  Downey had his breakthrough when he played James Spader s sidekick in Tuff Turf and then a bully in John Hughes  Weird Science  He was considered for the role of Duckie in John Hughes  film Pretty in Pink  1986   11  12  but his first lead role would be with Molly Ringwald in The Pick up Artist  1987   Because of these and other coming of age films Downey did during the 1980s  he is sometimes named as a member of the Brat Pack  10  13  In 1987  Downey played Julian Wells  a drug addicted rich boy whose life rapidly spirals out of his control  in the film version of the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less Than Zero  His performance  described by Janet Maslin in The New York Times as  desperately moving   14  was widely praised  though Downey has said that for him  the role was like the ghost of Christmas Future  since his drug habit resulted in his becoming an  exaggeration of the character  in real life  15 Zero drove Downey into films with bigger budgets and names  such as Chances Are  1989  with Cybill Shepherd and Ryan O Neal  Air America  1990  with Mel Gibson  and Soapdish  1991  with Sally Field  Kevin Kline and Whoopi Goldberg  In 1992  he starred as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin  a role for which he prepared extensively  learning how to play the violin and tennis left handed

times on drug related charges including cocaine  heroin and marijuana 18  and went several times through drug treatment programs unsuccessfully  explaining in 1999 to a judge   It s like I ve got a shotgun in my mouth with my finger on the trigger  and I like the taste of the gun metal   19  He explained his relapses by claiming to have been addicted to drugs since the age of eight  due to the fact that 19  his father  also an addict  had been giving them to him  20  In April 1996  Downey was arrested for possession of heroin  cocaine and an unloaded  357 caliber Magnum handgun while he was speeding down Sunset Boulevard  A month later  while on parole  he trespassed into a neighbor s home while under the influence of a controlled substance and fell asleep in one of the beds  21  22  He was sentenced to three years of probation and required to undergo mandatory drug testing  In 1997  he missed one of the court ordered drug tests and had to spend four months in the Los Angeles County jail  After Downey missed another required drug test in 1999  he was arrested once more  Despite Downey s lawyer  John Stewart Holden  assembling for his client s 1999 defense the same team of lawyers that successfully defended O  J  Simpson during his criminal trial for murder  19  Downey was sentenced to a three year prison term at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran  California  a k a   Corcoran II    At the time of the 1999 arrest  all of Downey s film projects had wrapped and were close to release  with the exception of In Dreams  which he was allowed to complete filming  He had also been hired for voicing  The Devil  on the NBC animated television series God  the Devil and Bob  but was fired when he failed to show up for rehearsals  23  24  After spending nearly a year in California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran  California  Downey  on condition of posting  5 000 bail  was unexpectedly freed when a judge ruled that his collective time in incarceration facilities  spawned from the initial 1996 arrests  had qualified him for early release  7  A week after his 2000 release  Downey joined the cast of the hit television series Ally McBeal  playing the new love interest of Calista Flockhart s title character  25  His performance was praised and the following year he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series category and won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a mini series or television film  26  27  He also appeared as a writer and singer on Vonda Shepard s Ally McBeal  For Once in My Life album  and he sang with Sting a duet of  Every Breath You Take  in an episode of the series  Despite the apparent success  Downey claims that his performance on the series was overrated and that   It was my lowest point in terms of addictions  At that stage  I didn t give a fuck whether I ever acted again   15  In January 2001  Downey was scheduled to play the role of Hamlet in a Los Angeles stage production directed by Mel Gibson  28  Before the end of his first season on Ally McBeal  over the Thanksgiving 2000 holiday  Downey was arrested when his room at Merv Griffin s Hotel and Givenchy Spa in Palm Springs  California was searched by the police  who were responding to an anonymous 911 call  Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of cocaine and Valium  29  30  Despite the fact that  if convicted  he could face a prison sentence of up to four years and eight months  he signed on to appear in at least eight more Ally McBeal episodes  31  In April 2001  while he was on parole  a Los Angeles police officer found him wandering barefoot in Culver City  just outside Los Angeles  He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs  but was released a few hours later  32  even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system  33  After this last arrest  producer David E  Kelley and other Ally McBeal executives ordered last minute re writes and re shoots and dismissed Downey from the show  despite the fact that Downey s character had resuscitated Ally McBeal s ratings  34  The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high profile film America s Sweethearts  33  and the subsequent incarceration forced Mel Gibson to shut down his planned stage production of Hamlet as well  In July 2001  Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges  avoiding jail time  Instead  he was sent into drug rehabilitation and put on a three year probation  benefiting from the California Proposition 36  which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping non violent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail  7  35  The book Conversations with Woody Allen reports that director Woody Allen wanted to cast Downey and Winona Ryder in his film Melinda and Melinda in 2005  but was unable to do so because he could not get insurance on them  stating   We couldn t get bonded  The completion bonding companies would not bond the picture unless we could insure them  We were heartbroken because I had worked with Winona before  on Celebrity  and thought she was perfect for this and wanted to work with her again  And I had always wanted to work with Bob Downey and always thought he was a huge talent   citation needed  In a December 18  2000 article for People Magazine entitled  Bad to Worse   Downey s stepmother Rosemary told author Alex Tresnlowski that Downey had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder  a few years ago  and added that his bipolar disorder was  the reason he has a hard time staying sober  What hasn t been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy   36  In the same article  Dr  Manijeh Nikakhtar  a Los Angeles psychiatrist and co author of Addiction or Self Medication  The Truth  ISBN 978 1883819576   says she received a letter from Downey in 1999  during his time at Corcoran II  asking for advice on his condition  She discovered that  no one had done a complete  psychiatric  evaluation  on him    I asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar  and he said   Oh yeah  There are times I spend a lot of money and I m hyperactive  and there are other times I m down    36  In an article for the March 2007 issue of Esquire  Downey told author Scott Raab that he wanted to address  this whole thing about the bipolar  after receiving a phone call from  the Bipolar Association  asking him about being bipolar  When Downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar  the caller quoted the People article  to which Downey replied    No  Dr  Malibusian said  I said I was bipolar       and they go   Well  it s been written  so we re going to quote it    37  Downey flatly denied being  depressed or manic  and that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because  the guy I was seeing didn t know I was smokin  crack in his bathroom  You can t make a diagnosis until somebody s sober   37   edit  Career comeback After five years of substance abuse  arrests  rehab  and relapse  Robert Downey  Jr  was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs and a return to his career  In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past  Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that  when someone says   I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab   Well  uh  you re a wreck  you just lost your job  and your wife left you  Uh  you might want to give it a shot   38  He added that after his last arrest in April 2001  when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court ordered rehab   I finally said   You know what  I don t think I can continue doing this   And I reached out for help  and I ran with it     You can reach out for help in kind of a half assed way and you ll get it and you won t take advantage of it  It s not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems   what s hard is to decide to actually do it   38  Downey got his first post rehab acting job in August 2001  lip syncing in the video for Elton John s single  I Want Love   39  Video director Sam Taylor Wood shot 16 takes of the video and used the last one because  according to John  Downey looked completely relaxed  and   The way he underplays it is fantastic   40  Downey was able to return to the big screen only after Mel Gibson  who had been a close friend to Downey since both had co starred in Air America  paid Downey s insurance bond for the 2003 film The Singing Detective  41  Gibson s gamble paved the way for Downey s comeback and Downey returned to mainstream films in the mid 2000s with Gothika  for which producer Joel Silver withheld 40 percent of his salary until after production wrapped as insurance against his addictive behavior  Similar clauses have become standard in his contracts since then  42  After Gothika  Downey was cast in a number of leading and supporting roles  including well received work in a number of semi independent films  A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints  Good Night  and Good Luck  A Scanner Darkly  and Steven Shainberg s fictional biopic of Diane Arbus  Fur  where Downey s character represented the two biggest influences on Arbus  professional life  Lisette

cover art 44  and designed the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio  45  The album received mixed reviews  46  47  but Downey stated in 2006 that he probably will not do another album  as he felt that the energy he put into doing the album was not compensated  48  In 2006  Downey returned to his television roots when he guest starred on Family Guy in the episode  The Fat Guy Strangler   Downey had previously telephoned the show s production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in an episode creation  as his son is a fan of the show  The producers of the show accepted the offer and created the character of Patrick Pewterschmidt  Lois Griffin s long lost  mentally disturbed brother  for Downey  49  Downey signed on with publishers HarperCollins to write a memoir  which in 2006 was already being billed as a  candid look at the highs and lows of his life and career   In 2008  however  Downey returned his advance to the publishers and cancelled the book without further comment  50   edit  Summer 2008 blockbusters With all of the critical success Robert Downey  Jr   had experienced throughout his career  he had never appeared in a  blockbuster  film  That changed in

and offer the hand of friendship  He just said   Hey  welcome to the club  Let s go see what we can do to work on ourselves   Downey has indicated that his time in prison changed his political point of view somewhat  saying   I have a really interesting political point of view  and it s not always something I say too loud at dinner tables here  but you can t go from a  2 000 a night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal  You can t  I wouldn t wish that experience on anyone else  but it was very  very  very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics ever since   102   edit  Filmography Year Title Role Notes 1970 Pound Puppy Directed by Robert Downey  Sr  1972 Greaser s Palace uncredited Directed by Robert Downey  Sr
