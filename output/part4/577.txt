in which it interacts with foreign nations and sets standards of interaction for its organizations  corporations and individual citizens  The U S  is highly influential in the world  The global reach of the United States is backed by a  15 trillion economy  1  approximately a quarter of global GDP  and a defense budget of  711 billion  which accounts for approximately 43  of global military spending  The U S  Secretary of State is analogous to the foreign minister of other nations and is the official charged with state to state diplomacy  although the president has ultimate authority over foreign policy  that policy includes defining the national interest  as well as the strategies chosen both to safeguard that and to achieve its policy goals  The current Secretary of State is Hillary Clinton  The officially stated goals of the foreign policy of the United States  as mentioned in the Foreign Policy Agenda of the U S  Department of State  are  to create a more secure  democratic  and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the international community   2  In addition  the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs states as some of its jurisdictional goals   export controls  including nonproliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear hardware  measures to foster commercial intercourse with foreign nations and to safeguard American business abroad  international commodity agreements  international education  and protection of American citizens abroad and expatriation   3  U S  foreign policy and foreign aid have been the subject

and the Supreme Court interprets treaties when cases are presented to it  Main articles  Treaty Clause  War Powers Clause  Appointments Clause  and Foreign Commerce Clause Subject to the advise and consent role of the U S  Senate  the President of the United States negotiates treaties with foreign nations  but treaties enter into force only if ratified by two thirds of the Senate  The President is also Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces  and as such has broad authority over the armed forces  however only Congress has authority to declare war  and the civilian and military budget is written by the Congress  The United States Secretary of State is the foreign minister of the United States and is the primary conductor of state to state diplomacy  Both the Secretary of State and ambassadors are appointed by the President  with the advice and consent of the Senate  Congress also has power to regulate commerce with foreign nations  6   edit  Historical overview Main articles  History of U S  foreign policy and Timeline of United States diplomatic history The Jay Treaty of 1795 aligned the U S  more with Britain less with France  leading to political polarization at home The main trend regarding the history of U S  foreign policy since the American Revolution is the shift from non interventionism before and after World War I  to its growth as a world power and global hegemon during and since World War II and the end of the Cold War in the 20th century  7  Since the 19th century  US foreign policy also has been characterized by a shift from the realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations  8  Foreign policy themes were expressed considerably in George Washington s farewell address  these included among other things  observing good faith and justice towards all nations and cultivating peace and harmony with all  excluding both  inveterate antipathies against particular nations  and passionate attachments for others    steer ing  clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world   and advocating trade with all nations  These policies became the basis of the Federalist Party in the 1790s  But the rival Jeffersonians feared Britain and favored France in the 1790s  declaring the War of 1812 on Britain  After the 1778 alliance with France  the U S  did not sign another permanent treaty until the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949  Over time  other themes  key goals  attitudes  or stances have been variously expressed by Presidential  doctrines   named for them  Initially these were uncommon events  but since WWII  these have been made by most presidents  Despite occasional entanglements with European Powers such as the War of 1812 and the 1898 Spanish American War  U S  foreign policy was marked by steady expansion of its foreign trade and scope during the 19th century  and it maintained its policy of avoiding wars with and between European powers  Concerning its domestic borders  the 1803 Louisiana Purchase doubled the nation s geographical area  Spain ceded the territory of Florida in 1819  annexation brought Texas in 1845  a war with Mexico in 1848 added California  Arizona and New Mexico  The U S  bought Alaska from the Russian Empire in 1867  and it annexed the Republic of Hawaii in 1898  Victory over Spain in 1898 brought the Philippines  and Puerto Rico  as well as oversight of Cuba  The short experiment in imperialism ended by 1908  as the U S  turned its attention to the Panama Canal and the stabilization of regions to its south  including Mexico  The 20th century was marked by two world wars in which the United States  along with allied powers  defeated its enemies and increased its international reputation  President Wilson s Fourteen Points  developed from his idealistic Wilsonianism program of spreading democracy and fighting militarism so as to end wars  It became the basis of the German Armistice  really a surrender  and the 1919 Paris Peace Conference  The resulting Treaty of Versailles  due to European allies  punitive and territorial designs  showed insufficient conformity with these points and the U S  signed separate treaties with each of its adversaries  due to Senate objections also  the U S  never joined the League of Nations  which was established as a result of Wilson s initiative  In the 1920s  the United States followed an independent course  and succeeded in a program of naval disarmament  and refunding the German economy  New York became the financial capital of the world  but the downside was that the Crash of 1929 hurled the entire world into the Great Depression  American trade policy relied on high tariffs under the Republicans  and reciprocal trade agreements under the Democrats  but in any case exports were at very low levels in the 1930s  The United States adopted a non interventionist foreign policy from 1932 to 1938  but then President Franklin D  Roosevelt moved toward strong support of the Allies in their wars against Germany and Japan  As a result of intense internal debate  the national policy was one of becoming the Arsenal of Democracy  that is financing and equipping the Allied armies without sending American combat soldiers  Roosevelt mentioned four fundamental freedoms  which ought to be enjoyed by people  everywhere in the world   these included the freedom of speech and religion  as well as freedom from want and fear  Roosevelt helped establish terms for a post war world among potential allies at the Atlantic Conference  specific points were included to correct earlier failures  which became a step toward the United Nations  American policy was to threaten Japan  to force it out of China  and to prevent its attacking the Soviet Union  However  Japan reacted by an attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941  and the United States was at war with Japan  Germany  and Italy  Instead of the loans given to allies in World War I  the United States provided Lend Lease grants of  50 000 000 000  Working closely with Winston Churchill of Britain  and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union  Roosevelt sent his forces into the Pacific against Japan  then into North Africa against Italy and Germany  and finally into Europe starting with France and Italy in 1944 against the Germans  The American economy roared forward  doubling industrial production  and building vast quantities of airplanes  ships  tanks  munitions  and  finally  the atomic bomb  Much of the American war effort went to strategic bombers  which flattened the cities of Japan and Germany  After the war  the U S  rose to become the dominant non colonial economic power with broad influence in much of the world  Almost immediately however  the world witnessed division into broad two camps during the Cold War  one side was led by the U S   and the other by the Soviet Union  but this situation also led to the establishment of the Non Aligned Movement  This period lasted until almost the end of the 20th century  and is thought to be both an ideological and power struggle between the two superpowers  A policy of containment was adopted to limit Soviet expansion  and a series of proxy wars were fought with mixed results  In 1991  the Soviet Union dissolved into separate nations  and the Cold War formally ended as the United States gave separate diplomatic recognition to the Russian Federation and other former Soviet states  With these changes to forty five years of established diplomacy and military confrontation  new challenges confronted U S  policymakers  citation needed  U S  foreign policy is characterized still by a commitment to free trade  protection of its national interests  and a concern for human rights citation needed   In the 21st century  U S  influence remains strong but  in relative terms  is declining in terms of economic output compared to rising nations such as China  India  Russia  Brazil  and the newly consolidated European Union  Substantial problems remain  such as climate change  nuclear proliferation  and the specter of nuclear terrorism  Foreign policy analysts Hachigian and Sutphen in their book The Next American Century suggest all six powers have similar vested interests in stability and terrorism prevention and trade  if they can find common ground  then the next decades may be marked by peaceful growth and prosperity  9   edit  Law This article appears to contradict the article Treaty  Please see discussion on the linked talk page  Please do not remove this message until the contradictions are resolved   February 2012  Main articles  Treaty and Treaty Clause In the United States  there are three types of treaty related law  Executive agreements Congressional executive agreements are made by the president or Congress  When made by Congress  a majority of both houses makes it binding much like regular legislation  While the constitution does not expressly state that these agreements are allowed  and constitutional scholars such as Laurence Tribe think they re unconstitutional  the U S  Supreme Court has upheld their validity  citation needed  Sole executive agreements are made by the president alone  Treaties are formal written agreements specified by the Treaty Clause of the Constitution  The president makes a treaty with foreign powers  but then the proposed treaty must be ratified by a two thirds vote in the Senate  For example  President Wilson proposed the Treaty of Versailles after World War I after consulting with allied powers  but this treaty was rejected by the U S  Senate  as a result  the U S  subsequently made separate agreements with different nations  While most international law has a broader interpretation of the term treaty  the U S  sense of the term is more restricted  In Missouri v  Holland  the Supreme Court ruled that the power to make treaties under the U S  Constitution is a power separate from the other enumerated powers of the federal government  and hence the federal government can use treaties to legislate in areas which would otherwise fall within the exclusive authority of the states  International law in most nations considers all three of the above agreements as treaties  In most nations  treaty laws supersede domestic law  So if there s a conflict between a treaty obligation and a domestic law  then the treaty usually prevails  In contrast to most other nations  the United States considers the three types of agreements as distinct  Further  the United States incorporates treaty law into the body of U S  federal law  As a result  Congress can modify or repeal treaties afterwards  It can overrule an agreed upon treaty obligation even if this is seen as a violation of the treaty under international law  Several U S  court rulings confirmed this understanding  including the 1900 Supreme Court decision in Paquete Habana  a late 1950s decision in Reid v  Covert  and a lower court ruling in 1986 in Garcia Mir v  Meese  Further  the Supreme Court has declared itself as having the power to rule a treaty as void by declaring it  unconstitutional   although as of 2011  it has never exercised this power  Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties  the State Department has taken the position that the Vienna convention represents established law  Generally when the U S  signs a treaty  it is binding  However  because of the Reid v  Covert decision  the U S  adds a reservation to the text of every treaty that says  in effect  that the U S  intends to abide by the treaty  but if the treaty is found to be in violation of the Constitution  then the U S  legally can t abide by the treaty since the U S  signature would be ultra vires   edit  Geography  edit  NATO A map of allies of the United States   NATO member states  including their colonies and overseas possessions   Major non NATO allies  plus Republic of China  Taiwan    Signatories of Partnership for Peace with NATO The United States is a

Kingdom  Under the NATO charter  the United States is compelled to defend any NATO state that is attacked by a foreign power  NATO is restricted to within the North American and European areas  Starting in 1989  the United States also created a major non NATO ally status  MNNA  for five nations  this number was increased in the late 1990s and following the September 11 attacks  it currently includes 14 nations  Each such state has a unique relationship with the United States  involving various military and economic partnerships and alliances   edit  United Kingdom Main article  United

two nations  relations are close and the two countries share the  world s longest undefended border   12  The border was demilitarized after the War of 1812 and  apart from minor raids  has remained peaceful  Military collaboration began during World War II and continued throughout the Cold War on both a bilateral basis and a multilateral relationship through NATO  A high volume of trade and migration between the United States and Canada since the 1850s has generated closer ties  despite continued Canadian fears of being culturally overwhelmed by its neighbor  which is nine times larger in terms of population and eleven times larger in terms of economy  13  14  The two economies have increasingly merged since the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  of 1994  which also

The United States  relationship with Australia is a very close one  with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stating that  America doesn t have a better friend in the world than Australia   17  The relationship is formalized by the ANZUS treaty and the Australia United States Free Trade Agreement  The two countries have a shared history  both have previously been British Colonies and many Americans flocked to the Australian goldfields in the 19th century  At a strategic level  the relationship really came to prominence in World War II  when the two nations worked extremely closely in the Pacific war against Japan  with General Douglas MacArthur undertaking his role as Supreme Allied Commander based in Australia  effectively having Australian troops and resources under his command  During this period  the cultural interaction between Australia and the U S  were elevated to a higher level as over 1 million U S  military personnel moved through Australia during the course of the war  The relationship continued to evolve throughout the second half of the 20th Century  and today now involves strong relationships at the executive and mid levels of government and the military

terrorism in the subcontinent   edit  Japan This section requires expansion  Matthew C  Perry in 1852 1854 went with battleships to Japan to open up trade  which pulled Japan to come out of isolationism and become involved with the outside world  The cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were both nuclear bombed by the United States during World War II  the only cities ever to be attacked in this manner  A deconstruction of the Japanese military then went into effect for several years  with most military units replaced and overseen by U S  troops  Relations since then have been excellent  The United States considers Japan to be one of its closest allies  and it is both a Major Non NATO ally and NATO contact country  The United States has several military bases in Japan including

  25   edit  China Main article  Sino American relations American relations with the People s Republic of China are complex  A great amount of trade between the two countries necessitates positive political relations  although periodic disagreements over tariffs and currency exchange rates do occur  China s status as a rising world power also strains relations  as many American conservatives see China as a long term military rival  The U S  criticizes China on human rights issues  Finally  the political status of Taiwan complicates relations  since the U S  does not officially recognize the country  but in fact offers the island protection against the threat of any invasion from China   edit  Taiwan Main article  Republic of China   United States relations Taiwan  Republic of China   does not have official diplomatic relations recognized and is no longer officially recognized by the State Department of the United States  but it conducts unofficial diplomatic relations through

partner for United States in both economy and geostrategic aspects  ASEAN s geostrategic importance stems from many factors  including  the strategic location of member countries  the large shares of global trade that pass through regional waters  and the alliances and partnerships which the United States shares with ASEAN member states  In July 2009  the United States signed ASEAN s Treaty of Amity and Cooperation  which establishes guiding principles intended to build confidence among its signatories with the aim of maintaining regional peace and stability  27  Trade flows are robust and

19  2008  37  38   edit  Hub and spoke vs multilateral While America s relationships with Europe have tended to be in terms of multilateral frameworks  such as NATO  America s relations with Asia have tended to be based on a series of bilateral relationships where the client states would coordinate with the United States in order to not have to deal directly with each other  On May 30  2009  at the Shangri La Dialogue Defense Secretary Robert M  Gates urged the nations of Asia to build on this hub and spoke model as they established and grew multilateral institutions such as ASEAN  APEC and the ad hoc arrangements in the area  39  However in 2011 Gates said that the United States must serve as the  indispensable nation   for building multilateral cooperation  40   edit  Oil  edit  Persian Gulf Further information  Energy policy of the United States and Petroleum politics The U S  currently produces about 40  of the oil that it consumes  its imports have exceeded domestic production since the early 1990s  Since the U S  s oil consumption continues to rise  and its oil production continues to fall  this ratio may continue to decline  41  Former U S  President George W  Bush identified dependence on imported oil as an urgent  national security concern   42  Two thirds of the world s proven oil reserves are estimated to be found in the Persian Gulf  43  44  Despite its distance  the Persian Gulf region was first proclaimed to be of national interest to the United States during World War II  Petroleum is of central importance to modern armies  and the United States as the world s leading oil producer at that time supplied most of the oil for the Allied armies  Many U S  strategists were concerned that the war would dangerously reduce the U S  oil supply  and so they sought to establish good relations with Saudi Arabia  a kingdom with large oil reserves  45  The Persian Gulf region continued to be regarded as an area of vital importance to the United States during the Cold War  Three Cold War United States Presidential doctrines the Truman Doctrine  the Eisenhower Doctrine  and the Nixon Doctrine played roles in the formulation of the Carter Doctrine  which stated that the United States would use military force if necessary to defend its  national interests  in the Persian Gulf region  46  Carter s successor  President Ronald Reagan  extended the policy in October 1981 with what is sometimes called the  Reagan Corollary to the Carter Doctrine   which proclaimed that the United States would intervene to protect Saudi Arabia  whose security was threatened after the outbreak of the Iran Iraq War  47  Some analysts have argued that the implementation of the Carter Doctrine and the Reagan Corollary also played a role in the outbreak of the 2003 Iraq War  48  49  50  51   edit  Canada Almost all of Canada s energy exports go to the United States  making it the largest foreign source of U S  energy imports  Canada is consistently among the top

accounting for 28 4  of exports  second in total to the EU at 31 4    81  of U S  imports from this region were petroleum products  53   edit  Foreign aid Main articles  United States foreign aid and United States Agency for International Development Foreign assistance is a core component of the State Department s international affairs budget and is considered an essential instrument of U S  foreign policy  There are four major categories of non military foreign assistance  bilateral development aid  economic assistance supporting U S  political and security goals  humanitarian aid  and multilateral economic contributions  for example  contributions to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund   54  In absolute dollar terms  the United States is the largest international aid donor   22 7 billion in 2006   but as a percent of gross national income  its contribution is only 0 2   proportionally much smaller than contributions of countries such as Sweden  1 04   and the United Kingdom  0 52   citation needed   The U S  Agency for International Development  USAID  manages the bulk of bilateral economic assistance  the Treasury Department handles most multilateral aid  Although the United States is the largest donor in absolute dollar terms  it is actually ranked 17 out of 22 countries on the Commitment to Development Index  The CDI ranks the 22 richest donor countries on their policies that affect the developing world  In the aid component the United States is penalized for low net aid volume as a share of the economy  a large share of tied or partially tied aid  and a large share of aid given to less poor and relatively undemocratic governments   edit  Military The United States has fought wars and intervened militarily on many occasions  See  Timeline of United States military operations  The U S  also operates a vast network of military bases around the world  See  List of United States military bases  In recent years  the U S  has used

The Strategic Defense Initiative  SDI  was a proposal by U S  President Ronald Reagan on March 23  1983 62  to use ground and space based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles  63  later dubbed  Star Wars   64  The initiative focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense doctrine of mutual assured destruction  MAD   Though it was never fully developed or deployed  the research and technologies of SDI paved the way for some anti ballistic missile systems of today  65  In February 2007  the U S  started formal negotiations with Poland and Czech Republic concerning construction of missile shield installations in those countries for a Ground Based Midcourse Defense system 66   in April 2007  57  of Poles opposed the plan   67  According to press reports the government of the Czech Republic agreed  while 67  Czechs disagree  68  to host a missile defense radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors is supposed to be built in Poland  69  70  Russia threatened to place short range nuclear missiles on the Russia s border with NATO if the United States refuses to abandon plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles and a radar in Poland and the Czech Republic  71  72  In April 2007  Putin warned of a new Cold War if the Americans deployed the shield in Central Europe  73  Putin also said that Russia is prepared to abandon its obligations under a Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1987 with the United States  74  On August 14  2008  The United States and Poland announced a deal to implement the missile defense system in Polish territory  with a tracking system placed in the Czech Republic  75   The fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between Russia and the United States over the situation in Georgia shows that  of course  the missile defense system will be deployed not against Iran but against the strategic potential of Russia   Dmitry Rogozin  Russia s NATO envoy  said  66  76   edit  Exporting Democracy See also  American democracy promotion in the Middle East and North Africa In United States history  critics have charged that presidents have used democracy to justify military intervention abroad  77  78  Critics have also charged that the U S  overthrew democratically elected governments in Iran  Guatemala  and in other instances  Studies have been devoted to the historical success rate of the U S  in exporting democracy abroad  Some studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the overall effectiveness of U S  efforts to encourage democracy in foreign nations  79  Until recently  scholars have generally agreed with international relations professor Abraham Lowenthal that U S  attempts to export democracy have been  negligible  often counterproductive  and only occasionally positive   80  81  Other studies find U S  intervention has had mixed results  79  and another by Hermann and Kegley has found that military interventions have improved democracy in other countries  82   edit  Opinion that U S  intervention does not export democracy Professor Paul W  Drake argued that the U S  first attempted to export democracy in Latin America through intervention from 1912 to 1932  Drake argued that this was contradictory because international law defines intervention as  dictatorial interference in the affairs of another state for the purpose of altering the condition of things   The study suggested that efforts to promote democracy failed because democracy needs to develop out of internal conditions  and can not be forcibly imposed  There was disagreement about what constituted democracy  Drake suggested American leaders sometimes defined democracy in a narrow sense of a nation having elections  Drake suggested a broader understanding was needed  Further  there was disagreement about what constituted a  rebellion   Drake saw a pattern in which the U S  State Department disapproved of any type of rebellion  even so called  revolutions   and in some instances rebellions against dictatorships  83  Historian Walter LaFeber stated   The world s leading revolutionary nation  the U S   in the eighteenth century became the leading protector of the status quo in the twentieth century   84  Mesquita and Downs evaluated 35 U S  interventions from 1945 to 2004 and concluded that in only one case  Colombia  did a  full fledged  stable democracy  develop within ten years following the intervention  85  Samia Amin Pei argued that nation building in developed countries usually unravelled four to six years after American intervention ended  Pei  based on study of a database on worldwide democracies called Polity  agreed with Mesquita and Downs that U S  intervention efforts usually don t produce real democracies  and that most cases result in greater authoritarianism after ten years  86  Professor Joshua Muravchik argued U S  occupation was critical for Axis power democratization after World War II  but America s failure to encourage democracy in the third world  prove    that U S  military occupation is not a sufficient condition to make a country democratic   87  88  The success of democracy in former Axis countries such as Italy were seen as a result of high national per capita income  although U S  protection was seen as a key to stabilization and important for encouraging the transition to democracy  Steven Krasner agreed that there was a link between wealth and democracy  when per capita incomes of  6 000 were achieved in a democracy  there was little chance of that country ever reverting to an autocracy  according to an analysis of his research in the Los Angeles Times  83   edit  Opinion that U S  intervention has mixed results Tures examined 228 cases of American intervention from 1973 to 2005  using Freedom House data  A plurality of interventions  96  caused no change in the country s democracy  In 69 instances the country became less democratic after the intervention  In the remaining 63 cases  a country became more democratic  79   edit  Opinion that U S  intervention effectively exports democracy Hermann and Kegley found that American military interventions designed to protect or promote democracy increased freedom in those countries  82  Penceny argued that the democracies created after military intervention are still closer to an autocracy than a democracy  quoting Przeworski  while some democracies are more democratic than others  unless offices are contested  no regime should be considered democratic   89  Therefore  Penceny concludes  it is difficult to know from the Hermann and Kegley study whether U S  intervention has only produced less repressive autocratic governments or genuine democracies  90  Penceny stated that the United States attempted to export democracy in 33 of its 93 20th century military interventions  91  Penceny argued that proliberal policies after military intervention had a positive impact on democracy  92   edit  Covert actions See also  Covert U S  regime change actions and Reagan Doctrine United States foreign policy also includes covert actions to topple foreign governments that have been opposed to the United States  In 1953 the CIA  working with the British government  endorsed the military in a coup d  tat against the anti British government of Iran led by Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh who had attempted to nationalize Iran s oil  threatening the interests of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company  93  See Operation Ajax   edit  War on Drugs Main article  War on Drugs United States foreign policy is influenced by the efforts of the U S  government to control imports of illicit drugs  including cocaine  heroin  methamphetamine  and cannabis  This is especially true in Latin America  a focus for the U S  War on Drugs  Those efforts date back to at least 1880  when the U S  and China completed an agreement that prohibited the shipment of opium between the two countries  Over a century later  the Foreign Relations Authorization Act requires the President to identify the major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries  In September 2005  4   the following countries were identified  Bahamas  Bolivia  Brazil  Burma  Colombia  Dominican Republic  Ecuador  Guatemala  Haiti  India  Jamaica  Laos  Mexico  Nigeria  Pakistan  Panama  Paraguay  Peru and Venezuela  Two of these  Burma and Venezuela are countries that the U S  considers to have failed to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months  Notably absent from the 2005 list were Afghanistan  the People s Republic of China and Vietnam  Canada was also omitted in spite of evidence that criminal groups there are increasingly involved in the production of MDMA destined for the United States and that large scale cross border trafficking of Canadian grown cannabis continues  The U S  believes that the Netherlands are successfully countering the production and flow of MDMA to the U S   edit  Criticism Main article  Criticism of American foreign policy Critics from the left cite episodes that undercut leftist governments or showed support for Israel  Others cite human rights abuses and violations of international law  Critics have charged that the U S  presidents have used democracy to justify military intervention abroad  77  78  It was also noted that the U S  overthrew democratically elected governments in Iran  Guatemala  and in other instances  Studies have been devoted to the historical success rate of the U S  in exporting democracy abroad  Some studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the overall effectiveness of U S  efforts to encourage democracy in foreign nations  79  Until recently  scholars have generally agreed with international relations professor Abraham Lowenthal that U S  attempts to export democracy have been  negligible  often counterproductive  and only occasionally positive   80  81  Other studies find U S  intervention has had mixed results  79  and another by Hermann and Kegley has found that military interventions have improved democracy in other countries  82   edit  Support Regarding support for certain anti Communist dictatorships during the Cold War  a response is that they were seen as a necessary evil  with the alternatives even worse Communist or fundamentalist dictatorships  David Schmitz says this policy did not serve U S  interests  Friendly tyrants resisted necessary reforms and destroyed the political center  though not in South Korea   while the  realist  policy of coddling dictators brought a backlash among foreign populations with long memories  94  95  Many democracies have voluntary military ties with United States  See NATO  ANZUS  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan  Mutual Defense Treaty with South Korea  and Major non NATO ally  Those nations with military alliances with the U S  can spend less on the military since they can count on U S  protection  This may give a false impression that the U S  is less peaceful than those nations   5   6  Research on the democratic peace theory has generally found that democracies  including the United States  have not made war on one another  There have been U S  support for coups against some democracies  but for example Spencer R  Weart argues that part of the explanation was the perception  correct or not  that these states were turning into Communist dictatorships  Also important was the role of rarely transparent United States government agencies  who sometimes mislead or did not fully implement the decisions of elected civilian leaders  96  Empirical studies  see democide  have found that democracies  including the United States  have killed much fewer civilians than dictatorships  97  98  Media may be biased against the U S  regarding reporting human rights violations  Studies have found that The New York Times coverage of worldwide human rights violations predominantly focuses on the human rights violations in nations where there is clear U S  involvement  while having relatively little coverage of the human rights violations in other nations  99  100  For example  the bloodiest war in recent time  involving eight nations and killing millions of civilians  was the Second Congo War  which was almost completely ignored by the media  Finally  those nations with military alliances with the U S  can spend less on the military and have a less active foreign policy since they can count on U S  protection  This may give a false impression that the U S  is less peaceful than those nations  101  102  Niall Ferguson argues that the U S  is incorrectly blamed for all the human rights violations in nations they have supported  He writes that it is generally agreed that Guatemala was the worst of the US backed regimes during the Cold War  However  the U S  cannot credibly be blamed for all the 200 000 deaths during the long Guatemalan Civil War  95  The U S  Intelligence Oversight Board writes that military aid was cut for long periods because of such violations  that the U S  helped stop a coup in 1993  and that efforts were made to improve the conduct of the security services  103  Today the U S  states that democratic nations best support U S  national interests  According to the U S  State Department   Democracy is the one national interest that helps to secure all the others  Democratically governed nations are more likely to secure the peace  deter aggression  expand open markets  promote economic development  protect American citizens  combat international terrorism and crime  uphold human and worker rights  avoid humanitarian crises and refugee flows  improve the global environment  and protect human health    7  According to former U S  President Bill Clinton   Ultimately  the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere  Democracies don t attack each other   104  In one view mentioned by the U S  State Department  democracy is also good for business  Countries that embrace political reforms are also more likely to pursue economic reforms that improve the productivity of businesses  Accordingly  since the mid 1980s  under President Ronald Reagan  there has been an increase in levels of foreign direct investment going to emerging market democracies relative to countries that have not undertaken political reforms   8  Leaked cables in 2010 suggested that the  dark shadow of terrorism still dominates the United States  relations with the world   105  The United States officially maintains that it supports democracy and human rights through several tools  9  Examples of these tools are as follows  A published yearly report by the State Department entitled  Supporting Human Rights and Democracy  The U S  Record  in compliance with a 2002 law  enacted and signed by President George W  Bush  which requires the Department to report on actions taken by the U S  Government to encourage respect for human rights   10  A yearly published  Country Reports on Human Rights Practices    11  In 2006  under President George W  Bush   the United States created a  Human Rights Defenders Fund  and  Freedom Awards    12  The  Human Rights and Democracy Achievement Award  recognizes the exceptional achievement of officers of foreign affairs agencies posted abroad   13  The  Ambassadorial Roundtable Series   created in 2006  are informal discussions between newly confirmed U S  Ambassadors and human rights and democracy non governmental organizations   14  The National Endowment for Democracy  a private non profit created by Congress in 1983  and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan  which is mostly funded by the U S  Government and gives cash grants to strengthen democratic institutions around the world  edit  See also Constitutional and International Law Advice and consent Afroyim v  Rusk Garcia Mir v  Meese List of United States treaties Missouri
