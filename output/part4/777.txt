presented as a group of superheroes like the Avengers  both to readers and to the Marvel Universe  who became heroes to help protect the world when the Avengers were declared dead after the events of the 1996  Onslaught  crossover  However the final page of the first issue of their comic book revealed that the Thunderbolts were the Masters of Evil in disguise  a surprise twist carefully guarded by Marvel  Themes of redemption and the nature of heroism are often featured in Thunderbolts comics  In subsequent storylines  the group rejects their leader Baron Zemo and attempts to become heroes in their own right  eventually under the leadership of the Avenger Hawkeye  The book has also garnered critical praise for its use of secondary characters from other Marvel Comics and its use of continuity themed storytelling  The Thunderbolts was an original concept created for Marvel Comics by Kurt Busiek and Mark Bagley  Most of the characters used in the final concept were reimagined versions of existing Marvel characters  with additional original characters for the series developed by Busiek and designed by Bagley  The pair also created the new heroic identities for the Masters of Evil  The Thunderbolts first appeared as a team in The Incredible Hulk  449  February 1997   written by Peter David and illustrated by Mike Deodato  Originally intended to be a similar team known as the  Echelon   the synchronization of the plans led to the Thunderbolts being used instead as a  teaser  for their own series  No mention was made of the connection between the Thunderbolts and the Masters of Evil in this appearance  save perhaps for the Hulk almost recognizing Meteorite s voice  having fought Moonstone before   The twist would not be revealed until the first issue of their own series  Soon after the publication of The Incredible Hulk  449  the team s own series premiered  The first issue  cover dated April 1997  was played largely as a straight superhero story  until the revelation of the Thunderbolts  true nature on the last page of the comic  This is considered one of the most well conceived plot twists in the history of American comic books  with Wizard magazine readers voting it  Comics  Greatest Moment of 1997  and later  in 1999  placing it at  11 on a list of  The 25 Greatest Comic Moments Ever   citation needed  Marvel managed to keep the secret of the Thunderbolts  true villainous identities tightly under wraps before the book launched  When word got out  the first issue sold out so quickly that Marvel not only offered a second printing  but also did a  mini trade paperback  collecting the first two issues  citation needed  Fabian Nicieza replaced Busiek in issue  34  Patrick Zircher  after a couple of fill ins  replaced Bagley in issue  51  The team also appeared in a one shot called Tales of the Marvel Universe  Despite critical acclaim  the book was reformatted with Thunderbolts  76  March 2003   removing the entire cast and creative team and replacing it with a brand new set of characters  along with a new writer  John Arcudi  1  The move was done in part due to Marvel Editor in Chief Joe Quesada s desire to emulate the success he had with X Force  which was reformatted with a new cast of characters and status quo that was successful in sales and popularity  However  the new direction for the series an underground fighting circuit that employed predominantly newly created super villain characters was a commercial failure citation needed  and canceled after six issues  In 2004  Marvel Comics launched a limited series titled Avengers Thunderbolts  which continued one year after the events of issue  75  citation needed  The limited series ran for the same number of issues as the reformatted Thunderbolts arc  Soon after the completion of Avengers Thunderbolts  Marvel Comics launched a second series featuring the characters with New Thunderbolts  1  January 2005   The storyline continued the events from Avengers Thunderbolts as well as the fall out of  Avengers Disassembled  and returned to the original series concept  though with a roster that lacked many fan favorites  such as Baron Zemo  Moonstone  and Techno   With the combination of the eighty one issues of the first series and the first eighteen issues of New Thunderbolts  the series reverted back to its original numbering with Thunderbolts  100  Thunderbolts  110 saw another change to the direction of the series  with writer Warren Ellis introducing a new team of Thunderbolts  2  3  villains working for the government  tasked with capturing unregistered superheroes  Ellis has stated that he chose to approach the series  gently  but directly from a political agenda  4  and the relaunch was closely tied to Marvel s commercially successful Civil War event  with the team serving as a dark reflection of the event s controversial ending  5  The Thunderbolts also feature in the Spider Man storyline  New Ways to Die   which is the first proper showdown between him and the team  6  7  8  Ellis stepped aside in issue  121 and was replaced by Christos Gage  who wrote three one shots 9  and a four issue tie in with Secret Invasion  10  11  At the 2008 San Diego Comic Con  Andy Diggle was announced as the new ongoing writer  12  starting in issue  126  November 2008  with a two issue story  Burning Down the House  which clears the way for the introduction of a new team line up  13  14  This team debuts in Thunderbolts  128 129  a story that deals with  Dark Reign   the Secret Invasion aftermath  14  15  which is followed by  Magnum Opus   a 4 issue crossover with Deadpool  vol  2   16  17  18  Miguel Sepulvida took over art duties with Thunderbolts  133 19  and Jeff Parker became the new writer with issue  138  20  Parker then piloted the title through the end of  Dark Reign   with a crossover with the Agents of Atlas team he was also writing  21  and into  Siege   following which the team will be revamped again    The status quo of the team undergoes a major overhaul for the new era to come  It s going to synthesize a lot of what readers like about recent history and re instill some elements from the early days of the book  22    The Heroic Age team debuted in Thunderbolts  144 with a new main artist  Kev Walker  23  24  25  The title crosses over with Avengers Academy in issue  147  which is bookended in the storyline by Avengers Academy  3 and  4  26  The series then goes on to crosses over with the Daredevil storyline  Shadowland  in issues  148 149  with artist Declan Shalvey stepping in for the two issues  27  28  29  The series then crossed over with the  Fear Itself  storyline in issues  158 163  30  31   edit  Fictional team biography The Thunderbolts  true identities as the Masters of Evil

Justice  Like Lightning    Justice  like lightning  ever should appear to few men s ruin  but to all men s fear  The series  slogan   Justice  Like Lightning     was attributed to a poem by Thomas

originally taken the slogan from the Roy Thomas penned issues of Captain Marvel  where the quote was similarly attributed to Randolph  74  The quote is frequently attributed to Joseph Swetnam  but this was not Swetnam himself  but rather a character based on him in the 1620 play Swetnam the Woman Hater Arraigned by Women  which was written by an unknown author  Busiek reports that one Thunderbolts fan located a version of the couplet attributed to Irish archbishop Milo Sweetman  who died in 1380  74   edit  Bibliography  edit  Eponymous series The Thunderbolts have headlined the
