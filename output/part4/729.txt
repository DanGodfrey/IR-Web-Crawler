member of a voting body of that member s power to vote in his absence  and or for the selection of additional representatives  as in the case with transitive proxies  Proxy appointments can be used to form a voting bloc that can exercise greater influence in deliberations or negotiations  A person so designated is called a  proxy  and the person designating him is called a  principal   The parliamentary manual Riddick s Rules of Procedure notes that under proxy voting  voting for officers should be done by ballot  due to the difficulties involved in authentication if a member simply

paper noted that proxy voting might be particularly useful in situations in which votes are cast as the discussion is ongoing  rather than at the end of a period of discussion   2  Full citation

some assemblies presently forbid proxy voting  For example  in both houses of the U S  Congress  as well as in most if not all state legislatures  each member must be present and cast his own vote for that vote to be counted  This can result  however  in the absence of a quorum and the need to compel attendance by a sufficient number of missing members to get a quorum  See call of the house  Various which   proposals have been made for a kind of automatic proxy voting in legislatures  For example  it has been proposed that instead of electing members from single member districts  that may have been gerrymandered   members be elected at large  but when seated each member cast the number of votes he or she received in the last election  Thus  if  for example  a state were allocated 32 members in the U S  House of Representatives  the 32 candidates who received the most votes in the at large election would be seated  but each would cast a different number of votes on the floor and in committee  This proposal would allow for representation of minority views in legislative deliberations  as it does in deliberations at shareholder meetings of corporations  The New Zealand Parliament allows proxy voting  Sections 155 156 of the Standing Orders of the New Zealand House of Representatives specify the procedures for doing so  A member can designate another member or a party to cast his vote  However  a party may not exercise proxies for more than 25  of its members  rounded upwards   3  The New Zealand Listener notes a controversial occurrence of proxy voting  The Labour Party was allowed to cast votes on behalf of Taito Phillip Field  who was frequently absent  Theoretically  this was to be allowed only if a legislator was absent on parliamentary business  public business or pressing private business  such as illness or bereavement  4  Until the Republican reforms of 1995 banished the practice  proxy voting was also used in U S  House of Representatives committees  Often members would delegate their vote to the ranking member of their party in the committee  Republicans opposed proxy voting on the grounds that it allowed an indolent Democratic majority to move legislation through committee with antimajoritarian procedures  That is  the Democratic leader in the committee would successfully oppose the sitting Republican majority by wielding the proxies of absent Democrats  5  Thomas E  Mann and Norman J  Ornstein write   In a large and fragmented institution in which every member has five or six places to be at any given moment  proxy voting is a necessary evil   6   edit  Elections Proxy voting is sometimes described as  the frequency with which spouses  union workers  and friends of friends are in effect sent off to the polls with an assignment to complete   The potential for proxy voting exists in roughly one voter out of five  and it is about twice as high at the middle levels of the sophistication continuum  According to W  Russell Neuman  the net effect of the cues provided by friends and associates is not likely to be as significant as those of the political parties  7  The possibility of expanded use of proxy voting has been the subject of much speculation  Terry F  Buss et al  write that internet voting would result in de facto approval of proxy voting  since passwords could be shared with others   Obviously  cost benefit calculations around the act of voting could also change substantially as organizations attempt to identify and provide inducements to control proxy votes without violating vote buying prohibitions in the law   8  One of the criticisms of proxy voting is that it carries a risk of fraud or intimidation  9  Another criticism is that it violates the concept of a secret ballot  in that paperwork may be filed  for instance  designating a party worker as one s proxy  10  It has been proposed that proxy voting be combined with initiative and referendum to form a hybrid of direct democracy and representative democracy   11  12  unreliable source  James C  Miller III  Ronald Reagan s budget director  suggested scrapping representative democracy and instead implementing a  program for direct and proxy voting in the legislative process   13  It has been suggested by Joseph Francis Zimmerman that proxy voting be allowed in New England town meetings  14  Proxy voting can eliminate some of the problems associated with the public choice dilemma of bundling   edit  Albania According to Arch Puddington et al   in Albanian Muslim areas  many women have been effectively disenfranchised through proxy voting by male relatives  15   edit  Algeria In Algeria  restrictions on proxy voting were instituted circa 1991 in order to undermine the Islamic Salvation Front  16   edit  Canada In Canada  the province of Nova Scotia allows citizens to vote by proxy if they expect to be absent  The Territories of Yukon  Northwest Territories  and Nunavut also allow for proxy voting  17  Canadian prisoners of war in enemy camps were allowed to vote through proxy voting  18  David Stewart and Keith Archer opine that proxy voting can result in leadership selection processes to become leader dominated  19  Proxy voting had only been available to military personnel since World War II  but was extended in 1970 and 1977 to include voters in special circumstances such as northern camp operators  fishermen  and prospectors  The Alberta Liberal Party ran into some difficulties  in that an unknown number of proxy ballots that were counted may have been invalid  20  Those who  through proxy voting or assistance of invalids  become knowledgeable of the principal s choice are bound to secrecy  21   edit  China Some Chinese provinces allow village residents to designate someone to vote on their behalf  Lily L  Tsai notes that  In practice  one family member often casts votes for everyone in the family even if they are present for the election  22  In 1997  a Carter Center delegation recommended abolishing the proxy voting that allowed one person to vote for three  the International Republican Institute had made a similar recommendation  23  Proxy voting also became an issue in relation to many of the Wenzhou people doing business outside  Most election disputes revolved around proxy votes  including the issues of who could represent them to vote and what kinds of evidence were acceptable for proxy voting  Intense competition made the proxy voting process more and more formal and transparent  Some villages required a notary to validate faxed proxy votes  some villages asked for faxed signatures  more often villages publicized those proxy votes so that villagers could directly monitor them  Taicang government reported a 99 4  voter turnout in its 1997 election  but a study showed that after removing proxy votes  only 48  of the eligible voters in the sample reported that they actually went to the central polling station to vote  24   edit  Gabon According to Mim Kelber   in Central Africa  all it takes for a man to cast a proxy vote for his wife is to produce an unwitnessed letter mentioning the name of the person to whom the voting power is delegated   The Gabon respondent to an Inter Parliamentary Union letter commented   It has been observed that this possibility was exploited to a far greater extent by men than by women  for reasons not always noble   25   edit  Guyana Proxy voting played an important role in Guyana politics in the 1960s  Prior to and during the 1961 elections  proxies had been severely restricted  Some restrictions were lifted  and there was a rise in proxy votes cast from 300 in 1961 to 6 635 in 1964  After that election  the Commonwealth Team of Observers voiced concern about proxy votes being liable to fraud  The proxy voting rules were relaxed further  and in 1969  official figures recorded 19 287 votes cast by proxy  about 7  of the total votes cast  an increase from 2 5  in 1964 to 1968   26  Amidst allegations of fraud  more restrictions were placed on proxy voting in 1973  in that year  about 10 000 votes were cast by proxy  27   edit  India In 2003  India s People s Representative Act was amended to allow armed forces personnel to appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf  28   edit  Iraq In Iraq  the Electoral Laws of 1924 and 1946 ruled out the possibility of proxy voting  except for illiterates  who could appoint someone to write for them  29   edit  Russia Some instances of proxy voting  usually by family members  in the Russian parliamentary elections of 1995 were noted by observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  30   edit  United Kingdom The provision for proxy voting in the UK dates back to James I  Long before women s suffrage  women sometimes voted as proxies for absent male family heads  Under British electoral law  ballot papers could not be sent overseas  10  British expatriates had no right to vote until the mid 1980s  They can now vote by proxy in general elections if they have been on a British electoral register at some point in the past 15 years  31  They can also vote by post  1  In the United Kingdom  electors may appoint a proxy  An elector can only act as a proxy for two people to whom they are not directly related  However  they can be a proxy for any number of electors if they are directly related to those electors  The voter can change his mind and vote in the election personally as long as his proxy has not already voted on his behalf or applied to vote by mail  32  Voters must provide a reason for using a proxy  such as being away on vacation  A narrower subset of reasons is permissible if the proxy is to be for more than one election  Except in cases of blindness  the validity of all proxies must be certified by someone such as an employer or doctor  33  In 2004  two Liberal Democrat councillors were found guilty of submitting 55 fraudulent proxy votes and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment  34  The Electoral Reform Society has proposed the abolition of proxy voting in the UK 35   edit  United States In 1635 36  Massachusetts granted to the frontier towns  liberty to stay soe many of their freemen at home for the safety of their towne as they judge needful  and that the said freemen that are appoyncted by the towne to stay at home shall have liberty for this court to send their voices by proxy   According to Charles Seymour and Donald Paige Frary  had not proxy voting been implemented  the inhabitants of the frontier towns would have lost their franchises  and the government would have represented only the freemen in the vicinity of Boston  The roads were poor  the drawing of all a village s men at once would have exposed it to Indian attacks  and at election time  the emigrants  labor was needed to get the spring planting into the ground  As late as 1680  and probably even after the charter was revoked in 1684  the Freeman might give his vote for Magistrates in person or proxy at the Court of Elections  36  Proxy voting was also adopted in colonies adjacent to Massachusetts  37  Indeed  traces of the practice of proxy voting remained in Connecticut s election laws until the final supersedure of her charter in 1819  38  In Maryland  the primary assemblies allowed proxy voting  After the assembly of 1638  protests were sent to the proprietor in England  It was said that the Governor and his friends were able to exercise too much influence through the proxies they had obtained  Proxy voting was also used in South Carolina  the proprietors in September 1683 complained to the governor about this system  Proxy voting was used in Long Island  New York as well  at that time  Phraseology was sometimes designed to hide the fact that a proxy system was in use and that the majority of voters did not actually attend the elections  In Rhode Island  the system described as a  proxy  system  from 1664 onward  was actually simply the sending of written ballots from voters who did not attend the election  rather than a true proxy system  as in the assembly of 1647   39  In Alabama  the Perry County Civic League s members  assisting illiterate voters by marking a ballot on their behalf was deemed  proxy voting  and  voting more than once  and thus held to be illegal  40  During the American Civil War  some northern soldiers used proxy voting  41  After Ira Eastman s near victory in New Hampshire  Republicans supported a bill to allow soldiers to vote by proxy  but it was ruled unconstitutional by the state supreme court  42  In the Progressive Era  proxy voting was used in Republican Party state conventions in New Hampshire  The Boston and Maine Railroad  the Republican Party s ally  maintained control over the Party by means of these conventions   At the 1906 state convention  for instance  party delegates were quite willing to trade  sell  or exchange their voting power in return for various forms of remuneration from the party machine  Public outcry led to the end of such  proxy  voting   43  Proxy voting was used in some American U S  Presidential nominating caucuses  In one case  Eugene McCarthy supporters were in the majority of those present but were outvoted when the presiding party official cast 492 proxy votes   three times the number present   for his own slate of delegates  44  After the nomination of Hubert Humphrey  the New Politics movement charged that Humphrey and party bosses had circumvented the will of Democratic Party members by manipulating the rules to Humphrey s advantage  In response  the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection  also known as the McGovern Fraser Commission  was created to rework the rules in time for the 1972 Democratic National Convention  State parties were required to ban proxy voting in order to have their delegates seated at the national convention  43  It was said that these rules had been used in  highly selective  ways  45  Several attempts have been made to place proxy voting related initiatives on the California ballot  but all have failed  46   edit  United States law on proxies   The template below  Expert subject  is being considered for deletion  See templates for discussion to help reach a consensus   This section needs attention from an expert on the subject  See the talk page for details  WikiProject Law or the Law Portal may be able to help recruit an expert   October 2008  Proxy is defined by supreme courts as  an authority or power to do a certain thing   47  A person can confer on his proxy any power which he himself possesses  He may also give him secret instructions as to voting upon particular questions  48  But a proxy is ineffectual when it is contrary to law or public policy  49  Where the proxy is duly appointed and he acts within the scope of the proxy  the person authorizing the proxy is bound by his appointee s acts  including his errors or mistakes  50  When the appointer sends his appointee to a meeting  the proxy may do anything at that meeting necessary to a full and complete exercise of the appointer s right to vote at such meeting  This includes the right to vote to take the vote by ballot  or to adjourn  and  hence  he may also vote on other ordinary parliamentary motions  such as to refer  postpone  reconsider  etc   when necessary or when deemed appropriate and advantageous to the overall object or purpose of the proxy   51  A proxy cannot vote when the principal himself is present and votes  He can vote only in the principal s absence  52  Where the authority conferred upon a proxy is limited to a designated or special purpose  a vote for another and different purpose is ineffective  53  A proxy in the usual  ordinary form confers authority to act only at the meeting then in contemplation  and in any adjourned meetings of the same  hence  it may not be voted at another or different meeting held under a new call  54  A proxy s unauthorized acts may be ratified by his appointer  and such ratification is equivalent to previous authority  55  According to the weight of authority  a proxy only to vote stock may be revoked at any time  notwithstanding any agreement that it shall be irrevocable  56  The sale in the meantime by a stockholder of his shares in a corporation or company automatically revokes any proxies made or given to vote in respect of such shares  57  And a proxy is also revoked where the party giving it attends the election in person  or gives subsequent proxy  58  Hence  a proxy cannot vote when the owner of the stock arrives late or is present and votes  59   edit  Vietnam In Vietnam  proxy voting was used to increase turnout  Presently  proxy voting is illegal  but it has nonetheless been occurring since before 1989  It is estimated to contribute about 20  to voter turnout  and has been described as  a convenient way to fulfil one s duty  avoid possible risks  and avoid having to participate directly in the act of voting   It is essentially a compromise between the party state  which wants to have high turnouts as proof of public support  and voters who do not want to go to the polling stations  In the Soviet Union  proxy voting was also illegal but done in order to increase turnout figures  60   edit  Nonprofit organization settings Proxy voting is automatically prohibited in organizations that have adopted Robert s Rules of Order  RONR  or The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure  TSC  as their parliamentary authority  unless it is provided for in its bylaws or charter or required by the laws of its state of incorporation  61  Robert s Rules  10th Edition expands this such that  if the law under which an organization is incorporated allows proxy voting to be prohibited by a provision of the bylaws  the adoption of this book as a parliamentary authority by prescription in the bylaws should be treated as sufficient provision to accomplish that result   RONR 10th ed  pp  414 415  l  33 2   Demeter says the same thing  but also states that  if these laws do not prohibit voting by proxy  the body can pass a law permitting proxy voting for any purpose desired   62  RONR opines   Ordinarily it should neither be allowed nor required  because proxy voting is incompatible with the essential characteristics of a deliberative assembly in which membership is individual  personal  and nontransferable  In a stock corporation  on the other hand  where the ownership is transferable  the voice and vote of the member also is transferable  by use of a proxy    63  While Riddick opins that  proxy voting properly belongs in incorporate organizations that deal with stocks or real estate  and in certain political organizations   it also states   If a state empowers an incorporated organization to use proxy voting  that right cannot be denied in the bylaws   Riddick further opins   Proxy voting is not recommended for ordinary use  It can discourage attendance  and transfers an inalienable right to another without positive assurance that the vote has not been manipulated   1  Parliamentary Law expounds on this point  64    It is used only in stock corporations where the control is in the majority of the stock  not in the majority of the stockholders  If one person gets control of fifty one per cent of the stock he can control the corporation  electing such directors as he pleases in defiance of the hundreds or thousands of holders of the remaining stock  The laws for stock corporations are nearly always made on the theory that the object of the organization is to make money by carrying on a certain business  using capital supplied by a large number of persons whose control of the business should be in proportion to the capital they have put into the concern  The people who have furnished the majority of the capital should control the organization  and yet they may live in different parts of the country  or be traveling at the time of the annual meeting  By the system of proxy voting they can control the election of directors without attending the meetings    Nonetheless  it is common practice in conventions for a delegate to have an alternate  who is basically the same as a proxy  Demeter s Manual notes that the alternate has all the privileges of voting  debate and participation in the proceedings to which the delegate is entitled  62  Moreover   if voting has for years   been conducted   by proxy   such voting by long and continuous custom has the force of law  and the proceedings are valid   65  Thomas E  Arend notes that U S  laws allow proxy votes to be conducted electronically in certain situations   The use of electronic media may be permissible for proxy voting  but such voting is generally limited to members  Given the fiduciary duties that are personal to each director  and the need for directors to deliberate to ensure properly considered decisions  proxy voting by directors is usually prohibited by statute  In contrast  a number of state nonprofit corporate statutes allow for member proxy voting and may further allow members to use electronic media to grant a proxy right to another party for member voting purposes   66  Sturgis agrees   Directors or board members cannot vote by proxy in their meetings  since this would mean the delegation of a discretionary legislative duty which they cannot delegate   61  Proxy voting  even if allowed  may be limited to infrequent use if the rules governing a body specify minimum attendance requirements  For instance  bylaws may prescribe that a member can be dropped for missing three consecutive meetings  67  The Journal of Mental Science noted the arguments raised against adopting proxy voting for the Association  These included that possibility that it would diminish attendance at meetings  The rejoinder was that people did not go there to vote  they attending the meetings for the sake of the meeting  the discussion  and the good fellowship  68  In 2005  the Libertarian Party of Colorado  following intense debate  enacted rules allowing proxy voting  69  A motion to limit proxies to 5 per person was defeated  70  Some people favored requiring members attending the convention to bring a certain number of proxies  in order to encourage them to politick  71  In 2006  the party repealed those bylaw provisions due to concerns that a small group of individuals could use it to take control of the organization  72   edit  Corporate settings Main article  Proxy statement Under the common law  shareholders had no right to cast votes by proxy in corporate meetings without special authorization  In Walker v  Johnson  73  the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia explained that the reason was that early corporations were of a municipal  religious or charitable nature  in which the shareholder had no pecuniary interest  The normal mode of conferring corporate rights was by an issue of a charter from the crown  essentially establishing the corporation as a part of the government  Given the personal trust placed in these voters by the king  it was inappropriate for them to delegate to others  In the Pennsylvania case of Commonwealth ex rel  Verree v  Bringhurst  74  the court held that members of a corporation had no right to vote by proxy at a corporate election unless such right was expressly conferred by the charter or by a bylaw  The attorneys for the plaintiff argued that the common law rules had no application to trading or moneyed corporations where the relation was not personal  The court found   The fact that it is a business corporation in no wise dispenses with the obligation of all members to assemble together  unless otherwise provided  for the exercise of a right to participate in the election of their officers   At least as early as the 18th century  however  clauses permitting voting by proxy were being inserted in corporate charters in England  75  Proxy voting is commonly used in corporations for voting by members or shareholders  because it allows members who have confidence in the judgment of other members to vote for them and allows the assembly to have a quorum of votes when it is difficult for all members to attend  or there are too many members for all of them to conveniently meet and deliberate  Proxy firms commonly advise institutional shareholders on how they should vote  Proxy solicitation firms assist in helping corral votes for a certain resolution  76  Domini notes that in the corporate world   Proxy ballots typically contain proposals from company management on issues of corporate governance  including capital structure  auditing  board composition  and executive compensation   77  Proxies are essentially the corporate law equivalent of absentee balloting  Shareholders send in a card  called a proxy card  on which they mark their vote  The card authorizes a proxy agent to vote the shareholder s stock as directed on the card  The proxy card may specify how shares are to be voted or may simply give the proxy agent discretion to decide how the shares are to be voted  Under Securities Exchange Commission Rule 14a 3  the incumbent board of directors  first step in soliciting proxies must be the distribution to shareholders of the firm s annual report  An insurgent may independently prepare proxy cards and proxy statements  which are sent to the shareholders  78  Associations of institutional investors sometimes attempt to effect social change  For instance  several hundred faith based institutional investors  such as denominations  pensions  etc  belong to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility  These organizations commonly exercise influence through shareholder resolutions  which may spur management to action and lead to the resolutions  withdrawal before an actual vote on the resolution is taken  79  In the absence of his principal from the annual meeting of a business corporation  the proxy has the right to vote in all instances  but he has not the right to debate or otherwise participate in the proceedings unless he is a stockholder in that same corporation  62  The Securities Exchange Commission has ruled that an investment adviser who exercises voting authority over his clients  proxies has a fiduciary responsibility to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the adviser votes proxies in the best interests of clients  to disclose to clients information about those policies and procedures  to disclose to clients how they may obtain information on how the adviser has voted their proxies  and to keep certain records related to proxy voting  80  This ruling has been criticized on many grounds  including the contention that it places unnecessary burdens on investment advisers and would not have prevented the major accounting scandals of the early 2000s  81  It is possible for overvotes and undervotes to occur in corporate proxy situations  82  Even in corporate settings  proxy voting s use is generally limited to voting at the annual meeting for directors  for the ratification of acts of the directors  for enlargement or diminution of capital  and for other vital changes in the policy of the organization  These proposed changes are summarized in the circular sent to shareholders prior to the annual meeting  The stock transfer book is closed at least ten days before the annual meeting  to enable the secretary to prepare a list of stockholders and the number of shares held by each  Stock is voted as shown by the stock book when posted  All proxies are checked against this list  64  It is possible to designate two or more persons to act as proxy by using language appointing  for instance   A  B  C  D  and E  F  or any of them  attorneys and agents for me  irrevocable  with full power by the affirmative vote of a majority of said attorneys and agents to appoint a substitute or substitutes for and in the name and stead of me   64  Proxy voting is said to have some anti deliberative consequences  in that proxy holders often lack discretion about how to cast votes due to the instructions given by their principal  Thus  they cannot alter their decision based on the deliberative process of testing the strength of arguments and counter arguments  83  In Germany  corporate proxy voting is done through banks  84  Proxy voting by banks has been a key feature of the connection of banks to corporate ownership in Germany since the industrialization period

Bryan Ford  92  James Green Armytage 93  and Michael Allan  86  Delegate voting is used by the Swedish local political party Demoex  Demoex won their first seat in the city council of Vallentuna  Sweden  in 2002  The first years of activity in the party have been evaluated by Mitth gskolan University in a paper by Karin Ottesen in 2003  94  In Demoex  a voter can also vote directly  even if she has delegated her vote to a proxy  the direct vote overrules the proxy vote  It is also possible to change the proxy at any time  In 2005  in a pilot study in Pakistan  Structural Deep Democracy  SD2 95  96 was used for leadership selection in a sustainable agriculture group called Contact Youth  SD2 uses PageRank for the processing of the transitive proxy votes  with the additional constraints of mandating at least two initial proxies per voter  and all voters are proxy candidates  More complex variants can be built on top of SD2  such as adding specialist proxies and direct votes for specific issues  but SD2 as the underlying umbrella system  mandates that generalist proxies should always be used  Delegated voting is also used in the World Parliament Experiment   edit
