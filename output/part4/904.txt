Deutschland  in the period between its creation in May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990  During this period  West Germany and the communist East Germany were divided by the Inner German border  After 1961  West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall  This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city state of Berlin  The enlarged Federal Republic of Germany with sixteen states  known simply as  Germany   is thus the continuation of the pre 1990 Federal Republic of Germany  The Federal Republic of Germany was established from eleven states formed in the three Allied Zones of occupation held by the United States  the United Kingdom and France  the  Western Zones    The city of Bonn was its provisional capital city  The fourth Allied occupation zone  the East Zone  or Ostzone  was held by the Soviet Union  The parts of this zone lying east of the Oder Neisse were in fact annexed by the Soviet Union and communist Poland  the remaining central part around Berlin became the communist German Democratic Republic  abbreviated GDR  in German Deutsche Demokratische Republik or DDR  with its de facto capital in East Berlin  As a result  West Germany had a territory about half the size of the interwar democratic Weimar Republic  At the onset of the Cold War  Germany  and  indeed  Europe  was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs  Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories  the Saarland and divided Berlin  The Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany  considering itself to be the democratically reorganised continuation of the German Reich  It took the line that the GDR was an illegally constituted state  The GDR did hold regular elections  but these were not free and fair  from the West German perspective the GDR was thus a puppet state of the Soviets and therefore illegitimate  Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden W rttemberg in 1952  and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957  In addition to the resulting ten states  West Berlin was considered an unofficial de facto 11th state  While legally not part of the Federal Republic of Germany  as Berlin was under the control of the Allied Control Council  West Berlin aligned itself politically with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions  Relations with the Soviet bloc improved during the era of  Neue Ostpolitik  around 1970  and West Germany began taking the line of  two German states within one German nation   but formally maintained the exclusive mandate  It recognised the GDR as a de facto government within a single German nation that in turn was represented de jure by the West German state alone  East Germany  as before  recognised the existence of two German countries de jure  and the West as both de facto and de jure foreign country  The Federal Republic and the GDR agreed that neither of them could speak in the name of the other one  The foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the Wirtschaftswunder  economic miracle  of the 1950s when West Germany rose from the enormous destruction wrought by World War II to become the world s third largest economy  The first chancellor Konrad Adenauer  who remained in office until 1963  had worked for a full alignment with the West rather than neutrality  He not only secured a membership in NATO but was also a proponent of agreements that developed into the present day European Union  When the G6 G8 was established in 1975  there was no question whether the Federal Republic of Germany would be a member as well  With the collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989  symbolised by the opening of the Berlin Wall  there was a rapid move towards German reunification  East Germany voted to dissolve itself and accede to the Federal Republic in 1990  Its five post war states  L nder  were reconstituted along with the reunited Berlin  which ended its special status and formed an additional Land  They formally joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990  raising the number of states from 10 to 16  ending the division of Germany  The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany s political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations  as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like the European Union and NATO  Contents 1 Naming conventions 2 History 2 1 NATO membership 2 2 The Sixties  a time for reforms 2 3 Political

Germany  adopted in 1949 and unchanged since  is Bundesrepublik Deutschland  Federal Republic of Germany   Its abbreviation  BRD   German  or  FRG   English  was sometimes also used  In East Germany usage the terms Westdeutschland  West ern  Germany  or westdeutsche Bundesrepublik  West German Federal Republic  were preferred during the 1950s and 1960s  This changed especially once East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners foreigners under its second constitution in 1968 abandoning the idea of a single German nation formerly upheld in East and West Germany alike  Starting in East German Neues Deutschland the initialism BRD  FRG  for the Federal Republic of Germany prevailed beginning in the early 1970s  while East German official sources adopted that initialism as the standard expression in 1973  followed by the usage of respective native abbreviations in all of the Eastern Bloc  In reaction to this move  in 1965 the Federal Minister of All German Affairs Erich Mende issued the Directives for the appellation of Germany recommending avoiding the initialism  On 31 May 1974 the heads of German federal and state governments recommended to always use the full name in official publications  From then on West German sources began to avoid the abbreviated form  except left leaning sources who started to embrace it  In November 1979 the federal government informed the Bundestag that the West German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF had agreed to refuse to use the initialism  1  The different usages were so ingrained that one could deduce a person s or source s political leaning from the name used for West Germany  Meanwhile the colloquial term  West Germany  or its equivalents were used in many other languages   Westdeutschland  was also a widespread colloquial form used in German speaking countries  usually without political overtones   edit  History History of Germany This article is part of a series Early History Germanic peoples

World War II  leaders from the United States  the United Kingdom  and the Soviet Union held the Yalta Conference where future arrangements with post war Europe and actions to be made against Japan in the Pacific were negotiated  The conference came to the agreement to split Germany into four occupation zones the French Zone in the far west  the British Zone in the northwest  the American Zone in the south  and the Soviet Zone in the east  It then was not the intention to split Germany  only to designate zones of administration  Former German areas east of the rivers Oder and Neisse were put under Polish administration  and millions of Germans were expelled from there  to be replaced by Poles   With the Soviet Union likewise taking a big bite from eastern Poland and East Prussia  In 1946 1949  the first three zones were combined in steps  First the British and American zones were combined into the quasi state of Bizonia  then only months afterward the French zone was included into Trizonia  At the same time  new federal states  L nder  were formed in the Allied zones  replacing the pre war states  In 1949  with the continuation and aggravation of the Cold War  witness the Berlin Airlift of 1948 49   the two German states that were originated in the Western Allied and the Soviet Zones became known internationally as West Germany and East Germany  Commonly known in English as East Germany  the former Soviet Occupation Zone  became the German Democratic Republic or GDR  From 3 October 1990  after the reformation of the GDR s L nder  the East German states joined the Federal Republic   edit  NATO membership West Germany  blue  and West Berlin  yellow   after accession of the Saarland in 1957  before the five L nder from the GDR and East Berlin joined in 1990 The Federal Republic of Germany  founded on 23 May 1949  was declared  fully sovereign  on 5 May 1955  The former occupying Western troops remained on the ground  now as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO   which West Germany joined on 9 May 1955  promising to rearm itself soon  West Germany became a focus of the Cold War with its juxtaposition to East Germany  a member of the subsequently founded Warsaw Pact  The former capital  Berlin  had been divided into four sectors  with the Western Allies joining their sectors to form West Berlin  while the Soviets held East Berlin  West Berlin was completely surrounded by East German territory and had suffered a Soviet blockade in 1948 1949  which was overcome by the Berlin airlift  Konrad Adenauer in parliament  1955 The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 led to U S  calls to rearm West Germany to help defend Western Europe from the perceived Soviet threat  Germany s partners in the Coal and Steel Community proposed to establish a European Defence Community  EDC   with an integrated army  navy and air force  composed of the armed forces of its member states  The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control  but the other EDC member states  Belgium  France  Italy  Luxembourg and the Netherlands  would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces  Though the EDC treaty was signed  May 1952   it never entered into force  France s Gaullists rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty  and when the French National Assembly refused to ratify it  August 1954   the treaty died  The French Gaullists and communists had killed the French government s proposal  Other means then had to be found to allow West German rearmament  In response  at the London and Paris Conferences  the Brussels Treaty was modified to include West Germany  and to form the Western European Union  WEU   West Germany was to be permitted to rearm  an idea many Germans rejected   and have full sovereign control of its military  called the Bundeswehr  The WEU  however  would regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states  Also  the German constitution prohibited any military action  except in case of an external attack against Germany or its allies  B ndnisfall   Also  Germans could reject military service on grounds of conscience  and serve for civil purposes instead  The three Western Allies retained occupation powers in Berlin and certain responsibilities for Germany as a whole  Under the new arrangements  the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense  pursuant to stationing and status of forces agreements  With the exception of 55 000 French troops  Allied forces were under NATO s joint defense command   France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966    edit  The Sixties  a time for reforms The grand old man of German postwar politics had to be dragged almost literally out of office in 1963  In 1959  it was time to elect a new President and Adenauer decided that he would place Erhard in this office  Erhard was not enthusiastic  and to everybody s surprise  Adenauer decided at the age of 83 that he would take on the position  His aim was apparently to remain in control of German politics for another ten years ins spite of the growing mood for change  but when his advisers informed him just how limited the powers of the president were he quickly lost interest  2  An alternative candidate was needed and eventually the Minister of Agriculture  Heinrich L bke took on the task and was duly elected  In October 1962  the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel published an analysis of the West German military defence  the conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system  Ten days after publication  the offices of Spiegel in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized  Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the Bundestag that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted  The editor owner of the magazine  Augstein spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored  The FDP members of Adenauer s cabinet resigned from the government  demanding the resignation of Franz Josef Strauss  Defence Minister  who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis  Adenauer s own reputation was impaired and he announced that he would step down in the Fall of 1963  His successor was to be Ludwig Erhard  3  In the early sixties  the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly  In 1962  growth rate was 4 7  and the following year  2 0   After a brief recovery  the growth rate petered into a recession  with no growth in 1967  In order to deal with this problem a new coalition was formed  Kiesinger s 1966 69 grand coalition was between West Germany s two largest parties  the CDU CSU and the Social Democratic Party  SPD   This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the two thirds majority of votes required for their ratification  These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a state of emergency  Rudi Dutschke  student leader During the time leading up to the passing of the laws  there was fierce opposition to them  above all by the Free Democratic Party  the rising German student movement  a group calling itself Notstand der Demokratie  Democracy in Crisis  and members of the Campaign against Nuclear Armament  A key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967  when the Shah of Persia visited West Berlin  Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Opera House where he was to attend a special performance  Supporters of the Shah  later known as  Jubelperser    armed with staves and bricks attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched  A demonstration in the centre was being forceably dispersed when a bystander named Benno Ohnesorg was shot in the head and killed by a plain clothed policeman   It has now been established that the policeman  Kurras  was a paid spy of the east German security forces   Protest demonstrations continued  and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made  which was declared by the press  especially the tabloid Bild Zeitung newspaper  as a massive disruption to life in Berlin  in a massive campaign against the protesters  Protests against the US intervention in Vietnam  mingled with anger over the vigour with which demonstrations were repressed led to mounting militance among the students at the universities in Berlin  One of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from East Germany called Rudi Dutschke who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in West Berlin  Just before Easter 1968  a young man tried to kill Dutschke as he bicycled to the student union  seriously injuring him  All over West Germany  thousands demonstrated against the Springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students  Trucks carrying newspapers were set on fire and windows in office buildings broken  4  In the wake of these demonstrations  in which the question of America s role in Vietnam began to play a bigger role  came a desire among the students to find out more about the role of the parent generation in the Nazi era  The proceedings of the War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg had been widely publicised in Germany but until a new generation of teachers  educated with the findings of historical studies  could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed in the name of the German people  One courageous attorney  Fritz Bauer patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the Auschwitz concentration camp and about twenty were put on trial in Frankfurt in 1963  Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that the Shoah was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed   The term  Holocaust  for the systematic mass murder of Jews first came into use in 1979  when an American mini series with that name was shown on German television   The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later  The calling in question of the actions and policies of government led to a new climate of debate  The issues of emancipation  colonialism  environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society  In 1979 the environmental party  the Greens  reached the 5  limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the Bremen provincial election  Also of great significance was the steady growth of a feminist movement in which women demonstrated for equal rights  Until 1979  a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account  Parallel to this  a gay movement began to grow in the larger cities  especially in West Berlin  where homosexuality had been widely accepted during the twenties in the Weimar Republic  Anger over the treatment of demonstrators following the death of Benno Ohnesorg and the attack on Rudi Dutschke  coupled with growing frustration over the lack of success in achieving their aims led to growing militance among students and their supporters  In May 1968  three young people set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt  they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the  struggle against imperialism    5  The student movement began to split into different factions  ranging from the unattached liberals to the Maoists and supporters of direct action in every form the anarchists  Several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalising the industrial workers and taking an example form activities in Italy of the Brigade Rosse  many students went to work in the factories  but with little or no success  The most notorious of the underground groups was the  Baader Meinhof Group   later known as the RAF which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen  several bystanders and eventually two prominent West Germans  whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas  In the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name  RAF   The last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998  Evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by German Intelligence undercover agents has since emerged  partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims  the State Counsel Buback  6   edit  Political Developments 1969 1990 In the 1969 election  the SPD headed by Willy Brandt gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP  Although Chancellor for only just over four years  Willy Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period  Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of he Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality  Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany s eastern neighbours  a policy opposed by the CDU  The issue of improving relations with Poland  Czechoslovakia and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister  Walther Scheel  FDP  negotiated agreements with all three countries   Moscow Agreement  August 1970  Warsaw Agreement  December 1970  Four Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany  signed in December 1972    7  These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led  in the long term to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Unions control over Eastern Europe  Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974  after G nter Guillaume  a senior member of his staff  was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service  the Stasi  Brandt s contributions to world peace led to his nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971  Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt  SPD  formed a coalition and he served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982  Hans Dietrich Genscher  a leading FDP official  became Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister  Schmidt  a strong supporter of the European Community  EC  and the Atlantic alliance  emphasized his commitment to  the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA   8  In October 1982  the SPD FDP coalition fell apart when the FDP joined forces with the CDU CSU to elect CDU Chairman Helmut Kohl as Chancellor in a Constructive Vote of No Confidence  Following national elections in March 1983  Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU  The CDU CSU fell just short of an absolute majority  due to the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens  who received 5 6  of the vote  In January 1987  the Kohl Genscher government was returned to office  but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties  Kohl s CDU and its Bavarian sister party  the CSU  slipped from 48 8  of the vote in 1983 to 44 3   The SPD fell to 37   long time SPD Chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by Hans Jochen Vogel  The FDP s share rose from 7  to 9 1   its best showing since 1980  The Greens  share rose to 8 3  from their 1983 share of 5 6    edit  Reunification Main article  German reunification The official German reunification ceremony on 3 October 1990 was held at the Reichstag building  including Chancellor Helmut Kohl  President Richard von Weizs cker  former Chancellor Willy Brandt and many others  One day later  the parliament of the united Germany would assemble in an act of symbolism in the Reichstag building  However  at that time  the role of Berlin had not yet been decided upon  Only after a fierce debate  considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of parliament  the Bundestag concluded on 20 June 1991  with quite a slim majority  that both government and parliament should move to Berlin from Bonn   edit  West German economic miracle The West German Wirtschaftswunder  English   economic miracle   coined by The Times of London in 1950   was partly due to the economic aid provided by the United States and the Marshall Plan  but mainly due to the currency reform of 1948  which replaced the Reichsmark with the Deutsche Mark as legal tender  halting rampant inflation  The Allied dismantling of the West German coal and steel industry finally ended in 1950  Volkswagen Beetle   for many years the most successful car in the world   on the assembly line in Wolfsburg factory  1973 In addition to the physical obstacles that had to be overcome for the German economic recovery  see the Morgenthau Plan  there were also intellectual challenges  The Allies confiscated intellectual privileges of huge value  such as all German patents  both in Germany and abroad  and used them to strengthen their own industrial competitiveness by licensing them to Allied companies  9  10  Meanwhile some of the best German researchers were being put to work in the Soviet Union and in the U S  Contrary to popular belief  the Marshall Plan  which was extended to include the newly formed West Germany in 1949  was not the main force behind the Wirtschaftswunder  11  12  Had that been the case  other countries such as Great Britain and France  which both received higher economic assistance from the plan than Germany  should have experienced the same phenomenon  In fact  the amount of monetary aid  which was in the form of loans  received by Germany through the Marshall Plan was far overshadowed by the amount the Germans had to pay back as war reparations and by the charges the Allies exacted from the Germans for the ongoing cost of occupation  about  2 4 billion per year   In 1953 it was decided that Germany was to repay  1 1 billion of the aid it had received  The last repayment was made in June 1971  The Korean war  1950 1953  led to a worldwide increased demand for goods  and the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products  At the time Germany had a large pool of skilled and cheap labour  partly as a result of the deportations and migrations  which affected up to 16 5 million Germans  This helped Germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war  Apart from these factors  hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and 1960s extra labour supplied by thousands of Gastarbeiter   guest workers   provided a vital base for the economic upturn  This would have implications later on for successive German governments as they tried to assimilate this group of workers  13  From the late 1950s onwards  West Germany had one of the strongest economies in the world  almost as strong as before the Second World War  The East German economy showed a certain growth  but not as much as in West Germany  partly because of continued reparations to the USSR in terms of resources  In 1952 West Germany became part of the European Coal and Steel Community  which would later evolve into the European Union  On 5 May 1955 West Germany was declared  fully sovereign   The British  French and U S  militaries remained in the country  just as the Soviet Army remained in East Germany  Four days after becoming  fully sovereign  in 1955  West Germany joined NATO  The U S  retained an especially strong presence in West Germany  acting as a deterrent in case of a Soviet invasion  In 1976 West Germany became one of the founding nations of the Group of Six  G6   In 1973  West Germany home to roughly 1 26  of the world s population featured the world s fourth largest GDP of 944 billion  5 9  of the world total   In 1987 the FRG held a 7 4  share of total world production   edit  Position towards East Germany See also  German reunification Willy Brandt and Willi Stoph in Erfurt 1970  the first time a Chancellor met a GDR prime minister The official position of West Germany concerning East Germany was that the West German government was the only democratically elected and therefore the only legitimate representative of the German people  According to the Hallstein Doctrine  any country  with the exception of the USSR  that recognised the authorities of the German Democratic Republic would not have diplomatic relations with West Germany  In the early 1970s  Willy Brandt s policy of  Neue Ostpolitik  led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany  The Treaty of Moscow  August 1970   the Treaty of Warsaw  December 1970   the Four Power Agreement on Berlin  September 1971   the Transit Agreement  May 1972   and the Basic Treaty  December 1972  helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both German states joining the United Nations  The Hallstein Doctrine was abolished  The West German Constitution  Grundgesetz  Basic Law   provided two articles for the unification with other parts of Germany  Article 23 provided the possibility for other parts of Germany to join the Federal Republic  under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany   Article 146 provided the possibility for unification of all parts of Germany under a new constitution  After the peaceful revolution of 1989 in East Germany  the first freely elected East German parliament decided in June 1990 that the L nder soon to be reestablished would join the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the  West  German Basic Law  Grundgesetz   This made a quick unification possible  In July August 1990 the East German parliament enacted a law for the reestablishment of L nder on the territory of the German Democratic Republic  The two German states entered into a currency and customs union in July 1990  and on 3 October 1990  the German Democratic Republic dissolved and the then reestablished five East German L nder  as well as a unified Berlin  joined the Federal Republic of Germany  bringing an end to the East West divide   edit  Politics Political life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly  The Adenauer era  1949 63  was followed by a brief period under Ludwig Erhard  1963 66  who  in turn  was replaced by Kurt Georg Kiesinger  1966 69   All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the united caucus of the Christian Democratic Union  CDU  and Christian Social Union  CSU   either alone or in coalition with the smaller Free Democratic Party  FDP  or other rightwing parties  The Brandt cabinet of 1969 on the steps of President Heinemanns s residence in Bonn  Villa Hammerschmidt Kiesinger s 1966 69  Grand Coalition  was between West Germany s two largest parties  the CDU CSU and the Social Democratic Party  SPD   This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts the Grand Coalition gave the ruling parties the two thirds majority of votes required to see them in  These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a state of emergency  Leading up to the passing of the laws  there was fierce opposition to them  above all by the FDP  the rising German student movement  a group calling itself Notstand der Demokratie   Democracy in a State of Emergency   and the labour unions  Demonstrations and protests grew in number  and in 1967 the student Benno Ohnesorg was shot in the head by a policeman  The press  especially the tabloid Bild Zeitung newspaper  launched a vast campaign against the protesters and in 1968  believed by some as a result  there was an attempted assassination of one of the top members of the German socialist students  union  Rudi Dutschke  By 1958 a stronger desire to confront the Nazi past had come into being  In the 1960s environmentalism and anti nationalism became fundamental values among left wing Germans  As a result in 1979 the Greens were able to reach the 5  minimum required to obtain parliamentary seats in the Bremen state election  and with the foundation of the national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green movements in the world  Another result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the Red Army Faction  RAF   The RAF was active from 1968  carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in West Germany during the 1970s  Even in the 1990s  attacks were still being committed under the name RAF  The last action took place in 1993  and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities  Helmut Kohl in 1986 In the 1969 election  the SPD gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP  SPD leader and Chancellor Willy Brandt remained head of government until May 1974  when he resigned after the Guillaume Affair  in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service  the Stasi  However the affair is widely considered to have been merely a trigger for Brandt s resignation  not a fundamental cause  Instead  Brandt  dogged by scandal relating to serial adultery  and struggling with alcohol and depression 14  15  as well as the economic fallout of the 1973 oil crisis  almost seems simply to have had enough  As Brandt himself later said   I was exhausted  for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at the time    16  Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt  SPD  then formed a government  continuing the SPD FDP coalition  He served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982  Hans Dietrich Genscher  a leading FDP official  was Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the same years  Schmidt  a strong supporter of the European Community  EC  and the Atlantic alliance  emphasized his commitment to  the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA   The goals of SPD and FDP however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s  On October 1  1982  the FDP joined forces with the CDU CSU to elect CDU Chairman Helmut Kohl as Chancellor in a Constructive Vote of No Confidence  Following national elections in March 1983  Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU  The CDU CSU fell just short of an absolute majority  because of the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens  who received 5 6  of the vote  In January 1987  the Kohl Genscher government was returned to office  but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties  The Social Democrats concluded that not only were the Greens unlikely to form a coalition  but also that such a coalition would be far from a majority  Neither condition changed until 1998   edit  Culture  edit  Culture in general In many aspects  German culture continued in spite of the dictatorship and wartime  Old and new forms coexisted next to each other  and the American influence  already strong in the 1920s  grew   edit  Sport Postage stamps commemorating football s 1974 World Cup in West Germany In the 20th century association football became the largest sport in Germany  The Germany national football team  established in 1900  continued its tradition based in the Federal Republic of Germany  winning the 1954 FIFA World Cup in a stunning upset dubbed the miracle of Bern  Earlier  the German team was not considered part of the international top  The 1974 FIFA World Cup was held in West German cities and West Berlin  After having been beaten by their East German counterparts in the first round  the team of the German Football Association won the cup again  defeating the Netherlands 2 1 in the final  With the process of unification in full swing in the summer of 1990  the Germans won a third World Cup  with players that had been capped for East Germany not yet permitted to contribute  European championships have been won too  in 1972 and 1980  After both Olympic Games of 1936 had been held in Germany  Munich was selected to host the 1972 Summer Olympics  These were also the first summer games in which the East Germans showed up with the separate flag and anthem of the GDR  Since the 1950s  Germany at the Olympics had been represented by a united team led by the pre war German NOC officials as the IOC had denied East German demands for a separate team  As in 1957  when the Saarland acceded  East German sport organisations ceased to exist in late 1990 as their subdivisions and their members joined their Western counterparts  Thus  the present German organisations and teams in football  Olympics and elsewhere are identical to those that had been informally called  West German  before 1991  The only differences were a larger membership and a different name used by some foreigners  These organisations and teams in turn mostly continued the traditions of those that represented Germany before the Second World War  and even the First World War  thus providing a century old continuity despite political changes  On the other hand  the separate East German teams and organisations were founded in the 1950s  they were an episode lasting less than four decades  yet quite successful in that time   edit  Literary scene Besides the interest in the older generation of writers  new authors emerged on the background of the experiences of war and after war period  Wolfgang Borchert  a former soldier who died young in 1947  is one of the best known representants of the Tr mmerliteratur  Heinrich B ll is considered an observer of the young Federal Republic from the 1950s to the 1970s  and caused some political controversies because of his increasingly critical view on society   edit  Life in general Franz Skarbina  Weihnachtsmarkt in Berlin  1892 During the 40 years of separation some divergence occurred in the cultural life of the two parts of the severed nation  Both West Germany and East Germany followed along traditional paths of the common German culture  but West Germany  being obviously more affected by influences from western Europe and North America  became more cosmopolitan  Conversely  East Germany  while remaining more conservative than West Germany in its adherence to some aspects of the received tradition  was strongly moulded by the dictates of a state socialist ideology of predominantly Soviet inspiration  On the non political level  East Germany was also influenced by the Eastern Bloc s Slavic cultures that manifested in art  culinary scene  and sports  Nevertheless  young East Germans were also fascinated by Western and particularly American culture  which they had a degree of access to in a variety of ways  not least through West German television and radio  whose broadcasts reached many parts of the country  For the majority of Germans in present day Germany who lived in pre reunification West Germany  there has been minimal change in daily life stemming from German reunification as the reunified country is essentially West Germany incorporating East Germany on a West German base  In contrast  for East Germans the scale of change has been sweeping in all aspects of life from that before die Wende  Although movements like Ostalgia exist attempting to celebrate and preserve parts of the GDR culture  since reunification the former East Germany has been converging towards the western part of the country in most parts of daily life   edit  Geographical distribution of government In West Germany  most of the political agencies and buildings were located in Bonn  while the German Stock Market was located in Frankfurt am Main  which became the economic center  The judicial branch of both the German Federal Constitutional Court  Bundesverfassungsgericht  and the highest Court of Appeals  were located in Karlsruhe  The West German government was known to be much more decentralised than its state socialist East German counterpart  the former being a federal state and the latter a unitary one  Whilst East Germany was divided into 15 administrative districts  Bezirke   which were merely local branches of the national government  West Germany was divided into states  L nder  with independently elected state parliaments and control of the Bundesrat  the second legislative chamber of the Federal Government   edit  Present geographical and political terminology Today  North Rhine Westphalia is often considered to be Western Germany in geographical terms  When distinguishing between former West Germany and former East Germany as parts of present day unified Germany  it has become most common to refer to the Alte Bundesl nder  old states  and the Neue Bundesl nder  new states   although Westdeutschland and Ostdeutschland are still heard as well   edit  See also
