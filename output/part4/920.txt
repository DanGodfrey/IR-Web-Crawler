ethnoreligious group  originating in the Israelites or Hebrews of the Ancient Near East  The Jewish ethnicity  nationality  and religion are strongly interrelated  as Judaism is the traditional faith of the Jewish nation  2  3  4 Converts to Judaism  whose status as Jews within the Jewish ethnos is equal to those born into it  have been absorbed into the Jewish people throughout the millennia  In Jewish tradition  Jewish ancestry is traced to the Biblical patriarchs Abraham  Isaac and Jacob in the second millennium BCE  The modern State of Israel defines itself as a Jewish state in its Basic Laws  and Israel s Law of Return states   Every Jew has the right to come to this country as an oleh   5  Israel is the only country where Jews are a majority of the population  Jews achieved political autonomy twice before in ancient history  The first of these periods lasted from 1350 6  to 586 BCE  and encompassed the periods of the Judges  the United Monarchy  and the Divided Monarchy of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah  ending with the destruction of the First Temple  The second was the period of the Hasmonean Kingdom spanning from 140 to 37 BCE  Since the destruction of the First Temple  most Jews have lived in diaspora  7  A minority in every country in which they live  except Israel   they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history  resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries  As of 2010 update   the world Jewish population was estimated at 13 42 million by the North American Jewish Data Bank  8  or roughly 0 2  of the total world population  According to this report  about 42  of all Jews reside in Israel  5 70 million   and about 42  in the United States  5 28 million  and Canada  0 38 million   with most of the remainder living in Europe  1 46 million   8  These numbers include all those who consider themselves Jews  whether or not they are affiliated with a Jewish organization  The total world Jewish population  however  is difficult to measure  In addition to issues with census methodology  there are halakhic disputes regarding who is a Jew and secular  political  and ancestral identification factors that may affect the figure considerably  9  Contents 1 Name and etymology 2 Origins 3 Judaism 4 Who is a Jew  5 Ethnic divisions 6 Jewish languages 7 Genetic studies 7 1 Male

German word  Jude  is pronounced   ju d    the corresponding adjective  j disch    jy d     Jewish  is the origin of the word  Yiddish   13   See Jewish ethnonyms for a full overview   According to The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language  Fourth Edition  2000   It is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun Jew  in phrases such as Jew lawyer or Jew ethics  is both vulgar and highly offensive  In such contexts Jewish is the only acceptable possibility  Some people  however  have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of Jew as a noun  a practice that carries risks of its own  In a sentence such as There are now several Jews on the council  which is unobjectionable  the substitution of a circumlocution like Jewish people or persons of Jewish background may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun  14  Origins According to their tradition  the Jewish people originated from the Israelites of the Southern Levant  who had several independent states before being overtaken first by the Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and later the Roman Empire  with a large portion of the population being scattered throughout the world  According to the Hebrew Bible  all Israelites were descended from Abraham  who was born in the Sumerian city of Ur  and migrated to Canaan  commonly known as the Land of Israel  with his family  Genetic studies on Jews show that most Jews worldwide do indeed bear a common genetic heritage which originates in the Middle East  and that they bear their strongest resemblance to the peoples of the Fertile Crescent  with only minor contribution from their host populations 15   historically due to the taboo on intermarriage in Jewish tradition  the low number of converts to Judaism  as well as the general isolations and persecutions of Jews throughout history   According to some Biblical archaeologists  however  Israelite culture did not overtake the region  but rather grew out of Canaanite culture  Judaism Main article  Judaism Judaism guides its adherents in both practice and belief  and has been called not only a religion  but also a  way of life   16  which has made drawing a clear distinction between Judaism  Jewish culture  and Jewish identity rather difficult  Throughout history  in eras and places as diverse as the ancient Hellenic world  17  in Europe before and after The Age of Enlightenment  see Haskalah   18  in Islamic Spain and Portugal  19  in North Africa and the Middle East  19 India  20  and China  21  or the contemporary United States 22  and Israel  23  cultural phenomena have developed that are in some sense characteristically Jewish without being at all specifically religious  Some factors in this come from within Judaism  others from the interaction of Jews or specific communities of Jews with their surroundings  others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community  as opposed to from the religion itself  This phenomenon has led to considerably different Jewish cultures unique to their own communities  each as authentically Jewish as the next  24  Who is a Jew  Main article  Who is a Jew  Judaism shares some of the characteristics of a nation  an ethnicity  a religion  and a culture  making the definition of who is a Jew vary slightly depending on whether a religious or national approach to identity is used  25  Generally  in modern secular usage  Jews include three groups  people who were born to a Jewish family regardless of whether or not they follow the religion  those who have some Jewish ancestral background or lineage  sometimes including those who do not have strictly matrilineal descent   and people without any Jewish ancestral background or lineage who have formally converted to Judaism and therefore are followers of the religion  26  Historical definitions of Jewish identity have traditionally been based on halakhic definitions of matrilineal descent  and halakhic conversions  Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the oral tradition into the Babylonian Talmud  Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh  such as Deuteronomy 7 1 5  by learned Jewish sages  are used as a warning against intermarriage between Jews and non Jews because   the non Jewish husband  will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods of others   Leviticus 24 10 says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an Egyptian man is  of the community of Israel   This contrasts with Ezra 10 2 3  where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their gentile wives and their children  27  28  Since the Haskalah  these halakhic interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged  29  At times  conversion has accounted for a substantial part of Jewish population growth  In the first century of the Christian era  for example  the population more than doubled  from four to 8 10 million within the confines of the Roman Empire  in good part as a result of a wave of conversion  30  Ethnic divisions Main article  Jewish ethnic divisions Ashkenazi Jews of late 19th century Eastern Europe portrayed in Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur  1878   by Maurycy Gottlieb  Within the world s Jewish population there are distinct ethnic divisions  most of which are primarily the result of geographic branching from an originating Israelite population  and subsequent independent evolutions  An array of Jewish communities were established by Jewish settlers in various places around the Old World  often at great distances from one another resulting in effective and often long term isolation from each other  During the millennia of the Jewish diaspora the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments  political  cultural  natural  and populational  Today  manifestation of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of each community  including Jewish linguistic diversity  culinary preferences  liturgical practices  religious interpretations  as well as degrees and sources of genetic admixture  31  Jews are often identified as belonging to one of two major groups  the Ashkenazim  or  Germanics   Ashkenaz meaning  Germany  in Medieval Hebrew  denoting their Central European base   and the Sephardim  or  Hispanics   Sefarad meaning  Spain Hispania  or  Iberia  in Hebrew  denoting their Spanish  and Portuguese  base   The Mizrahim  or  Easterners   Mizrach being  East  in Hebrew   that is  the diverse collection of Middle Eastern and North African Jews  constitute a third major group  although they are sometimes termed Sephardi for liturgical reasons  32  Smaller groups include  but are not restricted to  Indian Jews such as the Bene Israel  Bnei Menashe  Cochin Jews  and Bene Ephraim  the Romaniotes of Greece  the Italian Jews   Italkim  or  Ben  Roma    the Teimanim from Yemen and Oman  various African Jews  including most numerously the Beta Israel of Ethiopia  and Chinese Jews  most notably the Kaifeng Jews  as well as various other distinct but now almost extinct communities  33  The divisions between all these groups are approximate and their boundaries are not always clear  The Mizrahim for example  are a heterogeneous collection of North African  Central Asian  Caucasian  and Middle Eastern Jewish communities that are often as unrelated to each other as they are to any of the earlier mentioned Jewish groups  In modern usage  however  the Mizrahim are sometimes termed Sephardi due to similar styles of liturgy  despite independent development from Sephardim proper  Thus  among Mizrahim there are Egyptian Jews  Iraqi Jews  Lebanese Jews  Kurdish Jews  Libyan Jews  Syrian Jews  Bukharian Jews  Mountain Jews  Georgian Jews  Iranian Jews and various others  The Teimanim from Yemen and Oman are sometimes included  although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the admixture found among them to that found in Mizrahim  In addition  there is a differentiation made between Sephardi migrants who established themselves in the Middle East and North Africa after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal in the 1490s and the pre existing Jewish communities in those regions  33  Despite this diversity  Ashkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry  with at least 70  of Jews worldwide  and up to 90  prior to World War II and the Holocaust   As a result of their emigration from Europe  Ashkenazim also represent the overwhelming majority of Jews in the New World continents  in countries such as the United States  Canada  Argentina  Australia  and Brazil  In France  emigration of Jews from North Africa has led them to outnumber the Ashkenazim   34  Only in Israel is the Jewish population representative of all groups  a melting pot independent of each group s proportion within the overall world Jewish population  35  Jewish languages Main article  Jewish languages Hebrew is the liturgical language of Judaism  termed l shon ha kodesh   the holy tongue    the language in which the Hebrew scriptures  Tanakh  were composed  and the daily speech of the Jewish people for centuries  By the 5th century BCE  Aramaic  a closely related tongue  joined Hebrew as the spoken language in Judea  36  By the third century BCE  Jews of the diaspora were speaking Greek  37  For centuries  Jews worldwide have spoken the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to  often developing distinctive dialectal forms or branches that became independent languages  Yiddish is the Jud o German language developed by Ashkenazi Jews who migrated to Central Europe  Ladino is the Jud o Spanish language developed by Sephardic Jews who migrated to the Iberian peninsula  Due to many factors  including the impact of the Holocaust on European Jewry  the Jewish exodus from Arab lands  and widespread emigration from other Jewish communities around the world  ancient and distinct Jewish languages of several communities  including Gruzinic  Jud o Arabic  Jud o Berber  Krymchak  Jud o Malayalam and many others  have largely fallen out of use  38  For over sixteen centuries Hebrew was used almost exclusively as a liturgical language  and as the language in which most books had been written on Judaism  with a few speaking only Hebrew on the Sabbath  39  Hebrew was revived as a spoken language by Eliezer ben Yehuda  who arrived in Palestine in 1881  It had not been used as a mother tongue since Tannaic times  36  Modern Hebrew is now one of the two official languages of the State of Israel along with Arabic  40  The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew  English and Russian  Some Romance languages  such as French and Spanish  are also widely used  38  Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language  41  but it is far less used today  after the Holocaust and the adoption of Hebrew by the Zionist movement  then Israel  Genetic studies Main article  Genetic studies on Jews See also  Y chromosomal Aaron  Genealogical DNA test  and Matrilineality Genetic studies indicate various lineages found in modern Jewish populations  however  most of these populations share a lineage in common  traceable to an ancient population that underwent geographic branching and subsequent independent evolutions  42  While DNA tests have demonstrated inter marriage in all of the various Jewish ethnic divisions over the last 3 000 years  it was substantially less than in other populations  43  The findings lend support to traditional Jewish accounts accrediting their founding to exiled Israelite populations  and counters theories that many or most of the world s Jewish populations were founded entirely by local populations that adopted the Jewish religion  devoid of any actual Israelite genetic input  43  DNA analysis further determined that modern Jews of the priesthood tribe  Kohanim  share an ancestor dating back about 3 000 years  44  This result is consistent for all Jewish populations around the world  44  The researchers estimated that the most recent common ancestor of modern Kohanim lived between 1000 BCE  roughly the time of the Biblical Exodus  and 586 BCE  when the Babylonians destroyed the First Temple  45  They found similar results analyzing DNA from Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews  45  The scientists estimated the date of the original priest based on genetic mutations  which indicated that the priest lived roughly 106 generations ago  between 2 650 and 3 180 years ago depending whether one counts a generation as 25 or 30 years  45  These Jews belong to the haplotypes J1e and J2a  However  more recent research has shown that many ethnic groups in the Middle East and Mediterranean area also share this genetic profile  46  Although individual and groups of converts to Judaism have historically been absorbed into contemporary Jewish populations  it is unlikely that they formed a large percentage of the ancestors of modern Jewish groups  and much less that they represented their genesis as Jewish communities  42  47  Biologist Robert Pollack stated in 2003 that one cannot determine the biological  Jewishness  of an individual because  there are no DNA sequences common to all Jews and absent from all non Jews   48  A 2009 study was able to genetically identify individuals with full or partial Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry  49  Male lineages  Y chromosomal DNA A study published by the National Academy of Sciences found that  the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe  North Africa  and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population   and suggested that  most Jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring non Jewish communities during and after the Diaspora   42  Researchers expressed surprise at the remarkable genetic uniformity they found among modern Jews  no matter where the diaspora has become dispersed around the world  42  Other Y chromosome findings show that the world s Jewish communities are closely related to Kurds  Syrians and Palestinians  44  50  Skorecki and colleague wrote that  the extremely close affinity of Jewish and non Jewish Middle Eastern populations observed     supports the hypothesis of a common Middle Eastern origin   44  According to another study of the same year  more than 70  of Jewish men and half of the Arab men  inhabitants of Israel and the territories only  whose DNA was studied inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors who lived in the region within the last few thousand years  The results are consistent with the Biblical account of Jews and Arabs having a common ancestor  About two thirds of Israeli Arabs and Arabs in the territories and a similar proportion of Israeli Jews are the descendants of at least three common ancestors who lived in the Middle East in the Neolithic period  However  the Palestinian Arab clade includes two Arab modal haplotypes which are found at only very low frequency among Jews  reflecting divergence and or large scale admixture from non local populations to the Palestinians  51  A study of haplotypes of the Y chromosome  published in 2000  addressed the paternal origins of Ashkenazi Jews  Hammer et al  42  found that the Y chromosome of some Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews contained mutations that are also common among Middle Eastern peoples  but uncommon in the general European population  This suggested that the male ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to the Middle East  The proportion of male genetic admixture in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0 5  per generation over an estimated 80 generations  with  relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim   and a total admixture estimate  very similar to Motulsky s average estimate of 12 5    This supported the finding that  Diaspora Jews from Europe  Northwest Africa  and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non Jewish neighbors   However  when all haplotypes were included in the analysis  m  the admixture percentage  increased to 23    7   In addition  of the Jewish populations in this cluster  the Ashkenazim were closest to South European populations  specifically the Greeks  42  In Jewish populations  Haplogroup J1  defined by the 267 marker  constitutes 30  of the Yemenite Jews 52  20 0  of the Ashkenazim results and 12  of the Sephardic results  52  53  54  55  However  J1 is most frequent in Yemen  76    56  57 Saudi  64   58 Qatar  58    57  J1 is generally frequent amongst Negev Bedouins  62  59    It is also very common among other Arabs such as those of the Levant  i e  Palestinian  38 4    53 Syria  30    Lebanon  25    60  61  In Europe  higher frequencies have been reported in the central Adriatic regions of Italy  Gargano  17 2    62 Pescara  15    62  in the Mediterranean Paola  11 1   62  and in South Sicilian Ragusa  10 7    63  Fairly high frequencies have also been reported in other nearby Mediterranean areas  Crete  8 3    64 Malta  7 8    Cyprus  6 2    65 Greece  5 3    64  Haplogroup J2 which is found in the Sephardic Jews  29   66  and Ashkenazi Jews  23    66  or 19   67  is found mainly in the Fertile Crescent  the Caucasus  68 Anatolia  the Balkans  Italy  the Mediterranean littoral  the Iranian plateau  Central Asia  and South Asia  66  More specifically  it is found in Iraq  69 Syria  Lebanon  70 Turkey  Israel  Palestine  Greece  Italy and the eastern coasts of the Iberian Peninsula  62  and more frequently in Iraqis 29 7   71 Lebanese 25   72 Palestinians 16 8   66 Syrians 22 5   73 Kurds 28 4   Saudi Arabia 15 92   74 Jordan 14 3   Oman 10 15   75 UAE 10 4   Yemen 9 7   57  in Israel  66  in Palestine  66  and in Turkey  76  Female lineages  Mitochondrial DNA Before 2006  geneticists largely attributed the genesis of most of the world s Jewish populations to founding acts by males who migrated from the Middle East and  by the women from each local population whom they took as wives and converted to Judaism   though no genetic relation was found between Jewish and non Jewish female lineages  However  more recent findings of studies of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA  at least in Ashkenazi Jews  has led to a review of this archetype  77  This research has suggested that  in addition to Israelite male  significant female founder ancestry might also derive from the Middle East with 40  of Ashkenazim descended from four women lived about 1000 1500 years ago in the Middle East  77  In addition  Behar  2006  suggested that the rest of Ashkenazi mtDNA is originated from about 150 women  most of those were probably of Middle Eastern origin  78  Approximately 32  of people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry belong to the mtDNA haplogroup K  This high percentage points to a genetic bottleneck occurring some 100 generations ago  79  Research in 2008 found significant founder effects in many non Asheknazi Jewish populations  In Belmonte  Azerbaijani  Georgian  Bene Israel and Libyan Jewish communities  a single mother was sufficient to explain at least 40  of their present day mtDNA variation   In addition   the Cochin and Tunisian Jewish communities show an attenuated pattern with two founding mothers explaining  gt 30  of the variation   In contrast  Bulgarian  Turkish  Moroccan and Ethiopian Jews were heterogeneous with no evidence  for a narrow founder effect or depletion of mtDNA variation attributable to drift   The authors noted that  the first three of these communities were established following the Spanish expulsion and or received large influxes of individuals from the Iberian Peninsula and high variation presently observed  probably reflects high overall mtDNA diversity among Jews of Spanish descent  Likewise  the mtDNA pool of Ethiopian Jews reflects the rich maternal lineage variety of East Africa   Jewish communities from Iraq  Iran  and Yemen showed a  third and intermediate pattern    consistent with a founding event  but not a narrow one   80  In this and other studies Yemenite Jews differ from other Mizrahim  as well as from Ashkenazim  in the proportion of sub Saharan African gene types which have entered their gene pools  81  African specific Hg L xM N  lineages were found only in Yemenite and Ethiopian Jewish populations  80  Among Yemenites  the average stands at 35  lineages within the past 3 000 years  81  Genome wide association and linkage studies In genetic epidemiology  a genome wide association study  GWA study  or GWAS  is an examination of all or most of the genes  the genome  of different individuals of a particular species to see how much the genes vary from individual to individual  These techniques were originally designed for epidemiological uses  to identify genetic associations with observable traits  82  A 2006 study by Seldin  et al  used over five thousand autosomal SNPs to demonstrate European genetic substructure amongst the Ashkenazi  The results showed  a consistent and reproducible distinction between  northern  and  southern  European population groups   Most northern  central  and eastern Europeans  Finns  Swedes  English  Irish  Germans  and Ukrainians  showed  gt 90  in the  northern  population group  while most individual participants with southern European ancestry  Italians  Greeks  Portuguese  Spaniards  showed  gt 85  in the  southern  group  Both Ashkenazi Jews as well as Sephardic Jews showed  gt 85  membership in the  southern  group  Referring to the Jews clustering with southern Europeans  the authors state the results were  consistent with a later Mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups   83  A 2007 study by Bauchet  et al  found that Ashkenazi Jews were most closely clustered with Arabic North African populations when compared to Global population  and in the European structure analysis  they share similarities only with Greeks and Southern Italians  reflecting their east Mediterranean origins  84  85  A 2010 study on Jewish ancestry by Atzmon Ostrer et al  stated  Two major groups were identified by principal component  phylogenetic  and identity by descent  IBD  analysis  Middle Eastern Jews and European Syrian Jews  The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry    as both groups   the Middle Eastern Jews and European Syrian Jews shared common ancestors in the Middle East about 2500 years ago  The study examines genetic markers spread across the entire genome and shows that the Jewish groups  Ashkenazi and non Ashkenazi  share large swaths of DNA  indicating close relationships and that each of the Jewish groups in the study  Iranian  Iraqi  Syrian  Italian  Turkish  Greek and Ashkenazi  has its own genetic signature but is more closely related to the other Jewish groups than to their non Jewish fellow countrymen  86  Atzmon s team found that the SNP markers in genetic segments of 3 million DNA letters or longer were 10 times more likely to be identical among Jews than non Jews  Results of the analysis also tally with biblical accounts of the fate of the Jews  Using their DNA analysis  the authors traced the ancestors of all Jews to Persia and Babylon  areas that now form part of Iran and Iraq  87  The study also found that with respect to non Jewish European groups  the population most closely related to Ashkenazi Jews are modern day Italians  The study speculated that the genetic similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and Italians may be due to inter marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman Empire  It was also found that any two Ashkenazi Jewish participants in the study shared about as much DNA as fourth or fifth cousins 88  89  A 2010 study by Bray et al  using SNP microarray techniques and linkage analysis  estimated that 35 to 55 percent of the modern Ashkenazi genome is specifically traceable to Europe  and that European  admixture is considerably higher than previous estimates by studies that used the Y chromosome   The study assumed Druze and Palestinian Arabs populations to represent the reference to world Jewry ancestor genome  With this reference point  the linkage disequilibrium in the Ashkenazi Jewish population was interpreted as  matches signs of interbreeding or  admixture  between Middle Eastern and European populations   In their press release  Bray stated   We were surprised to find evidence that Ashkenazi Jews have higher heterozygosity than Europeans  contradicting the widely held presumption that they have been a largely isolated group    Thus  the AJ population shows evidence of past founding events  however  admixture and selection have also strongly influenced its current genetic makeup   The authors note that their results will require further investigation  90  91  Demographics Main article  Jewish population Population centres There are an estimated 13 14 million

the Jewish nation state  is the only country in which Jews make up a majority of the citizens  94  Israel was established as an independent democratic and Jewish state on May 14  1948  95  Of the 120 members in its parliament  the Knesset  96  currently  12 members of the Knesset are Arab citizens of Israel  most representing Arab political parties and one of Israel s Supreme Court judges is a Palestinian Arab  97  Between 1948 and 1958  the Jewish population rose from 800 000 to two million  98  Currently  Jews account for 75 8  of the Israeli population  or 5 4 million people  99  The early years of the state of Israel were marked by the mass immigration of Holocaust survivors and Jews fleeing Arab lands  100  Israel also has a large population of Ethiopian Jews  many of whom were airlifted to Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s  101  Between 1974 and 1979 nearly 227 258 immigrants arrived in Israel  about half being from the Soviet Union  102  This period also saw an increase in immigration to Israel from Western Europe  Latin America  and the United States 103  A trickle of immigrants from other communities has also arrived  including Indian Jews and others  as well as some descendants of Ashkenazi Holocaust survivors who had settled in countries such as the United States  Argentina  Australia and South Africa  Some Jews have emigrated from Israel elsewhere  due to economic problems or disillusionment with political conditions and the continuing Arab Israeli conflict  Jewish Israeli emigrants are known as yordim  104  Diaspora  outside Israel  Main article  Jewish diaspora The waves of immigration to the United States and elsewhere at the turn of the 19th century  the founding of Zionism and later events  including pogroms in Russia  the massacre of European Jewry during the Holocaust  and the founding of the state of Israel  with the subsequent Jewish exodus from Arab lands  all resulted in substantial shifts in the population centers of world Jewry by the end of the 20th century  105  Public Hanukkah menorah in Nicosia  Cyprus In this Rosh Hashana greeting card from the early 1900s  Russian Jews  packs in hand  gaze at the American relatives beckoning them to the United States  Over two million Jews fled the pogroms of the Russian Empire to the safety of the US between 1881 and 1924  106  Currently  the largest Jewish community in the world is located in the United States  with 5 3 million to 6 4 million Jews by various estimates  Elsewhere in the Americas  there are also large Jewish populations in Canada  Argentina  and Brazil  and smaller populations in Mexico  Uruguay  Venezuela  Chile  and several other countries  see History of the Jews in Latin America   99  Western Europe s largest Jewish community can be found in France  home to 490 000 Jews  the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from North African Arab countries such as Algeria  Morocco  and Tunisia  or their descendants   107  There are 295 000 Jews in the United Kingdom  In Eastern Europe  there are anywhere from 350 000 to one million Jews living in the former Soviet Union  but exact figures are difficult to establish  The fastest growing Jewish community in the world  outside Israel  is the one in Germany  especially in Berlin  its capital  Tens of thousands of Jews from the former Eastern Bloc have settled in Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall  108  The Arab countries of North Africa and the Middle East were home to around 900 000 Jews in 1945  Fueled by anti Zionism 109  after the founding of Israel  systematic persecution caused almost all of these Jews to flee to Israel  North America  and Europe in the 1950s  see Jewish exodus from Arab lands   Today  around 8 000 Jews remain in all Arab nations combined  110  Iran is home to around 10 800 Jews  down from a population of 100 000 Jews before the 1979 revolution  After the revolution some of the Iranian Jews emigrated to Israel or Europe but most of them emigrated  with their non Jewish Iranian compatriots  to the United States  especially Los Angeles  where the principal community is called  Tehrangeles    110  111  Outside Europe  the Americas  the Middle East  and the rest of Asia  there are significant Jewish populations in Australia and South Africa  110  Demographic changes Assimilation Since at least the time of the Ancient Greeks  a proportion of Jews have assimilated into the wider non Jewish society around them  by either choice or force  ceasing to practice Judaism and losing their Jewish identity  112  Assimilation took place in all areas  and during all time periods  112  with some Jewish communities  for example the Kaifeng Jews of China  disappearing entirely  113  The advent of the Jewish Enlightenment of the 18th century  see Haskalah  and the subsequent emancipation of the Jewish populations of Europe and America in the 19th century  accelerated the situation  encouraging Jews to increasingly participate in  and become part of  secular society  The result has been a growing trend of assimilation  as Jews marry non Jewish spouses and stop participating in the Jewish community  114  Rates of interreligious marriage vary widely  In the United States  they are just under 50   115  in the United Kingdom  around 53   in France  around 30   116  and in Australia and Mexico  as low as 10   117  118  In the United States  only about a third of children from intermarriages affiliate themselves with Jewish religious practice  119  The result is that most countries in the Diaspora have steady or slightly declining religiously Jewish populations as Jews continue to assimilate into the countries in which they live  War and persecution Main article  Persecution of Jews Related articles  Antisemitism  Islam and antisemitism  History of antisemitism  New antisemitism Jews  identifiable by the distinctive hats that they were required to wear  being killed by Christian knights  French Bible illustration from 1255  World War I poster shows a soldier cutting the bonds from a Jewish man  who says   You have cut my bonds and set me free   now let me help you set others free   The Jewish people and Judaism have experienced various persecutions throughout Jewish history  During late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages the Roman Empire  in its later phases known as the Byzantine Empire  repeatedly repressed the Jewish population  first by ejecting them from their homelands during the pagan Roman era and later by officially establishing them as second class citizens during the Christian Roman era  120  121  According to James Carroll   Jews accounted for 10  of the total population of the Roman Empire  By that ratio  if other factors had not intervened  there would be 200 million Jews in the world today  instead of something like 13 million   122  Later in medieval Western Europe  further persecutions of Jews in the name of Christianity occurred  notably during the Crusades when Jews all over Germany were massacred and a series of expulsions from England  Germany  France  and  in the largest expulsion of all  Spain and Portugal after the Reconquista  the Catholic Reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula   where both unbaptized Sephardic Jews and the ruling Muslim Moors were expelled  123  124  In the Papal States  which existed until 1870  Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called ghettos  125  In the 19th and  before the end of World War II  20th centuries  the Roman Catholic Church adhered to a distinction between  good antisemitism  and  bad antisemitism   The  bad  kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent  This was considered un Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity  anyone could become a Christian  The  good  kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers  banks  and other institutions  to care only about accumulation of wealth  etc  126  Islam and Judaism have a complex relationship  Traditionally Jews and Christians living in Muslim lands  known as dhimmis  were allowed to practice their religions and to administer their internal affairs  but subject to certain conditions  127  They had to pay the jizya  a per capita tax imposed on free adult non Muslim males  to the Islamic state  127  Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule  They had several social and legal disabilities such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims  128  Many of the disabilities were highly symbolic  The one described by Bernard Lewis as  most degrading  129  was the requirement of distinctive clothing  not found in the Qur an or hadith but invented in early medieval Baghdad  its enforcement was highly erratic  129  On the other hand  Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile  or forced compulsion to change their religion  and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession  130  Notable exceptions include the massacre of Jews and or forcible conversion of some Jews by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in Al Andalus in the 12th century  131  as well as in Islamic Persia  132  and the forced confinement of Moroccan Jews to walled quarters known as mellahs beginning from the 15th century and especially in the early 19th century  133  In modern times  it has become commonplace for standard antisemitic themes to be conflated with anti Zionist publications and pronouncements of Islamic movements such as Hezbollah and Hamas  in the pronouncements of various agencies of the Islamic Republic of Iran  and even in the newspapers and other publications of Turkish Refah Partisi   134  Jews in Minsk  1941  Before World War II some 40  of the population was Jewish  By the time the Red Army retook the city on 3 July 1944  there were only a few Jewish survivors  Throughout history  many rulers  empires and nations have oppressed their Jewish populations or sought to eliminate them entirely  Methods employed ranged from expulsion to outright genocide  within nations  often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent  The history of antisemitism includes the First Crusade which resulted in the massacre of Jews  123  the Spanish Inquisition  led by Torquemada  and the Portuguese Inquisition  with their persecution and autos da f  against the New Christians and Marrano Jews  135  the Bohdan Chmielnicki Cossack massacres in Ukraine  136  the Pogroms backed by the Russian Tsars  137  as well as expulsions from Spain  Portugal  England  France  Germany  and other countries in which the Jews had settled  124  According to a recent study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics 19 8  of the modern Iberian population has Sephardic Jewish ancestry  138  indicating that the number of conversos may have been much higher than originally thought  139  140  The persecution reached a peak in Nazi Germany s Final Solution  which led to the Holocaust and the slaughter of approximately 6 million Jews  141  The Holocaust   the state led systematic persecution and genocide of European Jews  and certain communities of North African Jews in European controlled North Africa  and other minority groups of Europe during World War II by Germany and its collaborators remains the most notable modern day persecution of Jews  142  The persecution and genocide were accomplished in stages  Legislation to remove the Jews from civil society was enacted years before the outbreak of World War II  143 Concentration camps were established in which inmates were used as slave labour until they died of exhaustion or disease  144  Where the Third Reich conquered new territory in eastern Europe  specialized units called Einsatzgruppen murdered Jews and political opponents in mass shootings  145  Jews and Roma were crammed into ghettos before being transported hundreds of miles by freight train to extermination camps where  if they survived the journey  the majority of them were killed in gas chambers  146  Virtually every arm of Germany s bureaucracy was involved in the logistics of the mass murder  turning the country into what one Holocaust scholar has called  a genocidal nation   147  Migrations Etching of the expulsion of the Jews from Frankfurt on August 23  1614  The text says   1380 persons old and young were counted at the exit of the gate  Jewish refugees in China in the Shanghai Ghetto during World War II  Shanghai offered unconditional asylum for tens of thousands of Jewish refugees from Europe escaping the Holocaust  148  Throughout Jewish history  Jews have repeatedly been directly or indirectly expelled from both their original homeland and the areas in which they have resided  This experience as refugees has shaped Jewish identity and religious practice in many ways  and is thus a major element of Jewish history  149  The incomplete list of major and other noteworthy migrations that follows includes numerous instances of expulsion or departure under duress  The patriarch Abraham was a migrant to the land of Canaan from Ur of the Chaldees 150  after an attempt on his life by King Nimrod  151  The Children of Israel experienced the Exodus  meaning  departure  or  exit  in Greek  from ancient Egypt  as recorded in the Book of Exodus  152  The Kingdom of Israel was sent into permanent exile by Assyria  initially to the Upper Mesopotamian provinces of the Assyrian Empire  153  from whence they scattered all over the world  or at least to unknown locations   154  The Kingdom of Judah was exiled by Babylonia  155  then returned to Judea by Cyrus the Great of the Persian Achaemenid Empire  156  and then many were exiled again by the Roman Empire  157  The 2 000 year dispersion of the Jewish diaspora beginning under the Roman Empire  as Jews were spread throughout the Roman world and  driven from land to land  and settled wherever they could live freely enough to practice their religion  Over the course of the diaspora the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia 158  to the Iberian Peninsula 159  to Poland 160  to the United States 161  and  as a result of Zionism  back to Israel  162  Many expulsions during the Middle Ages and Enlightenment in Europe  including  1290  16 000 Jews were expelled from England  see the  Statute of Jewry   in 1396  100 000 from France  in 1421 thousands were expelled from Austria  Many of these Jews settled in Eastern Europe  especially Poland  163  Following the Spanish Inquisition in 1492  the Spanish population of around 200 000 Sephardic Jews were expelled by the Spanish crown and Catholic church  followed by expulsions in 1493 in Sicily  37 000 Jews  and Portugal in 1496  The expelled Jews fled mainly to the Ottoman Empire  the Netherlands  and North Africa  others migrating to Southern Europe and the Middle East  164  During the 19th century  France s policies of equal citizenship regardless of religion led to the immigration of Jews  especially from Eastern and Central Europe   165  The arrival of millions of Jews in the New World  including immigration of over two million Eastern European Jews to the United States from 1880 1925  see History of the Jews in the United States and History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union  166  The Pogroms in Eastern Europe  137  the rise of modern antisemitism  167  the Holocaust  168  and the rise of Arab nationalism 169  all served to fuel the movements and migrations of huge segments of Jewry from land to land and continent to continent  until they arrived back in large numbers at their original historical homeland in Israel  162  The Islamic Revolution of Iran forced many Iranian Jews to flee Iran  Most found refuge in the US  particularly Los Angeles  CA  and Israel  Smaller communities of Persian Jews exist in Canada and Western Europe  170  When the Soviet Union collapsed  many of the Jews in the affected territory  who had been refuseniks  were suddenly allowed to leave  This produced a wave of migration to Israel in the early 1990s  104  Growth Israel is the only country with a consistently growing Jewish population due to natural population increase  though the Jewish populations of other countries in Europe and North America have recently increased due to immigration  In the Diaspora  in almost every country the Jewish population in general is either declining or steady  but Orthodox and Haredi Jewish communities  whose members often shun birth control for religious reasons  have experienced rapid population growth  171  Orthodox and Conservative Judaism discourage proselytism to non Jews  but many Jewish groups have tried to reach out to the assimilated Jewish communities of the Diaspora in order for them to reconnect to their Jewish roots  Additionally  while in principle Reform Judaism favors seeking new members for the faith  this position has not translated into active proselytism  instead taking the form of an effort to reach out to non Jewish spouses of intermarried couples  172  There is also a trend of Orthodox movements pursuing secular Jews in order to give them a stronger Jewish identity so there is less chance of intermarriage  As a result of the efforts by these and other Jewish groups over the past 25 years  there has been a trend of secular Jews becoming more religiously observant  known as the Baal Teshuva movement  though the demographic implications of the trend are unknown  173  Additionally  there is also a growing movement of Jews by Choice by gentiles who make the decision to head in the direction of becoming Jews  174  Jewish leadership Main article  Jewish leadership There is no single governing body for the Jewish community  nor a single authority with responsibility for religious doctrine  175  Instead  a variety of secular and religious institutions at the local  national  and international levels lead various parts of the Jewish community on a variety of issues  176  Notable Jews Main articles  Lists of Jews and Judaism by country Jews have made contributions in a broad range of human endeavors  including the sciences  arts  politics  and business  177  178  Although Jews comprise only 0 2  of the world s population  over 20  178  179  of Nobel Prize laureates

leading philanthropists  51 percent of the Pulitzer Prize winners for nonfiction      Shalev  Baruch  2005   100 Years of Nobel Prizes  p  57   A striking fact    is the high number of Laureates of the Jewish faith over 20  of the total Nobel Prizes  138   including  17  in Chemistry  26  in Medicine and Physics  40  in Economics and 11  in Peace and Literature each  These numbers are especially

because Jews make up less than a quarter of one percent of the world s population  it s surprising that over 20 percent of Nobel prizes have been awarded to Jews or people of Jewish descent    Lawrence E  Harrison  2008   The Central Liberal Truth  How Politics Can Change a Culture and Save It  Oxford University Press  p  102   That achievement is symbolized by the fact that 15 to 20 percent of Nobel Prizes have been won by Jews  who represent two tenths of one percent of the world s population    Jonathan B  Krasner  Jonathan D  Sarna  2006   The History of the Jewish People
