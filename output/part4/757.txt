in 119 countries  3  4  Headquartered in the United States  the company began in 1940 as a barbecue restaurant operated by the eponymous Richard and Maurice McDonald  in 1948 they reorganized their business as a hamburger stand using production line principles  Businessman Ray Kroc joined the company as a franchise agent in 1955  He subsequently purchased the chain from the McDonald brothers and oversaw its worldwide growth  5  A McDonald s restaurant is operated by either a franchisee  an affiliate  or the corporation itself  The corporation s revenues come from the rent  royalties and fees paid by the franchisees  as well as sales in company operated restaurants  McDonald s revenues grew 27 percent over the three years ending in 2007 to  22 8 billion  and 9 percent growth in operating income to  3 9 billion  6  McDonald s primarily sells hamburgers  cheeseburgers  chicken  french fries  breakfast items  soft drinks  shakes and desserts  In response to changing consumer tastes  the

restaurant is the third one built  in Downey  California  which opened in 1953   Speedee   the former mascot of McDonald s before his replacement by Ronald McDonald  Concept version of Ronald McDonald  Main article  History of McDonald s The business began in 1940  with a restaurant opened by brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald in San Bernardino  California  Their introduction of the  Speedee Service System  in 1948 furthered the principles of the modern fast food restaurant that the White Castle hamburger chain had already put into practice more than two decades earlier  The original mascot of McDonald s was a man with a chef s hat on top of a hamburger shaped head whose name was  Speedee   Speedee was eventually replaced with Ronald McDonald by 1967 when the company first filed a U S  trademark on a clown shaped man having puffed out costume legs  McDonald s first filed for a U S  trademark on the name  McDonald s  on May 4  1961  with the description  Drive In Restaurant Services   which continues to be renewed through the end of December 2009  In the same year  on September 13  1961  the company filed a logo trademark on an overlapping  double arched  M  symbol  The overlapping double arched  M  symbol logo was temporarily disfavored by September 6  1962  when a trademark was filed for a single arch  shaped over many of the early McDonald s restaurants in the early years  Although the  Golden Arches  appeared in various forms  the present form as a letter  M  did not appear until November 18  1968  when the company applied for a U S  trademark  McDonald s corporate logo used from 1968 to 2006  It still exists at some restaurants  The present corporation dates its founding to the opening of a franchised restaurant by Ray Kroc  in Des Plaines  Illinois  on April 15  1955  8  the ninth McDonald s restaurant overall  Kroc later purchased the McDonald brothers  equity in the company and led its worldwide expansion  and the company became listed on the public stock markets in 1965  9 Kroc was also noted for aggressive business practices  compelling the McDonald brothers to leave the fast food industry  The McDonald brothers and Kroc feuded over control of the business  as documented in both Kroc s autobiography and in the McDonald brothers  autobiography  The site of the McDonald brothers  original restaurant is now a monument  10  With the expansion of McDonald s into many international markets  the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life  Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity  corporate ethics and consumer responsibility  Corporate overview Facts and figures By 1993  McDonald s had sold more than 100 billion hamburgers  The once ubiquitous restaurant signs that boasted the number of sales  such as this one in Harlem  were left at  99 billion  as there was only space for two digits  McDonald s restaurants are found in 119 countries 11  and territories around the world and serve 58 million customers each day  3  McDonald s operates over 31 000 restaurants worldwide  employing more than 1 5 million people  11  The company also operates other restaurant brands  such as Piles Caf   Focusing on its core brand  McDonald s began divesting itself of other chains it had acquired during the 1990s  The company owned a majority stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill until October 2006  when McDonald s fully divested from Chipotle through a stock exchange  12  13  Until December 2003  it also owned Donatos Pizza  On August 27  2007  McDonald s sold Boston Market to Sun Capital Partners  14  Types of restaurants Most standalone McDonald s restaurants offer both counter service and drive through service  with indoor and sometimes outdoor seating  Drive Thru  Auto Mac  Pay and Drive  or  McDrive  as it is known in many countries  often has separate stations for placing  paying for  and picking up orders  though the latter two steps are frequently combined  it was first introduced in Arizona in 1975  following the lead of other fast food chains  The first such restaurant in Britain opened at Fallowfield  Manchester in 1986  15  In some countries   McDrive  locations near highways offer no counter service or seating  In contrast  locations in high density city neighborhoods often omit drive through service  There are also a few locations  located mostly in downtown districts  that offer Walk Thru service in place of Drive Thru  To accommodate the current trend for high quality coffee and the popularity of coffee shops in general  McDonald s introduced McCaf   a caf  style accompaniment to McDonald s restaurants in the style of Starbucks  McCaf  is a concept created by McDonald s Australia  starting with Melbourne in 1993  Today  most McDonald s in Australia have McCaf s located within the existing McDonald s restaurant  In Tasmania  there are McCaf s in every store  with the rest of the states quickly following suit  After upgrading to the new McCaf  look and feel  some Australian stores have noticed up to a 60  increase in sales  As of the end of 2003 there were over 600 McCaf s worldwide  Some locations are connected to gas stations convenience stores  16  while others called McExpress have limited seating and or menu or may be located in a shopping mall  Other McDonald s are located in Wal Mart stores  McStop is a location targeted at truckers and travelers which may have services found at truck stops  17  Since 1997  the only Kosher McDonald s in the world that is not in Israel  is located in the  Abasto de Buenos Aires   Argentina  18  19  Playgrounds McDonald s in Panorama City  Los Angeles  California designed for family friendly image Some McDonald s in suburban areas and certain cities feature large indoor or outdoor playgrounds  The first PlayPlace with the familiar crawl tube design with ball pits and slides was introduced in 1987 in the USA  with many more being constructed soon after  Some PlayPlace playgrounds have been renovated into  R Gym  areas  Redesign McDonald s in Exeter  UK  This is an example of the new look of McDonald s in Europe  In 2006  McDonald s introduced its  Forever Young  brand by redesigning all of its restaurants  the first major redesign since the 1970s  20  21  The design includes the traditional McDonald s yellow and red colors  but the red is muted to terra cotta  the yellow was turned golden for a more  sunny  look  and olive and sage green were also added  To warm up its look  the restaurants have less plastic and more brick and wood  with modern hanging lights to produce a softer glow  Contemporary art or framed photographs hang on the walls  Business model McDonald s Corporation earns revenue as an investor in properties  a franchiser of restaurants  and an operator of restaurants  Approximately 15  of McDonald s restaurants are owned and operated by McDonald s Corporation directly  The remainder are operated by others through a variety of franchise agreements and joint ventures  The McDonald s Corporation s business model is slightly different from that of most other fast food chains  In addition to ordinary franchise fees and marketing fees  which are calculated as a percentage of sales  McDonald s may also collect rent  which may also be calculated on the basis of sales  As a condition of many franchise agreements  which vary by contract  age  country  and location  the Corporation may own or lease the properties on which McDonald s franchises are located  In most  if not all cases  the franchisee does not own the location of its restaurants  The United Kingdom and Ireland business model is different than the U S  in that fewer than 30  of restaurants are franchised  with the majority under the ownership of the company  McDonald s trains its franchisees and others at Hamburger University in Oak Brook  Illinois  In other countries  McDonald s restaurants are operated by joint ventures of McDonald s Corporation and other  local entities or governments  As a matter of policy  McDonald s does not make direct sales of food or materials to franchisees  instead organizing the supply of food and materials to restaurants through approved third party logistics operators  According to Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser  2001   nearly one in eight workers in the U S  have at some time been employed by McDonald s   According to a news piece on Fox News this figure is one in ten  citation needed   The book also states that McDonald s is the largest private operator of playgrounds in the U S   as well as the single largest purchaser of beef  pork  potatoes  and apples  The selection of meats McDonald s uses varies with the culture of the host country  citation needed  Shareholder dividends McDonald s has increased shareholder dividends for 25 consecutive years  22  making it one of the S amp P 500 Dividend Aristocrats  23  24  Controversies As a prominent example of the rapid globalization of the American fast food industry  McDonald s is often the target of criticism for its menu  its expansion  and its business practices  The McLibel Trial  also known as McDonald s Restaurants v Morris  amp  Steel  is an example of this criticism  In 1990  activists from a small group known as London Greenpeace  no connection to the international group Greenpeace  distributed leaflets entitled What s wrong with McDonald s   criticizing its environmental  health  and labor record  The corporation wrote to the group demanding they desist and apologize  and  when two of the activists refused to back down  sued them for libel in one of the longest cases in British civil law  A documentary film of the McLibel Trial has been shown in several countries  Despite the objections of McDonald s  the term  McJob  was added to Merriam Webster s Collegiate Dictionary in 2003  25  The term was defined as  a low paying job that requires little skill and provides little opportunity for advancement   26  In an open letter to Merriam Webster  Jim Cantalupo  former CEO of McDonald s  denounced the definition as a  slap in the face  to all restaurant employees  and stated that  a more appropriate definition of a  McJob  might be  teaches responsibility    Merriam Webster responded that  we stand by the accuracy and appropriateness of our definition   27  In 1999  French anti globalisation activist Jos  Bov  vandalized a half built McDonald s to protest against the introduction of fast food in the region  28  In 2001  Eric Schlosser s book Fast Food Nation included criticism of the business practices of McDonald s  Among the critiques were allegations that McDonald s  along with other companies within the fast food industry  uses its political influence to increase its profits at the expense of people s health and the social conditions of its workers  The book also brought into question McDonald s advertisement techniques in which it targets children  While the book did mention other fast food chains  it focused primarily on McDonald s  McDonald s is the world s largest distributor of toys  which it includes with kids meals  29  It has been alleged that the use of popular toys encourages children to eat more McDonald s food  thereby contributing to many children s health problems  including a rise in obesity  30  In 2002  vegetarian groups  largely Hindu and Buddhist  successfully sued McDonald s for misrepresenting its French fries as vegetarian  when they contained beef broth  31  A PETA activist dressed as a chicken confronts the manager of the Times Square McDonald s over the company s animal welfare standards  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals  PETA   continues to pressure McDonald s to change its animal welfare standards  in particular the method its suppliers use for slaughtering chickens  32  Most processors in the United States shackle the birds upside down  then run them through an electrically charged water tub to render them unconscious before slitting their throats  33  PETA argues that using gas to kill the birds  a method known as  controlled atmosphere killing  or CAK  is less cruel  34  Both CAK and  controlled atmosphere stunning   CAS  are commonly used in Europe  33  Morgan Spurlock s 2004 documentary film Super Size Me said that McDonald s food was contributing to the epidemic of obesity in society  and that the company was failing to provide nutritional information about its food for its customers  Six weeks after the film premiered  McDonald s announced that it was eliminating the super size option  and was creating the adult happy meal  The soya that is fed to McDonald s chickens is supplied by agricultural giant Cargill and comes directly from Brazil  Greenpeace alleges that not only is soya destroying the Amazon rain forest in Brazil  but soya farmers are guilty of further crimes including slavery and the invasion of indigenous peoples  lands  The allegation is that McDonald s  as a client of Cargill s  is complicit in these activities  35  Arguments in defense In response to public pressure  McDonald s has sought to include more healthy choices in its menu and has introduced a new slogan to its recruitment posters   Not bad for a McJob   36   The word McJob  first attested in the mid 1980s 37  and later popularized by Canadian novelist Douglas Coupland in his book Generation X  has become a buzz word for low paid  unskilled work with few prospects or benefits and little security   McDonald s disputes this definition of McJob  In 2007  the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan  Would you like a career with that   on Irish television  outlining that its jobs have many prospects  In an effort to respond to growing consumer awareness of food provenance  the fast food chain changed its supplier of both coffee beans and milk  UK chief executive Steve Easterbrook said   British consumers are increasingly interested in the quality  sourcing and ethics of the food and drink they buy   citation needed  In a bid to tap into the ethical consumer market  38  McDonald s switched to using coffee beans taken from stocks that are certified by the Rainforest Alliance  a conservation group  Additionally  the company started using organic milk supplies for its hot drinks and milkshakes  According to a report published by Farmers Weekly in 2007  the quantity of milk used by McDonald s could have accounted for as much as 5  of the UK s organic milk output  39  McDonald s announced on May 22  2008 that  in the U S  and Canada  it would switch to using cooking oil that contains no trans fats for its french fries  and canola based oil with corn and soy oils  for its baked items  pies and cookies  by year s end  40  41  With regard to acquiring chickens from suppliers who use CAK or CAS methods of slaughter  McDonald s says that it needs to see more research  to help determine whether any CAS system in current use is optimal from an animal welfare perspective   42  Environmental record Kosher McDonald s at Ben Gurion International Airport  Israel In April 2008  McDonald s announced that 11 of its Sheffield  England restaurants have been using a biomass trial that had cut its waste and carbon footprint by half in the area  In this trial  waste from the restaurants were collected by Veolia Environmental Services and used to produce energy at a power plant  McDonald s plans to expand this project  although the lack of biomass power plants in the U S  will prevent this plan from becoming a national standard anytime soon  43  In addition  in Europe  McDonald s has been recycling vegetable grease by converting it to fuel for its diesel trucks  44  Furthermore  McDonald s has been using a corn based bioplastic to produce containers for some of its products  Although industries who use this product claim a carbon savings of 30  to 80   a Guardian study shows otherwise  The results show that this type of plastic does not break down in landfills as efficiently as other conventional plastics  The extra energy it takes to recycle this plastic results in a higher output of greenhouse gases  Also  the plastics can contaminate waste streams  causing other recycled plastics to become unsaleable  45  The U S  Environmental Protection Agency has recognized McDonald s continuous effort to reduce solid waste by designing more efficient packaging and by promoting the use of recycled content materials  46  McDonald s reports that it is committed towards environmental leadership by effectively managing electric energy  by conserving natural resources through recycling and reusing materials  and by addressing water management issues within the restaurant  47  In an effort to reduce energy usage by 25  in its restaurants  McDonald s opened a prototype restaurant in Chicago in 2009 with the intention of using the model in its other restaurants throughout the world  Building on past efforts  specifically a restaurant it opened in Sweden in 2000 that was the first to intentionally incorporate green ideas  McDonald s designed the Chicago site to save energy by incorporating old and new ideas such as managing storm water  using skylights for more natural lighting and installing some partitions and tabletops made from recycled goods  48  When McDonald s received criticism for its environmental policies in the 1970s  it began to make substantial progress towards source reductions efforts  49  For instance  an  average meal  in the 1970s a Big Mac  fries  and a drink required 46 grams of packaging  today  it requires only 25 grams  allowing a 46  reduction  50  In addition  McDonald s eliminated the need for intermediate containers for cola by having a delivery system that pumps syrup directly from the delivery truck into storage containers  saving two million pounds of packaging annually  51  Overall  weight reductions in packaging and products  as well as the increased usage of bulk packaging ultimately decreased packaging by 24 million pounds annually  52  Legal cases Main article  McDonald s legal cases McDonald s has been involved in a number of lawsuits and other legal cases  most of which involved trademark disputes  The company has threatened many food businesses with legal action unless it drops the Mc or Mac from trading names  In one noteworthy case  McDonald s sued a Scottish caf  owner called McDonald  even though the business in question dated back over a century  Sheriff Court Glasgow and Strathkelvin  November 21  1952   On September 8  2009  McDonald s Malaysian operations lost a lawsuit to prevent another restaurant calling itself McCurry  McDonald s lost in an appeal to Malaysia s highest court  the Federal Court  53  It has also filed numerous defamation suits  For example  in the McLibel case  McDonald s sued two activists for distributing pamphlets attacking its environmental  labor and health records  After the longest trial in UK legal history  the judge found that some claims in the pamphlet were untrue and therefore libellous  The company  however  had asserted that all claims in the pamphlet were untrue  essentially obliging the judge to publicly rule on each one  Embarrassingly for the company  several of the specific allegations were upheld  54  McDonald s has defended itself in several cases involving workers  rights  In 2001 the company was fined  12 400 by British magistrates for illegally employing and over working child labor in one of its London restaurants  This is thought to be one of the largest fines imposed on a company for breaking laws relating to child working conditions  R v 2002 EWCA Crim 1094   In April 2007 in Perth  Western Australia  McDonald s pleaded guilty to five charges relating to the employment of children under 15 in one of its outlets and was fined AU 8 000  55  Possibly the most infamous legal case involving McDonald s was the 1994 decision in The McDonald s Coffee Case where Stella Liebeck was awarded several million dollars after she suffered third degree burns after spilling a scalding cup of McDonald s coffee on herself  In a McDonald s American Idol figurine promotion  the figurine that represents  New Wave Nigel  wears something that closely resembles Devo s Energy Dome  which was featured on the band s album cover  Freedom of Choice  In addition to the figurine s image  it also plays a tune that appears to be an altered version of Devo s song  Doctor Detroit   Devo copyrighted and trademarked the Energy Dome and is taking legal action against McDonald s  56  Products A McDonald s McArabia meal  served with French fries  The McArabia is a popular pita bread sandwich sold in the Middle East and central Asia  Main article  McDonald s products See also  McDonald s products  international  McDonald s predominantly sells hamburgers  various types of chicken sandwiches and products  French fries  soft drinks  breakfast items  and desserts  In most markets  McDonald s offers salads and vegetarian items  wraps and other localized fare  On a seasonal basis  McDonald s offers the McRib sandwich  Some speculate the seasonality of the McRib adds to its appeal  57  Various countries  especially in Asia  are currently serving soup  This local deviation from the standard menu is a characteristic for which the chain is particularly known  and one which is employed either to abide by regional food taboos  such as the religious prohibition of beef consumption in India  or to make available foods with which the regional market is more familiar  such as the sale of McRice in Indonesia   Headquarters McDonald s Plaza  located in Oak Brook  Illinois is the headquarters of McDonald s The McDonald s headquarters complex  McDonald s Plaza  is located in Oak Brook  Illinois  It sits on the site of the former headquarters and stabling area of Paul Butler  the founder of Oak Brook  58  McDonald s moved into the Oak Brook facility from an office within the Chicago Loop in 1971  59  Advertising Main article  McDonald s advertising McDonald s has for decades maintained an extensive advertising campaign  In addition to the usual media  television  radio  and newspaper   the company makes significant use of billboards and signage  sponsors sporting events ranging from Little League to the Olympic Games  and makes coolers of orange drink with its logo available for local events of all kinds  Nonetheless  television has always played a central role in the company s advertising strategy  To date  McDonald s has used 23 different slogans in United States advertising citation needed   as well as a few other slogans for select countries and regions  At times  it has run into trouble with its campaigns  Children s advertising Main articles  Ronald McDonald and McDonaldland Sports awards and honors See Category McDonald s High School All Americans Global operations

albeit for a Maharaja Mac the next cheapest Big Mac is Hong Kong   61  Thomas Friedman once said that no country with a McDonald s had gone to war with another  62  Full citation needed  However  the  Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention  is not strictly true  Exceptions are the 1989 United States invasion of Panama  NATO s bombing of Serbia in 1999  the 2006 Lebanon War  and the 2008 South Ossetia war  Some observers have suggested that the company should be given credit for increasing the standard of service in markets that it enters  A group of anthropologists in a study entitled Golden Arches East 63  looked at the impact McDonald s had on East Asia  and Hong Kong in particular  When it opened in Hong Kong in 1975  McDonald s was the first restaurant to consistently offer clean restrooms  driving customers to demand the same of other restaurants and institutions  McDonald s have recently when   taken to partnering up with Sinopec  the second largest oil company in the People s Republic of China  as it begins to take advantage of the country s growing use of personal vehicles by opening numerous drive thru restaurants  64  McDonald s has opened a McDonald s
