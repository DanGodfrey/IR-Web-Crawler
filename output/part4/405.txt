of Jefferson County  According to the 2010 United States Census  Birmingham had a population of 212 237  2  The Birmingham Hoover Metropolitan Area had a population of about 1 128 047 according to the 2010 Census  which is approximately one quarter of Alabama s population  Birmingham was founded in 1871  just after the American Civil War  through the merger of three pre existing farm towns  notably  former Elyton  It grew from there  annexing many more of its smaller neighbors  into an industrial and railroad transportation center with a focus on mining  the iron and steel industry  and railroading  Birmingham was named for Birmingham  one of the major industrial cities of the United Kingdom  Most of the original settlers who founded Birmingham were of English ancestry  3  The city was planned as a place where cheap  non unionized  and African American labor from rural Alabama could be employed in the city s steel mills and blast furnaces  giving it a competitive advantage over industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast  4  From its founding through the end of the 1960s  Birmingham was a primary industrial center of the South  The pace of Birmingham s growth during the period from 1881 through 1920 earned its nicknames The Magic City and The Pittsburgh of the South  Much like Pittsburgh  Birmingham s major industries were iron and steel production  plus a major component of the railroading industry  where rails and railroad cars were both manufactured in Birmingham  In the field of railroading  the two primary hubs of railroading in the Deep South were nearby Atlanta and Birmingham  beginning in the 1860s and continuing through to the present day  The economy diversified during the later half of the twentieth century  Though the manufacturing industry maintains a strong presence in Birmingham  other businesses and industries such as banking  telecommunications  transportation  electrical power transmission  medical care  college education  and insurance have risen in stature  Mining in the Birmingham area is no longer a major industry with the exception of coal mining  Birmingham ranks as one of the most important business centers in the Southeastern United States and is also one of the largest banking centers in the United States  In addition  the Birmingham area serves as headquarters to one Fortune 500 company  Regions Financial  Five Fortune 1000 companies are headquartered in Birmingham  In the field of college and university education  Birmingham has been the location of the UAB School of Medicine and the University of Alabama School of Dentistry since 1947  and since that time  it has also become provided with the University of Alabama at Birmingham  founded circa 1969   one of three main campuses of the University of Alabama  and also with the private Birmingham Southern College  Between these two universities and Samford University  the Birmingham area has major colleges of medicine  dentistry

Further reading 11 External links  edit  History  edit  Founding and early growth Birmingham was founded on June 1  1871  by the Elyton Land Company whose investors included cotton planters  bankers and railroad entrepreneurs  It sold lots near the planned crossing of the Alabama  amp  Chattanooga and South  amp  North Alabama railroads including land formerly a part of the Benjamin P  Worthington Plantation  The first business at that crossroads was the trading post and country store operated by Marre  amp  Allen  The site of the railroad crossing was notable for the nearby deposits of iron ore  coal  and limestone   the three main raw materials used in making steel  Birmingham is the only place worldwide where significant amounts of all three minerals can be found in close proximity  5  From the start the new city was planned as a great center of industry  The founders  organized as the Elyton Land Company  borrowed the name of Birmingham  one of England s main industrial cities  to advertise that point  The growth of the planned city was impeded by an outbreak of cholera and a Wall Street crash in 1873  However  it began to grow shortly afterward at an explosive rate  The town of Elyton  Alabama  and several other surrounding towns were absorbed into Birmingham in 1911  The turn of the century brought the substantial growth that gave Birmingham the nickname  The Magic City  as the downtown area developed from a low rise commercial and residential district into a busy grid of neoclassical mid rise and high rise buildings and busy streetcar lines  Between 1902 and 1912 four large office buildings were constructed at the intersection of 20th Street  the central north south spine of the city  and 1st Avenue North  which connected the warehouses and industrial facilities stretching along the east west railroad corridor  This impressive group of early skyscrapers was nicknamed  The Heaviest Corner on Earth   Panorama of Birmingham  Alabama in 1916 The Great Depression hit Birmingham especially hard as sources of capital that were fueling the city s growth rapidly dried up at the same time that farm laborers  driven off the land  made their way to the city in search of work  New Deal programs made important contributions to the city s infrastructure and artistic legacy  including such key improvements as Vulcan s tower and Oak Mountain State Park  The wartime demand for steel and the post war building boom gave Birmingham a rapid return to prosperity  Manufacturing diversified beyond the production of raw materials and major civic institutions such as schools  parks and museums  were able to expand their scope  6   edit  Birmingham civil rights movement Main article  Birmingham campaign In the 1950s and 1960s Birmingham received national and international attention as a center of the civil rights struggle for African Americans  Locally the movement s activists were led by Fred Shuttlesworth  a fiery preacher who became legendary for his fearlessness in the face of violence  notably a string of racially motivated bombings that earned Birmingham the derisive nickname  Bombingham   7  16th Street Baptist Church  now a National Historic Landmark A watershed in the civil rights movement occurred in 1963 when Shuttlesworth requested that Martin Luther King  Jr   and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  SCLC   which Shuttlesworth had co founded  come to Birmingham  where King had once been a pastor  to help end segregation  8  Together they launched  Project C   for  Confrontation    a massive assault on the Jim Crow system  During April and May daily sit ins and mass marches organized and led by movement leader James Bevel were met with police repression  tear gas  attack dogs  fire hoses  and arrests  More than 3 000 people were arrested during these protests  almost all of them high school age children  These protests were ultimately successful  leading not only to desegregation of public accommodations in Birmingham but also the Civil Rights Act of 1964  9  While imprisoned for having taken part in a nonviolent protest  Dr  King wrote the now famous Letter from Birmingham Jail  a defining treatise in his cause against segregation  Birmingham is also known for a bombing which occurred later that year  in which four black girls were killed by a bomb planted at the 16th Street Baptist Church  The event would inspire the African American poet Dudley Randall s opus   The Ballad of Birmingham   as well as jazz musician John Coltrane s song  Alabama   In 1998 the Birmingham Pledge  written by local attorney James Rotch  was introduced at the Martin Luther King Unity Breakfast  As a grassroots community commitment to combating racism and prejudice  it has since then been used for programs in all fifty states and in more than twenty countries  10   edit  Recent history In the 1970s urban renewal efforts focused around the development of the University of Alabama at Birmingham  which developed into a major medical and research center  In 1971 Birmingham celebrated its centennial with a round of public works improvements  including the upgrading of Vulcan Park  Birmingham s banking institutions enjoyed considerable growth as well and new skyscrapers started to appear in the city center for the first time since the 1920s  These projects helped the city s economy to diversify  but did not prevent the exodus of many of the city s residents to independent suburbs  In 1979 Birmingham elected Dr  Richard Arrington Jr  as its first African American mayor  The population inside Birmingham s city limits has fallen over the past few decades  due in large part to  white flight  from the city of Birmingham proper to surrounding suburbs  From 340 887 in 1960  the population was down to 242 820 in 2000  a loss of about 29 percent  By 2009 Census estimates placed Birmingham s population at 230 650  That same period saw a corresponding rise in the populations of the suburban communities of Hoover  Vestavia Hills  Alabaster  and Gardendale  none of which were incorporated as municipalities until after 1950  Today  Birmingham has begun to experience something of a rebirth  Money has been invested in reconstructing the downtown area into a 24 hour mixed use district  The market for downtown lofts and condominiums has mushroomed while restaurant  retail and cultural options are beginning to sprout up  In 2006 the visitors bureau selected  the diverse city  as a new tag line for the city  11   edit  Geography and climate  edit  Geography Cahaba River National Wildlife Refuge Birmingham occupies Jones Valley  flanked by long parallel mountain ridges  the tailing ends of the Appalachian foothills   see Ridge and Valley Appalachians  running from north east to south west  The valley is drained by small creeks  Village Creek  Valley Creek  which flow into the Black Warrior River  The valley was bisected by the principal railroad corridor  along which most of the early manufacturing operations began  Red Mountain lies immediately south of downtown  Many of Birmingham s television and radio broadcast towers are lined up along this prominent ridge  The  Over the Mountain  area  including Shades Valley  Shades Mountain and beyond  was largely shielded from the industrial smoke and rough streets of the industrial city  This is the setting for Birmingham s more affluent suburbs of Mountain Brook  Vestavia Hills  Homewood  and Hoover  South of Shades Valley is the Cahaba River basin  one of the most diverse river ecosystems in the United States  Sand Mountain  a smaller ridge  flanks the city to the north and divides Jones Valley from much more rugged land to the north  The Louisville and Nashville Railroad  now CSX Transportation  enters the valley through Boyles Gap  a prominent gap in the long low ridge  Ruffner Mountain  located due east of the heart of the city  is home to Ruffner Mountain Nature Center  one of the largest urban nature reserves in the United States  According to the U S  Census Bureau  the city has a total area of 151 9 square miles  393 km2   of which  149 9 square miles  388 km2  of it is land and 2 0 square miles  5 2 km2  of it  1 34   is water   edit  Climate Birmingham has a humid subtropical climate  characterized by hot summers  mild winters  and

and daily snowfall total  The spring and fall months are pleasant but variable as cold fronts frequently bring strong to severe thunderstorms and occasional tornadoes to the region  The fall season features less rainfall and fewer storms  as well as lower humidity than the spring  but it is also a secondary severe weather season  Birmingham is located on the heart of a Tornado Alley known as the Dixie Alley due to the frequency of tornadoes in Central Alabama  The greater Birmingham area has been hit by two F5 tornadoes  one in Birmingham s northern suburbs in 1977  and second in the western suburbs in 1998  The area has been hit by an EF4 tornado in 2011  In late summer and fall months  Birmingham experiences occasional tropical storms and hurricanes due to its proximity to the Central Gulf Coast  The record high temperature is 107  F  41 7  C   set on July 29  1930  13  and the record low is  6  F   21 1  C   set on January 21  1985  14  Climate data for Birmingham  Alabama

km2  by the directors of the Elyton Land Co  The streets were numbered from west to east  leaving Twentieth Street to form the central spine of downtown  anchored on the north by Capital Park and stretching into the slopes of Red Mountain to the south  A  railroad reservation  was granted through the center of the city  running east to west and zoned solely for industrial uses  As the city grew  bridges and underpasses separated the streets from the railroad bed  lending this central reservation some of the impact of a river  without the pleasant associations of a waterfront   From the start  Birmingham s streets and avenues were unusually wide at 80 to 100 feet  24 to 30 m   purportedly to help evacuate unhealthy smoke  Railroad Park near downtown In the early 20th century professional planners helped lay out many of the new industrial settlements and company towns in the Birmingham District  including Corey  now Fairfield  which was developed for the Tennessee Coal  Iron and Railroad Company  subsequently purchased by U  S  Steel   At the same time  a movement to consolidate several neighboring cities gained momentum  Although local referendums indicated mixed feelings about annexation  the Alabama legislature enacted an expansion of Birmingham s corporate limits that became effective on January 1  1910  The Robert Jemison company developed many residential neighborhoods to the south and west of Birmingham which are still renowned for their aesthetic quality  A 1924 plan for a system of parks  commissioned from the Olmsted Brothers is seeing renewed

Birmingham metro area with sanitary sewer service  Sewer rates have increased in recent years 33  after citizens concerned with pollution in area waterways filed a lawsuit that resulted in a federal consent decree to repair an aging sewer system  Because the estimated cost of the consent decree was approximately three times more than the original estimate  many blame the increased rates on corruption 33  within the Jefferson County Environmental Services Department  One major reason for the higher cost was that Jefferson County had to buy the sewers from the many smaller municipalities in the area to ensure that these sewers were being maintained in a fashion that would meet E P A  approval to avoid massive fines for failure to comply with the consent decree  This continues to be a controversial topic in the region  33  Electric power is provided primarily by Southern Company subsidiary  Alabama Power  However  some of the surrounding area such as Bessemer and Cullman are
