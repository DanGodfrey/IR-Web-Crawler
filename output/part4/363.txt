Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum  Illyana first appeared in Giant Size X Men  1  May 1975   though her first name was not given until Uncanny X Men  145  May 1981   In the 1983 limited series Magik  Illyana and Storm   she aged seven years while in a paranormal dimension called Limbo  became a sorceress  and developed the mutant ability to create  teleportation discs   She then joined the junior team the New Mutants  2   edit  Fictional character biography Illyana Rasputin  born Illyana Nikolievna Rasputina  was born in the Ust Ordynski Collective farm  near Lake Baikal  Siberia  Russian SFSR  Soviet Union to Nikolai Rasputin and his wife Alexandra Natalya Rasputina  Illyana s two older brothers  Mikhail Nikolaievitch Rasputin and Piotr  Peter  Nikolaievitch Rasputin were both mutants  The X Men suspected Illyana to be a mutant as well  but they figured that years would pass until her adolescence and the emergence of any possible powers  They were wrong in this hypothesis  however  Peter s superhuman powers manifested while saving Illyana from a runaway tractor  3  A transformed Illyana becomes a powerful sorceress and ruler of Limbo in Magik  Illyana and Storm   When she was six years old  Illyana was abducted and brought to the United States by Arcade  who used her and several other hostages to coerce the X Men to assist him in opposing Doctor Doom  She was rescued and brought back to the X Mansion  4  Shortly thereafter  Illyana was kidnapped again  this time to the Limbo dimension by Belasco and S ym  inhabitants of this demon dimension  5  She was raised there and a portion of her essence soul was corrupted by Belasco  who sought to claim her soul in order to use it as a key to bring forth the Elder Gods to rule Earth  In order to free himself  Belasco needed to fill the Beatrix Medallion with five bloodstones  The blood stones would be created by corrupting Illyana s soul  with a new stone appearing as her corruption deepened  6  She was later rescued and tutored in the practice of white magic by that dimension s version of Storm  who turned to magic when her mutant powers waned  and eventually rebelled against Belasco  Finding the use of magic abhorrent  Limbo s version of Shadowcat kidnapped and trained Illyana in hand to hand and sword combat  7  Cat along with Illyana attempted to storm Belasco s citadel and kill him after her training  They were overwhelmed by Belasco who further transformed Cat into a more feline demonic creature  With Illyana back under his control  Belasco was able to instruct her in the art of black magic in the hopes that it would further corrupt her soul  However  Illyana covertly plotted Belasco s defeat and continued to resist the dark influence on her soul  8  Before he kidnapped Illyana  Belasco used both Storm and Shadowcat as potential gateways to freeing the Elder Gods by manipulating their souls with his evil  Both refused his magic before the process could be completed  Because of this  Illyana formed a mystical bond between both Storm and Kitty once she too was used in the same manner  9  Belasco was successful in using Illyana to create three parts of the bloodstone pendant and only needed two more in order to bring forth the Elder Gods  Realizing this  Illyana created the Soulsword and took over limbo as its new ruler  During her battle with Belasco she magically developed horns  a tail and fangs  She discovered that these new features only appeared when she held the Soulsword  After winning the battle  she banished Belasco from Limbo and claimed S ym as her servant  10  She then managed to return to Earth several years older  although no time had passed on Earth since her kidnapping  5  She subsequently joined the New Mutants  2  Former New Mutants writer Louise Simonson s one shot  Time Trial   written for Marvel s 2007 Mystic Arcana limited series  takes place during the events of New Mutants  vol  1   32  during which Magik misguided one of her teleportation discs through the space time continuum and stranded herself and Mirage in ancient Egypt  There  Illyana met Storm s ancestor Ashake  an Egyptian priestess  Together  they defeated an evil sorcerer Heka Nut who sought an ancient mystical sword called the Sword of Bone using Magik s Soulsword  Ashake helped Illyana and Dani return to the present  with Dani s memory of the incident erased in the process  11  The series indicated that Illyana is mystically associated with the alchemic and classical element of air and the Suit of Swords in the mystic Tarot  11  Over time when it came to the Inferno storyline  a strange armor began to appear on her body each time she wielded the Soulsword  which  much like her brother Colossus  gave her a form of invulnerability and increased strength  The armor appeared only on one of her shoulders and arms at first  12  but gradually began appearing on more of her body with each time that she wielded the sword  13  Illyana s skill as a sorceress grew as over time and she was able to battle other beings with mystical powers such as Baba Yaga  14  the Enchantress  15 Forge  16 Spiral  17  and Heka Nut  18  During the  Inferno  storyline  a routine trip through Limbo went awry  leaving the New Mutants stuck in Limbo  19  Illyana s demonic nature began to completely overtake her body and the demons pressed her to become the full and true lord of their realm  Her efforts to escape provided the demon N astirh the opportunity to open a colossal teleportation disc between Earth and Limbo  which triggered an invasion of Earth by demons from Limbo  Towards the end of this ordeal the seven year old Illyana was seen in some part of timeless Limbo  Magik made a supreme effort  which defeated S ym  Afterwards  when the New Mutants examined the husk of Magik s armor they found the seven year old Illyana inside it  She still possessed the bloodstone locket Belasco gave to her  implying that she still had ties to Limbo  The New Mutants  best guess as to what happened was that by forcibly removing her seven year old self from Limbo  before she had been corrupted by Belasco  then everything since then had been negated and none of it had happened  except that they still had their memories of the teenage Illyana who had not existed and of events which had not happened  20  Because of the mystic bond she shared with the Kitty Pryde from the Limbo dimension  the Soulsword then passed on to Earth s Kitty Pryde in England  It embedded itself into a stone near Excalibur s lighthouse headquarters  waiting for Kitty to claim it and become its new wielder  She rejected it out of fear she would become a twisted dark image of herself  just as Illyana had  Seeing how much its presence bothered her friend Kitty  Rachel Summers attempted to remove it from the bedrock with the powers of the Phoenix Force but could not move it  because  Kitty guessed  it would only move upon her command  21  It stayed embedded in England until it eventually fell into the hands of the supervillain Doctor Doom  who shortly thereafter lost it to the demon Darkoth  It eventually was acquired by Amanda Sefton  who would become the new Magik  and then go on to be ruler of Limbo and wielder of the Soulsword  Illyana  still a child  returned to Russia where she lived with her parents for some months until they were murdered by the Russian government in order to secure Illyana s abilities to defeat a psionic being known as the Soul Skinner  Illyana then returned to the X Mansion to live with her brother Piotr and the other X Men  22  Not long afterwards  Illyana contracted the Legacy Virus  succumbed to it and finally died in the X Mansion  despite all efforts in order to save her made by Charles Xavier and Moira McTaggert  Not being able to be there for his sister  Colossus  consumed by grief and rage  betrayed the X Men and joined the Acolytes right after her burial in Siberia  23  Her spirit  however  contacted both Wolverine and Piotr from the afterlife  She came to Logan shortly after he had the adamantium pulled from his body  and urged him to return to the world of the living to save Jean Grey  Illyana s spirit returned again  24  this time to her brother Piotr  who had recently returned to the United States with Kitty and Nightcrawler following the disbanding of Excalibur  When investigating odd occurrences inside the Mansion  Piotr located one of stepping disks that Illyana had magically bound to the school  He found himself transported to a pocket world  which held a memory imprint of Illyana  There Piotr manages to learn how to let go a little more and to move on with his life  while still remembering his sister  volume  amp  issue needed  Despite this  Illyana s memory convinced him to make one final sacrifice  When the cure for the Legacy Virus turned out to need the death of one mutant  he secretly and willingly gave his life  so nobody else would have to die like Illyana did  volume  amp  issue needed  Colossus would later be resurrected by an alien race  volume  amp  issue needed  After finally overthrowing Amanda Sefton as leader  Belasco returned to his previous position as ruler of Limbo  He created a powerful spell to return Illyana to him after seeing her reappear during the House of M crossover event  The spell managed to pull forth the remaining essence and memories of Illyana still held within Limbo s dimension  The essence took shape and became the Darkchylde  Unfortunately  Belasco was not satisfied with his creation  claiming that it was not the true Illyana Rasputin  due to her lack of Illyana s soul  and banished her to the outer parts of Limbo  25  Darkchylde eventually discovered some of the teenage New X Men being attacked by a horde of demons  After aiding the mutants against the demons  Darkchylde subsequently used a spell to immobilize them in order to steal a portion of the New X Man Pixie s soul  in the hopes of creating both a bloodstone and a new Soulsword  as Illyana felt Pixie had the most innocent of souls present  The spell was interrupted by Anole  who broke free from Illyana s confinement and dispatched her  26  Pixie s soul extraction was partially successful however  creating one part of a bloodstone pendant and a soul dagger  Illyana then attempted to complete the process and destroy those who wished to interfere  but the New X Man Rockslide thwarted her  and caused Illyana s human memories of her friends and life among the X Men to apparently return to her  26  Although only a part of Pixie s soul was taken  Illyana informed the other New X Men that Pixie was now capable of performing magic  the hole in her soul having been filled with black magic  Since Belasco had sealed his castle from her own magic and powers  Illyana taught Pixie a teleportation spell  with which the New X Men attacked and defeated Belasco  25  Illyana then gave into her Darkchylde persona and announced her desire to create several more bloodstones in order to become god like in power  Before Illyana could begin the process  however  she was interrupted by the arrival of her brother  Colossus  investigating Illyana s apparent return to life  A pained Illyana rejected her brother s offers of help  and sent everyone back to Earth  before reclaiming Limbo s throne  and informing with S ym and N astirh  now once more her servants  that her next move is to reclaim her soul  25  Illyana was next seen in her castle in Limbo recounting how she was an impatient child and plotting to get her soul back  At first she planned on using her Bloodstone medallion but decided against it because it had ruined so many lives and she refused to follow in the footsteps of Belasco  Motivated by her relationship with Kitty and Piotr  she tried to reclaim her soul through love and teleported to the Xavier Institute only to find it destroyed and abandoned  Saddened and angry  she declared that she would not get her soul back through love but through suffering and that she would target those who had wronged her and make them pay with their souls  27  Cover art for X Infernus  1  Magik as Darkchilde  Art by David Finch  While in Limbo  Darkchylde attacked various demons in her search for the Bloodstone amulet  becoming enraged when referred to by her human name  Her activities were noticed by Mephisto  Blackheart  Satannish  Dormammu and Hela  Belasco s daughter  Witchfire appeared during the meeting and revealed she was now the current owner of the Illyana s Bloodstone amulet and vowed to take her father s place as ruler of Limbo  Back at the X Men s base in San Francisco  Pixie attacked Nightcrawler with her soul dagger during a training session in the Danger Room and in the process accidentally discovered where Magik s Soulsword was hidden   inside Nightcrawler  Having sensed its presence  Darkchylde teleported in and laid claim to it  28  Pixie engaged her in combat  refusing to hand over the Soulsword and demanded the return of the bloodstone forged from her own soul  Darkchylde easily defeated her and reclaimed her sword  transforming into her Magik persona  However  Magik stuck Colossus when he entered the Danger Room her and called out to her  realizing that something was wrong when she does not feel any emotions  She returned to Limbo telling her brother he cannot save her  and that she has to save herself  Upon to her return to Limbo  she discovered that Witchfire had conquered Limbo and Magik s armies during her absence  Determined to destroy her  Witchfire engaged her in combat  29  Claiming everything that Belasco ever owned  Witchfire captured Magik  took her bloodstone and added it to the amulet  After the X Men arrived at the castle  Kurt discovered Illyana chained to a pillar  She asked him to stab her with Pixie s soul dagger  as he was the only one who was attuned to magic  She apologized and he stabs her  In doing so he re released the Soulsword inside of her  Meanwhile  Witchfire completed the set of Bloodstones via another portion of Pixie s soul and released the Elder Gods  30  Illyana then teamed up with the other mutants to hold back Witchfire and the Elder Gods  Using a combination of magic and the powers of the Soulsword and Souldagger  Illyana and Pixie were able to remove one of Pixie s bloodstones  Because of this  the Elder Gods were swept back to their dimension  along with Witchfire and the remaining bloodstones  Pixie s Souldagger then merged with the bloodstone that was pried loose by Ilyana  Angry that her second bloodstone was still lost and in the possession of Witchfire  Pixie then declared her hatred for Illyana and flew away  31  Saddened by the loss of her and Pixie s remaining bloodstones  Illyana teleported the mutants back to the X Base and was about to exile herself to Limbo  However  before she can do so her various former teammates begged for her to stay with them  But it was Cyclops that reminded her that they are a family and that  with so few mutants left  they needed her  Colossus then stepped forward and begged her not to leave and hurt him again  She reluctantly agreed  31  After receiving an anonymous tip in Colorado about a young mutant endangering a small town  Dani and Shan were sent to investigate and calm the locals  During their mission  Magik reappeared back at the X Men s base in San Francisco after teleporting off into the future after the events of  X Infernus  Upon her return  the younger mutants were still very distrustful of her and after a brief argument she informed Sam and Roberto that Shan and Dani were in trouble and that it would result in their deaths  Sam assembled a team consisting of himself  Sunspot  Magma and Magik to go find Dani and Shan  When questioned about his roster request  Sam replied that there is bad blood between Illyana and the younger mutants because they do not trust her  but he does  Illyana seemed to have undergone a personality change since her return from the future  becoming more detached emotionally in most cases  possibly due to the further loss of most of her soul during  X Infernus   32  While en route  Illyana asked Magma questions about her visits to Empath since he tried to kill her friends and asked if she still loves him  Magma just said he s blind and helpless and Illyana offered to cure him  Magma struggles to answer causing Magik to accuse her of liking him  that way  but nevertheless offers to help him if she asks  adding that it could be their little secret  While searching for Shan and Dani in Colorado  the girls split up because Illyana felt sorry for a lost little girl  Sam and Roberto came across a tied up and unconscious Shan in the back of a bar  Meanwhile Magik and Magma were tricked into freeing Legion from a box  32  Legion  as a result of absorbing hundreds of new personalities was even more insane  absorbed Shan s mind and sought to act on his vendetta against Dani for her part in one of his previous defeats  When Cannonball decided to locate Legion in order to bring him to Emma Frost  Illyana ignored his orders and entered Legion s mind by using Shan s mind as a bridge and began to kill all of Legion s split personalities in order to locate Shan  33  After locating Shan in Legion s mind  they teamed up with the lost girl  Marci and David Haller to find the doll that controls his body  After the doll was found  Magik and the others are returned to their bodies  34  During the protests between anti mutant and pro mutant movements about mutant reproductive rights during the Dark Reign storyline  Illyana was seen watching the news coverage along with most of the other X Men  35  Later  Cyclops sends her to team up  unknowingly  with X Force to locate Wolverine and teleport them to Alcatraz to rescue any mutants taken prisoner by Norman Osborn s forces  Along with Pixie  they teleported all the X Men from San Francisco to their new home  Utopia  36  In the aftermath of Utopia  Karma and Illyana were debriefed by Kavita Rao  where they informed her of what went on in Legion s mind  When Kavita mistook Marci for one of Legion s personalities  Shan corrected her and revealed that Marci was a real person  and that when she was about to exit his mind  Legion revealed to her that Marci did not have a body to return to  Shan explained how Legion s power works  that he absorbs the powers and personalities of people that die in close proximity to him and that one of Legion s personalities had killed Marci after she bought Legion water and played with him after he d returned from the Age of Apocalypse  Feeling angry  Illyana offered her Soulsword to Shan  telling her that it would be their little secret  Shan used the soulsword to kill the personality responsible for Marci s murder but told Kavita that Magik had done the deed  Magik kept her promise and corroborated Shan s version of events  37  When Hope and Cable returned to the present during the X Men  Second Coming storyline  Bastion began eliminating all mutant teleporters to trap the mutant population on Utopia  Magik was the first to fall while trying to bring Hope and Cable to Utopia  One of the Purifiers fired on her with some sort of supernatural weapon that opened a portal to Limbo that she could not control  she was then drawn into the portal by a cluster of demonic tentacles  38  Cyclops later designated Cannonball as the team leader of the rescue mission to extract Magik from Limbo  This team consisted of people that Cyclops was willing to spare but who were also deemed right for the job  39  She was eventually freed from her restraints by Pixie  and she and her rescue team returned to Earth  40  In a reversal of fortune  Pixie was soon kidnapped by Project Purgatory  and Magik returned to Limbo with the New Mutants in order to rescue her  41  While in Limbo  the New Mutants encountered the Inferno Babies   mutants who were taken as infants by the government during the Inferno and were raised and trained in Limbo  42  This now adult team of mutants attacked and overwhelmed Magik and the New Mutants  While the rest of the team was badly injured and captured  Magik managed escape to Earth with Karma and Pixie  After hiding the Soulsword inside Karma  Magik teleported the rest of the X Men to Portal Epsilon  Project Purgatory s gateway to Limbo  for what the X Men believed to be a rescue mission  They arrived just as Limbo s Elder Gods breached the gateway to Earth  43  Karma released Legion s mind with the soulsword  freeing him to use his vast powers to destroy the Elder Gods and return the bloodstones belonging to Magik and Pixie  44  Confronted by Cyclops afterward  Magik admitted to putting the world in danger and manipulating the X Men for the sake of a personal vendetta against the Elder Gods  As a result  Cyclops decided that she must be restrained  While she remained unrepentant  she accepted his decision  45  During the Fear Itself storyline  Magik was seen in the X Brig 2  a newly constructed  ultra high security prison 500 ft  below sea level  She was controlled by devices that detected and prevented the use of teleportation and magic  During a visit Magik accepted the blame for her incarceration when Colossus tried to comfort her  46  Soon afterwards she was approached by Moonstar s old friend Gus Grim  a Native American Cognitive Therapist from Colorado known for his work in the Cheyenne communities  who had come to Utopia to help Moonstar s  damaged  teammates  But before they could talk  Grim collapsed and three demons from Limbo burst from his body to rescue Magik  Magik  however  had no intention of leaving  as she wanted to stay and to regain her life and the trust of her friends  The demons were then banished by Danger using a protocol designed by Doctor Strange for just such an occasion  Grim recovered from this ordeal  and Magik explained that the demons used his body as a Trojan Horse to get into Utopia to rescue her  47  When Juggernaut  who had become the Worthy Kuurth  attacked San Francisco  Cyclops sent Dani Moonstar to meet with asgardian death goddess Hela  in the hope that she could explain what was happening  However  on the way to Las Vegas  Dani was forcibly moved to Hel  Discovering that Dani was gone  the New Mutants sought the assistance of Magik  however  due to the devices attached to her  she could not use her powers  yet she could explain to them what happened to Dani and told Cypher how he could take the team to her  However  Doug made   a mistake in the spell  and instead of Hel  he teleported the team into the Hell dimension of Mephisto  48  As the had X Men failed to stop Juggernaut  Magik was approached by her brother and Kitty who wanted her help to defeat him  She was released from her prison and used her powers to teleport herself  Colossus and Kitty Pryde into the Crimson Cosmos where they met with Cytorrak  Illyana told Cyttorak that Cain Marko had betrayed him and now served another god  Cytorrak took his power back from Marko and intended to make Magik his new avatar  but Colossus intercepted  and became the new Juggernaut  much to the dismay of Kitty Pryde  46   edit  Powers and abilities This section has multiple issues  Please help improve

style that may require cleanup  Tagged since March 2010  Cover to New Mutants  vol  1   50  featuring Magik wielding her Soulsword  Pencils by Rick Leonardi  inks by Dan Green   edit  Teleportation Magik has the mutant ability to teleport herself and others through time and space from one location to another by summoning  stepping discs   which are part of a dimension known as Limbo in the Marvel Universe  This dimension is specifically known alternately as  Demonic Limbo    Limbo Belasco   or  Otherplace   However  when Illyana mentally calls for a Stepping Disc she must use Limbo as a midway point before she can teleport to an alternate location  If she teleported herself or someone else from one place on Earth to another  the person would pass through Otherplace in the process  Magik could also teleport herself or someone into the Otherplace dimension or out of it  It is not known if she was genetically predetermined to travel through Limbo  or if she did so because  having been spirited there as a child  it was the only alternate dimension she was instinctively aware of  Magik has succeeded in teleporting herself across continents  from one continent to another  and even interplanetary and intergalactic distances on occasion  49  Apparently she can mentally scan Limbo while on Earth in order to locate whoever she wishes to teleport from Limbo down to her on Earth  citation needed  Unlike most other teleporters in the Marvel Universe  Magik can teleport through time as well as space  She has teleported moments  days or centuries into the past or future  50  51  Especially early on  she had difficulty modulating this ability and would often inadvertently travel through time and space when intending to teleport only through space  15  51  Magik was told by Doctor Strange that she had potential for great feats of manipulating time on a wider scale  volume  amp  issue needed  Illyana Rasputin could only utilize her superhuman mutant powers when she was an adolescent  on reverting to a prepubescent state her mutant powers returned to latency  As Magik  she never entirely mastered her teleportation ability  although her control over it improved with practice  Hence  the greater the distance over which she teleported  the greater the possible margin of error in terms of her arriving at the point of time she intended  citation needed   edit  Sorcery Magik is the sorceress supreme of her Limbo dimension  The extent of her powers in Limbo has yet to be defined  but powerful demons of Limbo did not dare challenge her  In Limbo  Magik can probably cast any magic spell that Belasco could  having had access to his store of sorcerous knowledge  The only exception to this is spells of teleportation  which Belasco kept from her  as stated in the Magik limited series  to ensure she never escaped captivity  Magik s recent teaching of a teleportation spell to Pixie  who has no known natural teleportation ability  is inconsistent with this fact  Her sorcery was a unique mix of black magic that she learned from Belasco and white magic she was taught by an alternative reality Ororo Munroe  She could not create uncorrupted life with a portion of her soul as Storm  her mentor  was able to do  as evidenced by the time Storm created an acorn that grew into a tree  The acorn Illyana created was rotten on the inside as her own soul was in her body  However  she was able to create a sword from a portion of her soul to use as a weapon  On one occasion she was shown to have easily inhibited the powers of the Enchantress while in Limbo despite the Enchantress being a powerful sorceress in her own right  15  Magik s magical abilities are far more limited in Earth s dimension  though she can still manipulate magical energies for various effects  Even an unskilled  but Earth based  magic user like Forge has demonstrated himself to be her superior  16  On Earth she has performed astral projection  sensed mystical presences  scried  and cast very simple spells  Her magical powers on Earth are primarily the use of her Soulsword  which is the ultimate embodiment of her mystical might  and the summoning of her eldritch armor  In X Infernus  however  she has been seen using magic of a seemingly greater strength than she could previously use in Earth s dimension  29   edit  Eldritch armor Illyana  willing most of her armor to appear  Art by Bret Blevins  The more that Magik uses her magical power on any occasion  the more mystical armor appears on her body in addition to demonic features such as horns  hooves  a tail and scales  The armor deflects or limits attacks  both physical and magical  which was shown during her battle with Forge  16  Illyana s armor also provided her protection and immunity to the Transmode Virus  which was shown when her transmode virus infected demons attempted to dethrone her  Also shown during the Inferno storyline was an aspect of limited super strength while in the armor  which makes Illyana similar in power to her brother Colossus  This was shown when the rather large demon S ym was easily thrown several feet by Illyana when he attempted to force her to the ground during the events of Inferno  52   edit  Soulsword The Soulsword was created by Illyana Rasputin during her imprisonment in Limbo by Belasco  Illyana magically caused her own life force energy to manifest before her  Once this happened she cast her hand into a pool of eldritch energy and imagined a weapon in her mind  When she withdrew her hand she discovered she was holding the Soulsword  which was created from her own soul  53  A simple looking blade upon its origin  it began to develop intricate designs and forms upon itself the more Illyana used it  becoming more powerful with each use  54  After Illyana s death the Soulsword was passed to Kitty Pryde who initially rejected it due to its ties to dark magic  55  It was then taken from her by Doctor Doom  and then taken from him by Darkoth the Death Demon  volume  amp  issue needed Amanda Sefton possessed the sword afterwards when she became a temporary ruler of Limbo  56  Fearing it would be stolen again  Amanda magically hid the sword inside the body of her former lover Nightcrawler  volume  amp  issue needed  A resurrected Illyana Rasputin was seen aiding the New X Men in Limbo  after Belasco abducted them and the adult X Men to his realm  57  She is also responsible for using the soul of the New X Man Pixie to create a soul dagger  a blade similar in origin  if not power  to the Soulsword  58  Illyana is now in possession of the Soulsword once again  31  Magik s Soulsword disrupts magic energies  constructs and creatures  It also augments the power level of any magic user who holds it  The Soulsword generally has no physical effect whatsoever  but disrupts even the most powerful magic as it passes through  It can shatter enchantments and destroy mystical creations and creatures  While it can kill magic creatures  such as demons  upon contact  it rarely injures non magical beings or items  although it has recently been shown to capable of killing psionic entities  59  The only exception to this has been Kitty Pryde  who can still be cut by the Soulsword even when Pryde is using her phasing power to become intangible  Pryde is also one of the few people other than Magik who can wield the Soulsword effectively  When Pryde does so  Magik s armor begins to appear on Pryde s body  Moreover  when the Beyonder once freed Illyana from the influence of her darksoul  Pryde gained the ability to produce and wield the Soulsword  Illyana later took the darksoul influence back into herself in order that she could again wield the Soulsword to save Pryde s life from a demon  Illyana once used it on herself to purge a magical strain of the Technarch transmode virus from her system after being infected by a transmode virus infected demon  54  Illyana can make her Soulsword appear and vanish at will  60  The Soulsword can increase the mystical abilities of any magic user  and as the Soulsword is the living embodiment of Illyana Rasputin  whomever owns the sword is considered to be the ruler of Limbo  just as Illyana once was  The Soulsword has appeared in various dimensions  wielded by alternate Illyana Rasputins  For example  the Exiles version of Illyana wielded her own blade  which was referred to as the  Soul Sword of Bata s Circle   volume  amp  issue needed  The exact origin of this sword is unclear  but this version of Illyana was able to create another blade after losing her original in a fight with Earth 616 s Archangel  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Other abilities It is also mentioned that Illyana has formidable psionic shields  which are mental barriers that block anyone from reading her mind  This is most likely a result of the time she spent in Limbo and the effects of her evolving a partially demonic soul  As such even powerful mind readers such as Charles Xavier  61  the Shadow King  62  and the Phoenix enhanced Rachel Summers 63  can not mentally read Illyana s thoughts  Illyana was able to lower her psionic shields and allow Emma Frost to see her memories of the death of the X Men  64  Due to Belasco creating the magical bloodstones with their souls  Illyana seems to have a psychic bond with X Man Kitty Pryde  When telepathically scanning a nightmare Kitty was having  Rachel Summers surmised that the nightmare was originating from Illyana and that the two of them have similar thought patterns  causing a psychic rapport like those of twins  63  Because of this  a similar connection could be considered between Illyana and Storm  65   edit  Other versions  edit  Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse timeline  Illyana was never kidnapped by Belasco at all  It was believed she had been killed during Apocalypse s attacks on Russia  but she was actually taken to the slave camp known as the Core located in Seattle  which provided energy for Apocalypse s empire  Colossus  Shadowcat and Generation NeXt rescued her  at the cost of the lives of every single member of Generation NeXt  except for Husk  who was later revealed to have survived   Illyana then helped Bishop go back in time to prevent the Age of Apocalypse from occurring in the mainstream Earth 616 timeline  66  In the 2000 Blink limited series  it is revealed via flashback that the mutant villain Sugar Man was at one point the jailer in charge of cellmates Illyana Rasputin  the longlost sister of fellow X Man Colossus  and Blink  before she was rescued as a young girl by Weapon X and Sabretooth  in a prison facility  and that he sexually abused both of them on a nightly basis  volume  amp  issue needed  This is also shown that in the

friend Shadowcat  When Alistaire Stuart and a near comatose Rachel Summers are threatened by the authorities  Illyana grants them sanctuary  however  she merely intends to use her guests to ensure her success in a bid for dominance over the world  When the authorities once more attempt to search Illyana s apartment  an altercation occurs and she is shot dead but merely resurrects into her fully demonic form which is incredibly powerful  but not sufficiently so to withstand the assault of a restored Phoenix   edit  Exiles An Illyana from yet another timeline  Earth 4210  was also a member of the team known as The Exiles  Illyana replaced Blink when the Timebroker apparently sent her home  She had been led to believe that had she not become an Exile  she would murder her family  This

Timebroker decreed that half the members of the combined Exiles and Weapon X group had to die  Fearing for her life  Magik tried to join King Hyperion and told him of the mission Exiles and Weapon X had been given  In order to corroborate her claims  Hyperion snapped Magik s neck to see if a replacement Exile was sent  Magik s body was kept in the stasis gallery at the Panoptichron  until the Exiles took over the timeline fixing operation and sent the bodies of the fallen Exiles and Weapon X ers home  Magik was buried by Colossus and their parents   edit  House of M Magik was seen once

67  but has not been seen since  However  this resulted in Belasco s resurrection of Illyana in the main Earth   edit  Shattershot In the Shattershot crossover  a reality was shown in which Illyana was regressed in the same way as in Earth 616 but never succumbed to the Legacy Virus  She grew up to master her mutant and mystical powers  called herself Darkchild and joined X Force alongside New Mutants like Sunspot and Cannonball  68   edit  Other In another reality in which Illyana is an adult  her son is trapped in an incorporeal form  She makes a deal with Mephisto to provide him with a
