Wozniak engineered one of the first commercially successful lines of personal computers  the Apple II series  Jobs was among the first to see the commercial potential of Xerox PARC s mouse driven graphical user interface  which led to the creation of the Apple Lisa and  one year later  the Macintosh  During this period he also led efforts that would begin the desktop publishing revolution  notably through the introduction of the LaserWriter and the associated PageMaker software  8  After losing a power struggle with the board of directors in 1985  Jobs left Apple and founded NeXT  a

Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco on 24 February 1955  to two university students  Joanne Carole Schieble and Syrian born Abdulfattah  John  Jandali  Arabic                     who were both unmarried at the time  22  Jandali who was teaching in Wisconsin when Steve was born in 1955  said he had no choice but to put the baby up for adoption because his girlfriend s family objected to their relationship  23  He was adopted at birth by Paul Reinhold Jobs  1922 1993  and Clara Jobs  1924 1986   Clara s maiden name was Hagopian  24  When asked about his  adoptive parents   Jobs replied emphatically that Paul and Clara Jobs  were my parents   25  He later stated in his authorized biography that they  were my parents 1 000    26  His biological parents subsequently married  December 1955   had a second child Mona Simpson in 1957  and divorced in 1962  26  The Jobs family moved from San Francisco to Mountain View  California when Steve was five years old  1  2  Paul and Clara later adopted a daughter  Patti  Paul Jobs  a machinist for a company that made lasers  taught his son rudimentary electronics and how to work with his hands  1  Clara was an accountant 25  who taught him to read before he went to school  1  Clara Jobs had been a payroll clerk for Varian Associates  one of the first high tech firms in what became known as Silicon Valley  27  Jobs attended Monta Loma Elementary  Mountain View  Cupertino Junior High and Homestead High School in Cupertino  California  2  He frequented after school lectures at the Hewlett Packard Company in Palo Alto  California  and was later hired there  working with Steve Wozniak as a summer employee  28  Following high school graduation in 1972  Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland  Oregon  Although he dropped out after only one semester  29  he continued auditing classes at Reed  while sleeping on the floor in friends  rooms  returning Coke bottles for food money  and getting weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple  30  Jobs later said   If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college  the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts   30  Early career This section may be in need of reorganization to comply with Wikipedia s layout guidelines  Please help by editing the article to make improvements to the overall structure   March 2012  Homebrew Computer Club Newsletter  September 1976 In 1974  Jobs took a job as a technician at Atari  Inc  in Los Gatos  California  31  He traveled to India in mid 1974 32  to visit Neem Karoli Baba 33  at his Kainchi Ashram with a Reed College friend  and  later  an early Apple employee   Daniel Kottke  in search of spiritual enlightenment  When they got to the Neem Karoli ashram  it was almost deserted as Neem Karoli Baba had died in September 1973  31  Then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of Hariakhan Baba  In India  they spent a lot of time on bus rides from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and back  then up to Himachal Pradesh and back  31  Jobs left India after staying for seven months 34  and returned to the US ahead of Daniel Kottke  31  with his head shaved and wearing traditional Indian clothing  35  36  During this time  Jobs experimented with psychedelics  calling his LSD experiences  one of the two or three most important things  he had  done in  his  life   37  He also became a serious practitioner of Zen Buddhism  engaged in lengthy meditation retreats at the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center  the oldest S t  Zen monastery in the US  38  considered taking up monastic residence  and maintained a lifelong appreciation for Zen  39  He later said that people around him who did not share his countercultural roots could not fully relate to his thinking  37  Jobs returned to Atari and was assigned to create a circuit board for the game Breakout  According to Atari co founder Nolan Bushnell  Atari offered  100 for each chip that was eliminated in the machine  Jobs had little interest in or knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips  Much to the amazement of Atari  Wozniak reduced the number of chips by 50  a design so tight that it was impossible to reproduce on an assembly line  According to Wozniak  Jobs told Wozniak that Atari gave them only  700  instead of the offered  5 000  and that Wozniak s share was thus  350  40  Wozniak did not learn about the bonus until ten years later  but said that had Jobs told him about it and said he needed the money  Wozniak would have given it to him  41  Jobs began attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club with Wozniak in 1975  2  He greatly admired Edwin H  Land  the inventor of instant photography and founder of Polaroid Corporation  and explicitly modeled his own career after that of Land s  42  43  Career Apple Computer See also  History of Apple Home of Paul and Clara Jobs  on Crist Drive in Los Altos  California  Steve Jobs formed Apple Computer in its garage with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in 1976  Wayne stayed only a short time  leaving Jobs and Wozniak as the primary co founders of the company  Jobs and Steve Wozniak met in 1971  when their mutual friend  Bill Fernandez  introduced 21 year old Wozniak to 16 year old Jobs  In 1976  Wozniak invented the Apple I computer  Jobs  Wozniak  and Ronald Wayne founded Apple computer in the garage of Jobs s parents in order to sell it  44  They received funding from a then semi retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer Mike Markkula  45  In 1978  Apple recruited Mike Scott from National Semiconductor to serve as CEO for what turned out to be several turbulent years  In 1983  Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi Cola to serve as Apple s CEO  asking   Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life  or do you want to come with me and change the world   46  In the early 1980s  Jobs was among the first to see the commercial potential of Xerox PARC s mouse driven graphical user interface  which led to the creation of the Apple Lisa  One year later  Apple employee Jef Raskin invented the Macintosh  47  48  The following year  Apple aired a Super Bowl television commercial titled  1984   At Apple s annual shareholders meeting on January 24  1984  an emotional Jobs introduced the Macintosh to a wildly enthusiastic audience  Andy Hertzfeld described the scene as  pandemonium   49  Apple logo in 1977  created by Rob Janoff with the rainbow color theme used until 1998  While Jobs was a persuasive and charismatic director for Apple  some of his employees from that time described him as an erratic and temperamental manager  Disappointing sales caused a deterioration in Jobs s working relationship with Sculley and it eventually became a power struggle between Jobs and Sculley  50  Jobs kept meetings running past midnight  sent out lengthy faxes  then called new meetings at 7 00 am  51  Sculley learned that Jobs believing Sculley to be  bad for Apple  and the wrong person to lead the company had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup  and on May 24  1985  called a board meeting to resolve the matter  50  Apple s board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties as head of the Macintosh division  52  53  Jobs resigned from Apple five months later 50  and founded NeXT Inc  the same year  51  54  In a speech Jobs gave at Stanford University in 2005  he said being fired from Apple was the best thing that could have happened to him   The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again  less sure about everything  It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life   And he added   I m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn t been fired from Apple  It was awful tasting medicine  but I guess the patient needed it   30  55  56  NeXT Computer See also  NeXT A NeXTstation with the original keyboard  mouse and the NeXT MegaPixel monitor After leaving Apple  Jobs founded NeXT Computer in 1985  with  7 million  A year later  Jobs was running out of money  and with no product on the horizon  he appealed for venture capital  Eventually  he attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot who invested heavily in the company  57  NeXT workstations were first released in 1990  priced at  9 999  Like the Apple Lisa  the NeXT workstation was technologically advanced  but was largely dismissed as cost prohibitive by the educational sector for which it was designed  58  The NeXT workstation was known for its technical strengths  chief among them its object oriented software development system  Jobs marketed NeXT products to the financial  scientific  and academic community  highlighting its innovative  experimental new technologies  such as the Mach kernel  the digital signal processor chip  and the built in Ethernet port  Tim Berners Lee invented the World Wide Web on a NeXT computer at CERN  59  The revised  second generation NeXTcube was released in 1990  also  Jobs touted it as the first  interpersonal  computer that would replace the personal computer  With its innovative NeXTMail multimedia email system  NeXTcube could share voice  image  graphics  and video in email for the first time   Interpersonal computing is going to revolutionize human communications and groupwork   Jobs told reporters  60  Jobs ran NeXT with an obsession for aesthetic perfection  as evidenced by the development of and attention to NeXTcube s magnesium case  61  This put considerable strain on NeXT s hardware division  and in 1993  after having sold only 50 000 machines  NeXT transitioned fully to software development with the release of NeXTSTEP Intel  62  The company reported its first profit of  1 03 million in 1994  57  In 1996  NeXT Software  Inc  released WebObjects  a framework for Web application development  After NeXT was acquired by Apple Inc  in 1997  WebObjects was used to build and run the Apple Store  62 MobileMe services  and the iTunes Store  Pixar and Disney In 1986  Jobs bought The Graphics Group  later renamed Pixar  from Lucasfilm s computer graphics division for the price of  10 million   5 million of which was given to the company as capital  63  The first film produced by the partnership  Toy Story  with Jobs credited as executive producer  64  brought fame and critical acclaim to the studio when it was released in 1995  Over the next 15 years  under Pixar s creative chief John Lasseter  the company produced box office hits A Bug s Life  1998   Toy Story 2  1999   Monsters  Inc   2001   Finding Nemo  2003   The Incredibles  2004   Cars  2006

an award introduced in 2001  65  Steve Jobs on computer graphics Steve Jobs on computer graphics  Interview excerpt from 1995  66  In the years 2003 and 2004  as Pixar s contract with Disney was running out  Jobs and Disney chief executive Michael Eisner tried but failed to negotiate a new partnership  67  and in early 2004  Jobs announced that Pixar would seek a new partner to distribute its films after its contract with Disney expired  In October 2005  Bob Iger replaced Eisner at Disney  and Iger quickly worked to patch up relations with Jobs and Pixar  On January 24  2006  Jobs and Iger announced that Disney had agreed to purchase Pixar in an all stock transaction worth  7 4 billion  When the deal closed  Jobs became The Walt Disney Company s largest single shareholder with approximately seven percent of the company s stock  11  Jobs s holdings in Disney far exceeded those of Eisner  who holds 1 7 percent  and of Disney family member Roy E  Disney  who until his 2009 death held about one percent of the company s stock and whose criticisms of Eisner   especially that he soured Disney s relationship with Pixar   accelerated Eisner s ousting  Jobs joined the company s board of directors upon completion of the merger and also helped oversee Disney and Pixar s combined animation businesses from a seat on a special six person steering committee  68  Upon Jobs s death his shares in Disney were transferred to the Steven P  Jobs Trust led by Laurene Jobs  69  Return to Apple See also   1998 2005  Return to profitability  in Apple  Inc  Logo for the Think Different campaign designed by TBWA Chiat Day and initiated by Jobs after his return to Apple Computer in 1997  In 1996  Apple announced that it would buy NeXT for  427 million  The deal was finalized in late 1996  70  bringing Jobs back to the company he co founded  Jobs became de facto chief after then CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in July 1997  He was formally named interim chief executive in September  71  In March 1998  to concentrate Apple s efforts on returning to profitability  Jobs terminated a number of projects  such as Newton  Cyberdog  and OpenDoc  In the coming months  many employees developed a fear of encountering Jobs while riding in the elevator   afraid that they might not have a job when the doors opened  The reality was that Jobs s summary executions were rare  but a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company   72  Jobs also changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones  making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines  With the purchase of NeXT  much of the company s technology found its way into Apple products  most notably NeXTSTEP  which evolved into Mac OS X  Under Jobs s guidance  the company increased sales significantly with the introduction of the iMac and other new products  since then  appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for Apple  At the 2000 Macworld Expo  Jobs officially dropped the  interim  modifier from his title at Apple and became permanent CEO  73  Jobs quipped at the time that he would be using the title  iCEO   74  Jobs on stage at Macworld Conference  amp  Expo  San Francisco  January 11  2005 The company subsequently branched out  introducing and improving upon other digital appliances  With the introduction of the iPod portable music player  iTunes digital music software  and the iTunes Store  the company made forays into consumer electronics and music distribution  On June 29  2007  Apple entered the cellular phone business with the introduction of the iPhone  a multi touch display cell phone  which also included the features of an iPod and  with its own mobile browser  revolutionized the mobile browsing scene  While stimulating innovation  Jobs also reminded his employees that  real artists ship   75  Jobs was both admired and criticized for his consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship  which has been dubbed the  reality distortion field  and was particularly evident during his keynote speeches  colloquially known as  Stevenotes   at Macworld Expos and at Apple Worldwide Developers Conferences  In 2005  Jobs responded to criticism of Apple s poor recycling programs for e waste in the US by lashing out at environmental and other advocates at Apple s Annual Meeting in Cupertino in April  A few weeks later  Apple announced it would take back iPods for free at its retail stores  The Computer TakeBack Campaign responded by flying a banner from a plane over the Stanford University graduation at which Jobs was the commencement speaker  30  The banner read  Steve  don t be a mini player recycle all e waste   In 2006  he further expanded Apple s recycling programs to any US customer who buys a new Mac  This program includes shipping and  environmentally friendly disposal  of their old systems  76  Resignation In August 2011  Jobs resigned as CEO of Apple  but remained with the company as chairman of the company s board  77  78  Hours after the announcement  Apple Inc   AAPL  shares dropped five percent in after hours trading  79  This relatively small drop  when considering the importance of Jobs to Apple  was associated with the fact that his health had been in the news for several years  and he had been on medical leave since January 2011  80  It was believed  according to Forbes  that the impact would be felt in a negative way beyond Apple  including at The Walt Disney Company where Jobs served as director  81  In after hours trading on the day of the announcement  Walt Disney Co   DIS  shares dropped 1 5 percent  82  Business life Wealth Jobs earned only  1 a year as CEO of Apple  83  but held 5 426 million Apple shares  as well as 138 million shares in Disney  which he received in exchange for Disney s acquisition of Pixar   84  Jobs quipped that the  1 per annum he was paid by Apple was based on attending one meeting for 50 cents while the other 50 cents was based on his performance  85 Forbes estimated his net wealth at  8 3 billion in 2010  making him the 42nd wealthiest American  86  Stock options backdating issue Steve Jobs and Bill Gates at the fifth D  All Things Digital conference  D5  in 2007 In 2001  Jobs was granted stock options in the amount of 7 5 million shares of Apple with an exercise price of  18 30  It was alleged that the options had been backdated  and that the exercise price should have been  21 10  It was further alleged that Jobs had thereby incurred taxable income of  20 000 000 that he did not report  and that Apple overstated its earnings by that same amount  As a result  Jobs potentially faced a number of criminal charges and civil penalties  The case was the subject of active criminal and civil government investigations  87  though an independent internal Apple investigation completed on December 29  2006  found that Jobs was unaware of these issues and that the options granted to him were returned without being exercised in 2003  88  On July 1  2008  a  7 billion class action suit was filed against several members of the Apple Board of Directors for revenue lost due to the alleged securities fraud  89  90  Management style Jobs was a demanding perfectionist 91  92  who always aspired to position his businesses and their products at the forefront of the information technology industry by foreseeing and setting trends  at least in innovation and style  He summed up that self concept at the end of his keynote speech at the Macworld Conference and Expo in January 2007  by quoting ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky  There s an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love   I skate to where the puck is going to be  not where it has been   And we ve always tried to do that at Apple  Since the very very beginning  And we always will  93  Much was made of Jobs s aggressive and demanding personality  Fortune wrote that he was  considered one of Silicon Valley s leading egomaniacs   94  Commentaries on his temperamental style can be found in Michael Moritz s The Little Kingdom  The Second Coming of Steve Jobs  by Alan Deutschman  and iCon  Steve Jobs  by Jeffrey S  Young  amp  William L  Simon  In 1993  Jobs made Fortune s list of America s Toughest Bosses in regard to his leadership of NeXT  NeXT Cofounder Dan l Lewin was quoted in Fortune as saying of that period   The highs were unbelievable     But the lows were unimaginable   to which Jobs s office replied that his personality had changed since then  95  In 2005  Jobs banned all books published by John Wiley  amp  Sons from Apple Stores in response to their publishing an unauthorized biography  iCon  Steve Jobs  96  In its 2010 annual earnings report  Wiley said it had  closed a deal     to make its titles available for the iPad   97 Jef Raskin  a former colleague  once said that Jobs  would have made an excellent king of France   alluding to Jobs s compelling and larger than life persona  98 Floyd Norman said that at Pixar  Jobs was a  mature  mellow individual  and never interfered with the creative process of the filmmakers  99  Jobs had a public war of words with Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell  starting in 1987 when Jobs first criticized Dell for making  un innovative beige boxes   100  On October 6  1997  in a Gartner Symposium  when Michael Dell was asked what he would do if he ran then troubled Apple Computer  he said  I d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders   101  In 2006  Jobs sent an email to all employees when Apple s market capitalization rose above Dell s  The email read  Team  it turned out that Michael Dell wasn t perfect at predicting the future  Based on today s stock market close  Apple is worth more than Dell  Stocks go up and down  and things may be different tomorrow  but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today  Steve  102  Jobs was also a board member at Gap Inc  from 1999 to 2002  103  Inventions and designs His design sense was greatly influenced by the Buddhism which he experienced in India while on a seven month spiritual journey  104  His sense of intuition was also influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied  104  As of October 9  2011  2011  10 09  update   Jobs is listed as either primary inventor or co inventor in 342 United States patents or patent applications related to a range of technologies from actual computer and portable devices to user interfaces  including touch based   speakers  keyboards  power adapters  staircases  clasps  sleeves  lanyards and packages  Most of these are design patents  specific product designs  as opposed to utility patents  inventions   105  106  He has 43 issued US patents on inventions  107  The patent on the Mac OS X Dock user interface with  magnification  feature was issued the day before he died  108  Philanthropy Arik Hesseldahl of BusinessWeek magazine stated that  Jobs isn t widely known for his association with philanthropic causes   compared to Bill Gates s efforts  109  Jobs said  in 1985  that he does charitable acts privately  110  After resuming control of Apple in 1997  Jobs eliminated all corporate philanthropy programs initially  111  Later  under Jobs  Apple signed to participate in Product Red program  producing red versions of devices to give profits from sales to charity  Apple has gone on to become the single largest contributor to the charity since its initial involvement with it  The chief of the Product Red project  singer Bono cited Jobs saying there was  nothing better than the chance to save lives   when he initially approached Apple with the invitation to participate in the program  112  Personal life Jobs s birth parents met at the University of Wisconsin  Abdulfattah  John  Jandali  a Syrian Muslim  113  taught there  Joanne Carole Schieble was his student  they were the same age because Jandali had  gotten his PhD really young    114  115  116  Schieble had a career as a speech language pathologist  Jandali taught political science at the University of Nevada in the 1960s  and then made his career in the food and beverage industry  and since 2006  has been a vice president at a casino in Reno  Nevada  117  118  In December 1955  ten months after giving up their baby boy  Schieble and Jandali married  In 1957  they had a daughter Mona together  They divorced in 1962  and Jandali lost touch with his daughter  119  Her mother remarried and had Mona take the surname of her stepfather  so she became known as Mona Simpson  115  In the 1980s  Jobs found his birth mother  Joanne Schieble Simpson  who told him he had a biological sister  Mona Simpson  They met for the first time in 1985 119  and became close friends  The siblings kept their relationship secret until 1986  when Mona introduced him at a party for her first book  25  After deciding to search for their father  Simpson found Jandali managing a coffee shop  Without knowing who his son had become  Jandali told Mona that he had previously managed a popular restaurant in the Silicon Valley where  Even Steve Jobs used to eat there  Yeah  he was a great tipper   In a taped interview with his biographer Walter Isaacson  aired on 60 Minutes  120  Jobs said   When I was looking for my biological mother  obviously  you know  I was looking for my biological father at the same time  and I learned a little bit about him and I didn t like what I learned  I asked her to not tell him that we ever met   not tell him anything about me   121  Jobs was in occasional touch with his mother Joanne Simpson  111  122  who lives in a nursing home in Los Angeles  115  When speaking about his biological parents  Jobs stated   They were my sperm and egg bank  That s not harsh  it s just the way it was  a sperm bank thing  nothing more   26  Jandali stated in an interview with the The Sun in August 2011  that his efforts to contact Jobs were unsuccessful  Jandali mailed in his medical history after Jobs s pancreatic disorder was made public that year  123  124  125  In her eulogy to Jobs at his memorial service  Mona Simpson stated  I grew up as an only child  with a single mother  Because we were poor and because I knew my father had emigrated from Syria  I imagined he looked like Omar Sharif  I hoped he would be rich and kind and would come into our lives  and our not yet furnished apartment  and help us  Later  after I d met my father  I tried to believe he d changed his number and left no forwarding address because he was an idealistic revolutionary  plotting a new world for the Arab people  Even as a feminist  my whole life I d been waiting for a man to love  who could love me  For decades  I d thought that man would be my father  When I was 25  I met that man and he was my brother  119  Jobs s first child  Lisa Brennan Jobs  was born in 1978  the daughter of his longtime partner Chris Ann Brennan  a Bay Area painter  111  For two years  she raised their daughter on welfare while Jobs denied paternity by claiming he was sterile  he later acknowledged Lisa as his daughter  111  Jobs later married Laurene Powell on March 18  1991  in a ceremony at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park  Presiding over the wedding was Kobun Chino Otogawa  a Zen Buddhist monk  Their son  Reed  was born September 1991  followed by daughters Erin in August 1995  and Eve in 1998  126  The family lives in Palo Alto  California  127  Jobs demonstrating the iPhone 4 to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on June 23  2010 In the unauthorized biography  The Second Coming of Steve Jobs  author Alan Deutschman reports that Jobs once dated Joan Baez  Deutschman quotes Elizabeth Holmes  a friend of Jobs from his time at Reed College  as saying she  believed that Steve became the lover of Joan Baez in large measure because Baez had been the lover of Bob Dylan   Dylan was the Apple icon s favorite musician   In another unauthorized biography  iCon  Steve Jobs by Jeffrey S  Young  amp  William L  Simon  the authors suggest that Jobs might have married Baez  but her age at the time  41  meant it was unlikely the couple could have children  Jobs was also a fan of The Beatles  He referred to them on multiple occasions at Keynotes and also was interviewed on a showing of a Paul McCartney concert  When asked about his business model on 60 Minutes  he replied  My model for business is The Beatles  They were four guys that kept each other s negative tendencies in check  they balanced each other  And the total was greater than the sum of the parts  Great things in business are never done by one person  they are done by a team of people  128  In 1982  Jobs bought an apartment in The San Remo  an apartment building in New York City with a politically progressive reputation  where Demi Moore  Steven Spielberg  Steve Martin  and Princess Yasmin Aga Khan  daughter of Rita Hayworth  also had apartments  With the help of I M  Pei  Jobs spent years renovating his apartment in the top two floors of the building s north tower  only to sell it almost two decades later to U2 singer Bono  Jobs never moved in  129  130  In 1984  Jobs purchased the Jackling House  a 17 000 square foot  1 600 m2   14 bedroom Spanish Colonial mansion designed by George Washington Smith in Woodside  California  Although it reportedly remained in an almost unfurnished state  Jobs lived in the mansion for almost ten years  According to reports  he kept a 1966 BMW R60 2 motorcycle in the living room  and let Bill Clinton use it in 1998  From the early 1990s  Jobs lived in a house in the Old Palo Alto neighborhood of Palo Alto  President Clinton dined with Jobs and 14 Silicon Valley CEOs there on August 7  1996  at a meal catered by Greens Restaurant  131  132  Clinton returned the favor and Jobs  who was a Democratic donor  slept in the Lincoln bedroom of the White House  133  Jobs allowed Jackling House to fall into a state of disrepair  planning to demolish the house and build a smaller home on the property  but he met with complaints from local preservationists over his plans  In June 2004  the Woodside Town Council gave Jobs approval to demolish the mansion  on the condition that he advertise the property for a year to see if someone would move it to another location and restore it  A number of people expressed interest  including several with experience in restoring old property  but no agreements to that effect were reached  Later that same year  a local preservationist group began seeking legal action to prevent demolition  In January 2007  Jobs was denied the right to demolish the property  by a court decision  134  The court decision was overturned on appeal in March 2010  and the mansion was demolished beginning in February 2011  135  Jobs usually wore a black long sleeved mock turtleneck made by Issey Miyake  that was sometimes reported to be made by St  Croix   Levi s 501 blue jeans  and New Balance 991 sneakers  136  137  Jobs told Walter Isaacson     he came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself  both because of its daily convenience  the rationale he claimed  and its ability to convey a signature style    138  He was a pescetarian  139  Jobs s car was a silver Mercedes Benz SL 55 AMG  which did not display its license plates  as he took advantage of a California law which gives a maximum of six months for new vehicles to receive plates  Jobs leased a new SL every six months  140  In a 2011 interview with biographer Walter Isaacson  Jobs revealed at one point he met with U S  President Barack Obama  complained of the nation s shortage of software engineers  and told Mr  Obama that he was  headed for a one term presidency   Jobs proposed that any foreign student who got an engineering degree at a U S  university should automatically be offered a green card  After the meeting  Jobs commented   The president is very smart  but he kept explaining to us reasons why things can t get done     It infuriates me    141  Jobs contributed to a number of political candidates and causes during his life  giving  209 000 to Democrats   19 000 to associated special interests and  1 000 to a Republican  142  Health issues Jobs addressing concerns about his health in 2008  In October 2003  Jobs was diagnosed with cancer  143  and in mid 2004  he announced to his employees that he had a cancerous tumor in his pancreas  144  The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is usually very poor  145  Jobs stated that he had a rare  far less aggressive type known as islet cell neuroendocrine tumor  144  Despite his diagnosis  Jobs resisted his doctors  recommendations for mainstream medical intervention for nine months  111  instead consuming a special alternative medicine diet in an attempt to thwart the disease  According to Harvard researcher Dr  Ramzi Amir  his choice of alternative treatment  led to an unnecessarily early death   143  According to Jobs s biographer  Walter Isaacson   for nine months he refused to undergo surgery for his pancreatic cancer   a decision he later regretted as his health declined   146   Instead  he tried a vegan diet  acupuncture  herbal remedies and other treatments he found online  and even consulted a psychic  He also was influenced by a doctor who ran a clinic that advised juice fasts  bowel cleansings and other unproven approaches  before finally having surgery in July 2004   147  He eventually underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy  or  Whipple procedure   in July 2004  that appeared to successfully remove the tumor  148  149  150  Jobs apparently did not receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy  144  151  During Jobs s absence  Tim Cook  head of worldwide sales and operations at Apple  ran the company  144  In early August 2006  Jobs delivered the keynote for Apple s annual Worldwide Developers Conference  His  thin  almost gaunt  appearance and unusually  listless  delivery  152  153  together with his choice to delegate significant portions of his keynote to other presenters  inspired a flurry of media and Internet speculation about his health  154  In contrast  according to an Ars Technica journal report  Worldwide Developers Conference  WWDC  attendees who saw Jobs in person said he  looked fine   155  Following the keynote  an Apple spokesperson said that  Steve s health is robust   156  Two years later  similar concerns followed Jobs s 2008 WWDC keynote address  157  Apple officials stated Jobs was victim to a  common bug  and was taking antibiotics  158  while others surmised his cachectic appearance was due to the Whipple procedure  151  During a July conference call discussing Apple earnings  participants responded to repeated questions about Jobs s health by insisting that it was a  private matter   Others  however  voiced the opinion that shareholders had a right to know more  given Jobs s hands on approach to running his company  159  160 The New York Times published an article based on an off the record phone conversation with Jobs  noting that  While his health problems amounted to a good deal more than  a common bug   they weren t life threatening and he doesn t have a recurrence of cancer   161  On August 28  2008  Bloomberg mistakenly published a 2500 word obituary of Jobs in its corporate news service  containing blank spaces for his age and cause of death   News carriers customarily stockpile up to date obituaries to facilitate news delivery in the event of a well known figure s death   Although the error was promptly rectified  many news carriers and blogs reported on it  162  intensifying rumors concerning Jobs s health  163  Jobs responded at Apple s September 2008 Let s Rock keynote by quoting Mark Twain   Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated   164  At a subsequent media event  Jobs concluded his presentation with a slide reading  110 70   referring to his blood pressure  stating he would not address further questions about his health  165  On December 16  2008  Apple announced that marketing vice president Phil Schiller would deliver the company s final keynote address at the Macworld Conference and Expo 2009  again reviving questions about Jobs s health  166  167  In a statement given on January 5  2009  on Apple com  168  Jobs said that he had been suffering from a  hormone imbalance  for several months  169  On January 14  2009  in an internal Apple memo  Jobs wrote that in the previous week he had  learned that my health related issues are more complex than I originally thought   and announced a six month leave of absence until the end of June 2009  to allow him to better focus on his health  Tim Cook  who previously acted as CEO in Jobs s 2004 absence  became acting CEO of Apple  170  with Jobs still involved with  major strategic decisions   170  In April 2009  Jobs underwent a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in Memphis  Tennessee  171  172  Jobs s prognosis was described as  excellent   171  On January 17  2011  a year and a half after Jobs returned from his liver transplant  Apple announced that he had been granted a medical leave of absence  Jobs announced his leave in a letter to employees  stating his decision was made  so he could focus on his health   As during his 2009 medical leave  Apple announced that Tim Cook would run day to day operations and that Jobs would continue to be involved in major strategic decisions at the company  173  174  Despite the leave  he made appearances at the iPad 2 launch event  March 2   the WWDC keynote introducing iCloud  June 6   and before the Cupertino city council  June 7   175  Jobs announced his resignation as Apple s CEO on August 24  2011   Unfortunately  that day has come   wrote Jobs  for he could  no longer meet  his  duties and expectations as Apple s CEO   Jobs became chairman of the board and named Tim Cook his successor  176  177  Jobs had worked for Apple until the day before his death  178  Death Flags flying at half staff outside Apple HQ in Cupertino  on the evening of Steve Jobs s death  Memorial candles and iPads to Steve Jobs outside the Apple Store in Palo Alto California shortly after his death Jobs died at his California home around 3 p m  on October 5  2011  due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet cell neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer  2  179  180  resulting in respiratory arrest  181  He had lost consciousness the day before  and died with his wife  children and sister at his side  182  His death was announced by Apple in a statement which read  We are deeply saddened to announce that Steve Jobs passed away today  Steve s brilliance  passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives  The world is immeasurably better because of Steve  His greatest love was for his wife  Laurene  and his family  Our hearts go out to them and to all who were touched by his extraordinary gifts  183  Jobs is survived by Laurene  his wife of 20 years  their three children  and Lisa Brennan Jobs  his daughter from a previous relationship  184  His family released a statement saying that he  died peacefully   185  186  According to Simpson  Jobs  looked at his sister Patty  then for a long time at his children  then at his life s partner  Laurene  and then over their shoulders past them   His last words  spoken hours before his death  were   Oh wow  Oh wow  Oh wow   119  For two weeks following his death  Apple s corporate Web site displayed a simple page  showing Jobs s name and lifespan next to his grayscale portrait  187  Clicking on the image led to an obituary  which read  Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius  and the world has lost an amazing human being  Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor  Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built  and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple  187  Also dedicating its homepage to Jobs was Pixar  with a photo of Jobs  John Lasseter and Edwin Catmull  and the eulogy they wrote  188  Steve was an extraordinary visionary  our very dear friend  and our guiding light of the Pixar family  He saw the potential of what Pixar could be before the rest of us  and beyond what anyone ever imagined  Steve took a chance on us and believed in our crazy dream of making computer animated films  the one thing he always said was to  make it great   He is why Pixar turned out the way we did and his strength  integrity  and love of life has made us all better people  He will forever be part of Pixar s DNA  Our hearts go out to his wife Laurene and their children during this incredibly difficult time  188  An email address was also posted for the public to share their memories  condolences  and thoughts  189  190  Over a million tributes were sent  which are now displayed on the Steve Jobs memorial page  Shortly after his death was announced  ABC  CBS  and NBC interrupted scheduled programming to broadcast this news  191  Numerous newspapers around the world carried news of his death on their front pages the next day  Several notable people  including US President Barack Obama  192  British Prime Minister David Cameron  193 Microsoft founder Bill Gates  194  and The Walt Disney Company s Bob Iger commented on the death of Jobs  Wired News collected reactions and posted them in tribute on their homepage  195  Other statements of condolence were made by many of Jobs s friends and colleagues  such as Steve Wozniak and George Lucas  196  197  A small private funeral was held on October 7  2011  of which details were not revealed out of respect to Jobs s family  198  Apple announced on the same day that they had no plans for a public service  but were encouraging  well wishers  to send their remembrance messages to an email address created to receive such messages  199  Sunday  October 16  2011  was declared  Steve Jobs Day  by Governor Jerry Brown of California  200  On that day  an invitation only memorial was held at Stanford University  Those in attendance include Apple and other tech company executives  members of the media  celebrities  close friends of Jobs  and politicians  along with

 Major media published commemorative works  Time published a commemorative issue for Jobs on October 8  2011  The issues cover featured a portrait of Jobs  taken by Norman Seeff  in which he is sitting in the lotus position holding the original Macintosh computer  first published in Rolling Stone in January 1984  The issue marked the eighth time Jobs has been featured on the cover of Time  209  The issue included a photographic essay by Diana Walker  a retrospective on Apple by Harry McCracken and Lev Grossman  and a six page essay by Walter Isaacson  Isaacson s essay served as a preview of his biography  Steve Jobs  210  Bloomberg Businessweek also published a commemorative issue  The cover of the magazine features Apple style simplicity  with a black and white  up close photo of Jobs and his years of birth and death  The issue was published without advertisements  It featured extensive essays by Steve Jurvetson  John Sculley  Sean Wisely  William Gibson  and Walter Isaacson  Free software pioneer Richard Stallman dissented from the prevailing hagiographic views of Jobs to draw attention to the tight corporate control Apple exercised over consumer computers and handheld devices  how Apple restricted news reporters  and persistently violated privacy   Steve Jobs  the pioneer of the computer as a jail made cool  designed to sever fools from their freedom  has died   211  212 Malcolm Gladwell in The New Yorker asserted that  Jobs s sensibility was editorial  not inventive  His gift lay in taking what was in front of him     and ruthlessly refining it   213  Although reporters wrote glowing elegies after Jobs died  Los Angeles Times media critic James Rainey reported that they  came courtesy of reporters who after deadline and off the record would tell stories about a company obsessed with secrecy to the point of paranoia  They remind us how Apple shut down a youthful fanboy blogger  punished a publisher that dared to print an unauthorized Jobs biography and repeatedly ran afoul of the most basic tenets of a free press   214  Apple  has taken stances that  in my opinion  are outright hostile to the practice of journalism   said longtime Silicon Valley reporter Dan Gillmor  214  Under Jobs  Apple sued three  small fry  bloggers who reported tips about the company and its unreleased products and tried to use the courts to force them to reveal their sources  Under Jobs  Apple even sued a teenager  Nicholas Ciarelli  who wrote enthusiastic speculation about Apple products beginning at age 13  His popular blog  ThinkSecret  was a play on Apple s slogan  Think Different    214  Rainey wrote that Apple wanted to kill ThinkSecret as  It thought any leaks  even favorable ones  diluted the punch of its highly choreographed product launches with Jobs  in his iconic jeans and mock turtleneck outfit  as the star    214  Honors and public recognition Jobs presenting iPhone OS  now iOS  2 at WWDC 2008  After Apple s founding  Jobs

215  216  Jobs was awarded the National Medal of Technology by President Ronald Reagan in 1985  with Steve Wozniak  among the first people to ever receive the honor   217  and a Jefferson Award for Public Service in the category  Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under   also known as the Samuel S  Beard Award  in 1987  218  On November 27  2007  Jobs was named the most

Jobs was ranked No 17 on Forbes  The World s Most Powerful People  224  In December 2010  the Financial Times named Jobs its person of the year for 2010  ending its essay  225  by stating   In his autobiography  John Sculley  the former PepsiCo executive who once ran Apple  said this of the ambitions of the man he had pushed out   Apple was supposed to become a wonderful consumer products company  This was a lunatic plan  High tech could not be designed and sold as a consumer product     226  The Financial Times closed by rhetorically asking of this quote   How wrong can you be   225  At the time of his resignation  and again after his death  Jobs was widely described as a visionary  pioneer and genius 227  228  229  230  perhaps one of the foremost in the field of business  223  231  innovation  232  and product design  233  and a man who had profoundly changed the face of the modern world  227  229  232  revolutionized at least six different industries  228  and who was an  exemplar for all chief executives   228  His death was widely mourned 234  and considered a loss to the world by commentators across the globe  230  After his resignation as Apple s CEO  Jobs was characterized as the Thomas Edison and Henry Ford of his time  235  236  In his The Daily Show eulogy  Jon Stewart said that unlike others of Jobs s ilk  such as Thomas Edison or Henry Ford  Jobs died young  He felt that we had  in a sense   wrung everything out of  these other men  but his feeling on Jobs was that  we re not done with you yet   237  Statue of Jobs at Graphisoft Park  Budapest 238

Reality distortion field Apple s Bud Tribble coined the term  reality distortion field  in 1981  to describe Jobs  charisma and its effects on the developers working on the Macintosh project  240  Tribble claimed that the term came from Star Trek  240  Since then the term has also been used to refer to perceptions of Jobs  keynote speeches  241  The RDF was said by Andy Hertzfeld to be Steve Jobs  ability to convince himself and others to believe almost anything  using a mix of charm  charisma  bravado  hyperbole  marketing  appeasement  and persistence  Although the subject of criticism  Jobs  so called reality distortion field was also recognized as creating a sense that the impossible was possible  Once the term became widely known  it was often used in the technology press to describe Jobs  sway over the public  particuarly regarding new product announcements  242  243  Portrayals and coverage in books  film  and theater Books The Little Kingdom  1984  by Michael Moritz
