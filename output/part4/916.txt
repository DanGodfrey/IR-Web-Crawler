southernmost continent  containing the geographic South Pole  It is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere  almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle  and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean  At 14 0 million km2  5 4 million sq mi   it is the fifth largest continent in area after Asia  Africa  North America  and South America  For comparison  Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia  About 98  of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages at least 1 mile  1 6 km  in thickness  Antarctica  on average  is the coldest  driest  and windiest continent  and has the highest average elevation of all the continents  6  Antarctica is considered a desert  with annual precipitation of only 200 mm  8 inches  along the coast and far less inland  7  The temperature in Antarctica has reached  89  C   129  F   There are no permanent human residents  but anywhere from 1 000 to 5 000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent  Only cold adapted organisms survive there  including many types of algae  animals  for example mites  nematodes  penguins  seals and tardigrades   bacteria  fungi  plants  and protista  Vegetation where it occurs is tundra  Although myths and speculation about a Terra Australis   Southern Land   date back to antiquity  the first confirmed sighting of the continent is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny  The continent  however  remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment  lack of resources  and isolation  The Antarctic Treaty was signed in 1959 by 12 countries  to date  49 countries have signed the treaty  The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining  prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal  supports scientific research  and protects the continent s ecozone  Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4 000 scientists from many nations  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History of exploration 3 Geography 4 Geology 4 1 Geological history and paleontology 4 1 1 Paleozoic

Antarctica is the romanized version of the Greek compound word             antarktik    feminine of              antarktikos   9  meaning  opposite to the Arctic    opposite to the north   10  History of exploration Main article  History of Antarctica See also  List of Antarctic expeditions An iceberg dwarfs a ship in this 1920s English magazine illustration of a whaler in the Antarctic  Belief in the existence of a Terra Australis   a vast continent in the far south of the globe to  balance  the northern lands of Europe  Asia and North Africa   has existed since the times of Ptolemy  1st century AD   who suggested the idea to preserve the symmetry of all known landmasses in the world  Even in the late 17th century  after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not part of the fabled  Antarctica   geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size  European maps continued to show this hypothetical land until Captain James Cook s ships  HMS Resolution and Adventure  crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773  in December 1773 and again in January 1774  11  Cook came within about 75 miles  121 km  of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773  12  The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by three individuals  According to various organizations  the National Science Foundation  13 NASA  14  the University of California  San Diego  15  and other sources   16  17  ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica in 1820  Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen  an Estonian born captain in the Imperial Russian Navy   Edward Bransfield  an Irish born captain in the Royal Navy   and Nathaniel Palmer  an American sealer out of Stonington  Connecticut   Von Bellingshausen saw Antarctica on 27 January 1820  three days before Bransfield sighted land  and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820  On that day the expedition led by Von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on ships Vostok and Mirny reached a point within 32 km  20 mi  of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice fields there  The first documented landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis in West Antarctica on 7 February 1821  although some historians dispute this claim citation needed   On 22 January 1840  two days after the discovery of the coast west of the Balleny Islands  some members of the crew of the 1837 40 expedition of Jules Dumont d Urville disembarked on the highest islet 18   of a group of rocky islands about 4 km from Cape Geodesie on the coast of Ad lie land where they took some mineral  algae and animal samples  19  In December 1839  as part of the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838 42 conducted by the United States Navy  sometimes called the  Ex  Ex    or  the Wilkes Expedition    an expedition sailed from Sydney  Australia  into the Antarctic Ocean  as it was then known  and reported the discovery  of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands  on 25 January 1840  That part of Antarctica was later named  Wilkes Land   a name it maintains to this day  Nimrod Expedition South Pole Party  left to right   Wild  Shackleton  Marshall and Adams Explorer James Clark Ross passed through what is now known as the Ross Sea and discovered Ross Island  both of which were named for him  in 1841  He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the Ross Ice Shelf  Mount Erebus and Mount Terror are named after two ships from his expedition  HMS Erebus and Terror  20 Mercator Cooper landed in East Antarctica on 26 January 1853  21  During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907  parties led by Edgeworth David became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole  Douglas Mawson  who assumed the leadership of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return  went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931  22  In addition  Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908   February 1909  they were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf  the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountain Range  via the Beardmore Glacier   and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau  An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram became the first to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911  using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel Heiberg Glacier  23  One month later  the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole  Richard E  Byrd led several voyages to the Antarctic by plane in the 1930s and 1940s  He is credited with implementing mechanized land transport on the continent and conducting extensive geological and biological research  24  However  it was not until 31 October 1956 that anyone set foot on the South Pole again  on that day a U S  Navy group led by Rear Admiral George J  Dufek successfully landed an aircraft there  25  The first person to sail single handed to Antarctica was the New Zealander David Henry Lewis  in a 10 meter steel sloop Ice Bird  Geography Main article  Geography of Antarctica See also  Extreme points of Antarctica and List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands Labelled map of Antarctica  Centered asymmetrically around the South Pole and largely south of the Antarctic Circle  Antarctica is the southernmost continent and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean  alternatively  it may be considered to be surrounded by the southern Pacific  Atlantic  and Indian Oceans  or by the southern waters of the World Ocean  It covers more than 14 000 000 km2  5 400 000 sq mi   1  making it the fifth largest continent  about 1 3 times as large as Europe  The coastline measures 17 968 km  11 165 mi  1  and is mostly characterized by ice formations  as the following table shows  Coastal types around Antarctica 26  Type Frequency Ice shelf  floating ice front  44  Ice walls  resting on ground  38  Ice stream outlet glacier  ice front or ice wall  13  Rock 5  Total 100  Antarctica is divided in two by the Transantarctic Mountains close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea  The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West Antarctica and the remainder East Antarctica  because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the Greenwich meridian  Elevation colored by relief height About 98  of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet  a sheet of ice averaging at least 1 6 km  1 0 mi  thick  The continent has about 90  of the world s ice  and thereby about 70  of the world s fresh water   If all of this ice were melted  sea levels would rise about 60 m  200 ft   27  In most of the interior of the continent  precipitation is very low  down to 20 mm  0 8 in  per year  in a few  blue ice  areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by sublimation and so the local mass balance is negative  In the dry valleys the same effect occurs over a rock base  leading to a desiccated landscape  West Antarctica is covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  The sheet has been of recent concern because of the real  if small  possibility of its collapse  If the sheet were to break down  ocean levels would rise by several metres in a relatively geologically short period of time  perhaps a matter of centuries  Several Antarctic ice streams  which account for about 10  of the ice sheet  flow to one of the many Antarctic ice shelves  East Antarctica lies on the Indian Ocean side of the Transantarctic Mountains and comprises Coats Land  Queen Maud Land  Enderby Land  Mac  Robertson Land  Wilkes Land and Victoria Land  All but a small portion of this region lies within the Eastern Hemisphere  East Antarctica is largely covered by the East Antarctic Ice Sheet  Mount Erebus  an active volcano on Ross Island Vinson Massif  the highest peak in Antarctica at 4 892 m  16 050 ft   is located in the Ellsworth Mountains  Antarctica contains many other mountains  both on the main continent and the surrounding islands  Located on Ross Island  Mount Erebus is the world s southernmost active volcano  Another well known volcano is found on Deception Island  which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970  Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years  Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active  28  In 2004  an underwater volcano was found in the Antarctic Peninsula by American and Canadian researchers  Recent evidence shows this unnamed volcano may be active  29  Antarctica is home to more than 70 lakes that lie at the base of the continental ice sheet  Lake Vostok  discovered beneath Russia s Vostok Station in 1996  is the largest of these subglacial lakes  It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500 000 to one million years but a recent survey suggests that  every so often  there are large flows of water from one lake to another  30  There is some evidence  in the form of ice cores drilled to about 400 m  1 300 ft  above the water line  that Lake Vostok s waters may contain microbial life  The frozen surface of the lake shares similarities with Jupiter s moon Europa  If life is discovered in Lake Vostok  this would strengthen the argument for the possibility of life on Europa  31  On 7 February 2008  a NASA team embarked on a mission to Lake Untersee  searching for extremophiles in its highly alkaline waters  If found  these resilient creatures could further bolster the argument for extraterrestrial life in extremely cold  methane rich environments  32  Geology Main article  Geology of Antarctica Subglacial topography and bathymetry of bedrock underlying Antarctica ice sheet Geological history and paleontology More than 170 million years ago  Antarctica was part of the supercontinent Gondwana  Over time  Gondwana gradually broke apart and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25 million years ago  Antarctica was not always cold  dry and covered in ice sheets  At a number of points in its long history it was farther north  experienced a tropical or temperate climate  was covered in forests  and inhabited by various ancient life forms  Paleozoic era  540 250 Ma  During the Cambrian period  Gondwana had a mild climate  West Antarctica was partially in the Northern Hemisphere  and during this period large amounts of sandstones  limestones and shales were deposited  East Antarctica was at the equator  where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites flourished in the tropical seas  By the start of the Devonian period  416 Ma   Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler  though fossils of land plants are known from this time  Sand and silts were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth  Horlick and Pensacola Mountains  Glaciation began at the end of the Devonian period  360 Ma   as Gondwana became centered around the South Pole and the climate cooled  though flora remained  During the Permian period  the plant life became dominated by fern like plants such as Glossopteris  which grew in swamps  Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the Transantarctic Mountains  Towards the end of the Permian period  continued warming led to a dry  hot climate over much of Gondwana  33  Mesozoic era  250 65 Ma  As a result of continued warming  the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert  In Eastern Antarctica  the seed fern became established  and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time  Synapsids  commonly known as  mammal like reptiles   were common in Antarctica during the Late Permian and Early Triassic and included forms such as Lystrosaurus  The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the Jurassic period  206 146 Ma   and islands gradually rose out of the ocean  Ginkgo trees and cycads were plentiful during this period  In West Antarctica  coniferous forests dominated through the entire Cretaceous period  146 65 Ma   though Southern beech began to take over at the end of this period  Ammonites were common in the seas around Antarctica  and dinosaurs were also present  though only three Antarctic dinosaur genera  Cryolophosaurus and Glacialisaurus  from the Hanson Formation  34  and Antarctopelta  have been described to date  35  It was during this period that Gondwana began to break up  Gondwanaland breakup  160 23 Ma  The cooling of Antarctica occurred stepwise  as the continental spread changed the oceanic currents from longitudinal equator to pole temperature equalizing currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences  Africa separated from Antarctica around 160 Ma  followed by the Indian subcontinent  in the early Cretaceous  about 125 Ma   About 65 Ma  Antarctica  then connected to Australia  still had a tropical to subtropical climate  complete with a marsupial fauna  About 40 Ma Australia New Guinea separated from Antarctica  so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia  and the first ice began to appear  During the Eocene Oligocene extinction event about 34 million years ago  CO2 levels have been found to be about 760 ppm 36  and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm  Around 23 Ma  the Drake Passage opened between Antarctica and South America  resulting in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that completely isolated the continent  Models of the changes suggest that declining CO2 levels became more important  37  The ice began to spread  replacing the forests that then covered the continent  Since about 15 Ma  the continent has been mostly covered with ice  38  with the Antarctic ice cap reaching its present extension around 6 Ma  Neogene Period  23 0 05 mya  In 1986  Peter Webb and a team of paleontologists at Ohio State University discovered the remains of an extensive temperate forest that flourished 640 kilometres  400 mi  from the South Pole 3 million years ago  39  40  41  Geology of present day Antarctica The geological study of Antarctica has been greatly hindered by the fact that nearly all of the continent is permanently covered with a thick layer of ice  However  new techniques such as remote sensing  ground penetrating radar and satellite imagery have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice  Geologically  West Antarctica closely resembles the Andes mountain range of South America  33  The Antarctic Peninsula was formed by uplift and metamorphism of sea bed sediments during the late Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic eras  This sediment uplift was accompanied by igneous intrusions and volcanism  The most common rocks in West Antarctica are andesite and rhyolite volcanics formed during the Jurassic period  There is also evidence of volcanic activity  even after the ice sheet had formed  in Marie Byrd Land and Alexander Island  The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the Ellsworth Mountains region  where the stratigraphy is more similar to the eastern part of the continent  East Antarctica is geologically varied  dating from the Precambrian era  with some rocks formed more than 3 billion years ago  It is composed of a metamorphic and igneous platform which is the basis of the continental shield  On top of this base are various modern rocks  such as sandstones  limestones  coal and shales laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the Transantarctic Mountains  In coastal areas such as Shackleton Range and Victoria Land some faulting has occurred  The main mineral resource known on the continent is coal  38  It was first recorded near the Beardmore Glacier by Frank Wild on the Nimrod Expedition  and now low grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains  The Prince Charles Mountains contain significant deposits of iron ore  The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore  namely the oil and natural gas fields found in the Ross Sea in 1973  Exploitation of all mineral resources is banned until 2048 by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty  Climate Main article  Climate of Antarctica The blue ice covering Lake Fryxell  in the Transantarctic Mountains  comes from glacial meltwater from the Canada Glacier and other smaller glaciers  Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth  The coldest natural temperature ever recorded on Earth was  89 2  C   128 6  F  at the Russian Vostok Station in Antarctica on 21 July 1983  42  For comparison  this is 11  C  20  F  colder than subliming dry ice  Antarctica is a frozen desert with little precipitation  the South Pole itself receives less than 10 cm  4 in  per year  on average  Temperatures reach a minimum of between  80  C   112  F  and  90  C   130  F  in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between 5  C  41  F  and 15  C  59  F  near the coast in summer  Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it  43  East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation  Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent  leaving the center cold and dry  Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent  ice there lasts for extended time periods  Heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent  where snowfalls of up to 1 22 metres  48 in  in 48 hours have been recorded  At the edge of the continent  strong katabatic winds off the polar plateau often blow at storm force  In the interior  however  wind speeds are typically moderate  During summer  more solar radiation reaches the surface during clear days at the South Pole than at the equator because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole  1  The snow surface at Dome C Station is typical of most of the continent s surface  Antarctica is colder than the Arctic for two reasons  First  much of the continent is more than 3 kilometres  2 mi  above sea level  and temperature decreases with elevation  Second  the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone  the ocean s relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica  Given the latitude  long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world  43  The aurora australis  commonly known as the southern lights  is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma full solar winds that pass by the Earth  Another unique spectacle is diamond dust  a ground level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals  It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies  so people sometimes also refer to it as clear sky precipitation  A sun dog  a frequent atmospheric optical phenomenon  is a bright  spot  beside the true sun  43  Population See also  Demographics of Antarctica and Research stations of Antarctica The  ceremonial  South Pole  at Amundsen Scott Station Antarctica has no permanent residents  but a number of governments maintain permanent manned research stations throughout the continent  The number of people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1 000 in winter to about 5 000 in the summer  Many of the stations are staffed year round  the winter over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one year assignment  An Orthodox church  Trinity Church  opened in 2004 at the Russian Bellingshausen Station is also manned year round by one or two priests  who are similarly rotated every year  44  45  The first semi permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica  areas situated south of the Antarctic Convergence  were British and American sealers who used to spend a year or more on South Georgia  from 1786 onward  During the whaling era  which lasted until 1966  the population of that island varied from over 1 000 in the summer  over 2 000 in some years  to some 200 in the winter  Most of the whalers were Norwegian  with an increasing proportion of Britons  The settlements included Grytviken  Leith Harbour  King Edward Point  Stromness  Husvik  Prince Olav Harbour  Ocean Harbour and Godthul  Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families  Among them was the founder of Grytviken  Captain Carl Anton Larsen  a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who  along with his family  adopted British citizenship in 1910  The first child born in the southern polar region was Norwegian girl Solveig Gunbj rg Jacobsen  born in Grytviken on 8 October 1913  and her birth was registered by the resident British Magistrate of South Georgia  She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen  the assistant manager of the whaling station  and of Klara Olette Jacobsen  Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 and became the manager of Grytviken  serving from 1914 to 1921  two of his children were born on the island  46  Emilio Marcos Palma was the first person born south of the 60th parallel south  the continental limit according to the Antarctic Treaty   47  as well as the first one born on the Antarctic mainland  in 1978 at Base Esperanza  on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula  48  49  his parents were sent there along with seven other families by the Argentine government to determine if family life was suitable on the continent  In 1984  Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Frei Montalva Station  becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica  Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station  50  As of 2009  eleven children were born in Antarctica  south of the 60th parallel south   eight at the Argentinean Esperanza Base 51  and three at the Chilean Frei Montalva Station  52  Biodiversity See also  Antarctic ecozone and Antarctica Microorganisms Emperor Penguins in Ross Sea  Antarctica Few terrestrial vertebrates live in Antarctica  53  Invertebrate life includes microscopic mites like the Alaskozetes antarcticus  lice  nematodes  tardigrades  rotifers  krill and springtails  The flightless midge Belgica antarctica  up to 6 millimetres  0 2 in  in size  is the largest purely terrestrial animal in Antarctica  54  The Snow Petrel is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica  55  A variety of marine animals exist and rely  directly or indirectly  on the phytoplankton  Antarctic sea life includes penguins  blue whales  orcas  colossal squids and fur seals  The Emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica  while the Ad lie Penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin  The Rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes  giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes  King penguins  Chinstrap penguins  and Gentoo Penguins also breed in the Antarctic  The Antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom  The Weddell Seal  a  true seal   is named after Sir James Weddell  commander of British sealing expeditions in the Weddell Sea  Antarctic krill  which congregates in large schools  is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean  and is an important food organism for whales  seals  leopard seals  fur seals  squid  icefish  penguins  albatrosses and many other birds  56  A census of sea life carried out during the International Polar Year and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010  The research is part of the global Census of Marine Life  CoML  and has disclosed some remarkable findings  More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions  having bridged the gap of 12 000 km  7 456 mi   Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually  More surprising are small forms of life such as mudworms  sea cucumbers and free swimming snails found in both polar oceans  Various factors may aid in their distribution   fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5  C  and the major current systems or marine conveyor belt which transport egg and larvae stages  57  About 400 species of lichen forming fungi are known to exist in Antarctica  The climate of Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation  A combination of freezing temperatures  poor soil quality  lack of moisture  and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth  As a result  the diversity of plant life is very small and limited in distribution  Excluding organisms which are not plants  algae and fungi  including lichen forming species   the flora of the continent largely consists of bryophytes  there are about 100 species of mosses and 25 species of liverworts   with only two species of flowering plants  both found in the Antarctic Peninsula  Deschampsia antarctica  Antarctic hair grass  and Colobanthus quitensis  Antarctic pearlwort   Growth generally occurs in the summer  and only for a few weeks at most  58  59  About 1150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica  of which about 750 are non lichen forming and 400 are lichen forming  60  59  Some of these species are cryptoendoliths as a result of evolution under extreme conditions  61  Seven hundred species of algae exist  most of which are phytoplankton  Multicolored snow algae and diatoms are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer  58  Recently ancient ecosystems consisting of several types of bacteria have been found living trapped deep beneath glaciers  62  The autotrophic community is made up of mostly protists  58  Conservation The dumping of waste  even old vehicles   such as here at the Russian Bellingshausen Station in 1992  is prohibited since the entry into force of the Protocol on Environmental Protection in 1998  The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty  also known as the Environmental Protocol or Madrid Protocol  came into force in 1998  and is the main instrument concerned with conservation and management of biodiversity in Antarctica  The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is advised on environmental and conservation issues in Antarctica by the Committee for Environmental Protection  A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non native species from outside the region  63  The passing of the Antarctic Conservation Act  1978  in the U S  brought several restrictions to U S  activity on Antarctica  The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty  as can the extraction of any indigenous species  The overfishing of krill  which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem  led officials to enact regulations on fishing  The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources  CCAMLR   a treaty that came into force in 1980  requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem  1  Despite these new acts  unregulated and illegal fishing  particularly of Patagonian toothfish  marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U S    remains a serious problem  The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing  with estimates of 32 000 tonnes  35 300 short tons  in 2000  64  65  Politics Emblem of the Antarctic Treaty since 2002  Antarctica has no government  although various countries claim sovereignty in certain regions  While a few of these countries have mutually recognised each other s claims  66  the validity of these claims is generally not recognised universally  1  New claims on Antarctica have been suspended since 1959 and the continent is considered politically neutral  Its status is regulated by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty and other related agreements  collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System  Antarctica is defined as all land and ice shelves south of 60  S for the purposes of the Treaty System  The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the Soviet Union  and later Russia   the United Kingdom  Argentina  Chile  Australia  and the United States  67  It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve  established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection  and banned military activity on the continent  This was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War  In 1983  the Antarctic Treaty Parties began negotiations on a convention to regulate mining in Antarctica  68  A coalition of international organisations 69  launched a public pressure campaign to prevent any minerals development in the region  led largely by Greenpeace International 70  which established its own scientific station World Park Base in the Ross Sea region 71  and conducted annual expeditions to document environmental effects of humans on the continent  72  In 1988  the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources  CRAMRA  was adopted  73  The following year  however  Australia and France announced that they would not ratify the convention  rendering it dead for all intents and purposes  They proposed instead that a comprehensive regime to protect the Antarctic environment be negotiated in its place  74  The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty  the  Madrid Protocol   was negotiated as other countries followed suit and on 14 January 1998 it entered into force  74  75  The Madrid Protocol bans all mining in Antarctica  designating the continent as a  natural reserve devoted to peace and science   HMS Endurance  the Royal Navy s Antarctic patrol ship The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any military activity in Antarctica  including the establishment of military bases and fortifications  military manoeuvers  and weapons testing  Military personnel or equipment are permitted only for scientific research or other peaceful purposes  76  The only documented military land manoeuvre was Operation NINETY by the Argentine military  77  The United States military issues the Antarctica Service Medal to military members or civilians who

 a sister species  Although coal  hydrocarbons  iron ore  platinum  copper  chromium  nickel  gold and other minerals have been found  they have not been in large enough quantities to exploit  The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts a struggle for resources  In 1998  a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining  to be reviewed in 2048  further limiting economic development and exploitation  The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish  Antarctic fisheries in 2000 01 reported landing 112 934 tonnes  Small scale  expedition tourism  has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol provisions  but in effect self regulated by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators  IAATO   Not all vessels associated with Antarctic tourism are members of IAATO  but IAATO members account for 95  of the tourist activity  Travel is largely by small or medium ship  focusing on specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife  A total of 37 506 tourists visited during the 2006 07 Austral summer with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships  The number is predicted to increase to over 80 000 by 2010  83  84  There has been some concern over the potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused by the influx of visitors  A call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota has been made by some environmentalists and scientists  85  The primary response by Antarctic Treaty Parties has been to develop  through their Committee for Environmental Protection and in partnership with IAATO   site use guidelines  setting landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites  Antarctic sight seeing flights  which did not land  operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979 on Mount Erebus  which killed all 257 aboard  Qantas resumed commercial overflights to Antarctica from Australia in the mid 1990s  Research See also  Research stations of Antarctica A full moon and 25 second exposure allowed sufficient light for this photo to be taken at Amundsen Scott South Pole Station during the long Antarctic night  The station can be seen at far left  the power plant in the center and the mechanic s garage in the lower right  The green light in the background is the Aurora Australis  Each year  scientists from 28 different nations conduct experiments not reproducible in any other place in the world  In the summer more than 4 000 scientists operate research stations  this number decreases to just over 1 000 in the winter  1 McMurdo Station  which is the largest research station in Antarctica  is capable of housing more than 1 000 scientists  visitors  and tourists  Researchers include biologists  geologists  oceanographers  physicists  astronomers  glaciologists  and meteorologists  Geologists tend to study plate tectonics  meteorites from outer space  and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwanaland  Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating ice  seasonal snow  glaciers  and ice sheets  Biologists  in addition to examining the wildlife  are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms  Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body s response to extreme seasonal temperatures  Astrophysicists at Amundsen Scott South Pole Station study the celestial dome and cosmic microwave background radiation  Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation  which results in a thin atmosphere  low temperature  which minimizes the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere  and absence of light pollution  thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth  Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest neutrino telescope in the world  built 2 km  1 2 mi  below Amundsen Scott station  86  Since the 1970s  an important focus of study has been the ozone layer in the atmosphere above Antarctica  In 1985  three British Scientists working on data they had gathered at Halley Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf discovered the existence of a hole in this layer  It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by chlorofluorocarbons emitted by human products  With the ban of CFCs in the Montreal Protocol of 1989  it is believed that the ozone hole will close up by around 2065  87  In September 2006  NASA satellite data showed that the Antarctic ozone hole was the largest on record  covering 27 5 million km2  10 6 million sq mi   87  On 6 September 2007  Belgian based International Polar Foundation unveiled the Princess Elisabeth station  the world s first zero emissions polar science station in Antarctica to research climate change  Costing  16 3 million  the prefabricated station  which is part of International Polar Year  was shipped to the South Pole from Belgium by the end of 2008 to monitor the health of the polar regions  Belgian polar explorer Alain Hubert stated   This base will be the first of its kind to produce zero emissions  making it a unique model of how energy should be used in the Antarctic   Johan Berte is the leader of the station design team and manager of the project which conducts research in climatology  glaciology and microbiology  88  In January 2008  the British Antarctic Survey  BAS  scientists  led by Hugh Corr and David Vaughan  reported  in the journal Nature Geoscience  that 2 200 years ago  a volcano erupted under Antarctica s ice sheet  based on airborne survey with radar images   The biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10 000 years  the volcanic ash was found deposited on the ice surface under the Hudson Mountains  close to Pine Island Glacier  89  Meteorites Antarctic meteorite  named ALH84001  from Mars Meteorites from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the solar system  most are thought to come from asteroids  but some may have originated on larger planets  The first meteorites were found in 1912  In 1969  a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites  Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years  Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges  with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall  Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth  the Antarctic meteorites are well preserved  90  This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets  New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found  Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon  and probably Mars  by impacts  These specimens  particularly ALH84001 discovered by ANSMET  are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars  Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation  the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies  The elapsed time since fall  or terrestrial residence age  of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets  90  In 2006  a team of researchers from Ohio State University used gravity measurements by NASA s GRACE satellites to discover the 300 mile  480 km  wide Wilkes Land crater  which probably formed about 250 million years ago  91  Ice mass and global sea level See also  Current sea level rise The motion of ice in Antarctica Due to its location at the South Pole  Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation  This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice  Precipitation is low  most of Antarctica is a desert  and almost always in the form of snow  which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land  Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams  which flow towards the edges of the continent  Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves  These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass  Offshore  temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year  It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global warming  Sea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer  This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level  The extent of sea ice around Antarctica has remained roughly constant in recent decades  although the thickness changes are unclear  92  93  Melting of floating ice shelves  ice that originated on the land  does not in itself contribute much to sea level rise  since the ice displaces only its own mass of water   However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level  This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent  Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica  especially along the Antarctic Peninsula  Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass  94  On the continent itself  the large volume of ice present stores around 70  of the world s fresh water  27  This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea  West Antarctica is currently experiencing a net outflow of glacial ice  which will increase global sea level over time  A review of the scientific studies looking at data from 1992 to 2006 suggested that a net loss of around 50 gigatonnes of ice per year was a reasonable estimate  around 0 14 mm of sea level rise   95  Significant acceleration of outflow glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment may have more than doubled this figure for 2006  96  East Antarctica is a cold region with a ground base above sea level and occupies most of the continent  This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows  The mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet as a whole is thought to be slightly positive  lowering sea level  or near to balance  95  96  However  increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions  96  97  Effects of global warming Warming trend from 1957 2006 Some of Antarctica has been warming up  particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula  A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at  gt 0 05  C  0 09  F  per decade from 1957 to 2006  This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0 1  C  0 2  F  per decade in the last 50 years  and this warming is strongest in winter and spring  This is partly offset by fall cooling in East Antarctica  98  There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions  99  However  the small amount of surface warming in West Antarctica is not believed to be directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet s contribution to sea level  Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean  just off the continental shelf  100  101  The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there  102  In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula s Larsen B ice shelf collapsed  103  Between 28 February and 8 March 2008  about 570 square kilometres  220 sq mi  of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed  putting the remaining 15 000 km2  5 800 sq mi  of the ice shelf at risk  The ice was being held back by a  thread  of ice about 6 km  4 mi  wide  104  105  prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009  106  107  According to NASA  the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005  when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze  this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5  C  41  F   108  Ozone depletion Image of the largest Antarctic ozone hole ever recorded due to CFCs accumulation  September 2006  Main article  Ozone depletion Each year a large area of low ozone concentration or  ozone hole  grows over Antarctica  This hole covers the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008  when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December  109  The hole was detected by scientists in 1985 110  and has tended to increase over the years of observation  The ozone hole is attributed to the emission of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs into the atmosphere  which decompose the ozone into other gases  111  Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica  and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere   110  Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere  Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6  C in the local stratosphere  This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent  the polar vortex  and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole  As a result  the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures  and the peripheral areas of Antarctica  especially the Antarctic Peninsula  are subject to higher temperatures  which promote accelerated melting  110  Models also suggest that the ozone depletion enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent  112  See also Antarctica portal Arctic portal Geography portal
