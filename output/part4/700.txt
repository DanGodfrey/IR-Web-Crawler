part of two Spanish and Mexican era colonial land grants  the 36 400 acre  147 km2  Rancho San Rafael  granted to Jose Maria Verdugo by the Spanish Bourbon government in 1784  and the 4 063 acre  16 44 km2  Rancho Providencia created in 1821  Historically  this area was the scene of a military skirmish which resulted in the unseating of the Spanish Governor of California  and his replacement by the Mexican leader Pio Pico  Remnants of the military battle reportedly were found many years later in the vicinity of Warner Brothers Studio when residents dug up cannon balls  4  Dr  David Burbank purchased over 4 600 acres  19 km2  of the former Verdugo holding and another 4 600 acres  19 km2  of the Rancho Providencia in 1867 and built a ranch house and began to raise sheep and grow wheat on the ranch  3  By 1876  the San Fernando Valley became the largest wheat raising area in Los Angeles County  But the droughts of the 1860s and 1870s underlined the need for steady water supplies  A professionally trained dentist  Dr  Burbank began his career in Waterville  Maine  He joined the great migration westward in the early 1850s and  by 1853 was living in San Francisco  At the time the American Civil War broke out he was again well established in his profession as a dentist in Pueblo de Los Angeles  In 1867  he purchased Rancho La Providencia from David W  Alexander and Francis Mellus  and he purchased the western portion of the Rancho San Rafael  4 603 acres  from Jonathan R  Scott  Dr  Burbank s property reached nearly 9 200 acres  37 km2  at a cost of  9 000  5  Dr  Burbank wouldn t acquire full titles to both properties until after a court decision known as the  Great Partition  was made in 1871 dissolving the Rancho San Rafael  He eventually became known as one of the largest and most successful sheep raisers in southern California  resulting in him stopping his practice of dentistry and investing heavily in real estate in Los Angeles  6  Dr  Burbank also later owned the Burbank Theatre  which opened on November 27  1893 at a cost of  150 000  Though the theater was intended to be an opera house  instead it staged plays and became known nationally  The theatre featured famous actors of the time including Fay Bainter and Marjorie Rambeau  until it had deteriorated into a burlesque house  7  When the area that became Burbank was settled in the 1870s and 1880s  the streets were aligned along what is now Olive Avenue  the road to the Cahuenga Pass and downtown Los Angeles  These were largely the roads the Indians traveled and the early settlers took their produce down to Los Angeles to sell and to buy supplies along these routes  At the time  the primary long distance transportation methods available to San Fernando Valley residents were stagecoach and train  Stagecoaching between Los Angeles and San Francisco through the Valley began in 1858  The Southern Pacific Railroad arrived in the Valley in 1876  completing the route connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles  8  A shrewd businessman  foreseeing the value of rail transport  Burbank sold Southern Pacific Railroad a right of way through the property for one dollar  The first train passed through Burbank on April 5  1874  A boom created by a rate war between the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific brought people streaming into California shortly thereafter  and a group of speculators purchased much of Dr  Burbank s land holdings in 1886 for  250 000  5  One account suggests Dr  Burbank may have sold his property because of a severe drought that year  which caused a shortage of water and grass for his livestock  Approximately 1 000 of his sheep died due to the drought conditions  6  Burbank as envisioned by Providencia Land  Water  amp  Development Co  The group of speculators who bought the acreage formed the Providencia Land  Water  and Development Company and began developing the land  calling the new town  Burbank  after its founder  and began offering farm lots on May 1  1887  The establishment of a water system in 1887 allowed farmers to irrigate their orchards and provided a stronger base for agricultural development  9  The original plot of the new townsite of Burbank extended from what is now Burbank Boulevard on the north  to Grandview Avenue in Glendale  California on the south  and from the top of the Verdugo Hills on the east to what is now known as Clyborn Avenue on the west  6  At the same time  the arrival of the railroad provided immediate access for the farmers to bring crops to market  Packing houses and warehouses were built along the railroad corridors  The railroads also provided access to the county for tourists and immigrants alike  A Southern Pacific Railroad depot in Burbank was completed in 1887  The boom lifting real estate values in the Los Angeles  California area proved to be a speculative frenzy that collapsed abruptly in 1889  Much of the newly created wealthy went broke  Many of the lots in Burbank ended up getting sold for taxes  6  Vast numbers of people would leave the region before it all ended  10  By 1904  Burbank received international attention for having world heavyweight boxing champion James J  Jeffries become a major landowner in the town  Jeffries bought 107 acres  0 43 km2  to build a ranch on Victory Boulevard  He eventually raised cattle and sold them in Mexico and South America  becoming one of the first citizens to engage in foreign trade  He eventually built a large ranch home and barn near where Victory and Buena Vista Street now intersect  The barn was later removed and reassembled at Knott s Berry Farm in Buena Park  California  6  Burbank s first telephone exchange  or telephone switch  was established in August 1900  becoming the first in the San Fernando Valley  Within 5 years  there were several telephone exchanges in the Valley and became known as the San Fernando Valley Home Telephone Company  based in Glendale  11  Home Telephone competed with Tropico  and in 1918 both were taken over by Pacific Telephone Company  At this time  there were an estimated 300 hand cranked telephones in Burbank  The town s first bank was formed in 1908 when Burbank State Bank opened its doors near the corner of Olive Avenue and San Fernando Road  On the first day  the bank collected  30 000 worth of deposits  In 1911  the bank was dissolved  12  In 1911  wealthy farmer Joseph Fawkes grew apricots and owned a house on West Olive Avenue  But he also had a fascination for machinery  and soon began developing what became known as the  Fawkes Folly  aerial trolley  13  He and his wife Ellen C  Fawkes secured two patents for the nation s first monorail  The two formed the Aerial Trolley Car Company and set about building a prototype they believed would revolutionize transportation  14  Joseph Fawkes called the trolley his Aerial Swallow  a cigar shaped  suspended monorail driven by a propeller that he promised would carry passengers from Burbank to downtown Los Angeles in 10 minutes  The first open car accommodated about 20 passengers and was suspended from an overhead track and supported by wooden beams  In 1911  the monorail car made its first and only run through his Burbank ranch  with a line between Lake and Flower Streets  The monorail was considered a failure after gliding just a foot or so and falling to pieces  Nobody was injured but Joseph Fawkes pride was badly hurt as Aerial Swallow became known as  Fawkes  Folly   City officials viewed his test run as a failure and focused on getting a Pacific Electric Streetcar line into Burbank  Laid out and surveyed with a modern business district surrounded by residential lots  wide boulevards were carved out as the  Los Angeles Express  printed   Burbank  the town  being built in the midst of the new farming community  has been laid out in such a manner as to make it by and by an unusually pretty town  The streets and avenues are wide and  all have been handsomely graded  All improvements being made would do credit to a city     Everything done at Burbank has been done right   Burbank  1922 The citizens of Burbank had to put up a  48 000 subsidy to get the reluctant Pacific Electric Streetcar officials to agree to extend the line from Glendale to Burbank  9  The first Red Car rolled into Burbank on Sept  6  1911  with a tremendous celebration  That was about two months after the town became a city  The  Burbank Review  newspaper ran a special edition that day 14  advising all local residents that   On Wednesday  the first electric car running on a regular passenger carrying schedule left the Pacific Electric station at Sixth and Main streets  Los Angeles  for Burbank at 6 30 a m  and the first car from Burbank to Los Angeles left at 6 20 a m  the same day  Upon arrival of this car on its maiden trip  many citizens gave evidence of their great joy by ringing bells and discharging firearms  A big crowd of both men and women boarded the first car and rode to Glendale and there changed to a second car coming from Los Angeles and rode home again  Every face was an expression of happiness and satisfaction   The Burbank Line was completed through to Cypress Avenue in Burbank  and by mid 1925 this line was extended about a mile further along Glenoaks Boulevard to Eton Drive  A small wooden station was erected in Burbank in 1911 at Orange Grove Avenue with a small storage yard in its rear  This depot was destroyed by fire in 1942 and in 1947 a small passenger shelter was constructed  On May 26  1942  the California State Railroad Commission proposed an extension of the Burbank Line to the Lockheed plant  15  The proposal called for a double track line from Arden Junction along Glenoaks to San Fernando Road and Empire Way  just northeast of Lockheed s main facility  But this extension never materialized and the commission moved on to other projects in the San Fernando Valley  The Red Car line in Burbank was abandoned and the tracks removed in 1956  At the time of cityhood  Burbank had a voluntary fire department  Fire protection depended upon the bucket brigade and finding a hydrant  It wasn t until 1913 that the city created its own fire department  By 1916  the city was installing an additional 40 new fire hydrants but still relying on volunteers for fire fighting  In 1927  the city switched from a volunteer fire department to a professional one  The city marshal s office was changed to the Burbank Police Department in 1923  The first police chief was George Cole  who later became a U S  Treasury prohibition officer  In 1928  Burbank was one of the first 13 cities to join the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California  one of the largest suppliers of water in the world  By 1937  the first power from Hoover Dam was distributed over Burbank s own electricity lines  16  The city purchases about 55  of its water from the MWD  17   edit  The City of Burbank The town grew steadily  weathering the drought and depression that hit Los Angeles in the 1890s and in 20 years  the community had a bank  newspaper  high school and a thriving business district with a hardware store  livery stable  dry goods store  general store  and bicycle repair shop  The city s first newspaper  Burbank Review  established in 1906  First city seal of Burbank  California The populace petitioned the State Legislature to incorporate as a city on July 8  1911  with businessman Thomas Story as the mayor  Voters approved incorporation by a vote of 81 to 51  At the time  the Board of Trustees governed the community which numbered 500 residents  The first city seal adopted by Burbank featured a cantaloupe  which was a crop that helped save the town s life when the land boom collapsed  14  In 1931  the original city seal was replaced and in 1978 the modern seal was adopted  The new seal shows City Hall beneath a banner but no cantaloupe  An airplane symbolizes the city s aircraft industry  the strip of film and stage light represent motion picture production  The bottom portion depicts the sun rising over the Verdugo Mountains  In 1915  major sections of the Valley capitulated  helping Los Angeles to more than double its size that year  But Burbank was among a handful of towns with their own water wells and remained independent  By 1916 Burbank had 1 500 residents  In 1927  five miles  8 km  of paved streets had increased to 125 miles  201 km   By 1930  as First National Studios  Andrew Jergens Company  The Lockheed Company  McNeill and Libby Canning Company  the Moreland Company  and Northrop Aircraft Corporation opened facilities there  the population jumped to 16 662  The Wall Street Crash of 1929 set off a period of hardship for Burbank where business and residential growth paused  The effects of the Depression also caused tight credit conditions and halted home building throughout the area  including the city s Magnolia Park development  Around this time  major employers began to cut payrolls and some plants closed their doors forever  18  Around this time  Burbank City Council responded by slashing 10  from the wages of city workers  Money was put into an Employee Relief Department to help unemployed  Local civic and religious groups sprang into action and contributed with food as homeless camps began to form along the city s Southern Pacific railroad tracks  Hundreds began to participate in self help cooperatives  trading skills such as barbers  tailors  plumbers  or carpenters for food and other services  19  Following a Valley land bust during the Depression  real estate began to bounce back in the mid 1930s  In Burbank  a 100 home construction project began in 1934  By 1936  property values in the city exceeded pre Depression levels  By 1950  the population had reached 78 577  20  It was no longer the  tiny little village  of Jane Russell s song  Hollywood Cinderella   it had become a major Los Angeles suburb  In 1922  the Burbank Chamber of Commerce was organized  The Federal government officially recognized Burbank s status in 1923 when the United States Postal Service reclassified the city from the rural village mail delivery to city postal delivery service  14  By this time  Burbank s population had grown significantly  from less than 500 people in 1908 to over 3 000 citizens  The city s business district grew on the west side of San Fernando Road and stretched from Verdugo to Cypress avenues  and on the east side to Palm Avenue  In the late 1970s  Burbank became part of the Verdugo Fire District under a joint communications agreement with nearby cities  including Glendale and Pasadena  Under contract  Burbank provides a Hazardous Materials team  Glendale provides an Air and Lighting unit as well as the dispatch center  and Pasadena provides a Heavy   Urban Search and Rescue team  The three city fire departments are all dispatched from the Verdugo Communications Center  located in Glendale  Each of the three cities shares the cost of operating and maintaining this dispatch facility  As of June 2008  the city employee population in Burbank stood at 1 683  Of the total  1 253 were full time  217 part time  and 213 temporary employees  The Burbank City Employees Association represents workers in the city  The organization dates back to 1939  and its primary role was to secure civil service status for city workers  The BCEA  representing more than 750 city employees  is one of six bargaining unions in Burbank city government  Others include  the Burbank Fire Fighters Association  the Burbank Police Officers  Association  the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers Local 18  the Burbank Fire Fighters Chief Officer s Unit  and the Burbank Management Association   edit  Early manufacturing In 1887  the Burbank Furniture Manufacturing Company was the town s first factory  21  After the land boom downturn in 1888  the building was abandoned and transients slept in the empty factory  In 1917  the arrival of the Moreland Motor Truck Company changed the town and resulted in a manufacturing and industrial workforce begin to take root in the city  Within a few years Moreland trucks were seen bearing the label   Made in Burbank   22  Watt Moreland  its owner  had relocated his plant to Burbank from Los Angeles  He selected 25 acres  100 000 m2  at San Fernando Road and Alameda Avenue  Moreland invested  1 million in the factory and machinery  and employed 500 people  The Moreland Motor Truck Company in Burbank Within the next several decades  factories  both large and small  would dot the area landscape  What had mainly been an agricultural and ranching area would get replaced with a variety of manufacturing industries  Moreland operated from 1917 to 1937  Aerospace supplier Menasco Manufacturing Company would later purchase the property  Menasco s Burbank landing gear factory closed in 1994 due to slow commercial and military orders  affecting 310 people  Within months of Moreland s arrival  Community Manufacturing Company  a  3 million tractor company  arrived in Burbank  In 1920  the Andrew Jergens Company factory opened at Verdugo Avenue near the railroad tracks in Burbank  Andrew Jergens  Jr    aided by his father  Cincinnati businessman Andrew Jergens  Sr  and business partners Frank Adams and Morris Spazier   had purchased the site and built a single story building  They began with a single product  coconut oil soap  but would later make face creams  lotions  liquid soaps and deodorants  In 1931  despite the Depression  the Jergens company expanded  building new offices and shipping department facilities  In 1939  the Burbank corporation merged with the Cincinnati company of Andrew Jergens  Sr   becoming known as the Andrew Jergens Company of Ohio  The Burbank plant closed in 1992  affecting nearly 90 employees   edit  Aviation The establishment of the aircraft industry and a major airport in Burbank during the 1930s set the stage for major growth and development  which was to continue at an accelerated pace into World War II and well into the postwar era  Brothers Allan Loughead and Malcolm Loughead  founders of the Lockheed Aircraft Company  opened a Burbank manufacturing plant in 1928  and a year later famed aviation designer Jack Northrop built his historic Flying Wing airplane in his own plant nearby  Dedicated on Memorial Day Weekend  May 30  June 1   1930  the United Airport was the largest commercial airport in the Los Angeles area until it was eclipsed in 1946 by the Los Angeles Municipal Airport  now Los Angeles International Airport  in Westchester when that facility  the former Mines Field  commenced commercial operations  Amelia Earhart  Wiley Post and Howard Hughes were among the notable aviation pioneers to pilot aircraft in and out of the original Union Air Terminal  By 1935  Union Air Terminal in Burbank ranked as the third largest air terminal in the nation  with 46 airliners flying out of it daily  The airport served 9 895 passengers in 1931 and 98 485 passengers in 1936  Vega Aircraft plant in Burbank  1942 Lockheed Aircraft Corp  in Burbank  1945 In 1931  Lockheed was then part of Detroit Aircraft Corp   which went into bankruptcy with its Lockheed unit  A year later  a group of investors acquired assets of the Lockheed company  The new owners staked their limited funds to develop an all metal  twin engine transport  the Model 10 Electra  It first flew in 1934 and quickly gained world wide fame  A brochure celebrating Burbank s 50th anniversary as a city touted Lockheed payroll having  nearly 1 200  by the end of 1936  The aircraft company s hiring contributed to what was a favorable employment environment at the time  23  Moreland s truck plant was later used by the Lockheed s Vega Aircraft Corporation  which made what was widely known as  the explorer s aircraft   Amelia Earhart flew one across the Atlantic Ocean  In 1936  Lockheed officially took over Vega Aircraft in Burbank  During World War II  the entire area of Lockheed s Vega factory was camouflaged to fool an enemy reconnaissance effort  The factory was hidden beneath a complete suburb replete with rubber automobiles and peaceful rural neighborhood scenes painted on canvas  24  Hundreds of fake trees and shrubs were positioned to give the entire area a three dimensional appearance  The fake trees and shrubs were created from chicken wire that had been treated with an adhesive and then covered with chicken feathers to provide a leafy texture  Air ducts disguised as fire hydrants made it possible for the Lockheed Vega employees to continue working underneath the huge camouflage umbrella designed to conceal their factory  25  Burbank s airport has undergone several name changes since opening in 1930  It had five runways that radiated in varying directions  each 300 feet  91 m  wide and 2 600 feet  790 m  long  It remained United Airport until 1934  when it was renamed Union Air Terminal  1934 1940   Boeing built planes on the field  Lockheed Aircraft had its own nearby airfield  Lockheed bought the airport in 1940 and renamed it Lockheed Air Terminal  which it was known as until 1967  when it became Hollywood Burbank Airport  In 1978 it was renamed Burbank Glendale Pasadena Airport  1978 2003  after Lockheed sold it to the three California cities for  51 million  In December 2003  the facility was renamed Bob Hope Airport in honor of the comedian who lived in nearby Toluca Lake  In 2005  the city of Burbank and the Burbank Glendale Pasadena Airport Authority  which owns and operates the airport  reached a development agreement  The agreement forbids further airport expansion until 2009  Unlike most other regional airports in California  Burbank s airport sits on land that was specifically zoned for airport use  The growth of companies such as Lockheed  and the burgeoning entertainment industry drew more people to the area  and Burbank s population doubled between 1930 and 1940 to 34 337  Burbank saw its greatest growth during World War II due to Lockheed s presence  employing some 80 800 men and women producing aircraft such as the Hudson  P 38 Lightning  PV 1 Ventura and America s first jet fighter  the P 80 Shooting Star  Lockheed later created the U2  SR 71 Blackbird and the F 117 Nighthawk at its Burbank based  Skunk Works   Dozens of hamburger stands  restaurants and shops appeared around Lockheed to accommodate the employees  Some of the restaurants operated 24 hours a day  At one time  Lockheed paid utility rates representing 25  of the city s total utilities revenue  making Lockheed the city s cash cow  When Lockheed left  the economic loss was huge  At its height during World War II  the Lockheed facility employed up to 98 000 people  26  Burbank s growth did not slow as war production ceased  and over 7 000 new residents created a postwar real estate boom  Real estate values soared as housing tracts appeared in the Magnolia Park area of Burbank between 1945 and 1950  Following the World War II  homeless veterans lived in tent camps in Burbank  in Big Tujunga Canyon and at a decommissioned National Guard base in Griffith Park  The government also set up trailer camps at Hollywood Way and Winona Avenue in Burbank and in nearby Sun Valley  But new homes were built  the economy improved  and the military presence in Burbank continued to expand  Lockheed employees numbered 66 500 and expanded from aircraft to include spacecraft  missiles  electronics and shipbuilding  Lockheed s presence in Burbank attracted dozens of firms making aircraft parts  One of them was Weber Aircraft Corporation  an aircraft interior manufacturer situated adjacent to Lockheed at the edge of the airport  In 1988  Weber closed its Burbank manufacturing plant  which then employed 1 000 people  Weber produced seats  galleys  lavatories and other equipment for commercial and military aircraft  Weber had been in Burbank for 37 years  Front of Bob Hope Airport  2009 By the mid 1970s  Hollywood Burbank Airport handled 1 5 million passengers annually  Airlines serving Bob Hope Airport include Alaska Airlines  American Airlines  Delta Air Lines  JetBlue Airways  Southwest Airlines  and United Air Lines  As of August 2009 update   Southwest represents two thirds of the airport s operations  27  In 2005  JetBlue Airways began the first non stop coast to coast service out of the airport  Avjet Corporation  a private jet service  operates out of several hangars on the south side of the airport  Atlantic Aviation   formerly Mercury Air Center  also provides jet services for several prominent companies  In 1987  Burbank s airport became the first to require flight carriers to fly quieter  Stage 3  jets  By 2010  Burbank s Bob Hope Airport had 4 5 million passengers annually  The airport also was a major facility for FedEx and UPS  with 96 2 million pounds of cargo that year  28  In early 2012  American Airlines announced it would cease flights in and out of Burbank  The decision followed American s parent company filing for bankruptcy protection in November 2011  29  American ranks well behind Southwest Airlines in terms of passenger traffic from Bob Hope Airport  For October 2011  Southwest flew roughly 233 000 passengers that month while American was just under 30 000 passengers   edit  Entertainment industry The motion picture business arrived in Burbank in the 1920s  In 1926  First National Pictures bought a 78 acre  320 000 m2  site on Olive Avenue near Dark Canyon  The property included a 40 acre  160 000 m2  hog ranch and the original David Burbank house  both owned by rancher Stephen A  Martin  In 1928 29  First National was taken over by a company founded by the four Warner brothers  Columbia Pictures purchased property in Burbank as a ranch facility  used primarily for outdoor shooting  Walt Disney s company  which had outgrown its Hollywood quarters  bought 51 acres  210 000 m2  in Burbank  Disney s million dollar studio  designed by Kem Weber  was completed in 1939 on Buena Vista Street  Disney originally wanted to build  Mickey Mouse Park   as he first called it  next to the Burbank studio  But his aides finally convinced him that the space was too small  and there was opposition from the Burbank City Council  One council member told Disney   We don t want the carny atmosphere in Burbank   Disney later built his successful Disneyland in Anaheim  Disney and Warner contributed to the war effort by producing both training and morale films for the armed services and cartoons promoting the sale of war bonds  Disney artists designed more than 1 000 unit mascot designs for the armed forces  Walt Disney had authorized that these insignias were to be designed at no charge  By war s end  the cost to Disney was over  30 000  Burbank saw its first real civil strife as the culmination of a six month labor dispute between the set decorator s union and the studios resulted in the Battle of Burbank on October 5  1945  By the 1960s and 1970s  more of the Hollywood entertainment industry was relocating to Burbank  The National Broadcasting Company moved its network television headquarters to its new location at Olive and Alameda avenues  The Burbank studio was purchased in 1951  and NBC arrived in 1952 from its former location at Sunset and Vine in Hollywood  Although NBC promoted its Hollywood image for most of its West Coast telecasts  such as Ed McMahon s introduction to the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson   from Hollywood    comedians Dan Rowan and Dick Martin began mentioning  beautiful downtown Burbank  on Laugh in in the 1960s  By 1962  NBC s multi million dollar  state of the art complex was completed  Rumors surfaced of NBC leaving Burbank after its parent company General Electric Company acquired Universal Studios and renamed the merged division NBC Universal  Since the deal  NBC has been relocating key operations to the 391 acre  1 6 km2  Universal property located in Universal City  Los Angeles  California  USA  In the early 1990s  Burbank tried unsuccessfully to lure Sony Pictures Entertainment  the Columbia and TriStar studios owner based in Culver City  and 20th Century Fox  which had threatened to move from its West Los Angeles lot unless the city granted permission to upgrade its facility  Fox stayed after getting Los Angeles City approval on its  200 million expansion plan  In 1999 the city did manage to gain Cartoon Network Studios which took up residence in an old commercial bakery building located on North 3rd St  when it separated its production operations from Warner Bros  Animation in Sherman Oaks  CA  On September 10  2007  NBC Universal management informed employees that the company planned to end its 56 year relationship with Burbank and sell much of the 34 acre  140 000 m2  Burbank complex  NBC Universal will relocate its television and cable operations to the Universal City complex  Originally  management touted a major development located adjacent to the Universal City Red Line subway station  The company planned to take West Coast network and local news operations and other facilities such as the Access Hollywood set to the new broadcast facility across the street from Universal Studios by 2011  Those controversial plans were altered in fall 2009 when Ron Meyer  President and Chief Operating Officer of Universal Studios  announced the so called NBC Universal Evolution Plan as part of the studios s  3 billion makeover  The new plan includes new studio space as well as a residential component  30  The relocation plans changed following Comcast Corp  s  30 billion acquisition of NBC Universal in January 2011  NBC Universal announced in January 2012 it would relocate the NBC Network  Telemundo s L A  Bureau  as well as local stations KNBC and KVEA to the former Technicolor building located on

air raids at the start of World War II  The two story hospital was located at Olive Avenue and Fifth Street  By 1925  the hospital was expanded to 50 beds and in the mid 1980s operated with 103 beds and a staff of over 175 physicians  For years  it also was the only hospital in Burbank where women could receive abortions  tubal ligations and other procedures not offered at what is now Providence

Burbank Health Care Foundation  which assists community organizations that cater to health related needs  In 1943  the Sisters of Providence Health System  a Catholic non profit group  founded Providence St  Joseph Medical Center  Construction of the hospital proved difficult due to World War II restrictions on construction materials  and in particular the lack of structural steel  But the challenges were met and the one story hospital was erected to deal with wartime restrictions  During the baby boom of the 1950s  the hospital expanded from the original 100 beds to 212  By 2008  the hospital featured 455 beds  over 2 300 employees and more than 650 physicians  In the mid 1990s  Seattle based Sisters of Providence Health System  which owns St  Joseph in Burbank  renamed the

neighborhood is in constant struggle with developers looking to expand and update Magnolia Boulevard  Independent merchants and slow growth groups have fought off new construction and big box stores  The neighborhood remains quiet despite being beneath the airport flight path and bordered by arterial streets  One of the centerpieces of the area s attempted comeback is Porto s Bakery at the old Thrifty site located at 3606 and 3614 West Magnolia Boulevard  As part of the project  Burbank loaned Porto s funds for building upgrades  Under the agreement a portion of the loan will be forgiven over a 10 year period  East of Porto s is Antique Row  a hub for shopping in the city  Other enhancements include converting the disused railroad right of way along Chandler Boulevard into a

revitalized downtown Burbank provides an urban mix of shopping  dining  and entertainment  The San Fernando Strip is an exclusive mall designed to be a modern urban village  with apartments above the mall  An upscale shopping district is located in the state of the art Empire Center neighborhood  The Burbank Town Center is a retail complex adjacent to the downtown core that was built in two phases between 1991 and 1992  In 1979  the Burbank Redevelopment Agency entered into an agreement with San Diego based Ernest Hahn Company to build a regional mall known as Media City Center  It would later get renamed Burbank Town Center and undergo a  130 million facelift starting in 2004  including a new exterior streetscape facade  The agency  helped out with its powers of eminent domain  spent  52 million to buy up the 41 acre  170 000 m2  land in the area bounded by the Golden State Freeway  Burbank Boulevard  Third Street and Magnolia Boulevard  Original plans were for Media City Center included four anchor tenants  including a J W  Robinson s  But May Co  Department Stores later bought the parent company of Robinson s and dropped out of the deal  The other stores then dropped out as well and Hahn and the agency dropped the project in March 1987  Within months  Burbank entered into negotiations with the Walt Disney Company for a shopping mall and office complex to be called the  Disney MGM Backlot   51  Disney had estimated that it could spend  150 million to  300 million on a complex of shops  restaurants  theaters  clubs and hotel  and had offered to move its animation department and Disney Channel cable network operation to the property as well  These plans ended in failure in February 1988 when Disney executives determined that the costs were too high  In January 1989  Burbank began Media City Center project negotiations with two developers  the Alexander Haagen Co  of Manhattan Beach and Price Kornwasser Associates of San Diego  Eight months later  Haagen won the contract and commenced construction  leading to the  250 million mall s opening in August 1991  Under terms of the agreement with Haagen  the city funded a  18 million parking garage and made between  8 and  12 million in improvements to the surrounding area  Plans by Sheraton Corporation to build a 300 room hotel at the mall were shelved because of the weak economy  The new mall helped take the strain off Burbank s troubled economy  which had been hard hit by the departure of several large industrial employers  including Lockheed Corp  The center was partially financed with  50 million in city redevelopment funds  Construction had been in doubt for many years by economic woes and political turmoil since it was first proposed in the late 1970s  In 2003  Irvine based Crown Realty  amp  Development purchased the 1 200 000 square foot  110 000 m2  Burbank Town Center from Pan Pacific Retail Properties for  111 million  Crown then hired General Growth Properties Inc   a Chicago based real estate investment trust  for property management and leasing duties  At the time  the Burbank mall ranked as the No  6 retail center in Los Angeles County in terms of leasable square footage  with estimated combined tenant volumes in excess of  240 million  One local standout was the Burbank Town Center s IKEA  with an estimated 30 000 shoppers weekly and rated No  1 in Southern California with annual sales of  90 million  In 1994  Lockheed selected Chicago based Homart Development Company as the developer of a retail center on a former P 38  Skunk Works  plant near the Burbank Airport that was subject to a major toxic clean up project  A year later  Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta to become Lockheed Martin Corp   Lockheed was ordered to clean up the toxics as part of a federal Superfund site  52  The northern Burbank area also became identified as the San Fernando Valley s hottest toxic spot in 1989 by the South Coast Air Quality Management District  with Lockheed identified among major contributors  53  Lockheed always maintained the site was never a health risk to the community  P 38 Lightning production line in Burbank  Site is now location of Burbank Empire Center  The Lockheed toxic clean up site  just east of the Golden State Freeway  later became home to the Empire Center  Four developers competed to be selected to build the  300 million outdoor mall on the site  In 1999  Lockheed picked Los Angeles based Zelman Cos  from among other contenders to create the retail office complex on a 103 acre  0 42 km2  site  54  Zelman purchased the land in 2000 for around  70 million  As part of the sales agreement  Lockheed carried out extensive soil vapor removal on the site  Lockheed had manufactured planes on the site from 1928 to 1991  Together with  42 million for demolition and  12 million for site investigation  Lockheed would eventually spend  115 million on the project  Warner Brothers proposed building a sports arena there for the Kings and the Clippers on the former B 1 bomber plant site  Price Club wanted it for a new store  Disney considered moving some operations there too  The city used the site in its failed attempt to lure DreamWorks to Burbank  55  Phoenix based Vestar Development Company planned a major retail development and spent more than a year in negotiations to buy the property from Lockheed before pulling out late in 1998  Less than eight months after breaking ground  the Empire Center s first stores opened in October 2001  Local officials estimated the complex would generate about  3 2 million a year in sales tax revenue for the city  and as many as 3 500 local jobs  56  Within a year of completion  the Empire Center was helping the city to post healthy growth in sales tax revenues despite a down economy  Alone  the Empire mall generated close to  800 000 in sales tax revenues in the second quarter of 2002  The outdoor mall s buildings hark back to Lockheed s glory days by resembling manufacturing plants  Each of the outdoor signs features a replica of a Lockheed aircraft  while the mall design brings to mind an airport  complete with a miniature control tower  57  In 2009  work was finished on a  130 million office project adjacent to the Empire Center  The completion of the seven story tower marked the final phase of the mixed use Empire development near Bob Hope

involving the right to begin meetings with a sectarian prayer  73  A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge ruled that prayers referencing specific religions violated the principle of separation of church and state in the First Amendment  While invocations were still allowed  Burbank officials were required to advise all clerics that sectarian prayer as part of Council meetings was not permitted under the Constitution  Like other California cities  Burbank took a financial hit after Californians passed Proposition 13 in 1977  The city dealt with the ramifications of maintaining service levels expected by the community but with lower tax revenues  As a result  Burbank officials opted to cut some services and implement user fees for specialized services  citation needed   edit  Burbank
