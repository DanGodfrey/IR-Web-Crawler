city is Omaha  on the Missouri River  The state is crossed by many historic trails  but it was the California Gold Rush that first brought large numbers here  and it became a state in 1867  Certain landmarks still compete for the notional distinction  Where the West Begins   There are wide variations between winter and summer temperatures  and violent thunderstorms and tornadoes are common  The state is characterized by treeless prairie  ideal for cattle grazing  and it is a major producer of beef  as well as pork  maize and soybeans  Nebraska is overwhelmingly rural  as the 8th least densely populated state of America  with only one Metropolitan Class City  Ethnically  the largest group are German Americans  and the state has the biggest Czech American population per head  During the Great Migration  many African Americans came to Omaha  and they continue to campaign for improved conditions  More recently  Native American activism has increased  with a drive for self determination in a climate of co operation with state officials on regional issues  It is traditionally a Republican voting state  Nebraska is identified with notables as varied as Fred Astaire  Malcolm X  Johnny Carson  Dick Cavett  Montgomery Clift  Henry Fonda  Buffalo Bill Cody  Warren Buffett  L  Ron Hubbard  Willa Cather  Marlon Brando and Alexander Payne  Kool Aid was created here in

after the Platte River that flows through the state  4   edit  History Main article  History of Nebraska Nebraska in 1718  Guillaume de L Isle map  with the approximate area of the future state highlighted Varying cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the region along the rivers for thousands of years before European exploration  Historical Native American tribes living in Nebraska have included the Omaha  Missouria  Ponca  Pawnee  Otoe  and various branches of the Lakota  Sioux   Long before the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804 1806  French Canadian explorers  including the Mallet brothers in 1739  traversed the territory of Nebraska on their way to trade in Santa Fe  then claimed by Spain  5  In 1819  the United States established Fort Atkinson as the first US Army post west of the Missouri River  just east of present day Fort Calhoun  The army abandoned the fort in 1827 as migration moved further west  European American settlement did not begin in any numbers until after 1848 and the California Gold Rush  On May 30  1854  the US Congress created the Kansas and the Nebraska territories  divided by the Parallel 40  North  under the Kansas Nebraska Act  6  The Nebraska Territory included parts of the current states of Colorado  North Dakota  South Dakota  Wyoming  and Montana  7  The territorial capital of Nebraska was Omaha  In the 1860s  after the US government forced many of the Native American tribes to cede their lands and settle on reservations  it opened large tracts of land to agricultural development by Europeans and Americans  Under the Homestead Act  thousands of new settlers migrated into Nebraska to claim free land granted by the federal government  Because so few trees grew on the prairies  many of the first farming settlers built their homes of sod  as had the Native Americans such as the Omaha  The first wave of settlement gave the territory a sufficient population to apply for statehood  8  Homesteaders in central Nebraska in 1886 Nebraska became the 37th state on March 1  1867  and the capital was moved from Omaha to the center at Lancaster  later renamed Lincoln after the recently assassinated President of the United States  Abraham Lincoln  During the 1870s to the 1880s  Nebraska experienced a large growth in population  Several factors contributed to attracting new residents  The first was that the vast prairie land was perfect for cattle grazing  This helped settlers to learn the unfamiliar geography of the area  The second factor was the invention of several farming technologies  Agricultural inventions such as barbed wire  wind mills  and the steel plow  combined with good weather  enabled settlers to make use of Nebraska as prime farming land  By the 1880s  Nebraska s population had soared to more than 450 000 people  9  The Arbor Day holiday was founded in Nebraska  The National Arbor Day Foundation is still headquartered in Nebraska City  with some offices in Lincoln  In the late nineteenth century  many African Americans migrated from the South to Nebraska as part of the Great Migration  primarily to Omaha which offered working class jobs in meatpacking  the railroads and other industries  Omaha has a long history of civil rights activism  Blacks encountered discrimination from other Americans in Omaha and especially from recent European immigrants  ethnic whites who were competing for the same jobs  In 1912 African Americans founded the Omaha chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to work for improved conditions in the city and state  Activism has continued  Since the 1960s  Native American activism in the state has increased  both through open protest  activities to build alliances with state and local governments  and in the slower  more extensive work of building tribal institutions and infrastructure  Native Americans in federally recognized tribes have pressed for self determination  sovereignty and recognition  They have created community schools to preserve their cultures  as well as tribal colleges and universities  Tribal politicians have also collaborated with state and county officials on regional issues   edit

with a unicameral legislature  Although this house is officially known simply as the  Legislature   and more commonly called the  Unicameral   its members call themselves  senators   Nebraska s Legislature is also the only state legislature in the United States that is nonpartisan  The senators are elected with no party affiliation next to their names on the ballot  and the speaker and

other Nebraskans encouraged the idea of a unicameral legislature  and demanded the issue be decided in a referendum  Norris argued    The constitutions of our various states are built upon the idea that there is but one class  If this be true  there is no sense or reason in having the same thing done twice  especially if it is to be done by two bodies of men elected in the same way and having the same jurisdiction    Unicameral supporters also argued that a bicameral legislature had a significant undemocratic feature in the committees that reconciled Assembly and Senate legislation  Votes in these committees were secretive  and would sometimes add provisions to bills that neither house had approved  Nebraska s unicameral legislature today has rules that bills can contain only one subject  and must be given at least five days of consideration  In 1934  due in part to the budgetary pressure of the Great Depression  Nebraska citizens ran a state initiative to vote on a unicameral legislature  which was approved  In effect  the Assembly  the house  was abolished  as noted  today s Nebraska state legislators are commonly referred to as  Senators    edit  Judicial branch Further
