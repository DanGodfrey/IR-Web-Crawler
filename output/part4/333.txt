character  and illustrated by Don Heck  who initially designed the character   edit  Fictional character biography  edit  Origins The Mandarin s late father was one of the wealthiest men in pre revolutionary mainland China  and a descendant of Genghis Khan   while his late mother was an English noblewoman  Their son was born in an unnamed village in mainland China before the Communist revolution  The boy s parents died soon after his birth  and he was raised by his  paternal  aunt  who was embittered against the world and raised him with much the same attitude  Every last bit of the family fortune was spent obsessively training the Mandarin in science and combat  with the result that he was completely broke upon reaching adulthood  Unable to pay the taxes on his ancestral home  the Mandarin was evicted by the government  5  Hoping to find a means of avenging himself upon the civilization that had taxed him and rendered him homeless  the Mandarin explored the forbidden  Valley of Spirits   where no one had dared to set foot for centuries  5  There he found the skeleton and starship of Axonn Karr  an intelligent dragon like alien from the planet Maklu IV  who had come to Earth centuries ago and died  Over the following years  the Mandarin studied Makluan science until he mastered it  He also learned how to use the ten rings he found within the starship which were apparently its propulsion source  among other things  The Mandarin then became a conqueror and subjugated the villages around the Valley  and  through his advanced science  rapidly became a power that not even the Chinese Army could successfully challenge  He then embarked on a long series of attempts to achieve world domination  The Chinese  though fearing him  asked for his help  but he would not become subserviant to them  The Mandarin sees technology as the surest means to achieve his goals  Over the years  he has frequently attempted to turn the weapons of various nations against them  Among the Mandarin s earliest schemes is the sabotage and theft of American missiles and spy planes built by Tony Stark  To restore public confidence in his workmanship  Stark donned his Iron Man armor and flew to China to investigate  6  Iron Man soon became the Mandarin s principal obstacle against his plans for world domination  The cover of Tales of Suspense  50  February 1964  Art by Jack Kirby  First appearance of the Mandarin  On three occasions in their early confrontations  the Mandarin managed to take Iron Man  or his alter ego Tony Stark  captive  but the Mandarin failed to kill him  Similarly  Iron Man thwarted the Mandarin s various schemes  but was unable to bring him to justice  Some of the Mandarin s early technological achievements are the launching of a small orbiting satellite whose  death ray  he aims at Stark Industries and the building  later retconned as  the reprogramming  the refitting  and the recharging   of Ultimo  a 30 foot  9 1 m  android possessing vast destructive powers  The Mandarin would employ Ultimo four times over the years  but it was always defeated by Iron Man  The Mandarin s teleportation technology  derived from Makluan science  enables him to kidnap people at will or teleport himself out of threatening situations  He teleported the Swordsman to his castle just before the Avengers captured him  plotting to use him to destroy the Avengers and adding technology to his sword to aid him  though the Swordsman betrayed him and threw the bomb away  During his fifth encounter with Iron Man  the Mandarin teleported Harold  Happy  Hogan  a friend and confidant of Iron Man  to his castle in China half a world away  Hogan was wearing the Iron Man armor at the time to help protect his employer s secret identity  and the Mandarin mistook him for his true foe  In rescuing Hogan  Iron Man physically bested the Mandarin in personal combat for the first time  Iron Man redirected the missiles that the Mandarin had launched so that they hit the Mandarin s castle  destroying it  The Mandarin escaped by means of his teleportation machinery  and he materialized aboard his orbiting satellite  There  he constructed a gemlike device capable of broadcasting  hate rays  toward Earth  The Mandarin  using his teleportation technology  assembled several of the former Masters of Evil to perform missions for him  the Living Laser who attacked Asia with Ultimo but was beaten by Thor and Hawkeye  the original Power Man and the Swordsman  who with an army of mercanaries attacked a South American country but were beaten by Goalith  the Wasp  and Iron Man  the Enchantress  and the Executioner  who led an army of Trolls in Africa  but were beaten by Hercules and the Scarlet Witch  The Avengers managed to thwart the Mandarin s scheme after getting to the satellite  despite being hit by his Hate Rays that made them fight the person nearest to themselves  However the Wasp was nearest to the Mandarin and her attack on him shut off the rays  The Mandarin was sucked into space and the Avengers were able to destroy his satellite  The Mandarin then established a base in China s Gobi Desert and turned his attention to the Hulk for a time  hoping to make the dull witted brute an accomplice  Two attempts at controlling the Hulk proved futile  however  First he placed a device on the Hulk s neck  hoping to use him to start a war which would allow the Mandarin to take over the world  However Nick Fury foiled this scheme  Next the Mandarin allied himself with the American criminal the Sandman  who had just been beaten by the Hulk  The Hulk destroyed the Mandarin s desert base and the Mandarin sent the Sandman into a hot vat  turning him to glass  When the Mandarin next attacked Iron Man  he employed an android in the Hulk s likeness rather than the real Hulk  The Mandarin set up a makeshift base of operations in America  and attempted to discredit Anthony Stark publicly  Holding Iron Man captive for the fourth time  the Mandarin tried to learn if Iron Man was actually Stark  but Stark fooled him with a rubber mask over his own features  His plans thwarted  the Mandarin tried to kill Stark s current girlfriend  Janice Cord  but the Mandarin s betrothed Mei Ling saved her at the cost of her own life   edit  New bodies Returning to China  the Mandarin sought a means to increase his rings  power and learned of the legendary Eye of Yin  a talisman of power created by an ancient group of Chinese sorcerers  The Mandarin manipulated the Royal Family of the Inhumans  who lived  at the time  in the nearby Himalayan Mountains of Tibet  into locating the idol for him  Yet before he could fully incorporate the Eye s power in his rings  Black Bolt  the ruler of the Inhumans  overpowered him  stripped him of his ten rings  and hid them  Unable to find the rings  the Mandarin journeyed back to the  Valley of Spirits  and the ruins of the Makluan starship wherein he first acquired the rings  There he found a headband containing technology which enabled him to recover the rings  The Mandarin used his newfound power to restore his castle to its original state  The Unicorn  another frequent opponent of Iron Man  sought the Mandarin s aid in curing him of a progressive disease  The Mandarin and the Unicorn traveled to America to attack their common enemy  Iron Man  but in the heat of battle the Mandarin found that the headband had somehow exchanged his consciousness with that of the Unicorn  The Mandarin was forced to flee  desperate to separate himself from the Unicorn s dying body  7  When the Mandarin arrived at his castle in China  he found that it had been taken over by the Yellow Claw  another professional criminal and warlord of Chinese origin  The Mandarin was forced to find another laboratory to try to restore his mind back to its rightful body  which he managed with the unwilling aid of the Japanese mutant Sunfire  volume  amp  issue needed  In battle with Iron Man again  the Mandarin s interim headquarters was destroyed  The Mandarin then launched an attack on the Yellow Claw in an attempt to regain his own castle  but was fatally injured when the Yellow Claw robot he had been battling exploded  As the Mandarin was dying  he used the headband s mind transferring capacities to transfer his consciousness into his ten rings  volume  amp  issue needed  When the rings were confiscated by the Yellow Claw s power hungry servant Loc Do  the Mandarin s consciousness entered his body  permanently driving out Loc Do s  Using his matter rearranger ring  the Mandarin transformed Loc Do s body into a younger duplicate of his own original one  8  The Mandarin returned to his castle  discovering that it had again been destroyed  After rebuilding it  the Mandarin attempted to capture Iron Man with his teleportation devices  but once again caught someone else clad in his armor  This time it was Michael O Brien  later to become a friend of Stark s and second to wear the Guardsman armor  Iron Man flew to O Brien s rescue  clad in an old set of armor  saved O Brien  thwarted the Mandarin s attempt to bomb the United States  and for a second time bested him in personal combat  Perhaps due to the effect of the Mandarin s mental domination ring on him  Iron Man did not take the Mandarin into custody  but allowed him to remain free  9  The Mandarin later schemed to turn the Great Vibranium Mound of Wakanda into Type II Vibranium  which destroys the molecular cohesion of metals  He also tried to destroy China s entire rice crop with radiation in an attempt to force a starving nation into war  In the second of these plots  the Mandarin encountered James Rhodes during Rhodes s custodianship of the Iron Man armor  10   edit  Heart of Darkness When Stark tried to set up a branch of Stark Enterprises in Hong Kong  Iron Man and the Mandarin once again came into conflict  The Mandarin had taken the name of Zhang Tong  and had become a financial leader in Hong Kong  As Tong  he controlled a number of government officials and industry leaders of Hong Kong  The Mandarin thwarted all of Stark s attempts to set up a business branch  even resorting to murder  The Mandarin now employed a group called the Hand to do his dirty work  When on a mission  a Hand member is allowed to take one of the Mandarin s rings and use its powers  As a precaution  if the Hand member were to be captured  he would fanatically try to kill himself  If the Hand member were to be killed or knocked out  the ring would automatically teleport back to the Mandarin  The Mandarin s agents kidnapped James Rhodes and several of Stark s other employees  forcing Iron Man into single combat in exchange for their lives  Iron Man defeated the Mandarin once again  and helped Stark s employees escape the Hand  Ironically  the Mandarin s minions were left without their weapons when their master was knocked unconscious  causing his rings to teleport back to him automatically and leaving them unarmed and unable to stop Stark s employees from fleeing  volume  amp  issue needed  At one point  during a period in which the then thought dead X Men had disbanded  the mutant heroine Psylocke passed through the mystic portal known as the Siege Perilous  The portal relocated her to an Asian shore  leaving her an amnesiac  The man known as Matsu o Tsurayaba found her and believed he could save his brain dead lover Kwannon by switching her mind with Psylocke  volume  amp  issue needed  He made an arrangement with the Mandarin to help him with the switch  since his rings would be able to cause the mind switch  Working with the woman known as Spiral  they were able to switch the minds of the two women  Mandarin then put Psylocke  now in Kwannon s body  through conditioning  causing her to believe herself to be Lady Mandarin  the Mandarin s assassin  During this time  the Mandarin teamed up with several other villains during the Acts of Vengeance  He also confronted the Avengers  volume  amp  issue needed  After completing several assignments for him  Psylocke was eventually rescued by her X Men teammate Wolverine and his then sidekick  Jubilee  The three then defeated the Mandarin  causing events which led to the Mandarin s leaving the Hand  volume  amp  issue needed  Some time later  the Mandarin discovered that one of his rings was an elaborate counterfeit  One of his underlings had betrayed him  surrendering the ring to Chen Hsu  an ancient wizard who lived in San Francisco  Hsu  elfin in appearance but puissant in power  gave up the ring to the Mandarin  who  however  collapsed as soon as he put it on  Chen Hsu tended to him  removing the veil of confusion from his mind  soon the Mandarin realized that his memories had been fragmented because of the theft of the ring  because the rings were still linked to his consciousness  volume  amp  issue needed  Next Chen Hsu made the Mandarin a strange offer which involved the two of them traveling to the Valley of the Dragons  There  he used a magic herb to awaken Fin Fang Foom  an ancient and incredibly powerful dragon  Under the control of Hsu  the dragon obeyed the Mandarin  laying waste to an army sent by the Chinese government to stop him  Soon the Mandarin claimed a third of China s territory  and the authorities sent out a call for help to the only man who had consistently defeated him or had had any effectiveness in foiling his plans  Iron Man  volume  amp  issue needed  When Iron Man confronted the Mandarin and Fin Fang Foom  it soon became clear that there were other plans in motion  eight other dragons appeared  It was revealed that  many thousands of years ago  a number of aliens from the planet Kakaranathara  planet number IV of the star Maklu  had traveled to Earth to look for the conflict which was unknown in their culture and which they craved  The ship had crashed  forcing them to stay on Earth for thousands of years  Then  the Mandarin had found the ship and had claimed their rings  Now  they demanded them back  but he refused them  Iron Man forcibly combined his power with the rings  and managed to destroy the Makluan dragons  The Mandarin survived in a comatose state  but his hands were vaporized in the blast  volume  amp  issue needed  For months  he lay in a state between life and death  in the care of a peasant woman who did not even know who he was  Over time  his hands grew back  though they did so as reptilian claws  and the rings called to him again  to reclaim them  volume  amp  issue needed  The Mandarin next discovered the Heart of Darkness  an orb of apparently mystic energy  the alien Century believed it was an ancient artifact which acted as a  lens  to attract and focus all manner of dark power  11  The Mandarin used its power to turn back time in China  and literally transformed it into a feudal nation again  one in which electronic equipment could not operate  12  Iron Man  with his team Force Works and ally War Machine defeated him  but not before the Mandarin discovered that Tony Stark was the man inside the Iron Man armor  13  Iron Man infected the Mandarin with a techno organic virus  and the Heart  seeing him infected with technology  rejected the Mandarin and imploded  Iron Man believed him dead  though in reality the Mandarin had been transported and transformed  by the last flare of the orb s magic  into a janitor in the Hong Kong branch of Stark Enterprises  14  Eventually  the Mandarin s memories returned to him  Instead of trying to crush technology  the Mandarin believed that the feudalism of yesterday had merely been transformed into the capitalism of today  This led the Mandarin to set into motion plans to create a giant flying fortress  called the Dragon of Heaven  through which he could conquer Russia and eventually the world  15  During this time  Iron Man reappeared after being believed dead in a battle against the psychic menace Onslaught  The Mandarin initiated a series of attacks on Iron Man  16  culminating in a battle with the Dragon of Heaven  17  Eventually it was revealed that the Mandarin s primary purpose had not been to conquer Russia  but instead to test Iron Man himself  prove him worthy as a foe  and to justify the Mandarin s own thoughts on the feudal nature of capitalism  The Mandarin seemed to die as the Dragon of Heaven exploded  but Iron Man was less than convinced that his foe had truly met his end  18   edit  Temugin Despite the uncertainty of his fate  it would be nearly ten years before the Mandarin returned to the pages of his foe s comic  In the interim  the Golden Avenger faced Temugin  the son of the Mandarin  Temugin had precious few memories of his father  and most of them involved his father taking him to the monastery where he was raised and trained by monks  Temugin was sensitive  spiritual  and unbelievably powerful because of his control of chi  the living force in all things  volume  amp  issue needed  One day  Temugin received a package containing the severed hands of the Mandarin  bearing all the rings of power  Temugin knew that he was honor bound to fulfill his father s wishes for him  He challenged Iron Man in order to avenge his father s death  and he proved a deadly adversary even without the rings  19  After Tony Stark revealed a conspiracy for mass murder in his own ranks  Temugin appeared to have forgiven Iron Man for the death of his father and to have turned to more lofty pursuits  but events indicated that the evil power of the rings had corrupted his soul  volume  amp  issue needed  Temugin had been named after his  and the Mandarin s  claimed ancestor Genghis Khan  whose birth name was Temujin  also spelled Temuchin  Temudjin  u also variates to     volume  amp  issue needed  Temugin was later contacted by the double crossing Spot  who promptly handed over a super weapon that MODOK had been planning to steal  In this appearance  Temugin spoke of the Mandarin as  My Late Father   and bore the rings  one of which he used to imprison Spot in another dimension with nothing but money  In the following issue  the Puma tore off at least one of his hands  but despite this  he retained at least half of the rings   and possibly all  as Nightshade  who used the rings on his lost hand  was not seen with them at the end of the story  20  Nevertheless  he later lost the rings  or perhaps discarded them   and reappeared   with a cybernetic arm   as a member of the Atlas Foundation  having been selected as a secondary candidate for the position of its ruler by the ancient dragon Mr  Lao  In this capacity he was a constant irritant to Jimmy Woo  the head of Atlas  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Revival The Mandarin has been revived in a later arc of Iron Man  Apparently  he has been in a prison in central China for some time  In this story it has been revealed that he has lost his hands  most likely the hands that were sent to Temugin were  in fact  actually the Mandarin s   He has also been living with no food or water for years  His ability to survive so long without food or water is likely due to his mastery of chi  Despite being handless and starved  he was able to kill several men armed with guns via his mastery of the martial arts  His rings have been returned to him  and were reassimilated into his body by heating them and burning them into his spine  21  After attacking Iron Man  via S H I E L D    with dozens of unwitting proxies in the form of extremist splinter groups  equipped by him with hyper advanced biological weapons   he eventually resurfaces as Tem Borjigin  yet another name of Genghis Khan   now once again sporting hands  although they are artificial   volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Government infiltration The Mandarin infiltrates the U S  government via his role as CEO of Prometheus  a corporation specializing in bio engineered weaponry  He appears to be using Extremis creator and Tony Stark s former love interest Maya Hansen to produce an army of Extremis enhanced soldiers as well as financing and arming terrorists around the globe  The Mandarin also appears to plan unleashing the Extremis virus in aerosol form on the public  expecting the 97 5  fatality ratio to cause a mass catastrophe of deaths  volume  amp  issue needed  The Mandarin admits to Hansen that even he will die in the outbreak but she and those with the gene to survive will become free from disease and become effectively immortal  Though he has his Extremis disabled  Iron Man defeats the Mandarin while wearing the Silver Centurion armor by tearing five of the rings out of the Mandarin s spine  blasting him with those rings  his unibeam  and repulsors at the same time  and then freezing him as he is engulfed in deadly concentrated Extremis virus  Iron Man then prevents the Extremis outbreak  22  However  when the Mandarin s apparently frozen body is autopsied  all that is found is a blackened husk    not unlike an Extremis chrysalis  23   edit  Enter the Mandarin The Mandarin appeared in Iron Man   Enter the Mandarin in 2007 which is an expanded and modified retelling from his earliest appearances in Tales of Suspense   edit  Mandarin  The Story of My Life In Invincible Iron Man Annual  1 by Matt Fraction  a new updated origin of the Mandarin is offered  Here  the Mandarin kidnaps a young up and coming film producer to tell his life s story  He relates the same story he once told Iron Man in Tales of Suspense of his English noblewoman mother and his schooling at the finest boarding schools in the land  However  the director begins to learn that much of what the Mandarin says is contradictory and false with photos from this time staged  It s hinted that the Mandarin had used one of his own rings to make himself believe this tapestry of half truths  and discovers a different tale of the Mandarin s origins  The Mandarin was the son of a opium den prostitute who went on to become a powerful underworld figure before discovering the Ten Rings of Power in an alien craft  the pilot of which he brutally slew to obtain them  the Mandarin slaughtered the Red Chinese army officials for daring to cross him while financing his operations with drug and gun smuggling  aided by the mercenary Raza  In this retelling  he is also said to have been at the camp in which Tony Stark constructed his Iron Man armor  though Stark is unaware of this fact  Angered at the Mandarin holding his wife hostage  the director shoots the movie as he wishes not as the Mandarin dictates  The Mandarin denounces this telling of his past as lies and angrily destroys the cinema in which it was being shown  before having the director killed  Later he is regretful about murdering the director  noting that he really did love his films  24  It is unknown if this new origin is the truth or not as a major theme of the issue is that the with the Mandarin s life it is impossible to tell the truth from the myth that the man has created around himself and at least some of what the Mandarin claims must be true as he possesses the ten alien rings and well honed martial arts skills that he describes acquiring  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Stark Resilient At the conclusion of the Stark Resilient storyline  it is revealed that the Mandarin is the father of Sasha Hammer  as she introduces her boyfriend Ezekiel Stane to her parents  Mandarin tells Stane some of the various names he s known as  then simply instructs Stane to refer to him as  Master   25  With help from Zeke Stane  Mandarin recruits Blizzard II  Chemistro III  Crimson Dynamo XIII  Firebrand IV  Firepower  Living Laser  Melter II  Mauler III  a Titanium Man  Vibro  and Whirlwind as well as building some new Dreadnought robots in a plot to take out Iron Man  26   edit  Powers and abilities The Mandarin is a superb athlete with tremendous skill in the various martial arts  Through repeated practice  he has toughened all the striking surfaces of his body  especially his hands  which are covered with thick calluses  He can even split Iron Man s magnetic beam reinforced alloy armor with repeated blows  So great is the Mandarin s martial arts ability  that he can even survive years without food and water  apparently sustaining himself purely via his mastery of chi  The precise degree of The Mandarin s martial art powers has been the subject of multiple implied retcons by Marvel Comics  Initially  Mandarin was portrayed as being such a superhumanly skilled martial artist that he could destroy Iron Man s armor with his bare hands  27  Later portrayals focused on his use of the rings  and implicitly retconned the Mandarin s skill to being great but no longer superhuman  volume  amp  issue needed  The most recent continuity has restored Mandarin s martial arts ability to its original superhuman level  volume  amp  issue needed  The Mandarin is one of Marvel Earth s greatest scientific geniuses  and highly skilled in various sciences  Not only has he made himself into an expert authority on alien Makluuan science  but he has also built upon this knowledge by making further discoveries based upon it  The principal personal weapons of the Mandarin are the ten rings which he wears on the fingers of each hand  The rings  operations cannot be explained by contemporary Earth science  but it is known that they served as near limitless power sources for the warp drive engines of the Makluan starship of Axonn Karr  The Mandarin learned how to convert the rings to his personal uses and to make them respond to his mental commands  The fingers on which he wears each ring  and the known functions for which he uses each ring  are given below  Digit Left Hand Right Hand Little finger Ice Blast The ring emits waves of cold which can be used to stun an opponent  The ring usually causes the air in the path of its blast to turn to ice  and can lower an object s temperature to nearly absolute zero  Black Light The ring can create an area of absolute blackness that seems to absorb all light used within it  Although  black light  is a term used to refer to ultraviolet radiation  the darkness created by the ring is probably a form of the  darkforce  used by Cloak  Darkstar  and the Shroud  Ring Finger Mento Intensifier The ring magnifies the wearer s own psionic energy  allowing him to place one or more people under his mental control and to transmit orders to them mentally  Most frequently used to create illusions  Disintegration Beam The ring emits a beam of energy that destroys all bonds between the atoms and molecules of the object it strikes  This ring needs twenty minutes to recharge after use  Middle Finger Electro Blast The ring emits electricity in amounts at intensities mentally determined by the wearer  The maximum current attainable is not known  Vortex Beam The ring causes the air to move about at high speed in a vortex  The vortex can be used as an offensive weapon  as a means of levitating objects  or as a means of propelling the ring s wearer through the air  Index Finger Flame Blast The ring emits infrared radiation  or heat  at intensities mentally determined by the wearer  Usually the heat produces flame through incandescing the molecules in the air in the path of the blast  The heat beam can be used to trigger chemical explosions  The maximum amount of heat it can generate is not known  Impact Beam This ring can project various forms of energy  most frequently that of fast neutrons with great concussive force  The ring has also been used to project intense sonic vibrations and to create magnetic waves to attract or repel objects  The ring may be capable of emitting other forms of energy as well  and has been used to send Iron Man slamming through a mountain  Thumb White Light This ring can emit various forms of energy along the electromagnetic spectrum  Has been used to create gravity powerful enough to make Iron Man bury himself by trying to walk forward  Matter Rearranger This ring can rearrange the atoms and molecules of a substance  or speed up or slow down their movement  so as to produce various effects  The ring has been used to condense water vapor in the air to liquid water  to solidify gasses  to create lethal poison gas from the air  to turn a group of men to stone  to turn a man into a beetle  to turn a mountain into a rock monster  and to make a stone hand large enough to engulf Iron Man s body erupt from the floor  The ring cannot transmute elements or rearrange the atoms and molecules of Iron Man s magnetic beam reinforced armor  Over the years through mental discipline achieved through meditation and long practice in use of the rings  the Mandarin has established a strong psionic link with his ten power rings  which was made many times stronger during the period in which his mind spirit actually inhabited them volume  amp  issue needed   One result is that no one who wears the rings other than the Mandarin himself can command them without his permission  The Mandarin can now command the rings even when they are separated from him by vast distances  He can mentally monitor events taking place near a ring that has been separated from him  Continued exposure to the alien rings made his hands green and scaly  He can voluntarily give temporary control over a ring to his servants  however  If the servant dies or falls unconscious  the rings teleport back to the Mandarin  Conversely  if the Mandarin himself is knocked out  all the rings automatically return to him  On one occasion volume  amp  issue needed   this left the Mandarin s servants powerless to stop some of Tony Stark s employees  that the Mandarin had kidnapped  from escaping  The Mandarin also briefly used a force field generator volume  amp  issue needed   but this is not part of his standard weaponry citation needed   He has also used a head band enabling him to transfer his mind into his rings or into another s body  and a teleportation device hidden on his person  both examples of Makluuan technology  The Mandarin is a brilliant and brutal tactician and a gifted strategist  He also abides by a very strict code of honor  When he attempted to stop Stark Enterprises from establishing itself in Hong Kong  the Mandarin challenged Iron Man to a duel  stating that if he won  he would take control of Stark Enterprises  Hong Kong operations  and that he would cease hindering Stark s activities if he lost  When Iron Man defeated him in fair combat  he lived up to his end of the agreement  On another occasion  he killed one of his minions for attempting to drug him during a practice session  angry that one of his students would use such dishonorable tactics   edit  Other versions  edit  Spider Ham In the Spider Ham universe  there is a version of the Mandarin who is a Ring tailed lemur named Mandaringtail  28   edit  Ultimate Marvel In the Ultimate Marvel Universe  the Ultimate Mandarin appears in a flashback in Ultimate Avengers vs  New Ultimates  with Tony Stark in an earlier Armor prototype attacking Mandarin  who is holding Rhodes captive  29   edit  In other media  edit  Television The Mandarin was a major foe of Iron Man in The Marvel Super Heroes  in which his voice was provided by Bernard Cowan  The Mandarin on the 1994 animated series  In the Iron Man series  the Mandarin is Arnold Brock  an archaeologist who falls into an ancient catacomb containing an alien starship  which belongs to this series  incarnation of Fin Fang Foom  with whom the Mandarin forged an uneasy alliance  while fleeing from desert bandits  In this catacomb  he finds a large gem that is the ship s power source with ten gems beneath it  Unfortunately  the bandits slay everyone else  including his fianc e Ilona  All the raiders leave behind are his fianc e s rings with the jewels plucked from them  The Mandarin uses these as the settings for the ten gems which he made into his rings  The Mandarin of this continuity was altered by the power of the ship s power source when he touched it  he developed pointy ears  claw like fingernails  and enhanced musculature  His skin turned emerald green  and he became very smart  The cartoon version of the Mandarin was served in his villainy by Justin Hammer as well as by several supervillains like Blizzard  Blacklash  Dreadknight  Hypnotia  Grey Gargoyle  Whirlwind  Living Laser  and MODOK  but following the cartoon s adaptation of the  Dragon Seed  storyline  the Mandarin s servants were captured and his rings scattered across the world  Eventually recovering all of his rings  appearing in a brief epilogue at the end of most episodes to do so  the Mandarin renewed his hostilities against Iron Man in an adaptation of  The Hands of the Mandarin   Prior to finding his last two rings  The Mandarin claims his 8th ring from MODOK in the episode  Empowered    Empowered  was the clip show of the season  the purpose being that the Mandarin wanted to learn of Iron Man s recent activities  In the final episode of the series  Iron Man manages to reflect the power of Mandarin s rings destroying them  and ultimately leaving the Mandarin amnesiac and helpless before a band of desert bandits  The cartoon s versions of the rings were much more ambiguous  with no particular power associated with any ring   most frequently  they were used to project force blasts  alter reality  and transmute objects  The eleventh episode of season two   Hulkbuster  would reveal the specific abilities of two of the rings  One allows for creating windows through time and space  while the other allows for traveling through the windows  They were both used by Leader in an attempt to travel back to the time that the Gamma Bomb that transformed Bruce Banner into the Hulk detonated  The Mandarin in Iron Man  Armored Adventures In Iron Man  Armored Adventures  the Mandarin  voiced by Vincent Tong  is fully armored  with a helmet that hides his identity  In this series  his rings are called the Makluan Rings  while the name  Mandarin  is a title used by any of several characters able to wield the power of the rings  The rings enable the wearer to materialize the signature armor of the Mandarin  levitate  and teleport  Five of his rings can each control a natural force  lightning  gravity  water  fire and wind   while one can emit acid  another can increase mental powers  and a third can command vortexes and grant the wearer super speed  The rings  powers can also be increased with every ring the wielder obtains  The original Mandarin  a man named Khan  hid the ten rings throughout the globe hundreds of years ago  He put at least four of the rings in hidden temples and designed tests to guard them to ensure that only the  worthy  possess  activated  rings  Primarily  the position of Mandarin is held by Khan s descendant Temugin  or   Gene Khan    Gene s stepfather  Shin Zhang  who is the head of a criminal organization called the Tong  also claims to be the  true Mandarin   occupying the role until Gene imprisons him and takes control of the Tong  Interestingly  however  it is in fact Tony Stark  as Iron Man  who passes two of the four tests  while Gene only passes the third and fourth tests  It is suggested that Khan wanted someone in his own family to wield the rings and become his successor  this idea is supported by the fact that Gene s late mother had possession of one of the rings  and that the rings appear to only work for members of Khan s family  Of the three people so far who have claimed the Title of Mandarin  there has been significant differences in their motives and personality  Zhang used the power to increase his criminal empire standing and was ruthless and cruel  Gene Khan  although similar in his methods wants to use the rings to bring the world to order  Although little is known about
