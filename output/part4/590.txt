Southern United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search The Southern United States as defined by the United States Census Bureau  1  See also the map of the Deep South  The Southern United States commonly referred to as the American South  Dixie  or simply the South  is an area in the southeastern and south central United States  The region is known for its distinct culture and history  having developed its own customs  musical styles and varied cuisines that have helped distinguish it from the rest of the United States  The South owes its unique heritage to a variety of sources  including Native Americans  early European settlements of Spanish  English  German  French  Scots Irish and Scottish 2  importation of hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans  historic dependence on slave labor  presence of a large proportion of African Americans in the population  and the aftermath of the Confederacy after the Civil War  Historically  the South has relied heavily on agriculture but has become more industrialized and urban in the last few decades of the 20th century  attracting national and international migrants  The American South is now among the fastest growing areas in the United States  Despite rapid economic growth  the South still has persistent poverty  and every Southern state with the exceptions of Maryland  Virginia and Florida has a higher poverty rate than the American average  3  Poverty is especially prevalent in rural areas  Sociological research has indicated that Southern collective identity stems from political  demographic and cultural distinctiveness  Studies have shown that Southerners are significantly more conservative than non Southerners in several areas  including religion  morality  international relations and race relations  4  5  This is especially evident during presidential elections and in religious attendance figures  4  5  In the 21st century  the South remains demographically distinct with higher percentages of blacks  Demographically  the South has lower percentages of high school graduates  lower housing values  lower household incomes and higher percentages of people in poverty  6  These factors  combined with the fact that Southerners continue to maintain strong loyalty to family ties  has led some sociologists to label white Southerners a  quasi ethnic regional group   7  In previous censuses  the largest ancestry group identified by Southerners was English or mostly English  8  9  10  with 19 618 370 self reporting  English  as an ancestry on the 1980 census  followed by 12 709 872 listing  Irish  and 11 054 127  Afro American   8  9  10  Almost a third of all Americans who claim English ancestry can be found in the American South  and over a quarter of all Southerners claim English descent as well  11  Apart from its climate  the living experience in the South increasingly resembles the rest of the nation  The arrival of millions of Northerners  especially in the suburbs and coastal areas  12  and millions of Hispanics 13  means the introduction of cultural values and social norms not rooted in Southern traditions  14  15  Observers conclude that collective identity and Southern distinctiveness are thus declining  particularly when defined against  an earlier South that was somehow more authentic  real  more unified and distinct   16  The process has worked both ways  however  with aspects of Southern culture spreading throughout a greater portion of the rest of the United States in a process termed  Southernization   17  Contents 1

define the subregions in the South has been the focus of research for nearly a century  18  19  As defined by the United States Census Bureau  1  the Southern region of the United States includes sixteen states  As of 2010  an estimated 114 555 744 people  or thirty seven percent of all U S  residents  lived in the South  the nation s most populous region  20  The Census Bureau defined three smaller units  or divisions  The South Atlantic States  Florida  Georgia  Maryland  North Carolina  South Carolina  Virginia  West Virginia  and Delaware The East South Central States  Alabama  Kentucky  Mississippi and Tennessee The West South Central States  Arkansas  Louisiana  Oklahoma  and Texas Other terms related to the South include  The Old South  can mean either the slave states that existed in 1776  Virginia  Delaware  Maryland  Georgia  North Carolina  and South Carolina   21  or all the slave states before 1860  which included the newer states of Kentucky  Tennessee  Alabama  Florida  Mississippi  Missouri  Arkansas  Louisiana  and Texas    22  The New South  usually including the South Atlantic States  23  The Solid South  region controlled by the Democratic Party from 1877 to 1964  Includes at least all the 11 former Confederate States  24  Southern Appalachia  mainly refers to areas situated in the Southern Appalachian Mountains  namely Eastern Kentucky  East Tennessee  Western North Carolina  Western Maryland  West Virginia  Southwest Virginia  North Georgia  and Northwestern South Carolina  25  Southeastern United States  usually including the Carolinas  Virginia  Tennessee  Kentucky  West Virginia  Georgia  Alabama  Mississippi  Florida and at times Maryland 26  The Deep South  various definitions  usually including Louisiana  Alabama  Mississippi  Georgia  and South Carolina  Occasionally  parts of adjoining states are included  sections of East Texas  delta areas of Arkansas and Tennessee  and parts of Florida such as the Panhandle and the north central part of the state   27  The Gulf South  various definitions  usually including Gulf coasts of Florida  Louisiana  Mississippi  Texas and Alabama  The Upper South  Kentucky  Virginia  West Virginia  Maryland  Tennessee  and North Carolina  28  Dixie  various definitions  but most commonly associated with the 11 states of the Old Confederacy  The Mid South  Various definitions  including that of the Census Bureau of the East and West South Central United States  29  in another informal definition  Tennessee  Arkansas  Mississippi  and sometimes adjoining areas of other states  30  31  32  33  Border South  Missouri  Kentucky  Maryland  and Delaware were states on the outer rim of the Confederacy that did not secede from the United States  but did have significant numbers of residents who joined the Confederate armed forces  Kentucky and Missouri had Confederate governments in exile and were represented in the Confederate Congress and by the Confederate battle flag  West Virginia formed in 1863 after the western region broke away from Virginia  though support for the Confederacy and the Union in the new state was about evenly divided  34  The popular definition of the  South  is more informal and generally associated with the eleven states that seceded during the Civil War to form the Confederate States of America  Those states share commonalities of history and culture that carry on to the present day  Oklahoma is often included  it was not a state  but all its major Indian tribes signed formal treaties of alliance with the Confederacy  The South is a diverse meteorological region with numerous climatic zones  including temperate  sub tropical  tropical  and arid  though the South is generally regarded as hot and humid  with long summers and short  mild winters  Most of the south   except for the higher elevations and areas near the western  southern and some northern fringes   fall in the humid subtropical climate zone  Crops grow easily in the South  its climate consistently provides growing seasons of at least six months before the first frost  Landscapes  particularly in the Southeast  are characterized by live oaks  magnolia trees  yellow jessamine vines  Spanish moss  cabbage palms and flowering dogwoods  Another common environment is found in the bayous and swamplands of the Gulf Coast  especially in Louisiana and Texas  Parts of the rural South have been overrun by Kudzu  an invasive  fast growing  leafy vine that can spread over trees  land  roads  and buildings  choking and killing indigenous plants  Kudzu is a particularly big problem in the Piedmont regions of South Carolina  Mississippi  Alabama  and Georgia  35   edit  History Main article  History of the Southern United States  edit  Native American culture The first well dated evidence of human occupation in the south United States occurs around 9500 BC with the appearance of the earliest documented Americans  who are now referred to as Paleo Indians  36  Paleoindians were hunter gathers that roamed in bands and frequently hunted megafauna  Several cultural stages  such as Archaic  ca  8000  1000 BC  and the Woodland  ca  1000 BC AD 1000   preceded what the Europeans found at the end of the 15th century   the Mississippian culture  36  The Mississippian culture was a complex  mound building Native American culture that flourished in what is now the southeastern United States from approximately 800 AD to 1500 AD  Natives had elaborate and lengthy trading routes connecting their main residential and ceremonial centers extending through the river valleys and from the East Coast to the Great Lakes  36  Some noted explorers who encountered and described the Mississippian culture  by then in decline  included P nfilo de Narv ez  1528   Hernando de Soto  1540   and Pierre Le Moyne d Iberville  1699   Native American descendants of the mound builders include Alabama  Apalachee  Caddo  Cherokee  Chickasaw  Choctaw  Creek  Guale  Hitchiti  Houma  and Seminole peoples  all of whom still reside in the South  Other peoples whose ancestral links to the Mississippian culture are less clear but were clearly in the region before the European incursion include the Catawba and the Powhatan   edit  European colonization European immigration resulted in a corresponding die off of native Americans who had not been exposed to various diseases  37  The predominant culture of the South was rooted in the settlement of the region by British colonists  In the 17th century  most voluntary immigrants were of English origins who settled chiefly along the coastal regions of the Eastern seaboard but had pushed as far inland as the Appalachian mountains by the 18th century  The majority of early British settlers were indentured servants  who gained freedom after enough work to pay off their passage  The wealthier men who paid their way received land grants known as headrights  to encourage settlement  38  The Spanish and French established colonies in Florida  Texas  and Louisiana  The Spanish colonized Florida in the 16th century  with their communities reaching a peak in the late 17th century  In the British colonies  immigration began in 1607 and continued until the outbreak of the Revolution in 1775  Settlers cleared land  built houses and outbuildings  and on their own farms  The rich owned large plantations that dominated export agriculture and used black slaves  Many were involved in the labor intensive cultivation of tobacco  the first cash crop of Virginia  Tobacco exhausted the soil quickly  requiring new fields to be cleared on a regular basis  Old fields were used as pasture and for crops such as corn and wheat  or allowed to grow into woodlots  39  In the mid to late 18th century  large groups of Ulster Scots  later called the Scotch Irish  and people from the Anglo Scottish border region immigrated and settled in the back country of Appalachia and the Piedmont  They were the largest group of non English immigrants from the British Isles before the American Revolution  40  In the 1980 Census  34  of Southerners reported that they were of English ancestry  English was the largest reported European ancestry in every Southern state by a large margin  8  The early colonists  engaged in warfare  trade  and cultural exchanges  Those living in the backcountry were more likely to encounter Creek Indians  Cherokee  and Choctaws and other regional native groups  The oldest university in the South  The College of William  amp  Mary  was founded in 1693 in Virginia  it pioneered in the teaching of political economy and educated future U S  Presidents Jefferson  Monroe and Tyler  all from Virginia  Indeed  the entire region dominated politics in the First Party System era  for example  four of the first five Presidents  Washington  Jefferson  Madison  and Monroe   were from Virginia  The two oldest public universities are also in the South  the University of North Carolina  1789  and the University of Georgia  1785    edit  American Revolution Main article  Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War With Virginia in the lead  the Southern colonies embraced the American Revolution  providing such leaders as commander in chief George Washington  and the author of the Declaration of Independence  Thomas Jefferson  In 1780 81  the British largely gave up reconquest of the northern states  and concentrated on the south  where they were told there was a large Loyalist population ready to leap to arms once the royal forces arrived  The British took control of Savannah and Charleston  capturing a large American army in the process  and set up a network of bases inland  Many Loyalist did join the British  often switching sides once or twice  but not nearly enough to overcome the Americans  Led by Nathaniel Greene and other generals  the Americans engaged in Fabian tactics designed to wear down the British invasion force  and to neutralize its strong points one by one  There were numerous battles large and small  with each side claiming some victories  By 1781  however  British General Cornwallis realized his mission was hopeless  so he moved north to Virginia to await rescue by the British Navy  The British Navy did arrive  but so it too did a stronger French fleet  and Cornwallis was trapped  American and French armies  led by Washington  forced Cornwallis to surrender his entire army in Yorktown  Virginia in October 1781  effectively winning the war  41  The Revolution provided a shock to slavery in the South  Thousands of slaves took advantage of wartime disruption to find their own freedom  catalyzed by the British governor Dunmore of Virginia s promise of freedom for service  Many others were removed by Loyalist owners and became slaves elsewhere in the Empire  There was sharp decline between 1770 and 1790 the percentage of blacks from 61  percent to 44  in South Carolina and from 45  to 36  in Georgia  42  In addition  some slaveholders were inspired to free their slaves after the Revolution  They were moved by the principles of the Revolution  and Quaker and Methodist preachers worked to encourage slaveholders to free their slaves  Planters often freed slaves by their wills  as did George Washington  In the upper South  more than 10 percent of all blacks were free by 1810  a significant expansion from pre war proportions of less than 1 percent free  43   edit  Antebellum years Slaves on a South Carolina plantation  The Old Plantation  c  1790  Cotton became dominant in the lower South after 1800  After the invention of the cotton gin  short staple cotton could be grown more widely  This led to an explosion of cotton cultivation  especially in the frontier uplands of Georgia  Alabama and other parts of the Deep South  as well as riverfront areas of the Mississippi Delta  Migrants poured into those areas in the early decades of the 19th century  when county population figures rose and fell as swells of people kept moving west  The expansion of cotton cultivation required more slave labor  and the institution became even more deeply an integral part of the South s economy  44  With the opening up of frontier lands after the government forced most Native Americans to move west of the Mississippi  there was a major migration of both whites and blacks to those territories  From the 1820s through the 1850s  more than one million enslaved African Americans were transported to the Deep South in forced migration  two thirds of them by slave traders and the others by masters who moved there  Planters in the Upper South sold slaves excess to their needs as they shifted from tobacco to mixed agriculture  Many enslaved families were broken up  as planters preferred mostly strong males for field work  45  Two major political issues that festered in the first half of the 19th century caused political alignment along sectional lines  strengthened the identities of North and South as distinct regions with certain strongly opposed interests  and fed the arguments over states  rights that culminated in secession and the Civil War  One of these issues concerned the protective tariffs enacted to assist the growth of the manufacturing sector  primarily in the North  In 1832  in resistance to federal legislation increasing tariffs  South Carolina passed an ordinance of nullification  a procedure in which a state would in effect repeal a Federal law  Soon a naval flotilla was sent to Charleston harbor  and the threat of landing ground troops was used to compel the collection of tariffs  A compromise was reached by which the tariffs would be gradually reduced  but the underlying argument over states  rights continued to escalate in the following decades  The second issue concerned slavery  primarily the question of whether slavery would be permitted in newly admitted states  The issue was initially finessed by political compromises designed to balance the number of  free  and  slave  states  The issue resurfaced in more virulent form  however  around the time of the Mexican American War  which raised the stakes by adding new territories primarily on the Southern side of the imaginary geographic divide  Congress opposed allowing slavery in these territories  Before the Civil War  the number of immigrants arriving at Southern ports began to increase  although the North continued to receive the most immigrants  Hugenots were among the first settlers in Charleston  along with the largest number of Hasidic Jews outside of New York City  citation needed  Numerous Irish immigrants settled in New Orleans  establishing a distinct ethnic enclave now known as the Irish Channel  Germans also went to New Orleans and its environs  resulting in a large area north of the city  along the Mississippi  becoming known as the German Coast  however  still greater numbers immigrated to Texas  especially after 1848   where many bought land and were farmers  Many more German immigrants arrived in Texas after the Civil War  where they created the brewing industry in Houston and elsewhere  became grocers in numerous cities  and also established wide areas of farming   edit  Presidential history The South produced nine of the first 12 U S  Presidents prior to the Civil War  For more than a century after the Civil War  no Southerner became President unless he either moved North  like Woodrow Wilson  or was vice president when their president died in office  like Vice Presidents Andrew Johnson  Harry Truman and Lyndon B  Johnson   In 1976  Jimmy Carter defied this trend and became the first Southerner to break the pattern since Zachary Taylor in 1848  The South produced five of the last eight American Presidents  Lyndon B  Johnson  1963 69   Jimmy Carter  1977 81   George H  W  Bush  1989 93   Bill Clinton  1993 2001  and George W  Bush  2001 2009   Carter was from Georgia  Clinton from Arkansas  while George H W  and George W  Bush were from Texas  although born in New England   edit  Civil War Historic Southern United States  The states in red were in the Confederacy and have historically been regarded as forming  the South   Those in stripes were considered  border states   and gave varying degrees of support to the Southern cause although they remained in the Union   This image depicts the original  trans Allegheny borders of Virginia  and so does not show West Virginia separately  See the images above for post 1863 Virginia and West Virginia borders   Although Oklahoma was aligned with the Confederacy  it is not shaded because at the time the region was Indian Territory  not a state  By 1856  the South had lost control of Congress  and was no longer able to silence calls for an end to slavery which came mostly from the more populated  free states of the North  The Republican Party  founded in 1854  pledged to stop the spread of slavery beyond those states where it already existed  After Abraham Lincoln was elected the first Republican president in 1860  seven cotton states declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America before Lincoln was inaugurated  The United States government  both outgoing and incoming  refused to recognize the Confederacy  and when the new Confederate President Jefferson Davis ordered his troops to open fire on Fort Sumter in April 1861  there was an overwhelming demand  North and South  for war  Only the state of Kentucky attempted to remain neutral  and it could only do so briefly  When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion  four more states decided to secede and join the Confederacy  which then moved its capital to Richmond  Virginia   Although the Confederacy had large supplies of captured munitions and many volunteers  it was slower than the Union in dealing with the border states  By March 1862  the Union largely controlled Maryland  West Virginia  Kentucky and Missouri  had shut down all commercial traffic from all Confederate ports  had prevented European recognition of the Confederate government  and was poised to seize New Orleans  Confederate dead of General Ewell s Corps who attacked the Union lines at the Battle of Spotsylvania  May 19  1864  In the four years of war 1861 65 the South was the primary battleground  with all but two of the major battles taking place on Southern soil  Union forces relentlessly squeezed the Confederacy  capturing the border states in 1861  the Tennessee River  the Cumberland River and New Orleans in 1862  and the Mississippi River in 1863  In the East  however  the rebel army under Robert E  Lee beat off attack after attack in its defense of their capital at Richmond  But when Lee tried to move north  he was repulsed  and nearly captured  at Antietam  1862  and Gettysburg  1863   The Confederacy had the resources for a short war  but was unable to finance or supply a longer war  It reversed the traditional low tariff policy of the South by imposing a new 15  tax on all imports from the North  The Union blockade stopped most commerce from entering the South  and smugglers avoided the tax  so the Confederate tariff produced too little revenue to finance the war  Inflated currency was the solution  but that created distrust of the Richmond government  Because of low investment in railroads  the Southern transportation system depended primarily on river and coastal traffic by boat  both were shut down by the Union Navy  The small railroad system virtually collapsed  so that by 1864 internal travel was so difficult that the Confederate economy was crippled  The Confederate cause was hopeless by the time Atlanta fell and William T  Sherman marched through Georgia in late 1864  but the rebels fought on  refusing to give up their independence until Lee s army was captured in April 1865  All the Confederate forces surrendered  and there was no insurgency as the region moved into the Reconstruction Era  The South suffered much more than the North overall  as the Union strategy of attrition warfare meant that Lee could not replace his casualties  and the total war waged by Sherman  Sheridan and other Union armies devastated the infrastructure and caused widespread poverty and distress  The Confederacy suffered military losses of 95 000 men killed in action and 165 000 who died of disease  for a total of 260 000  46  out of a total white Southern population at the time of around 5 5 million  47  Based on 1860 census figures  8  of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war  including 6  in the North and about 18  in the South  48  Northern military casualties exceeded Southern casualties in absolute numbers  but were two thirds smaller in terms of proportion of the population affected   edit  Reconstruction and Jim Crow Main articles  Reconstruction era of the United States  Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era  United States   and Voting rights in the United States After the Civil War  the South was devastated in terms of population  infrastructure and economy  Because of states  reluctance to grant voting rights to freedmen  Congress instituted Reconstruction governments  It established military districts and governors to rule over the South until new governments could be established  Many white Southerners who had actively supported the Confederacy were temporarily disfranchised  Rebuilding was difficult as people grappled with the effects of a new labor economy of a free market in the midst of a widespread agricultural depression  In addition  what limited infrastructure the South had was mostly destroyed by the war  At the same time  the North was rapidly industrializing  To avoid the social effects of the war  most of the Southern states initially passed black codes  Eventually  these were mostly legally nullified by federal law and anti Confederate legistures  which persisted for a short time during Reconstruction  49  A Home on the Mississippi  Currier and Ives  1871 There were thousands of people on the move  as African Americans tried to reunite families separated by slaves sales  and sometimes migrated for better opportunities in towns or other states  Other freedpeople moved from plantation areas to cities or towns for a chance to get different jobs and out from under white control  At the same time  whites returned from refuges to reclaim plantations or town dwellings  In some areas  many whites returned to the land to farm for a while  Some freedpeople left the South altogether for states such as Ohio and Indiana  and later  Kansas  Thousands of others joined the migration to new opportunities in the Mississippi and Arkansas Delta bottomlands and Texas  With passage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States  which outlawed slavery   the 14th Amendment  which granted full U S  citizenship to African Americans  and the 15th amendment  which extended the right to vote to African American males   African Americans in the South were made free citizens and were given the right to vote  Under Federal protection  white and black Republicans formed constitutional conventions and state governments  Among their accomplishments was creating the first public education systems in Southern states  and providing for welfare through orphanages  hospitals and similar institutions  Northerners came south to participate in politics and business  Some were representatives of the Freedmen s Bureau and other agencies of Reconstruction  some were humanitarians with the intent to help black people  Also  as is often the case in volatile environments  some were adventurers who hoped to benefit themselves by questionable methods  They were all condemned with the pejorative term of carpetbagger  Some Southerners also took advantage of the disrupted environment and made money off various schemes  including bonds and financing for railroads  50  Secret vigilante organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan an organization sworn to perpetuate white supremacy had arisen quickly after the war s end and used lynching  physical attacks  house burnings and other forms of intimidation to keep African Americans from exercising their political rights  Although the first Klan was disrupted by prosecution by the Federal government in the early 1870s  other groups persisted  By the mid to late 1870s  elite white Southerners created increasing resistance to the altered social structure  Paramilitary organizations such as the White League in Louisiana  1874   the Red Shirts in Mississippi  1875  and rifle clubs  all  White Line  organizations  used organized violence against Republicans  blacks and whites  to turn Republicans out of office  repress and bar black voting  and restore Democrats to power  51  In 1876 white Democrats regained power in most of the state legislatures  They began to pass laws designed to strip African Americans and poor whites from the voter registration rolls  The success of late 19th century interracial coalitions in several states inspired a reaction among some white Democrats  who worked harder to prevent both groups from voting  52  Despite discrimination  many blacks became property owners in areas that were still developing  For instance  90  of the Mississippi s bottomlands were still frontier and undeveloped after the war  By the end of the century  two thirds of the farmers in Mississippi s Delta bottomlands were black  They had cleared the land themselves and often made money in early years by selling off timber  Tens of thousands of migrants went to the Delta  both to work as laborers to clear timber for lumber companies  and many to develop their own farms  53  Child laborers  Bluffton  South Carolina  1913 Nearly all Southerners  black and white  suffered as a result of the Civil War  Within a few years cotton production and harvest was back to pre war levels  but low prices through much of the 19th century hampered recovery  They encouraged immigration by Chinese and Italian laborers into the Mississippi Delta  While the first Chinese entered as indentured laborers from Cuba  the majority came in the early 20th century  Neither group stayed long at rural farm labor  54  The Chinese became merchants and established stores in small towns throughout the Delta  establishing a place between white and black  55  Migrations continued in the late 19th and early 20th centuries among both blacks and whites  In the last two decades oth the 19th century about 141 000 blacks left the South  and more after 1900  totaling a loss of 537 000  After that the movement increased in what became known as the Great Migration from 1910 1940  and the Second Great Migration through 1970  Even more whites left the South  some going to California for opportunities and others heading to Northern industrial cities after 1900  Between 1880 and 1910  the loss of whites totaled 1 243 000  56  Five million more left between 1940 and 1970  From 1890 to 1908  10 of the 11 states passed disfranchising constitutions or amendments which had provisions for voter registration  such as poll taxes  residency requirements and literacy tests  which were hard for many poor to meet  Most African Americans  Mexican Americans and tens of thousands of poor whites were disfranchised  losing the vote for decades  In some states grandfather clauses were temporarily used to exempt white illiterates from literacy tests  The numbers of voters dropped drastically throughout the South as a result  This can be seen on the feature  Turnout in Presidential and Midterm Elections  at the University of Texas Politics  Barriers to Voting  Alabama  which had established universal white suffrage in 1819 when it became a state  also substantially reduced voting by poor whites  57  58  Legislatures passed Jim Crow laws to segregate public facilities and services  including transportation  While African Americans  poor whites and civil rights groups started litigation against such provisions in the early 20th century  for decades Supreme Court decisions overturning such provisions were rapidly followed by new state laws with new devices to restrict voting  Most blacks in the South could not vote until 1965  after passage of the Voting Rights Act and Federal enforcement to ensure people could register  Not until the late 1960s did all American citizens regain protected civil rights by passage of legislation following the leadership of the American Civil Rights Movement   edit  Late 19th and 20th century industrialization and Great Migration Main article  Great Migration  African American  At the end of the 19th century  white Democrats in the South had created state constitutions that were hostile to industry and business development  Banking was limited  as was access to credit  States persisted in agricultural economies  citation needed  As in Alabama  rural minorities held control in many state legislatures long after population had shifted to industrializing cities  and the legislators resisted business and modernizing interests  For instance  Alabama refused to redistrict from 1901 to 1972  long after major population and economic shifts to cities  For decades Birmingham generated the majority of revenue for the state  for instance  but received little back in services or infrastructure  59  An illustrated depiction of black people picking cotton  1913 In the late 19th century  Texas rapidly expanded its railroad network  creating a network of cities connected on a radial plan and linked to the port of Galveston  It was the first state in which urban and economic development proceeded independently of rivers  the primary transportation network of the past  A reflection of increasing industry were strikes and labor unrest   in 1885 Texas ranked ninth among forty states in number of workers involved in strikes  4 000   for the six year period it ranked fifteenth  Seventy five of the 100 strikes  chiefly interstate strikes of telegraphers and railway workers  occurred in the year 1886   60  In 1890 Dallas was the largest city in Texas  By 1900 it had a population of more than 42 000  which more than doubled to over 92 000 a decade later  Dallas was the harnessmaking capital of the world and center of other manufacturing  As an example of its ambitions  in 1907 Dallas built the Praetorian Building  15 stories tall and the first skyscraper west of the Mississippi  Others soon followed  61  Texas was transformed by a railroad network linking five important cities  among them Houston with its nearby port at Galveston  Dallas  Fort Worth  San Antonio  and El Paso  Each exceeded 50 000 in population by 1920  with the major cities having three times that population  62  Business interests were ignored by the Bourbon class  Nonetheless  major new industries started developing in cities such as Atlanta  GA  Birmingham  AL  and Dallas  Fort Worth and Houston  Texas  Growth began occurring at a geometric rate  Birmingham became a major steel producer and mining town  with major population growth in the early decades of the 20th century  The first major oil well in the South was drilled at Spindletop near Beaumont  Texas  on the morning of January 10  1901  Other oil fields were later discovered nearby in Arkansas  Oklahoma  and under the Gulf of Mexico  The resulting  Oil Boom  permanently transformed the economy of the West South Central states and led to the most significant economic expansion after the Civil War  In the early 20th century  invasion of the boll weevil devastated cotton crops in states of the South  This was an additional catalyst to African Americans  decisions to leave the South  From 1910 to 1940  and then from the 1940s to 1970  more than 6 5 million African Americans left the South in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern cities  making multiple acts of resistance against persistent lynching and violence  segregation  poor education  and inability to vote  Their movements transformed many cities  creating new cultures and music in the North  Many African Americans  like other groups  became industrial workers  others started their own businesses within the communities  Southern whites also migrated to industrial cities  especially Chicago and Detroit  where they took jobs in the booming new auto industry  Photo of sharecropper family in Walker County  Alabama  ca  1937 Later  the Southern economy was dealt additional blows by the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl  After the Wall Street Crash of 1929  the economy suffered significant reversals and millions were left unemployed  Beginning in 1934 and lasting until 1939  an ecological disaster of severe wind and drought caused an exodus from Texas and Arkansas  the Oklahoma Panhandle region and the surrounding plains  in which over 500 000 Americans were homeless  hungry and jobless  63  Thousands left the region forever to seek economic opportunities along the West Coast  President Franklin D  Roosevelt noted the South as the  number one priority  in terms of need of assistance during the Great Depression  His administration created programs such as the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933 to provide rural electrification and stimulate development  Locked into low productivity agriculture  the region s growth was slowed by limited industrial development  low levels of entrepreneurship  and the lack of capital investment  World War II marked a time of change in the South as new industries and military bases were developed by the Federal government  providing badly needed capital and infrastructure in many regions  People from all parts of the US came to the South for military training and work in the region s many bases and new industries  Farming shifted from cotton and tobacco to include soybeans  corn  and other foods  This growth increased in the 1960s and greatly accelerated into the 1980s and 1990s  Large urban areas with over 4 million people rose in Texas  Georgia  and Florida  Rapid expansion in industries such as autos  telecommunications  textiles  technology  banking  and aviation gave some states in the South an industrial strength to rival large states elsewhere in the country  By the 2000 census  The South  along with the West  was leading the nation in population growth  However  with this growth has come long commute times and serious air pollution problems in cities such as Dallas  Houston  Atlanta  Miami  Austin  Charlotte  and others which have relied on sprawling development and highway networks   edit  Growth and poverty In the antebellum years  by 1840 New Orleans was the wealthiest city in the country and the third largest in population  based on the growth of international trade associated with products being shipped to and from the interior of the country down the Mississippi River  It had the largest slave market in the country  as traders brought slaves to New Orleans by ship and overland to sell to planters across the Deep South  The city was a cosmopolitan port with a variety of jobs that attracted more immigrants than did other areas of the South  64  Because of lack of investment  construction of railroads to span the region lagged behind that in the North  People relied most heavily on river traffic for getting their crops to market and for transportation  In Mississippi before the war  for instance  most plantations were developed along the Mississippi and other navigable rivers  The bottomlands were not developed until after the war  when the chance to buy land attracted tens of thousands of migrants  both black and white  By the end of the century  two thirds of farm owners in the Delta bottomlands were black  The long agricultural depression meant that many had to take on too much debt together with disfranchisement and lack of access to credit  by 1910 many had lost their property and by 1920  most blacks in the Delta were sharecroppers or landless workers  More than two generations of free African Americans had lost their stake in property  65   edit  Economy In the late 20th century  the South changed dramatically  It saw a boom in its service economy  manufacturing base  high technology industries  and the financial sector  Tourism in Florida and along the Gulf Coast grew steadily throughout the last decades of the 20th century  Numerous new automobile production plants have opened in the region  or are soon to open  such as Mercedes Benz in Tuscaloosa  Alabama  Hyundai in Montgomery  Alabama  the BMW production plant in Spartanburg  South Carolina  Toyota plants in Georgetown  Kentucky  Blue Springs  Mississippi and San Antonio  the GM manufacturing plant in Spring Hill  Tennessee  the Nissan North American headquarters in Franklin  Tennessee  and the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant  The two largest research parks in the country are located in the South  Research Triangle Park in North Carolina  the world s largest  and the Cummings Research Park in Huntsville  Alabama  the world s fourth largest   Many major banking corporations have headquarters in the region  Charlotte is home to Bank of America  and was also home to Wachovia before its purchase by Wells Fargo  Birmingham boasts Regions Financial Corporation  AmSouth Bancorporation  and BBVA Compass  Atlanta is home to SunTrust Banks and the district headquarters of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta  and BB amp T is headquartered in Winston Salem  Atlanta and its surrounding area are also home to many major corporations outside the banking sector  such as The Coca Cola Company and The Home Depot  and also to many cable television networks  such as CNN  TBS  TNT  Turner South  Cartoon Network  and The Weather Channel  This economic expansion has enabled parts of the South to report some of the lowest unemployment rates in the United States  66  But in the U S  top ten of poorest big cities  the South is represented in the rankings by two cities  Miami  Florida and Memphis  Tennessee  67  In 2011  nine out of ten poorest states were in the South  68   edit  Education Southern public schools have consistently ranked in the bottom of many national surveys and average test score rankings before allowances for race are made  69  When allowance for race is considered  a 2007 US Government list of test scores often shows white fourth and eighth graders performing better than average for reading and math  while black fourth and eighth graders also performed better than average  70  This comparison does not hold across the board  Mississippi scores lower than average no matter how the statistics are compared   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of the Southern United States Street musicians in Maynardville  Tennessee  photographed in 1935 The predominant culture of the South has its origins with the settlement of the region by large groups of Northern English  Scots lowlanders and Ulster Scots  later called the Scotch Irish  who settled in Appalachia and the Piedmont in the 18th century  and from parts of southern England such as East Anglia  Kent and the West Country in the 17th century  71  and the many African slaves who were part of the Southern economy  African American descendants of the slaves brought into the South comprise the United States  second largest racial minority  accounting for 12 1 percent of the total population according to the 2000 census  Despite Jim Crow era outflow to the North  the majority of the black population remains concentrated in the Southern states  and has heavily contributed to the cultural blend  the charismatic brand of Christianity  foods  art  music  see spiritual  blues  jazz and rock and roll  that characterize Southern culture today  The South has been seen largely as a stronghold of Protestant Christianity  Although the traditional Southerner was Anglican  or more accurately Episcopalian  the predominant denominations in the South are now Baptists  especially the Southern Baptist Convention   followed by Methodists  with other denominations found throughout the region  Roman Catholics historically were concentrated in Louisiana and Hispanic areas such as South Texas and South Florida and along the Gulf Coast  The great majority of black Southerners are Baptist or Methodist  72   edit  Health Eight Southern states have obesity rates over 30  of the population  the highest in the country  Mississippi  Alabama  Arkansas  Kentucky  Louisiana  Oklahoma  Tennessee  and West Virginia  Rates for hypertension and diabetes for these states are also the highest in the nation  73  A study reported that six Southern states have the worse incidence of sleep disturbances in the nation  attributing the disturbances to high rates of obesity and smoking  74  The South also has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country  with states like Arkansas  Mississippi  and Texas having rates exceeding 60 per 1 000 teens  75   edit  Recent politics Main article  Politics of the Southern United States A rally against school integration in 1959  In the first decades after Reconstruction  when white Democrats regained power in the state legislatures  they began to make voter registration more complicated  to reduce black voting  With a combination of intimidation  fraud and violence by paramilitary groups  they turned Republicans out of office and suppressed black voting  From 1890 to 1908  ten of eleven states ratified new constitutions or amendments that effectively disfranchised most black voters and many poor white voters  This disfranchisement persisted for six decades into the 20th century  depriving blacks and poor whites of all political representation  Because they could not vote  they could not sit on juries  They had no one to represent their interests  resulting in state legislatures consistently underfunding programs and services  such as schools  for blacks and poor whites  76  As the Supreme Court began to find such disfranchisement provisions unconstitutional  Southern legislatures quickly passed other measures to keep blacks disfranchised  even after suffrage was extended more widely to poor whites  Because white Democrats controlled all the seats apportioned to their states  they had outsize power in Congress and filibustered or defeated efforts by others to pass legislation against lynching  for example  The region became known as the Solid South  The Republicans controlled parts of the Appalachian Mountains and competed for power in the Border States  From the late 1870s to the 1960s  it was rare for a state or national Southern politician to be Republican  77  Civil Rights activists after being beaten by a mob in Montgomery  Alabama  1961 Increasing support for civil rights legislation by the national Democratic Party beginning in 1948 caused segregationist Southern Democrats to nominate J  Strom Thurmond on a third party  Dixiecrat  ticket in 1948  These Dixicrats returned to the party by 1950  but Southern Democrats held off Republican inroads in the suburbs by arguing that only they could defend the region from the onslaught of northern liberals and the civil rights movement  In response to the Brown v  Board of Education ruling of 1954  101 Southern congressmen  19 senators  82 House members of which 99 were Southern Democrats and 2 were Republicans  in 1956 denounced the Brown decisions as a  clear abuse of judicial power  that  climaxes a trend in the federal judiciary undertaking to legislate in derogation of the authority of Congress and to encroach upon the reserved rights of the states and the people   The manifesto lauded  those states which have declared the intention to resist enforced integration by any lawful means   It was signed by all Southern senators except Majority Leader Lyndon B  Johnson  and Tennessee senators Albert Gore  Sr  and Estes Kefauver  Virginia closed schools in Warren County  Prince Edward County  Charlottesville  and Norfolk rather than integrate  but no other state followed suit  Democratic governors Orval Faubus of Arkansas  Ross Barnett of Mississippi  Lester Maddox of Georgia  and  especially  George Wallace of Alabama resisted integration and appealed to a rural and blue collar electorate  78  President Johnson signs the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964  The northern Democrats  support of civil rights issues culminated when Democratic President Lyndon B  Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which ended legal segregation and provided federal enforcement of voting rights for blacks  In the presidential election of 1964  Barry Goldwater s only electoral victories outside his home state of Arizona were in the states of the Deep South where few blacks could vote before the 1965 Voting Rights Act  79  Pockets of resistance to integration in public places broke out in violence during the 1960s by the shadowy Ku Klux Klan  which caused a backlash among moderates  80  Major resistance to school busing extending into the 1970s  81  National Republicans such as Richard Nixon began to develop their Southern strategy to attract conservative white Southerners  especially the middle class and suburban voters  in addition to traditional GOP pockets  such as Appalachia  and migrants from the North  The transition to a Republican stronghold in the South took decades  First  the states started voting Republican in presidential elections  except for native sons Jimmy Carter in 1976  Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996  Then the states began electing Republican senators and finally governors  Georgia was the last state to do so  with Sonny Perdue taking the governorship in 2002  82  In addition to its middle class and business base  Republicans cultivated the religious right and attracted strong majorities from the evangelical or Fundamentalist vote  mostly Southern Baptists  which had not been a distinct political force prior to 1980  83   edit  Other politicians and political movements The South has produced various nationally known politicians and political movements  Obama supporters at a campaign rally in Austin  Texas  on February 23  2007  In 1948  a group of Democratic congressmen  led by Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina  split from the Democrats in reaction to an anti segregation speech given by Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota  They founded the States Rights Democratic or Dixiecrat Party  During that year s Presidential election  the party ran Thurmond as its candidate  but he was unsuccessful  citation needed  In the 1968 Presidential election  Alabama Governor George C  Wallace ran for President on the American Independent Party ticket  Wallace ran a  law and order  campaign similar to that of Republican candidate  Richard Nixon  Nixon s Southern Strategy of gaining electoral votes downplayed race issues and focused on culturally conservative values  such as family issues  patriotism  and cultural issues that appealed to Southern Baptists  In 1994  another Southern politician  Newt Gingrich  ushered in 12 years of GOP control of the House  citation needed  Gingrich became Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in 1995 and served until his resignation in 1999  Tom DeLay was the most powerful Republican leader in Congress citation needed  until he was indicted under criminal charges in 2005 and was forced to step aside by Republican rules  citation needed  Apart from Bob Dole of Kansas  1985 96   the recent Republican Senate leaders have been Southerners  Howard Baker  1981 85  of Tennessee  Trent Lott  1996 2003  of Mississippi  Bill Frist  2003 2006  of Tennessee  and Mitch McConnell  2007 present  of Kentucky  The Republicans candidates for President have won the South in elections since 1972  except for 1976  However  the region is not entirely monolithic  and every successful Democratic candidate since 1976 has claimed at least three Southern states   edit  Race relations Main article  Racism in the United States  edit  Native Americans Native Americans had lived in the south for nearly 12 000 years  They were defeated by settlers in a series of wars ending in the War of 1812 and the Seminole Wars  and most were removed west to Indian Territory  now Oklahoma and Kansas   However large numbers of Native Americans managed to stay behind by blending into the surrounding society  This was especially true of the wives of Euro American merchants and miners   edit  Civil rights Racial segregation was commonplace in the South until the 1960s The South witnessed two major events in the lives of 20th century African Americans  the Great Migration and the American Civil Rights Movement  The Great Migration began during World War I  hitting its high point during World War II  During this migration  blacks left the South to find work in Northern factories and other sectors of the economy  84  The migration also empowered the growing Civil Rights Movement  While the movement existed in all parts of the United States  its focus was against disfranchisement and the Jim Crow laws in the South  Most of the major events in the movement occurred in the South  including the Montgomery Bus Boycott  the Mississippi Freedom Summer  the March on Selma  Alabama  and the assassination of Martin Luther King  Jr   In addition  some of the most important writings to come out of the movement were written in the South  such as King s  Letter from Birmingham Jail   Most of the civil rights landmarks can be found around the South  The Martin Luther King  Jr   National Historic Site in Atlanta includes a museum that chronicles the American Civil Rights Movement as well as Martin Luther King  Jr  s boyhood home on Auburn Avenue  Additionally  Ebenezer Baptist Church is located in the Sweet Auburn district as is the King Center  location of Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King s gravesites  As a result of the Civil Rights Movement  Jim Crow laws across the South were dropped  A second migration appears to be underway  with African Americans from the North moving to the South in record numbers  85  While race relations are still a contentious issue in the South  the region surpasses the rest of the country in many areas of integration and racial equality  According to 2003 report by researchers at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee  Virginia Beach  Charlotte  Nashville Davidson  and Jacksonville were the four most integrated of the nation s fifty largest cities  with Memphis at number six  86  Southern states tend to have a low disparity in incarceration rates between blacks and whites relative to the rest of the country  87   edit  Symbolism While this  Confederate Flag  pattern is the one most often thought of as the  Confederate Flag  today  it was actually just one of many used by the Confederate armed forces  This design served as the Battle Flag of the Army of Tennessee  and as the Confederate Naval Jack  Some Southerners use the Confederate flag to identify themselves with the South  states  rights and Southern tradition  Groups  such as the League of the South  promote secession from the United States  citing a desire to protect and defend Southern heritage  88  Other symbols of the Antebellum South include the Bonnie Blue Flag  magnolia trees  and the song  Dixie    edit  Major metropolitan areas The South was heavily rural as late as the 1940s  but now the population is increasingly concentrated in metropolitan areas  including central cities and their suburbs  Rank Metropolitan Statistical
