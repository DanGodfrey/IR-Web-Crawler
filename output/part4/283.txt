Ford F Series  A 1997 model F 150 is shown Chevrolet El Camino 1972 Several North American vehicles  the Chevrolet El Camino  Ford Ranchero  Dodge Rampage  Honda Ridgeline and Subaru Baja have beds  but are not considered by some to be trucks citation needed   because they do not fit the traditional  at least in North America  expectations of a specific architecture  Although the El Camino and the Ranchero were built with body on frame architectures  they were based on existing station wagon platforms  while the Ridgeline uses a spot welded sheet steel monocoque  unibody  chassis in the same style as modern passenger cars  Trucks typically have either a tubular or channel rail chassis with a fully floating cab and separate cargo section to allow for chassis flex and prevent warping of the sheetmetal  The sheet steel in both of these sections is not a stressed member  A combination of the two styles  monocoque cab and engine bay welded to a  C  section chassis rear is commonly used for trucks  such as the Mercedes Benz Sprinter chassis cab   but has not been common in North America  For instance  when offered in Australia it is known as the  one tonner  because it is rated to carry some 250 kg  551 lb  more than the all monocoque style  citation needed  In Australia and New Zealand vehicles like the Holden Ute and Falcon Utility are colloquially called utes  shortened

ute chassis  known in Egypt as a  box   citation needed  Coup  utilities and panel vans usually have an integral cargo bed behind the cabin with unibody or monocoque construction like automobiles  The design details of such vehicles vary significantly  and different nationalities seem to specialize in different styles and sizes of vehicles   edit  History A 1928 Ford roadster pickup with step side or well body 1937 Plymouth PT 50 with step side or well body priced at US 525 1  The first factory assembled pickup was based on the Ford Model T car  with a modified rear body  It debuted in 1925 and sold for US 281  Henry Ford billed it as the  Ford Model T Runabout with Pickup Body   The 34 000 built that first year featured a cargo box  adjustable tailgate  four stake pockets and heavy duty rear springs  2  In 1928  the Model A replaced the Model T  introducing the first closed cab pickup  It sported innovations like a safety glass windshield  roll up side windows and three speed transmission  It was powered by a four cylinder L head engine capable of 40 horsepower  30 kW   citation needed  Ford Australia was the first company to produce a coupe utility  This was the result of a 1932 letter from the wife of a farmer in Victoria  Australia asking for  a vehicle to go to church in on a Sunday and which can carry our pigs to market on Mondays   The vehicle debuted in Australia and is known as the utility or  ute   3  It was designed by Lewis Bandt from Ford Australia  In 1932  the 65 horsepower  48 kW  Ford flathead V8 engine was offered as an option in the truck  By 1936  Ford had already produced 3 million trucks and led the industry in sales  citation needed   edit  Military and Commercial Work Pickups Weapons Carrier    WC   Dodge Power Wagon M 37 M 715 Most featured low range gearing  heavy load capacities  in some cases multi fuel engines  and very heavy duty components   edit  Types of pickups This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability   edit  Compact pickups The compact pickup  or simply  pickup   without qualifier  is the most widespread form of pickup truck worldwide  It is built like a mini version of a two axle heavy truck  with a frame providing structure  a conventional cab  a leaf spring suspension on the rear wheels and a gasoline engine usually taken from the passenger car range  The compact pickup was popularized in North America during the 1960s by Japanese manufacturers  Datsun  Nissan 1959  and Toyota dominated under their own nameplates through the end of the 1970s  Other Japanese manufacturers built pickups for the American  Big Three   Isuzu built the Luv for Chevrolet  Mazda built the Courier for Ford and Mitsubishi built the Ram 50 for Dodge  It was not until the 1980s that Mazda introduced their own B Series  Isuzu with their P up and Mitsubishi with their Mighty Max  also at the same time  the American  Big Three  built their own small trucks for the domestic market  Ford with their own Ranger  General Motors with their Chevrolet S 10  amp  GMC S 15 Sonoma twins  and Dodge with their midsize Dakota  Morris Minor 1000 Pickup  N  American model  1960  1 4 ton carrying capacity Example of a 1961 Volkswagen Type II pickup  Compact trucks sold in the US market in 2011 include  Ford Ranger Chevrolet Colorado GMC Canyon Compact trucks sold in the European market in 2011 include  Ford Ranger Isuzu Rodeo Mitsubishi Triton Nissan Navara Toyota Hilux Volkswagen Amarok In Europe  compact pickups dominate the pickup market  although they are popular mostly in rural areas  There are few entries by European manufacturers  the most notable of which is perhaps the Peugeot 504 Pick Up  which continued to be sold in Mediterranean Europe and Africa long after the original 504 ceased production  Eastern European manufacturers such as ARO or UAZ have served their home markets faithfully for decades  but are now disappearing  The near majority of compact pickups sold in Europe use Diesel engines   edit  Full size pickups A 1982 GMC C1500 Half ton two wheel drive pickup truck with aftermarket box cap  A full size pickup is a large pickup truck suitable for hauling heavy loads and performing other functions  Most full size trucks can carry at least 1 000 lb  450 kg  in the rear bed  with some capable of over six times that much  The bed is usually constructed so as to accommodate a 4 ft  1 2 m  wide object  such as sheets of plywood  drywall  or other flat materials produced in that size as standard  with a bed able to carry 8 ft  2 4 m  long material available  although in some cases this size is available only in combination with shorter cab options   Most are front engine and rear wheel drive with four wheel drive optional  and most use a live axle with leaf springs in the rear  They are commonly found with a V6 or V8 engine  In addition  a diesel engine is often an option   edit  Dual wheeled pickup trucks The largest full size pickups feature doubled rear tires  two on each side on one axle   These are colloquially referred to as  duallies   DOOL eez   or dual wheeled pickup trucks  and are often equipped with a fifth wheel for towing heavy trailers  Dual wheeled pickup trucks are typically Class 3  However Ford s model year 2008  2009   amp  2010 F 450 pick up trucks were Class 4   edit  Ton ratings  amp  maximum payloads Full size pickups in North America are sold in four size ranges     Ton    Ton  1 Ton  and now 1  ton  These size ranges originally indicated the maximum payload of the vehicle  however modern pickups can typically carry far more than that  For example  the 2011 model Ford F 250  a  3 4 Ton  pickup  has a payload of between 2 210 lb  1 000 kg  and 4 050 lb  1 840 kg   depending on configuration  A 2011 model F 350  a  1 Ton  pickup  has a payload of between 3 580 lb  1 620 kg  and 6 520 lb  2 960 kg  depending on configuration  Drivetrain and configuration often reduce payload despite being able to haul more as is the case with the 2011 model year F 450 which has a payload of 4 920 lb  2 230 kg   Until recently  only the Big Three built full size pickups  Toyota introduced the T100 pickup truck in 1993  but sales were poor due to high prices and a lack of a V8 engine  As of 2011  these pick ups are sold as full size in North America  Chevrolet Silverado GMC Sierra Dodge Ram Ford F Series Nissan Titan Toyota Tundra  edit  Mid size pickups The first mid size pickup was the Dodge Dakota  introduced in 1987 with V6 and V8 availability to distinguish it from the smaller compact trucks which generally offered only four cylinder engines  Its hallmark was the ability to carry a 4 ft   8 ft sheet of plywood flat in the cargo bed  something which compact pickups could only carry at an angle  While the Frontier  the Tacoma  and the Ridgeline are only available with 4  or 6 cylinder engines  since 1989 the Dakota has been available with a 4   6   or 8 cylinder engine  The Mitsubishi Raider  new for 2006  was a rebadged Dakota with the same engine options  citation needed  For model year 2012 mid size models include  Chevrolet Colorado GMC Canyon Nissan Frontier Suzuki Equator Toyota Tacoma Dodge Dakota  edit  Muscle trucks Several high performance versions of trucks have been produced over the years  Besides the obvious big block equipped trucks  other notable models include  Dodge  Warlock  1976 1979   Li l Red Express  1978 1979   Midnite Express  1978   Macho Power Wagon  Shelby Dakota  1989   Ram VTS  1996 2001   R T Dakota  and SRT 10  2004 2006   Ford

deriving from an SUV or Crossover with the distinction of four doors and an open bed similar to that of a pickup truck suitable for light to heavy duty capability  depending on the vehicle  Examples include the Honda Ridgeline  Hummer H2 SUT  Chevrolet Avalanche  Ford Explorer Sport Trac  the Cadillac Escalade EXT  SsangYong Musso Sports and SsangYong Actyon Sports  citation needed   edit  Specialty trucks The Big Three  automobile manufacturers  oftentimes offer trucks that are equipped for specific off road needs  These trucks have special attributes that make them more capable than a typical 4x4  Dodge offered the Power Wagon for model year 2005  Ford offered the SVT Raptor beginning in model year 2010  GM currently has a concept truck called the Sierra All Terrain HD Concept

Subaru Baja  profile view with bed mounted bike rack  Marketed from 2003 to 2006 in the USA  Canada and Chile  the Baja featured four doors and derived from the Subaru Outback platform  A Holden SS Ute An upmarket  Fastback  Proton Arena Jumbuck small pickup with a hard  streamlined tonneau cover cum camper shell from the Malaysian car manufacturer  Proton  Coup  utility  or ute  is a variant of the well body where the rear body  truck like bed  is joined to the front body  usually a coupe  hence the name   The coup  utility body style is a light duty truck  based on an automobile platform either a unibody platform or coach or auto body and chassis and usually  but not exclusively  with a two door passenger cabin and an integral cargo bed  They often share sheet metal and instruments panels from their passenger car antecedents and are more carlike in appearance and performance than pickups based on rugged frames  In the USA  they were known as a coupe pickup or coupe express  and were manufactured from the 1930s to the 1980s  They were very popular with florists as a way to transport flowers and potted plants  Coupe pickups were manufactured by most of the American automobile and truck builders  Examples include the Studebaker Coupe Express  or the 1941 Chevrolet Coupe Pickup  A variation of the coupe pickup became the very specialized flower car that was used by funeral homes as an attendant vehicle to the hearse as part of funeral processions  Flower cars were custom manufactured by several aftermarket coachbuilders by modifying a standard production sedan  station wagon  or carryall  aka  suburban   in the same manner that ambulances  hearses  crummies  fire command cars  and fire apparatus were are manufactured  The most popular American coupe pickups were the Ford Ranchero and the Chevrolet El Camino  The more modern Subaru Baja resembles a coup  utility but with four doors  The coup  utility body style is especially popular in Australia  The ute had its origins in Australia from the open top passenger car models of the mid 1920s  The ute body type was first available in Australian Fords before Chevrolet then Dodge models  the bodies of which were made by Holden under contract  Australia has developed a culture around utes  particularly in rural areas with events known as Ute musters  Many young drivers who   customise their utes and are not willing to scratch the paintwork doing anything utilitarian citation needed   Other drivers who   customise their utes in the B amp S style citation needed  vague  with roobars  spotlights  oversized mudflaps  exhaust pipe flaps and UHF aerials  The ute culture has been romanticised by country singers such as Lee Kernaghan  who has written odes to the ute such as She s My Ute  Scrubbabashin  Baptise The Ute and Love Shack  The two current Australian built utilities Holden Ute and the Ford Falcon ute derive from currently marketed passenger cars   edit  Pickup cab styles Pickup trucks have been produced with a number of different configurations or body styles   edit  Standard cab A standard cab pickup has a single row of seats and a single set of doors  one on each side  Most pickups have a front bench seat that can be used by three people  however within the last few decades  various manufacturers have begun to offer individual seats as standard equipment   edit  Extended cab Extended or super cab pickups add an extra space behind the main seat  This is normally accessed by reclining the front bench back  but recent extended cab pickups have featured suicide doors on one or both sides for access  The original extended cab trucks used simple side facing  jump seats  that could fold into the walls  but modern super cab trucks usually have a full bench in the back  Toyota offered a version of the Stout with two doors  one each side  and two full width bench seats to hold 6 people in 1954  Dodge introduced the Club Cab in 1973  Ford followed with the SuperCab concept on their 1974 F 100  In 1977 Datsun introduced the first minitruck with extended cab  their King Cab  GM did not offer one on their full size pickups until 1988  however their smaller S Series Chevrolet S 10 GMC S 15  pickups had extended cab models starting in 1983  citation needed   edit  Crew cab A true four door pickup is a crew cab  double cab or dual cab  It features seating for up to five or six people with a rear bench seat and two full size front hinged doors on both sides  Crew cabs are not available in combination with the longest bed or box in some cases  particularly in lighter duty models  to limit their overall length and required wheelbase  International Harvester introduced the first crew cab in 1957  4  It had 3 doors  the 4th door was added in 1961  The Toyota Stout had a full crew cab version in 1960  5 Dodge followed with its own factory built crew cab in 1963  6 Ford introduced its crew cab in 1965 and General Motors in 1973  7  Through the 1980s  most crew cab pickup trucks were sold as heavy duty  3 4 and 1 ton  models intended for commercial use  and custom vehicle builders such as Centurion built light duty crew cabs for the personal use market  Nissan offered the first US market compact crew cab pickup in 2000  8  Ford  GM  Dodge  Nissan and Toyota all introduced their own compact and 1 2 ton crew cab models in the 2000s as demand grew  In North America  for carpoolers  truck sales have increased as some American full size cars have dropped the front bench seating feature from the lineup  citation needed  Crew cabs were popular and widely available in other markets many years before they caught on in the US because of their superior passenger space  citation needed  Land Rover used what they described as crew cabs in the 1970s for their special vehicles  e g  a crane mounted on the rear for street lighting maintenance  providing up to six seats so the whole work crew or gang could be accommodated  citation needed Land Rover introduced the  Defender  127 Crew Cab at least in 1987  Four door compact pickup trucks are quite in vogue in most of the world  due to their increased passenger space and versatility in carrying non rugged cargo  In the United States and Canada  however  four door compact trucks were very slow to catch on  although eventually almost every brand offered this choice  In recent years seat belt laws  requirements of insurance companies and fear of litigation have increased the demand for four door trucks which provide a safety belt for each passenger  In Mexico four door compact pickups are quite popular  9   edit  Cab forward A cab forward pickup may be derived from a cab forward van  a van where the driver sits atop the front axle  The first cab forward pickup was the Volkswagen Transporter which was introduced in 1952  It had a drop side bed which aided in loading and unloading  American  British  and Japanese manufacturers followed in the late 1950s and 1960s  American manufacturers adopted this design only later  most notably on the 1956 1965 Jeep Forward Control and the first generation Ford Econoline  Chevrolet Corvair Rampside and Loadside pickups  and Dodge A 100  While this configuration remains popular for large commercial trucks and buses  it is largely regarded as unsafe in smaller vehicles due to the lack of a crumple zone  In the event of a frontal impact  there is nothing in front of the passenger cabin to absorb the force of impact  thus crushing the entire front of the vehicle  occupants included  There have been many accidents in Europe involving large trucks where the cabin was crushed when rear ending another truck at high speed in conditions with heavy fog  They remain popular due to unimpeded forward visibility and flexible maneuverability  but have largely fallen into disuse in the United States with the exception of purpose built school and transit buses  as well as garbage and fire trucks  The Japanese embraced this design because of its high maneuverability on narrow streets and fields  The smallest ones are 360 550 660 cc Kei trucks based on microvans from Daihatsu  Honda  Mazda  Mitsubishi  Nissan  Subaru and Suzuki where the statutory limitation on length makes a short cab necessary  The pickup variant of the fifth generation Suzuki Carry is an example of a cab forward pickup kei truck    In Germany extended cabs on light trucks  such as this Mercedes Benz T2  are often favored for public service vehicles     edit  Pickup bed styles Full size pickup trucks are generally available with several different types of beds attached  The provided lengths typically specify the distance between the inside of the front end of the bed and the closed tailgate  note that these values are approximate and different manufacturers produce beds of slightly varying length  Most compact truck beds are approximately 50 in  1 270 mm  wide  and most full size are between 60 in  1 524 mm  and 70 in  1 778 mm  wide  generally 48 in  1 219 mm  or slightly over between the wheel wells  minimum width    edit  Standard bed The standard bed is by far the most popular type of pickup truck bed  Compact truck beds are generally 5 ft  1 5 m  long  full size beds are generally 6 5 ft  2 0 m  or 8 ft  2 4 m long  These beds offer significant load hauling versatility  but are not long enough to be difficult to drive or park   edit  Long bed The long bed is usually a foot or two longer than the standard bed and is more popular on trucks of primarily utilitarian employ  for example  commercial work trucks or farm trucks   Compact long beds are generally 7 ft  2 1 m  long and full size long beds are generally 8 ft  2 4 m  long  Full size long beds offer the advantage of carrying a standard size 4 ft 8 ft sheet of plywood  drywall or other material typically produced in that size  with the tailgate closed  Full size long bed trucks also have the advantage of being the standard vehicle to haul a Truck camper  In the United States and Canada  long beds are not very popular on compact trucks because of the easy availability of full size pickup trucks   edit  Short bed As mentioned above  some compact four door pickup trucks are equipped with Short beds or super short beds  They are usually based on sport utility vehicles  the bed is either attached behind the cab  the Ford Explorer Sport Trac and SsangYong Musso Sports is an example of this  or built into an integrated assembly such as the Chevrolet Avalanche  Early very short bed trucks had only a regular cab   edit  Step side Hudson truck with running board step side Most pickup truck beds have side panels positioned outside the wheel wells  Conversely  step side truck beds have side panels inside the wheel wells  Pickup trucks were commonly equipped with step side beds until the 1950s  when General Motors  Chevrolet Cameo Carrier and GMC Suburban Carrier  and Chrysler  Dodge Sweptside  introduced smooth side pickup beds as expensive  low production options  These smooth side panels were cosmetic additions over a narrow step side bed interior  In 1957  Ford offered a purpose built  Styleside  bed with smooth sides and a full width interior at little extra cost  Most manufacturers followed and switched to a straight bed  which offer slightly more interior space than step side beds  and due to better aerodynamics  tend to produce less wind noise at highway speeds  Step side beds do have the added advantage of a completely rectangular interior  although most modern trucks with a step side bed are that way purely for styling  General Motors calls the step side option sportside  while Ford Motor Company dubs it flareside  Another common designation until recently was  thriftside   so named for its lower cost   edit  No bed  cab and chassis or chassis cab  Ford F 550 Super Duty In some cases  commercial pickup trucks can be purchased without a bed at all  the fuel tank and driveline are visible and easily accessible through the top of the frame rails until a proper bed  many times customized to fit a particular business  needs  is attached by the customer  These are called  Cab  amp  Chassis  models  and are usually finished by the customer to use a flatbed  flat deck  cargo carrier  stake bed  or specialized fixtures such as tow rigs  glass sheet carriers or other types  A common type is the  flat bed  which in the US is usually of metal and has many lockable cabinet compartments  a type of large tradesman s tool box  Other varieties of commercial pickups without beds are called  Cowl  amp  Chassis  models and  Cowl  amp  Windshield  models  Both are similar to cab  amp  chassis models  but have incomplete cabs  most of which are replaced with the commercial bodies themselves  Ice cream vans were commonly built on cowl and windshield pickups until the 1970s  while walk in delivery bodies are available on cowl and chassis and stripped chassis  which have no cab at all from the chassis manufacturer   Class C motor homes are constructed of a recreational vehicle coach body attached to cab and chassis trucks  which in rare cases are the same cab and chassis also used for pickup truck models   edit  Flat bed or tray The bed is a simple flat surface mounted above the wheels  Rear indicators and brake lights are usually mounted hanging underneath the tray or on a bracket from the rear most part of the chassis   edit  Drop side The drop side has a flat tray with hinged panels rising up on the sides and the rear  The hinged panels can be lowered independently  Sometimes they can be removed completely by the driver in order to carry oversized loads  Rear indicators and brake lights are usually mounted hanging underneath the tray or on a bracket from the rear most part of the chassis   edit  Well body or style side The bed is enclosed on the sides with body panels  usually made from pressed steel  A hinged rear tailgate is almost universal  Rear indicators and brake lights are usually fitted to the rear corners of the body in a manner similar to sedan rear lights   edit  Cultural significance  edit  North America This article may contain original research  Please improve it by verifying

states  Many parts of the Deep South states and rural Mountain West states also have significant pickup truck cultures  high registration of pickup trucks  as well as similar Texas tax cuts on pickups   edit  Japan Before late 1990s  many pickup trucks were built in Japan and can be registered as private or commercial vehicle  and also had been exported to many countries  But in the 1990s  the popularity for the pickup trucks in Japanese Domestic Market has been decreased in favour of sport utility vehicles  and increasement of the taxes  such as chicken tax and excise duty  for the pickup trucks  Many manufacturers had to drop them from the lineup  For example  the Nissan Frontier was dropped from Nissan s JDM lineup  with Mazda and Toyota subsequently dropped the Mazda B Series and Toyota Hilux from their JDM lineup  The NOx law also prevent the trucks from being imported to Japan  The only mid size truck offered in Japan is the Mitsubishi Triton  which classified as SUVs by the government  But the kei trucks are still popular there  and has not affected by the decline of the trucks   edit  China Pickup trucks are required to register as commercial vehicles in mainland China  In 2010  378 000 new pickups were sold  up 48  from 2009  Great Wall Motor is the largest pickup truck maker in the country  13   edit  Thailand A medium sized inter village songthaew  Ubon Ratchathani  Thailand  As the world s second largest manufacturer of pickup trucks  aided by punitive excise taxes on passenger cars  pickup trucks have long been extremely popular in Thailand  between 1987 and 1996  58 percent of all cars sold in the country were pickup trucks  Pickups are used extensively for shipping and transport  notably the converted songthaew  lit   two row   minibus that forms the backbone of public transportation in and between many smaller cities  Thailand is also the world s second largest market for pickup trucks  after the United States  490 000 pickups were sold there in 2005  During 2011  despite the industry suffering from earthquake and tsunami in Japan and later followed by widespread severe flooding in Thailand  a total of 893 988 pickup trucks were manufactured in Thailand while domestic sales reached 328 219 units  Sales of the one ton pickup trucks during the same year commanded 42  of the total market share  Toyota was the top pickup truck seller  having sold 121 888 units of the Hilux Vigo  followed by the Isuzu D Max with 113 884 units in second place and Mitsubishi Triton in third place with 40 523 units  14   edit  Europe The largest pickup market in Europe is Portugal  where crew cab 4WD pickups have somewhat replaced SUVs as offroad vehicles  after a change in taxation removed light commercial vehicle status from SUVs  The introduction of more powerful engines in pickups  benefiting from variable vane turbochargers and common rail direct injection technology  have made these cars interesting prospects in the eyes of the public  and mid size trucks  like Nissan Navara  Mitsubishi L200 and Toyota Hilux are the top sellers in the pick up scene  citation needed  In the United Kingdom pickups are gaining popularity fast on a low level  Through 2006 pick up sales have increased by 14 percent to reach a total topping 36 000  where overall new car sales are down by 4 2 percent  The biggest sellers in the UK are mid size trucks like the Nissan Navara and the Mitsubishi L200  These are often seen as a lifestyle statement associated with surfing or other extreme sports  citation needed  In other parts of Europe pickups are only used for light commercial use  These cars are mostly cab forward types based upon vans as the Volkswagen Bus  A rather small number of compact pickup trucks is also sold  The Mitsubishi L200 is the top seller of these in Germany  with less than 2000 units per year  Additionally  a few manufacturers had made pickups based upon rather small cars like the Volkswagen Caddy  which is derived from the Volkswagen Golf I  The only example of this kind left today is the Dacia Logan Pickup  Volkswagen Caddy    koda Felicia Fun   Fiat Fiorino   Polonez Truck Plus   Dacia Pick

little over 3 meters in length  it was nonetheless quite popular as a practical  working truck  selling 58 000 vehicles between 1961 and 1983   edit  Australia and New Zealand In Australia and New Zealand  the term  Ute   short for  coupe utility   is most commonly used to describe a pickup truck  The Ute is considered an Australian   New Zealand icon since the coupe utility was originally invented there by Lewis Thornet Bandt in 1933 and were first built by Ford Australia in Geelong and were based on their 1934 V 8 Coupe  A prior patent application in 1929 by James Freeland Leacock describes a vehicle which some people claim to be the first  Ute  but it does not comply with the accepted definition of a  Ute   and was never built anyway   15  citation needed  Holden and Ford are the two most popular Ute makers in Australia and New Zealand  with their best selling models only sold in Australasia  Australasia also has a big market for muscle trucks  see above  with the
