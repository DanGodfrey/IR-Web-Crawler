Academy Award for Best Actress From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Academy Award for Best Actress Awarded for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role Presented by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Country United States Currently held by Meryl Streep The Iron Lady  2011  Official website http   www oscars org Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role is one of the Academy Awards of merit presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  AMPAS  to recognize an actress who has delivered an outstanding performance while working within the film industry  Prior to the 49th Academy Awards ceremony  1976   this award was simply known as the Academy Award of Merit for Performance by an Actress  Since its inception  however  the award has commonly been referred to as the Oscar for Best Actress  While actresses are nominated for this award by Academy members who are actors and actresses themselves  winners are selected by the Academy membership as a whole  Contents 1 History 2 Other awards for acting 3 Winners and nominees 3 1 1920s 3 2 1930s 3 3 1940s 3 4 1950s 3 5 1960s 3 6 1970s 3 7 1980s 3 8 1990s 3 9

accounting for ties and repeat winners  AMPAS has presented a total of 85 Best Actress awards to 70 different actresses  Winners of this Academy Award of Merit receive the familiar Oscar statuette  depicting a gold plated knight holding a crusader s sword and standing on a reel of film  The first recipient was Janet Gaynor  who was honored at the 1st Academy Awards ceremony  1929  for her performances in Seventh Heaven  Street Angel  and Sunrise  The most recent recipient was Meryl Streep  who was honored at the 84th Academy Awards ceremony  2012  for her performance in The Iron Lady  In the first three years of the Academy Awards  individuals such as actors and directors were nominated as the best in their categories  Then all of their work during the qualifying period  as many as three films  in some cases  was listed after the award  However  during the 3rd Academy Awards ceremony  1930   only one of those films was cited in each winner s final award  even though each of the acting winners had had two films following their names on the ballots  For the 4th Academy Awards ceremony  1931   this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the current system in which an actress is nominated for a specific performance in a single film  Such nominations are limited to five per year  Until the 8th Academy Awards ceremony  1936   nominations for the Best Actress award were intended to include all actresses  whether the performance was in either a leading or supporting role  At the 9th Academy Awards ceremony  1937   however  the Best Supporting Actress category was specifically introduced as a distinct award following complaints that the single Best Actress category necessarily favored leading performers with the most screen time  Currently  Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role  Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role  Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role  and Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role constitute the four Academy Awards of Merit for acting annually presented by AMPAS   edit  Other awards for acting Actors have also received special awards  or Academy Honorary Awards  for acting in specific films  such as in the case of James Baskett  who received a special honorary award for Disney s Song of the South   Child actors have also been awarded the Academy Juvenile Award   edit  Winners and nominees Following the Academy s practice  the films below are listed by year of their Los Angeles qualifying run  which is usually  but not always  the film s year of release  For example  the Oscar for Best Actress of 1999 was announced during the award ceremony held in 2000  For the first six ceremonies  the eligibility period spanned two calendar years  For example  the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3  1930  recognized films that were released between August 1  1928 and July 31  1929  Starting with the 7th Academy Awards  held in 1935  the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31  Winners are listed first in bold  followed by the other nominees   edit  1920s Year Actor Film Role s  1927 28 1st  Janet Gaynor Seventh Heaven Diane Street Angel Angela

two Best Actress Academy Awards  in chronological order  they are Luise Rainer  Bette Davis  Olivia de Havilland  Vivien Leigh  Ingrid Bergman  Elizabeth Taylor  Glenda Jackson  Jane Fonda  Sally Field  Jodie Foster  Hilary Swank and Meryl Streep  With two Best Actress Oscars and one for Best Supporting Actress  Ingrid Bergman and Meryl Streep are the only actresses  after Katharine Hepburn  to have won three competitive acting Oscars  Only two actresses have won this award in consecutive years  Luise Rainer  1937 and 1938  and Katharine Hepburn  1967 and 1968   Five women have won both

and 3 for Best Supporting Actress   which makes her the overall most nominated performer of all time  There has been only one tie in the history of this category  This occurred in 1969 when Katharine Hepburn and Barbra Streisand were both given the award  Unlike the earlier 1932 tie for Best Actor  however  Hepburn and Streisand each received exactly the same number of votes  Barbra Streisand is the only actress who won a Best Actress Award  for Funny Girl  and a Best Original Song Award  for composing the song  Evergreen    the latter one shared with lyricist Paul Williams  Only twice have siblings been nominated for the Best Actress award during the same year  Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine in 1942  and Lynn Redgrave and Vanessa Redgrave in 1967  Only two pairs of actresses have

ages in 2001 s Iris  Winslet and Gloria Stuart were also both nominated  Winslet for Best Actress and Stuart for Best Supporting Actress  for their portrayals of Rose DeWitt Bukater in Titanic  1997  These are the only instances of the younger and older versions of a character in the same film both yielding Academy Award nominations  thus making Kate Winslet the only actor to twice share an Oscar nomination with another for portraying the same character  The 71st Academy Awards  1999  presented the unique case of actresses being nominated in the same year for the same character in different films  Cate Blanchett was nominated for Best Actress for playing Queen Elizabeth I of England in Elizabeth  while Judi Dench was nominated for  and won  Best Supporting Actress for playing the same character in Shakespeare in Love  Cate Blanchett is the only actress to be nominated twice for the same role  Queen Elizabeth I   first for 1998 s Elizabeth and then again for 2007 s Elizabeth  The Golden Age  Halle Berry  who won in 2002 for her role in Monster s Ball  is the only woman of African American descent to win the Best Actress award  1  Eight other black actresses have been nominated

Sandino Moreno  Colombian  2004   and Pen lope Cruz  Spanish  2006   However  Cruz won the Best Supporting Actress award for her role in the 2008 film Vicky Cristina Barcelona  Nicole Kidman is the only Australian actress to win the Best Actress award  The Hours  2002   Kidman also received nominations for Moulin Rouge   2001  and Rabbit Hole  2010   other Australian nominees include May Robson for Lady for a Day  1933   Judy Davis for A Passage to India  1984   Cate Blanchett for Elizabeth  1998  and Elizabeth  The Golden Age  2007   Naomi Watts for 21 Grams  2003  and Keisha Castle Hughes for Whale Rider  2003   Sophia Loren  Marlee Matlin  and Marion Cotillard are the only actresses to win this award for a foreign language performance  Loren for her Italian language performance in Two Women  1961   Matlin for her American Sign Language performance in Children of a Lesser God and Cotillard for her French language performance in La Vie en rose  2007   Cotillard was the second French actress to win the Best Actress award after Simone Signoret for her role in Room at the Top  1959   Claudette Colbert  who won the award in 1934 for her comedic performance in It Happened One Night  was born French but later became a U S  naturalized citizen  Jane Wyman  Marlee Matlin and Holly Hunter are the only actresses in the post silent era to receive Academy Awards for roles that were non speaking  in Wyman s case  or predominantly non speaking  in Matlin and Hunter s cases   Wyman  playing a deaf rape victim in Johnny Belinda  1948   was the first person in the sound era to win an acting Oscar without speaking a line of dialogue  Matlin  who speaks just once when she argues with actor William Hurt  won the award for her American Sign Language performance in Children of a Lesser God  1986   and Hunter  who narrates several scenes and speaks on camera in the last scene  although her face is covered  for her British sign language role in The Piano  1993   Unlike Matlin  who is almost completely deaf in real life  Hunter and Wyman can hear  No Best Actress winning or nominated performance is lost  although Sadie Thompson  1928  is incomplete and missing portions have been reconstructed with stills  There have been no posthumous winners of the award  The only posthumous nomination of a woman for any acting award was Jeanne Eagels  who was nominated for Best Actress in 1929 for The Letter  She was the first woman to be posthumously nominated for an Oscar in any category  The earliest nominee in this category who is still alive is Luise Rainer  1936   followed by sisters Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine  both 1941   Luise Rainer is one of only two acting winners who have ever reached the age of 100  the other being George Burns  The earliest Oscars where all 5 Best Actress nominations are alive is at the 44th Academy Awards  The most recent where all 5 have died is at the 35th Academy Awards As of 2011 the earliest Oscars where all 4 acting winners are alive is the 34th Academy Awards  while the most recent where all 4 have died is the 54th Academy Awards  The earliest Oscars where both lead acting winning are alive is at the 34th Academy Awards  The most recent where both have died is at the 54th Academy Awards  The earliest Oscars where all 20 acting nominations are alive is at the 56th Academy Awards  1983   the most recent all 20 have died is at the 15th Academy Awards  1942   The first woman to win Best Actress for a Performance in a color film was Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind  to date the last woman to win an Academy Award for Best Actress in an all black and white film was Elizabeth Taylor in Who s Afraid of Virginia Woolf   The longest living winner is Luise Rainer  still alive at 102  The most short lived to date is Judy Holliday  dying at 43 years of age  In 1984  three of the five nominees    Sally Field in Places in the Heart  Jessica Lange in Country  and Sissy Spacek in The River    were all nominated for playing strikingly similar roles  farmers struggling to keep their properties running against the odds  not a particularly common role  Field won the Oscar for her performance  this was her second award  Lange and Spacek had both won previously   edit  Life expectancy of winners In 2001 Donald A  Redelmeier and Sheldon M  Singh published a study in the Annals of Internal Medicine in which they found that  Winning an Academy Award was associated with a large gain in life expectancy for actors and actresses    Winning an Academy Award can increase a performer s stature and may add to their longevity  The absolute difference in life expectancy is about equal to the societal consequence of curing all cancers in all people for all time  22  23   Moreover  movie stars who have won multiple Academy Awards have a survival advantage of 6 0 years  CI  0 7 to 11 3 years  over performers with multiple films but no victories  Formal education is not the only way to improve health  and strict poverty is not the only way to worsen health  The main implication is that higher status may be linked to lower mortality rates even at very impressive levels of achievement   2  The authors did an update to 29 March 2006 in which they found 122 more individuals and 144 more deaths since their first publication  Their unadjusted analysis showed a smaller survival advantage of 3 6 years for winners compared to their fellow nominees and costars in the films in which their performance garnered them their award  3  However  in a 2006 published study by Marie Pierre Sylvestre  MSc  Ella Huszti  MSc  and James A  Hanley  PhD  the authors found   The statistical method used to derive this statistically significant difference gave winners an unfair advantage because it credited an Oscar winner s years of life before winning toward survival subsequent to winning  When the authors of the current article reanalyzed the data using methods that avoided this  immortal time  bias  the survival advantage was closer to 1 year and was not statistically significant  The bias in Redelmeier and Singh s study is not limited to longevity comparisons of persons who reach different ranks within their profession   4   edit  International presence As the Academy Awards are based in the United States and are centered on the Hollywood film industry  the majority of Academy Award winners have been Americans  Nonetheless  there is significant international presence at the awards  as evidenced by the following list of winners for the Academy Award for Best Actress  Australia  Nicole Kidman  Kidman was born in the United States of Australian parents who were temporarily living in Hawaii  she is a citizen of both countries   Canada  Marie Dressler  Mary Pickford  Norma Shearer

Bette Davis has ten nominations  Her performance in Of Human Bondage was not nominated for an Oscar  Several influential people at the time campaigned to have her name included on the list  so for that year  and the follwing year also  the Academy relaxed its rules and allowed a write in vote  Technically this meant that any performance was eligible  however  the academy does not officially recognise this as a nomination for Davis   edit  Multiple awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress combined 2 awards 7  Bette Davis Olivia De Havilland Sally Field Jane Fonda Jodie Foster
