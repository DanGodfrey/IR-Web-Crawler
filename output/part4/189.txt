encompasses most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains  Colorado is part of the Western United States  Southwestern United States  and the Mountain States  Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States  The state was named for the Colorado River  which early Spanish explorers named the R o Colorado for the red colored  Spanish  colorado  silt the river carried from the mountains  On August 1  1876  U S  President Ulysses S  Grant signed a proclamation admitting Colorado as the 38th state  Colorado is nicknamed the  Centennial State  because it was admitted to the Union in 1876  the centennial year of the United States Declaration of Independence  Colorado is bordered by the northwest state of Wyoming to the north  the midwest states of Nebraska and Kansas to the northeast and east  on the south by New Mexico and a small portion of the southern state of Oklahoma  and on the west by Utah  The four states of Colorado  New Mexico  Arizona  and Utah meet at one common point known as the Four Corners  which is known as the heart of the American Southwest  Colorado is one of only three U S  states with no natural borders  the others being neighboring Wyoming and Utah  Colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of mountains  forests  high plains  mesas  canyons  plateaus  rivers  and desert lands  Denver is the capital and the most populous city of Colorado  Residents of the state are properly known as  Coloradans   although the archaic term  Coloradoan  is still used  7  8  Contents 1 Geography 1 1 Mountains 1 2 Plains 1 3 Front range 1 4 Continental Divide 1 5 Southern region 1 6 Peaks 1 7 Western slope 2 Climate 2 1

longitude  making its shape a latitude longitude  quadrangle which stretches from 37 N to 41 N latitude and from 102 03 W to 109 03 W longitude  25 W to 32 W from the Washington Meridian   9  Colorado  Wyoming and Utah are the only states which have boundaries defined solely by lines of latitude and longitude  When placing the border markers for the Territory of Colorado  minor surveying errors resulted in several small kinks  most notably along the border with the Territory of Utah  Once agreed upon by the federal  state  and territorial governments  those surveyors  benchmarks  became the legal boundaries for the Colorado Territory  kinks and all  10   edit  Mountains Tenmile Range near Leadville  Colorado The summit of Mount Elbert at 14 440 feet  4 401 m  in elevation in Lake County is the highest point of Colorado and the Rocky Mountains  2  Colorado is the only U S  state that lies entirely above 1 000 meters  3 281 ft  elevation  The point where the Arikaree River flows out of Yuma County  Colorado  and into Cheyenne County  Kansas  is the lowest point in Colorado at 3 317 feet  1 011 m  elevation  This point holds the distinction of being the highest low elevation point of any state  3  11  Mountains near Breckenridge  Colorado   edit  Plains A little over one third of the area of Colorado is flat and rolling land  East of the Rocky Mountains are the Colorado Eastern Plains of the High Plains  the section of the Great Plains within Colorado at elevations ranging from roughly 3 350 to 7 360 feet  1 020 to 2 240 m   12  The Colorado plains are usually thought of as prairies  but actually they have many patches of deciduous forests  buttes  and canyons  much like the high plains in New Mexico as well  Eastern Colorado is presently mainly covered in farmland  along with small farming villages and towns  Precipitation is fair  averaging from 15 to 25 inches  380 to 630 mm  annually  13  The summers in the plains are normally hot and dry  while the winters are often quite cold  snowy  and icy  Corn  wheat  hay  soybeans  and oats are all typical crops  and most of the villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a grain elevator  As well as the farming of crops  Eastern Colorado has a good deal of livestock raising  such as at cattle ranches and hog farms and irrigation water is available from the South Platte  the Arkansas River  and a few other streams  and also from subterranean sources  including artesian wells  However  heavy use of ground water from wells for irrigation has caused underground water reserves to decline   edit  Front range Front Range Peaks west of Denver Most of Colorado s population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the Front Range Urban Corridor between Cheyenne  Wyoming  and Pueblo  Colorado  This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado  The only other significant population centers are at Grand Junction and Durango in far western Colorado   edit  Continental Divide The Continental Divide dips down to 11 990 feet  3 655 m  at Loveland Pass  The tallest sand dunes in North America in Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in southern Colorado  View from near the summit of Mount Belford near the Continental Divide  The Continental Divide extends along the crest of the Rocky Mountains  The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the Western Slope of Colorado  Drainage water west of the Continental Divide flows to the southwest via the Colorado River and the Green River into the Gulf of California  Within the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large so called  parks  or high broad basins  In the north  on the east side of the Continental Divide is the North Park of Colorado  The North Park is drained by the North Platte River  which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska  Just to the south of North Park  but on the western side of the Continental Divide  is the Middle Park of Colorado  which is drained by the Colorado River  The South Park of Colorado is the region of the headwaters of the South Platte River   edit  Southern region In southmost Colorado is the large San Luis Valley  where the headwaters of the Rio Grande are located  The valley sits between the Sangre De Cristo Mountains and San Juan Mountains  and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains  The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico  Mexico  and Texas  Across the Sangre de Cristo Range to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the Wet Mountain Valley  These basins  particularly the San Luis Valley  lie along the Rio Grande Rift  a major geological formation of the Rocky Mountains  and its branches   edit  Peaks Mount Elbert is the tallest peak in Colorado  and the Rocky Mountains  Longs Peak in the Front Range is the tallest peak in Rocky Mountain National Park  To the west of Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains  Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include Longs Peak  Mount Evans  Pikes Peak  and the Spanish Peaks near Walsenburg  in southern Colorado  This area drains to the east and the southeast  ultimately either via the Mississippi River or the Rio Grande into the Gulf of Mexico  The Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain about 54 peaks that are 14 000 feet  4 267 m  or higher in elevation above sea level  known as fourteeners  14  These mountains are largely covered with trees such as conifers and aspens up to the tree line  at an elevation of about 12 140 feet  3 700 m  in southern Colorado to about 10 500 feet  3 200 m  in northern Colorado  Above this only alpine vegetation grows  Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow covered year round  Much of the alpine snow melts by mid August with the exception of a few snowcapped peaks and a few small glaciers  The Colorado Mineral Belt  stretching from the San Juan Mountains in the southwest to Boulder and Central City on the front range  contains most of the historic gold  and silver mining districts of Colorado  Mount Elbert is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains  The 30 highest major summits of the Rocky Mountains of North America all lie within the state   edit  Western slope Grand Mesa of the Western Slope is the largest mesa in the world The Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries  primarily the Green River and the San Juan River   or by evaporation in its arid areas  Prominent in the southwestern area of the Western Slope is the Grand Mesa and the high San Juan Mountains  a rugged mountain range  and to the west of the San Juan Mountains  the Colorado Plateau  a high arid region that borders Southern Utah  The city of Grand Junction  Colorado  is the largest city on the Western Slope  Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of radio and television broadcasting  newspapers  and higher education on the Western Slope  Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction  Western State College of Colorado in Gunnison  and Fort Lewis College in Durango are the only four year colleges in Colorado west of the Continental Divide  Canyon walls near Glenwood Springs  Colorado  Grand Junction is located along Interstate 70  the only major highway of Western Colorado  Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope  the Union Pacific  which also provides the tracks for Amtrak s California Zephyr passenger train  which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways  Hanging Lake near Glenwood Springs  Colorado  To the southeast of Grand Junction is the Grand Mesa  said to be the world s largest flat topped mountain  Other towns of the Western Slope include Glenwood Springs with its resort hot springs  and the ski resorts of Aspen  Breckenridge  Vail  Crested Butte  Steamboat Springs  and Telluride  The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region  and it contains part of the noted Dinosaur National Monument  which is not only a paleontological area  but is also a scenic area of high  rocky hills  canyons  and streambeads  Here  the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado  Dinosaur National Monument From west to east  the land of Colorado consists of desert lands and desert plateaus  then alpine mountains with National Forests  then some scattered desert land in the southern mountain areas in the state  and then the relatively flat grasslands and scattered forests of the Great Plains  The famous Pikes Peak is located just west of Colorado Springs  Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days  and also far to the north and the south  15  The desert lands in Colorado are located in and around areas such as  the Royal Gorge  Pueblo  Canon City  Florence  Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve  San Luis Valley  Cortez  Canyon of the Ancients National Monument  Hovenweep National Monument  Ute Mountain  Delta  Grand Junction  Colorado National Monument  Roan Plateau  and other areas surrounding the Uncompahgre Plateau and Uncompahgre National Forest  Colorado is one of four states in the United States that share a common geographic point the Four Corners  together with Arizona  New Mexico  and Utah  At this intersection  it is possible to stand in four states at once  See also  Colorado cities and towns  Colorado counties  Colorado municipalities  Colorado rivers  and Four Corners Monument  edit  Climate Spring melt at Bear Lake in Rocky Mountain National Park  The climate of Colorado is quite complex compared to most of the United States  Unlike in other states  southern Colorado is not necessarily warmer than northern Colorado  Most of Colorado is made up of mountains  foothills  high plains  and desert lands  Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate  As a general rule  with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation  Northeast  east  and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains  while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains  foothills  and mountains  Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous  with some desert lands mixed in  Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas   edit  Eastern Plains Center pivot irrigation of wheat growing in Yuma County  The climate of the Eastern Plains is semi arid  K ppen climate classification BSk  with low humidity and moderate precipitation  usually from 15 to 25 inches  380 to 630 mm  annually  The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool clear nights  which give this area a great average diurnal temperature range  In summer  this area can have many days above 95  F  35  C  and sometimes 100  F  38  C    16  Although 105  F  41  C  is the maximum in the front range cities above 5 000 ft  1 500 m   front range cities sitting just below 5 000 ft  1 500 m  have reached 112  F  44  C   17  In the plains  the winter extremes can be from 0  F   18  C  to  10  F   23  C   About 75  of the precipitation falls within the growing season  from April to September  but this area is very prone to droughts  Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms  which are often severe  and from major snowstorms that occur most often in the early spring  late autumn  and winter  Otherwise  winters tend to be mostly dry and cold  In much of the region  March and April are the snowiest months  April and May are normally the rainiest months  while April is the wettest month overall  The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to chinook winds which warm the area  sometimes bringing temperatures of 70  F  21  C  or higher in the winter   18  The average July temperature is 55  F  13  C  in the morning and close to 90  F  32  C  in the afternoon  The average January temperature is 18  F   8  C  in the morning and 45  F  7  C  in the afternoon  although variation between consecutive days can be 40  F  22  C    edit  West of the plains and foothills View of the Western Slope from Grand Junction  West of the plains and foothills  the weather of Colorado is much less uniform  Even places a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography of the area  Most valleys have a semi arid climate  which becomes an alpine climate at higher elevations  Humid microclimates also exist in some areas  Generally  the wettest season in western Colorado is winter while June is the driest month  This is the opposite of precipitation patterns in the east  The mountains have cool summers with many days of high temperatures around 60  F  16  C  to 70  F  21  C   although frequent thunderstorms can cause sudden drops in temperature  Summer nights are cool or even cold at the highest elevations  which sometimes get snow even in the middle of the summer  The winters bring abundant  powdery snowfall to the mountains with plenty of sunshine in between major storms  The western slope has high summer temperatures similar to those found on the plains  while the winters tend to be slightly cooler due to the lack of warming winds common to the plains and Front Range  Other areas in the west have their own unique climate   edit  Extreme weather Snow highlights the rugged mountains as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the Colorado plains  Extreme weather is a common occurrence in Colorado  Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental divide in the spring and summer  and Colorado is one of the leading states in deaths due to lightning  Hail is a common sight in the mountains east of the divide and in the northwest part of the state  The Eastern Plains have some of the biggest hail storms in North America  13  Also the Eastern Plains are part of Tornado Alley and produce some of the deadliest U S  tornadoes  Some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 Limon F3 tornado and the 2008 Windsor EF3 tornado  which devastated the town  19  The plains are also susceptible to floods  which are caused both by thunderstorms and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather  Denver s record in 1921 for the number of consecutive days above 90  F  32  C  was broken during the summer of 2008  The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week  20  Much of Colorado is a relatively dry state averaging only 17 inches  430 mm  of rain per year statewide and rarely experiences a time when some portion of the state is not in some degree of drought  21  The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of wildfires in the state such as the Hayman Fire  one of the largest wildfires in American history  and the Fourmile Canyon Fire of 2010  the most destructive wildfire in Colorado s recorded history  However  there are some of the mountainous regions of Colorado which receive a huge amount of moisture via winter snowfalls  The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in such rivers as the Yampa River  the Grand River  the Colorado River  the Rio Grande  the Arkansas River  Cherry Creek  the North Platte River  and the South Platte River  Water flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms  towns  and cities of fellow southwest states of New Mexico  Arizona  Utah  Nevada  as well as midwest like Nebraska and Kansas  and also southern states like Oklahoma and Texas  A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California  occasionally  formerly naturally and consistently  the flow of water reaches northern Mexico   edit  Records The highest temperature recorded in Colorado is 118  F  48  C  on July 11  1888  at Bennett  whereas the lowest is  61  F

Earthquakes On August 22  2011  a 5 3 magnitude earthquake occurred nine miles WSW of the city of Trinidad  25  No casualties and only small damage was reported  It was the second largest earthquake in Colorado since a magnitude 5 7 earthquake was recorded in 1973  26   edit  History The ruins of the Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde as photographed by Gustaf Nordenski ld in 1891  Main articles  History of Colorado and Timeline of Colorado history The region that is today the state of Colorado has been inhabited by Native Americans for more than 13 000 years  The Lindenmeier Site in Larimer County contains artifacts dating from approximately 11200 BCE to 3000 BCE  The eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains was a major migration route that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas  The Ancient Pueblo Peoples lived in the valleys and mesas of the Colorado Plateau  27  The Ute Nation inhabited the mountain valleys of the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Western Rocky Mountains  The Arapaho Nation and the Cheyenne Nation moved west to hunt across the High Plains  The United States acquired a territorial claim to the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains with the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803  This U S  claim conflicted with the claim of Spain to a huge region surrounding its colony of Santa F  de Nuevo M jico as its sovereign trading zone with native peoples  Zebulon Pike led a U S  Army reconnaissance expedition into the disputed region in 1806  Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the San Luis Valley the following February  taken to Chihuahua  and then expelled from Mexico the following July  Bent s Old Fort along the Arkansas River operated from 1833 to 1849  The United States relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the Arkansas River and south of 42nd parallel north and west of the 100th meridian west as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the Adams On s Treaty of 1819  The treaty took effect February 22  1821  Having settled its border with Spain  the United States admitted the southeastern portion of the Territory of Missouri to the Union as the state of Missouri on August 10  1821  The remainder of the Missouri Territory  including what would become northeastern Colorado  became unorganized territory  and would remain so for 33 years over the question of slavery  After 11 years of war  Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the Treaty of C rdoba signed on August 24  1821  Mexico eventually ratified the Adams On s Treaty in 1831  The Texian Revolt of 1835 1836 fomented a dispute between the United States and Mexico which eventually erupted into the Mexican American War in 1846  Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the United States with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo at the conclusion of the war in 1848  Most American settlers traveling overland west to the Oregon Country  the new goldfields of California  or the new Mormon settlements of Deseret in the Salt Lake Valley  avoided the rugged Southern Rocky Mountains  and instead followed the North Platte River and Sweetwater River to South Pass  the lowest crossing of the Continental Divide between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains  In 1849  the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal State of Deseret  claiming the entire Great Basin and all lands drained by the Green  Grand  and Colorado rivers  The federal government of the United States flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government  because it was theocratic and sanctioned plural marriage  Instead  the Compromise of 1850 divided the Mexican Cession and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories  the state of California  the Territory of New Mexico  and the Territory of Utah  On April 9  1851  Mexican American settlers from the area of Taos settled the village of San Luis  then in the New Mexico Territory  later to become Colorado s first permanent Euro American settlement  In 1854  Senator Stephen A  Douglas persuaded the U S  Congress to divide the unorganized territory east of the Continental Divide into two new organized territories  the Territory of Kansas and the Territory of Nebraska  and an unorganized southern region known as the Indian territory  Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries  but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between free soil and pro slavery factions   edit  Pike s Peak Gold Rush A lithograph of the Denver City mining camp in 1859  Gold was discovered along the South Platte River then in western Kansas Territory in July 1858  precipitating the Pike s Peak Gold Rush  28  The placer gold deposits along the rivers and streams of the region rapidly played out  but prospectors soon discovered far more valuable seams of hard rock gold in the nearby mountains  The gold seekers organized the Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson on August 24  1859  but this new territory failed to secure approval from the Congress of the United States embroiled in the debate over slavery  The election of Abraham Lincoln for the President of the United States on November 6  1860  led to the secession of nine southern slave states and the threat of civil war among the states  Seeking to augment the political power of the Union states  the Republican Party dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the Territory of Kansas into the Union as the free State of Kansas on January 29  1861  leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory  and its gold mining areas  as unorganized territory   edit  Territory act The territories of New Mexico  Utah  Kansas  and Nebraska before the creation of the Territory of Colorado  Thirty days later on February 28  1861  outgoing U S  President James Buchanan signed an Act of Congress organizing the free Territory of Colorado  29  The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged today  The name Colorado was chosen because it was commonly believed that the Colorado River originated in the territory  30  In 1776  Spanish priest Silvestre V lez de Escalante recorded that Native Americans in the area knew the river as el Rio Colorado for the red brown silt that the river carried from the mountains  31  In 1859  a U S  Army topographic expedition led by Captain John Macomb located the confluence of the Green River with the Grand River in what is now Canyonlands National Park in Utah  32  The Macomb party designated the confluence as the source of the Colorado River  On April 12  1861  South Carolina artillery opened fire on Fort Sumter to start the American Civil War  While many gold seekers held sympathies for the Confederacy  the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the Union cause  The Battle of Glorieta Pass  1862 In 1862  a force of Texas cavalry invaded the Territory of New Mexico and captured Santa Fe on March 10  The object of this Western Campaign was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of Colorado and California and to seize ports on the Pacific Ocean for the Confederacy  A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force marched from Denver City  Colorado Territory  to Glorieta Pass  New Mexico Territory  in an attempt to block the Texans  On March 28  the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the Battle of Glorieta Pass  destroyed their cannon and supply wagons  and ran off 500 head of their horses and mules  The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe  Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico  the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to San Antonio in defeat  The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States  In 1864  Territorial Governor John Evans appointed the Reverend John Chivington as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors who were accused of stealing cattle  Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek  Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors  The militia returned to Denver City in triumph  but several officers reported that the so called battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace  that most of the dead were women and children  and that bodies of the dead had been mutilated and desecrated in hideous manner  Three U S  Army inquiries condemned the action  and incoming President Andrew Johnson asked Governor Evans for his resignation  but none of the perpetrators was ever punished  Mount of the Holy Cross was photographed by William Henry Jackson in 1874 In the midst and aftermath of Civil War  many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes  but a determined few stayed on to develop mines  mills  farms  ranches  roads  and towns in the Territory  On September 14  1864  James Huff discovered silver near Argentine Pass  the first of many silver strikes  In 1867  the Union Pacific Railroad laid its tracks west to Weir  now Julesburg  in the northeast corner of the Territory  The Union Pacific linked up with the Central Pacific Railroad at Promontory Summit  Utah  on May 10  1869  to form the First Transcontinental Railroad  The Denver Pacific Railway reached Denver in June of the following year  and the Kansas Pacific arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent  In 1872  rich veins of silver were discovered in the San Juan Mountains on the Ute Indian reservation in southwestern Colorado  The Ute people were removed from the San Juans the following year   edit  Statehood The United States Congress passed an enabling act on March 3  1875  specifying the requirements for the Territory of Colorado to become a state  9  On August 1  1876  28 days after the Centennial of the United States   U S  President Ulysses S  Grant signed a proclamation admitting Colorado to the Union as the 38th state and earning it the moniker  Centennial State   33  The Georgetown Loop of the Colorado Central Railroad as photographed by William Henry Jackson in 1899 The discovery of a major silver lode near Leadville in 1878  triggered the Colorado Silver Boom  The Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 invigorated silver mining  and Colorado s last  but greatest  gold strike at Cripple Creek a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers  Colorado women were granted the right to vote beginning on November 7  1893  making Colorado the second state to grant universal suffrage and the first one by a popular vote  of Colorado men   The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado  but the state slowly and steadily recovered  Colorado became the first western state to host a major political convention when the Democratic Party met in Denver in 1908  By the U S  Census in 1930  the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents  Colorado suffered greatly through the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s  but a major wave of immigration following World War II boosted Colorado s fortune  Tourism became a mainstay of the state economy  and high technology became an important economic engine  The United States Census Bureau estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009  Three warships of the U S  Navy have been named the USS Colorado  The first USS Colorado was named for the Colorado River  The later two ships were named in honor of the state  including the battleship USS Colorado which served in World War II in the Pacific
