defined as the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions  2  According to the U S  Census Bureau data released Tuesday September 13th  2011  the nation s poverty rate rose to 15 1   46 2 million  in 2010  3  up from 14 3   approximately 43 6 million  in 2009 and to its highest level since 1993  In 2008  13 2   39 8 million  Americans lived in relative poverty  4  In 2000  the poverty rate for individuals was 12 2  and for families was 9 3   5  The government s definition of poverty is based on total income received  For example  the poverty level for 2011 was set at  22 350  total yearly income  for a family of four  6  Most Americans  58 5   will spend at least one year below the poverty line at some point between ages 25 and 75  7  There remains some controversy over whether the official poverty threshold over  or understates poverty  The most common measure of poverty in the United States is the  poverty threshold  set by the U S  government  This measure recognizes poverty as a lack of those goods and services commonly taken for granted by members of mainstream society  8  The official threshold is adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index  Relative poverty describes how income relates to the median income  and does not imply that the person is lacking anything  In general the United States has some of the highest relative poverty rates among industrialized countries  9  According to a 2008 report released by the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire  on average  rates of poverty are persistently higher in rural and inner city parts of the country as compared to suburban areas  10  11  The number of people in the U S  who are in poverty is increasing to record levels with the ranks of working age poor approaching 1960s levels that led to the national war on poverty  12  Contents 1 Measures of poverty 1 1 Two official measures of poverty 1 2 Recent poverty rate and

official measures of poverty Percent and number below the poverty threshold  13  The poverty rate for selected age groups  Those under the age of 18 are most likely to fall below There are two basic versions of the federal poverty measure  the poverty thresholds  which are the primary version  and the poverty guidelines  The Census Bureau issues the poverty thresholds  which are generally used for statistical purposes for example  to estimate the number of people in poverty nationwide each year and classify them by type of residence  race  and other social  economic  and demographic characteristics  The Department of Health and Human Services issues the poverty guidelines for administrative purposes for instance  to determine whether a person or family is eligible for assistance through various federal programs  14  Since the 1960s  the United States Government has defined poverty in absolute terms  When the Johnson administration declared  war on poverty  in 1964  it chose an absolute measure  The  absolute poverty line  is the threshold below which families or individuals are considered to be lacking the resources to meet the basic needs for healthy living  having insufficient income to provide the food  shelter and clothing needed to preserve health  The  Orshansky Poverty Thresholds  form the basis for the current measure of poverty in the U S  Mollie Orshansky was an economist working for the Social Security Administration  SSA   Her work appeared at an opportune moment  Orshansky s article was published later in the same year that Johnson declared war on poverty  Since her measure was absolute  i e   did not depend on other events   it made it possible to objectively answer whether the U S  government was  winning  this war  The newly formed United States Office of Economic Opportunity adopted the lower of the Orshansky poverty thresholds for statistical  planning  and budgetary purposes in May 1965  The Bureau of the Budget  now the Office of Management and Budget  adopted Orshansky s definition for statistical use in all Executive departments  The measure gave a range of income cutoffs  or thresholds  adjusted for factors such as family size  sex of the family head  number of children under 18 years old  and farm or non farm residence  The economy food plan  the least costly of four nutritionally adequate food plans designed by the Department of Agriculture  was at the core of this definition of poverty  15  The Department of Agriculture found that families of three or more persons spent about one third of their after tax income on food  For these families  poverty thresholds were set at three times the cost of the economy food plan  Different procedures were used for calculating poverty thresholds for two person households and persons living alone  Annual updates of the SSA poverty thresholds were based on price changes in the economy food plan  Two changes were made to the poverty definition in 1969  Thresholds for non farm families were tied to annual changes in the Consumer Price Index  CPI  rather than changes in the cost of the economy food plan  Farm thresholds were raised from 70 to 85  of the non farm levels  In 1981  further changes were made to the poverty definition  Separate thresholds for  farm  and  female householder  families were eliminated  The largest family size category became  nine persons or more   15  Apart from these changes  the U S  government s approach to measuring poverty has remained static for the past forty years   edit  Recent poverty rate and guidelines

820  4 780  4 390 The poverty guideline figures are NOT the figures the Census Bureau uses to calculate the number of poor persons  The figures that the Census Bureau uses are the poverty thresholds  The Census Bureau provides an explanation of the difference between poverty thresholds and guidelines  16  The Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty  15  The 2010 figure for a family of 4 with no children under 18 years of age is  22 541  while the figure for a family of 4 with 2 children under 18 is  22 162  17  For comparison  the 2011 HHS poverty guideline for a family of 4 is  22 350   edit  Numbers in other countries The official number of poor in the United States in 2008 is about 39 1 million people  greater in number but not percentage than the officially poor in Indonesia  which has a far lower Human Development Index and the next largest population after the United States  18  19  The poverty level in the United States  with 12 65   39 1 million people in poverty  of a total of 309 million  is comparable to the one in France  where 14  of the population live with less than 880 euros per month  20  21  Number of poor are hard to compare across countries  Absolute income may be used but does not reflect the actual number of poor  which depend on relative income and cost of living in each country  Among developed countries  each country then has its own definition and threshold of what it means to be poor  but this is not adjusted for cost of living and social benefits  For instance  despite the fact that France and US have about the same threshold in terms of dollars amount for poverty  cost of living and health benefits may differ  with universal health insurance coverage for poor people in France   In general  it might be better to use the Human Poverty Index  HPI   Human Development Index  HDI  or other global measure to compare quality of living in different countries   edit  Relative measures of poverty Another way of looking at poverty is in relative terms   Relative poverty  can be defined as having significantly less access to income and wealth than other members of society  Therefore  the relative poverty rate is a measure of income inequality  When the standard of living among those in more financially advantageous positions rises while that of those considered poor stagnates  the relative poverty rate will reflect such growing income inequality and increase  Conversely  the poverty rate can decrease  with low income people coming to have less wealth and income if wealthier people s wealth is reduced by a larger percentage than theirs  In 1959  a family at the poverty line had an income that was 42 64  of the median income  citation needed  If the poverty line in 1999 was less than 42 64  of the median income  then relative poverty would have increased  In the EU and for the OECD   relative poverty  is defined as an income below 60  of the national median equalized disposable income after social transfers for a comparable household  In Germany  for example  the official relative poverty line for a single adult person in 2003 was 938 euros per month  11 256 euros year   12 382 PPP  West Germany 974 euros month  11 688 euros year   12 857 PPP   For a family of four with two children below 14 years the poverty line was 1969 8 euros per month   2 167 PPP  or 23 640 euros   26 004 PPP  per year  According to Eurostat the percentage of people in Germany living at risk of poverty  relative poverty  in 2004 was 16   official national rate 13 5  in 2003   Additional definitions for poverty in Germany are  poverty   50  median  and  strict poverty   40  median  national rate 1 9  in 2003   Generally the percentage for  relative poverty  is much higher than the quota for  strict poverty   The U S concept is best comparable to  strict poverty   By European standards the official  relative  poverty rate in the United States would be significantly higher than it is by the U S  measure  A research paper from the OECD calculates the relative poverty rate for the United States at 16  for 50  median of disposable income and nearly 24  for 60  of median disposable income 22   OECD average  11  for 50  median  16  for 60  median   Some critics argue that relying on income disparity to determine who is impoverished can be misleading  The Bureau of Labor Statistics data suggests that consumer spending varies much less than income  In 2008  the  poorest  one fifth of Americans households spent on average  12 955 per person for goods and services  other than taxes   the second quintile spent  14 168  the third  16 255  the fourth  19 695  while the  richest  fifth spent  26 644  The disparity of expenditures is much less than the disparity of income  23  neutrality is disputed   edit  The income distribution and relative poverty Although the relative approach theoretically differs largely from the Orshansky definition  crucial variables of both poverty definitions are more similar than often thought  First  the so called standardization of income in both approaches is very similar  To make incomes comparable among households of different sizes  equivalence scales are used to standardize household income to the level of a single person household  In Europe  the modified OECD equivalence scale is used  which takes the combined value of 1 for the head of household  0 5 for each additional household member older than 14 years and 0 3 for children  When compared to the US Census poverty lines  which is based on a defined basket of goods  for the most prevalent household types both standardization methods show to be very similar  Furthermore  the poverty threshold in Western European countries is not always higher than the Orshansky threshold for a single person family  The actual Orchinsky poverty line for single person households in the US   9645 in 2004  is very comparable to the relative poverty line in many Western European countries  Belgium 2004   9315   while price levels are also similar  citation needed  The reason why relative poverty measurement causes high poverty levels in the US  as demonstrated by F rster  22  is caused by distributional effects rather than real differences in well being among EU countries and the USA  The median household income is much higher in the US than in Europe due to the wealth of the middle classes in the US  from which the poverty line is derived  Although the paradigm of relative poverty is most valuable  this comparison of poverty lines show that the higher prevalence of relative poverty levels in the US are not an indicator of a more severe poverty problem but an indicator of larger inequalities between rich middle classes and the low income households  It is therefore not correct to state that the US income distribution is characterized by a large proportion of households in poverty  it is characterized by relatively large income inequality but also high levels of prosperity of the middle classes  neutrality is disputed  The 2007 poverty threshold for a three member family is 17 070   edit  Poverty and demographics Camden  New Jersey is one of the poorest cities in the United States  Poverty in Chester  Pennsylvania  In addition to family status  race ethnicity and age also correlate with high poverty rates in the United States  Although data regarding race and poverty are more extensively published and cross tabulated the family status correlation is by far the strongest   edit  Poverty and family status According to the US Census  in 2007 5 8  of all people in married families lived in poverty  24  as did 26 6  of all persons in single parent households 24  and 19 1  of all persons living alone  24   edit  By race ethnicity and family status  based on data from 2007 Among married couple families  5 8  lived in poverty  24  This number varied by race and ethnicity as follows  5 4  of all white persons  which includes white hispanics   25  9 7  of all black persons  which includes black hispanics   26  and 14 9  of all Hispanic persons  of any race  27  living in poverty  Among single parent  male or female  families  26 6  lived in poverty  24  This number varied by race and ethnicity as follows  22 5  of all white persons  which includes white hispanics   25  44 0  of all black persons  which includes black hispanics   26  and 33 4  of all Hispanic persons  of any race   of any race  27  living in poverty  Among unrelated individuals living alone  19 1  lived in poverty  24  This number varied by race and ethnicity as follows  18  of white persons  which includes white hispanics  28  27 9  of black persons  which includes black hispanics  27  and 27  of Hispanic persons  of any race  29  living in poverty  edit  Poverty and race ethnicity The US Census declared that in 2010 15 1  of the general population lived in poverty  30  9 9  of all non Hispanic white persons 12 1  of all Asian persons 26 6  of all Hispanic persons  of any race  27 4  of all black persons  About half of those living in poverty are non Hispanic white  19 6 million in 2010   30  but poverty rates are much higher for blacks and Hispanics  Non Hispanic white children comprised 57  of all poor rural children  31   edit  Poverty and age The US Census declared that in 2010 15 1  of the general population lived in poverty  22  of all people under age 18 13 7  of all people 19 64  and 9  of all people ages 65 and older 30  The Organization for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD  uses a different measure for poverty and declared in 2008 that child poverty in the US is 20  and poverty among the elderly is 23   32  The non profit advocacy group Feeding America has released a study  May 2009  based on 2005 2007 data from the U S  Census Bureau and the Agriculture Department  which claims that 3 5 million children under the age of 5 are at risk of hunger in the United States  The study claims that in 11 states  Louisiana  which has the highest rate  followed by North Carolina  Ohio  Kentucky  Texas  New Mexico  Kansas  South Carolina  Tennessee  Idaho and Arkansas  more than 20 percent of children under 5 are allegedly at risk of going hungry The study was paid by ConAgra Foods  a large food company  33   edit  Food security Eighty nine percent of the American households were food secure throughout the entire year of 2002  meaning that they had access  at all times  to enough food for an active  healthy life for all of the household members  The remaining households were food insecure at least some time during that year  The prevalence of food insecurity rose from 10 7  in 2001 to 11 1  in 2002  and the prevalence of food insecurity with hunger rose from 3 3  to 3 5   34  In 2008  eighty five percent of American households were food secure throughout the entire year  35   edit  Factors in poverty There are numerous factors related to poverty in the United States  Income has a high correlation with educational levels  In 2007  the median earnings of household headed by individuals with less than a 9th grade education was  20 805 while households headed by high school graduates received  40 456  households headed holders of bachelor s degree earned  77 605  and families headed by individuals with professional degrees earned  100 000  36  In many cases poverty is caused by job loss  In 2007  the poverty rate was 21 5  for individuals who were unemployed  but only 2 5  for individuals who were employed full time  36  In 1991  8 3  of children in two parent families were likely to live in poverty  19 6  of children lived with father in single parent family  and 47 1  in single parent family headed by mother  37  Income levels vary with age  For example  the median 2009 income for households headed by individuals age 15 24 was only  30 750  but increased to  50 188 for household headed by individuals age 25 34 and  61 083 for household headed by individuals 35 44  38  Although the reasons are unclear  work experience and additional education may be factors  Income levels vary along racial ethnic lines  21  of all children in the United States live in poverty  about 46  of black children and 40  of Latino children live in poverty  39  The poverty rate is 9 9  for black married couples and only 30  of black children are born to married couples  see Marriage below   In 2007 11  of black women aged 30 44 without a high school diploma had a working spouse  40  copyright violation   The poverty rate for native born and naturalized whites is identical  9 6    On the other hand  the poverty rate for naturalized blacks is 11 8  compared to 25 1  for native born blacks suggesting race alone does not explain income disparity  Not all minorities have low incomes  Asian families have higher incomes than all other ethnic groups  For example  the 2005 median income of Asian families was  68 957 compared to the median income of white families of  59 124  41  Asians  however  report discrimination occurrences more frequently than blacks  Specifically  31  of Asians reported employment discrimination compared to 26  of blacks in 2005  42  The relationship between tax rates and poverty is disputed  A study comparing high tax Scandinavian countries with the U  S  suggests high tax rates are inversely correlated with poverty rates  43  The poverty rate  however  is low in some low tax countries such as Switzerland  A comparison of poverty rates between states reveals that some low tax states have low poverty rates  For example  New Hampshire has the lowest poverty rate of any state in the U  S   and has very low taxes  46th among all states  It is true however that in those instances  both Switzerland and New Hampshire have a very high household income and other measures to levy or offset the lack of taxation  For example  Switzerland has Universal Healthcare and a free system of education for children as young as four years old  44  New Hampshire has no state income tax or sales tax  but does have the nation s highest property taxes  45  The conservative Heritage Foundation speculates that illegal immigration increases job competition among low wage earners  both native and foreign born  Additionally many first generation immigrants  namely those without a high school diploma  are also living in poverty themselves  46  Much of the debate about poverty focuses on statistical measures of poverty and the clash between advocates and opponents of welfare programs and government regulation of the free market  Since measures can be either absolute or relative  it is possible that advocates for the different sides of this debate are basing their arguments on different ways of measuring poverty  It is often claimed that poverty is understated  yet there are some who also believe it is overstated  thus the accuracy of the current poverty threshold guidelines is subject to debate and considerable concern   edit  Concerns regarding accuracy In recent years  there have been a number of concerns raised about the official U S  poverty measure  In 1995  the National Research Council s Committee on National Statistics convened a panel on measuring poverty  The findings of the panel were that  the official poverty measure in the United States is flawed and does not adequately inform policy makers or the public about who is poor and who is not poor   The panel was chaired by Robert Michael  former Dean of the Harris School of the University of Chicago  According to Michael  the official U S  poverty measure  has not kept pace with far reaching changes in society and the economy   The panel proposed a model based on disposable income    According to the panel s recommended measure  income would include  in addition to money received  the value of non cash benefits such as food stamps  school lunches and public housing that can be used to satisfy basic needs  The new measure also would subtract from gross income certain expenses that cannot be used for these basic needs  such as income taxes  child support payments  medical costs  health insurance premiums and work related expenses  including child care  47     edit  Understating poverty Many sociologists and government officials have argued that poverty in the United States is understated  meaning that there are more households living in actual poverty than there are households below the poverty threshold  48  A recent NPR report states that as much as 30  of Americans have trouble making ends meet and other advocates have made supporting claims that the rate of actual poverty in the US is far higher than that calculated by using the poverty threshold  48  As far back as 1969  the Bureau of Labor Statistics put forward suggested budgets for families to live adequately on  60  of working class Americans lived below one of these budgets  which suggested that a far higher proportion of Americans lived in poverty than the official poverty line suggested  These findings were also used by observers on the left when questioning the long established view that most Americans had attained an affluent standard of living in the two decades following the end of the Second World War  49  50  As noted above  the poverty thresholds used by the US government were originally developed during the Johnson administration s War on Poverty initiative in 1963 1964  51  52  Mollie Orshansky  the government economist working at the Social Security Administration who developed the thresholds  based the threshold levels on the cost of purchasing what in the mid 1950s had been determined by the US Department of Agriculture to be the minimal nutritionally adequate amount of food necessary to feed a family  Orshansky multiplied the cost of the food basket by a factor of three  under the assumption that the average family spent one third of its income on food  While the poverty threshold is updated for inflation every year  the basket of food used to determine what constitutes being deprived of a socially acceptable minimum standard of living has not been updated since 1955  As a result  the current poverty line only takes into account food purchases that were common more than 50 years ago  updating their cost using the Consumer Price Index  When methods similar to Orshansky s were used to update the food basket using prices for the year 2000 instead of from nearly a half century earlier  it was found that the poverty line should actually be 200  higher than the official level being used by the government in that year  53  Yet even that higher level could still be considered flawed  as it would be based almost entirely on food costs and on the assumption that families still spend a third of their income on food  In fact  Americans typically spent less than one tenth of their after tax income on food in 2000  54  For many families  the costs of housing  health insurance and medical care  transportation  and access to basic telecommunications take a much larger bite out of the family s income today than a half century ago  yet  as noted above  51  52  none of these costs are considered in determining the official poverty thresholds  According to John Schwarz  a political scientist at the University of Arizona    The official poverty line today is essentially what it takes in today s dollars  adjusted for inflation  to purchase the same poverty line level of living that was appropriate to a half century ago  in 1955  for that year furnished the basic data for the formula for the very first poverty measure  Updated thereafter only for inflation  the poverty line lost all connection over time with current consumption patterns of the average family  Quite a few families then didn t have their own private telephone  or a car  or even a mixer in their kitchen    The official poverty line has thus been allowed to fall substantially below a socially decent minimum  even though its intention was to measure such a minimum    The issue of understating poverty is especially pressing in states with both a high cost of living and a high poverty rate such as California where the median home price in May 2006 was determined to be  564 430  55  With half of all homes being priced above the half million dollar mark and prices in urban areas such as San Francisco  San Jose or Los Angeles being higher than the state average  it is almost impossible for not just the poor but also lower middle class worker to afford decent housing  citation needed  and no possibility of home ownership  In the Monterey area  where the low pay industry of agriculture is the largest sector in the economy and the majority of the population lacks a college education the median home price was determined to be  723 790  requiring an upper middle class income which only roughly 20  of all households in the county boast  55  56  Such fluctuations in local markets are however not considered in the Federal poverty threshold and thus leave many who live in poverty like conditions out of the total number of households classified as poor  In 2011  the Census Bureau introduced a new supplementary poverty measure aimed at providing a more accurate picture of the true extent of poverty in the United States  According to this new measure  16  of Americans lived in poverty in 2011  compared with 15 2  using the official figure  The new measure also estimated that nearly half of all Americans lived in poverty that year  defined as living within 200  of the federal poverty line  57   edit  Overstating poverty Impoverished area near 125th Street in Harlem  New York  which was subsequently demolished for new commercial development  Some critics assert that the official U S  poverty definition is inconsistent with how it is defined by its own citizens and the rest of the world  because the U S  government considers many citizens statistically impoverished despite their ability to sufficiently meet their basic needs  According to a 2011 paper by poverty expert Robert Rector  of the 43 6 million Americans deemed to be below the poverty level by the U S  Census Bureau in 2009  the majority had adequate shelter  food  clothing and medical care  In addition  the paper stated that those assessed to be below the poverty line in 2011 have a much higher quality of living than those who were identified by the census 40 years ago as being in poverty  58  The federal poverty line also excludes income other than cash income  especially welfare benefits  Thus  if food stamps and public housing were successfully raising the standard of living for poverty stricken individuals  then the poverty line figures would not shift since they do not consider the income equivalents of such entitlements  59  A 1993 study of low income single mothers titled Making Ends Meet  by Kathryn Edin  a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania  showed that the mothers spent more than their reported incomes because they could not  make ends meet  without such expenditures  According to Edin  they made up the difference through contributions from family members  absent boyfriends  off the book jobs  and church charity  According to Edin   No one avoided the unnecessary expenditures  such as the occasional trip to the Dairy Queen  or a pair of stylish new sneakers for the son who might otherwise sell drugs to get them  or the Cable TV subscription for the kids home alone and you are afraid they will be out on the street if they are not watching TV   60  Moreover  Swedish Libertarian think tank Timbro points out that lower income households in the U S  tend to own more appliances and larger houses than many middle income Western Europeans  61  Some experts don t believe poverty can be accurately measured   There is no exact way of measuring poverty  The measures are contingent on how we conceive of and define poverty   said William  Sandy  Darity  a professor of public policy and economics at Duke University   Efforts to develop more refined measures have been dominated by researchers who intentionally want to provide estimates that reduce the magnitude of poverty    edit  Fighting poverty See also  War on poverty and Welfare s effect on poverty There have been many governmental and nongovernmental efforts to reduce poverty and its effects  These range in scope from neighborhood efforts to campaigns with a national focus  They target specific groups affected by poverty such as children  people who are autistic  immigrants  or people who are homeless  Efforts to alleviate poverty use a disparate set of methods  such as advocacy  education  social work  legislation  direct service or charity  and community organizing  Recent debates have centered on the need for policies that focus on both  income poverty  and  asset poverty   Advocates for the approach argue that traditional governmental poverty policies focus solely on supplementing the income of the poor  through programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children  AFDC  and Food Stamps  Additionally  the Earned Income Tax Credit  EITC or EIC  is a credit for people who earn low to moderate incomes  This credit can reduce the taxes of working families and individuals  allowing them to keep more of what they earn  The Earned Income Tax Credit is viewed as the largest poverty reduction program in the United States   edit
