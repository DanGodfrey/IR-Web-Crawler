of the Colorado River basin The Colorado River is the principal river of the southwestern United States and northwest Mexico  The 1 450 mile  2 330 km  river flows from the Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of California  draining 246 000 square miles  640 000 km2  in parts of seven U S  and two Mexican states  Known for its dramatic canyons and whitewater rapids  the Colorado is a vital source of water for agricultural and urban areas as well as an important provider of hydroelectric power in the southwestern desert lands of North America  4  The river basin has been inhabited by humans for at least eight thousand years  5  Due to the area s dry climate  they practiced farming and irrigation much more prolifically than other native peoples of the continent  Before the first Europeans arrived in the 1500s  many of these indigenous societies had collapsed due to either drought or poor agricultural practices  6  Through the next few centuries  the watershed became part of New Spain and early Mexico before the American acquisition of the region in 1848  The Colorado remained one of the last uncharted major rivers in the U S  until the famed 1869 Powell Expedition  whose members were the first to run the river through the Grand Canyon  American settlers did not establish a large permanent presence in the watershed until the 19th and early 20th centuries  7  As the Southwest s only significant source of water  the Colorado was heavily developed in the twentieth century through a system of dams  reservoirs and canals  8  These works irrigate some of the most productive agricultural regions in North America 9  and supply almost 40 million people both inside and outside the watershed  10  whose shares are carefully managed according to a series of treaties collectively known as the  Law of the River   11  However  declines in runoff and heavy water use have caused over allocation of the Colorado  a river already considered among the most regulated in the world  8  Overdraft of the Colorado River could lead to severe shortages by the mid 21st century  greatly endangering power generation and water supply  12  13  Contents 1 Course 1 1 Discharge 2

Hermit s Rest The Colorado rises at La Poudre Pass east of the Never Summer Mountains in the Colorado Rockies  some 60 miles  97 km  northwest of Denver  The river runs south before turning west below Grand Lake  the largest natural lake in the state  14  After passing Kremmling  it cuts a series of narrow canyons  including Gore  Glenwood  and De Beque  The Colorado emerges from the mountains at the Grand Valley  where it is joined by the Gunnison River before arcing northwest into desert Utah  Carving its way southwest across the Colorado Plateau  the Colorado forms Cataract Canyon and other gorges and receives its principal tributary  the Green River  before flowing into Lake Powell  a reservoir formed by the Glen Canyon Dam nearly 200 miles  320 km  downstream in Arizona  15  16  In Arizona  the Colorado passes Lee s Ferry  the official dividing point of the Upper and Lower Colorado River Basins  17  before swinging south then west through the Grand Canyon  18  Below Lake Mead   the largest man made lake in the U S   19  formed by Hoover Dam at the junction of Arizona  Nevada and Utah   the river turns sharply south  As it enters the Lower Colorado River Valley  the Colorado delineates the Arizona Nevada and Arizona California borders and is impounded by a series of dams  including Imperial Dam  where most of its flow is diverted into the All American Canal to irrigate the Imperial Valley in California  20  Below the confluence with the Gila River the Colorado forms a short stretch of the Mexico United States border before passing entirely into Mexico  It empties into the Gulf of California via a large estuary  the Colorado River Delta  about 75 miles  121 km  south of Yuma  Arizona  21  22  With its headwaters at 10 184 feet  3 104 m   the Colorado River loses nearly two miles in elevation by the time it reaches the Gulf  23  Above Lake Mead  most of the Colorado is a swift moving whitewater river  with the exception of the region around Grand Junction  Colorado   where it exhibits braided characteristics   and the marshy Kawuneeche Valley near the headwaters  The lower river between Hoover Dam and the international border is generally a slow moving  meandering stream  24  Much of the upper Colorado ranges from 200 to 500 feet  61 to 150 m  wide  compared with 500 to 1 000 feet  150 to 300 m  for the lower river  The river is relatively shallow  with an average depth of 6 to 20 feet  1 8 to 6 1 m   25  26  Prior to the mid 20th century  the estuary of the Colorado River was subjected to a major tidal bore that has almost disappeared with reductions in river flow and some dredging of the estuary channel  27  The first historical record of the tidal bore was that of the Croatian missionary in Spanish service Father Ferdinand Kon  ak on 18 July 1746  During spring tide conditions  the tidal bore formed in the estuary about Montague Island in Baja California and propagated upstream  It was locally called El Burro or burro  28   edit  Discharge Discharge of the Colorado River at selected locations Gage Discharge  average  Discharge  max  Drainage area Period of record Ref cfs m3 s cfs m3 s mi2 km2 Grand Lake

S  border  36  The tables at right list data associated with eight of these gages   edit  Watershed The drainage basin or watershed of the Colorado River encompasses 246 000 sq mi  640 000 km2  of southwestern North America  making it the seventh largest on the continent  2  About 238 600 sq mi  618 000 km2   or 97 0  of the watershed  is in the United States  37  Parts of the U S  states of Arizona  California  Colorado  New Mexico  Nevada  Utah  and Wyoming and the Mexican states of Baja California and Sonora are in the Colorado River watershed  Most of the basin is arid   defined by the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts and the expanse of the Colorado Plateau   although significant expanses of forest are found in the Rocky Mountains  the Kaibab  Aquarius  and Markagunt Plateaus in southern Utah and northern Arizona  the Mogollon Rim through central Arizona  and other smaller mountain ranges and sky islands  Elevations range from sea level at the Gulf of California to over 13 000 feet  4 000 m  in the mountains of Colorado and western Wyoming  22  with an average of some 5 500 feet  1 700 m  across the entire basin  38  39  Climate varies widely across the watershed  Mean monthly high temperatures range from 77 5 to 105  F  25 to 41  C  and lows from 48 to 10 5  F  9 to  12  C   with extremes of up to 120  F  49  C  in the desert regions of the watershed to  50  F   46  C  in Rocky Mountain winter storms  Annual precipitation averages 6 5 in  170 mm   ranging from over 40 in  1 000 mm  in some areas of the Rockies to just 0 6 in  15 mm  along the Mexican reach of the river  40  The upper basin generally receives snow and rain during the winter and early spring  while the lower basin is characterized by intense but infrequent summer thunderstorms brought on by the North American Monsoon  41  The river in western Colorado  with the California Zephyr running alongside As of 2010  approximately 12 7 million people lived in the Colorado River basin  n 2 Phoenix in Arizona and Las Vegas in Nevada are the largest metropolitan areas in the watershed  Population densities are also high along the lower Colorado River below Davis Dam  which includes Bullhead City  Lake Havasu City and Yuma  Other significant population centers in the basin include Tucson  Arizona  St  George  Utah and Grand Junction  Colorado  Colorado River basin states are among the fastest growing in the U S   the population of Nevada alone increased by about 66 percent between 1990 and 2000 as Arizona grew by some 40 percent  45  Snowmelt provides between 65 to 70 percent of the Colorado River s flow  almost 90 percent of which comes from the Upper Basin states of Colorado and Wyoming  In its natural state  most of the river s flow occurred between April and July  46  Historically the Colorado River discharged about 15 1 million acre feet  18 6 km3  each year  corresponding to an average flow of 20 900 cu ft s  590 m3 s   47  Since the beginning of the 20th century  flows have steadily declined  and in most years after 1960 the Colorado River has run dry before reaching the sea  47  This substantial reduction in flow can be attributed to irrigation and municipal diversions  evaporation from reservoirs  and likely climate change  48  For example  the Gila River   formerly one of the Colorado s largest tributaries   contributes little more than a trickle in most years due to use of its water by cities and farms in central Arizona  49  The Colorado River basin shares drainage boundaries with many other major watersheds of North America  The Continental Divide of the Americas forms a large portion of the eastern boundary of the watershed  separating it from the basins of the Yellowstone River and Platte River  tributaries of the Missouri River  on the northeast  and from the headwaters of the Arkansas River on the east  Both the Missouri and Arkansas Rivers are part of the Mississippi River system  Further south  the Colorado River basin borders on the Rio Grande drainage  which along with the Mississippi flows to the Gulf of Mexico  as well as a series of endorheic  closed  drainage basins in southwestern New Mexico and extreme southeastern Arizona  22  50  For a short stretch  the Colorado watershed meets the drainage basin of the Snake River  a tributary of the Columbia River  in the Wind River Range of western Wyoming  Southwest of there  the northern divide of the Colorado watershed skirts the edge of the Great Basin  bordering on the closed drainage basins of the Great Salt Lake and Sevier River in central Utah  and other closed basins in southern Utah and Nevada  50  To the west in California  the Colorado River watershed borders on those of small closed basins in the Mojave Desert  the largest of which is the Salton Sea drainage north of the Colorado River Delta  22  On the south  the watersheds of the Sonoyta  Concepci n  and Yaqui Rivers  all of which drain to the Gulf of California  border that of the Colorado  51   edit  Geology As recently as the Cretaceous period one hundred million years ago  much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean  Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon Plate with the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 50 75 million years ago in a mountain building episode known as the Laramide Orogeny  52  The Colorado first formed as a west flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range  and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado  Approximately 20 30 million years ago  volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the Mid Tertiary ignimbrite flare up which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona  and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed  53  The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene  but did not attain its present height until about five million years ago  about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California  54  The exact nature in which the river s present course and the Grand Canyon were formed is uncertain  Before the Gulf of California was formed approximately 5 12 million years ago by faulting processes along the boundary of the North American and Pacific Plates  55  the Colorado flowed west to an outlet on the Pacific Ocean   possibly Monterey Bay on the Central California coast  forming the Monterey submarine canyon  The uplift of the Sierra Nevada mountains began about 4 5 million years ago  diverting the Colorado southwards towards the Gulf  56  As the Colorado Plateau rose between 2 5 5 million years ago  the river maintained its ancestral course  as an antecedent stream  and began to cut the Grand Canyon  Antecedence played a major part in shaping other peculiar geographic features in the watershed  including the Dolores River s bisection of Paradox Valley in Colorado and the Green River carving its way through the Uinta Mountains in Utah  57  Remnants of basalt flows from the Uinkaret volcanic field are seen here descending into the Grand Canyon  where they dammed the Colorado over 10 times in the past two million years  Sediments carried from the plateau by the Colorado River created a vast delta made of more than 10 000 cu mi  42 000 km3  of material that walled off the northernmost part of the gulf in approximately one million years  Cut off from the ocean  the portion of the gulf north of the delta eventually evaporated and formed the Salton Sink  which reached about 260 feet  79 m  below sea level  58  59  Between then and now the river changed course into the Salton Sink at least three times  transforming it into Lake Cahuilla  which at maximum flooded up the valley to present day Indio  California  The lake took about 50 years to evaporate after the Colorado resumed flowing to the Gulf  The present day Salton Sea can be considered the most recent incarnation of Lake Cahuilla  though on a much smaller scale  60  Between 1 8 million and 10 000 years ago  massive flows of basalt from the Uinkaret volcanic field in northern Arizona dammed the Colorado River within the Grand Canyon  At least thirteen lava dams were formed  the largest of which was more than 2 300 feet  700 m  high  backing the river up for nearly 500 miles  800 km  to present day Moab  61  Most of these dams were unstable  and may have survived for as little as several hundred years before catastrophically collapsing  The main evidence pointing towards the dams  short lifespans is the lack of associated sediment deposits along this stretch of the Colorado River  which would have accumulated in the dammed lakes over time  Failure of the lava dams caused by erosion  leaks and cavitation caused catastrophic flooding which may have been some of the largest ever to occur in North America  rivaling the ice age Missoula Floods of the northwestern United States  62  Mapping of flood deposits indicate that crests as high as 700 feet  210 m  passed through the Grand Canyon  63  reaching peak discharges as great as 17 million cubic feet per second  500 000 m3 s   64   edit  History  edit  Indigenous peoples Pueblos and cliff dwellings such as this one in New Mexico were inhabited by people of the Colorado River basin in the early centuries A D  Nomadic people descended from Uto Aztecan speakers have sparsely populated the Colorado Plateau for at least 8 000 years  and perhaps for as long as 12 000 years  6  In about 6000 B C  the Hisatsinom  predecessor of the Puebloan peoples  settled near the Four Corners region around the San Juan River  while around 500 B C   people of the Fremont culture began to populate the Green River valley and the eastern part of the Great Basin  65  It was not until about 700 A D  that the Puebloans began to cultivate crops for food  and they did not build the large cliff dwellings for which they are famous until after 1000 A D  66  Tribes of the Colorado River basin had many different names for the river  The Maricopa tribe knew the river as Xakxwet  while the Mohave called the river  Aha Kwahwat  67  The Navajo called the river T  Nts  s kooh  and both Ha  ay G am and Sil Gsvgov were used by the Havasupai to refer to the river  68  Prior to European contact  native peoples such as the Anasazi  Hohokam  Mohave  Navajo  and Pueblo lived on the arid lands of the Colorado River basin  using water from the Colorado and its tributaries for farming  Beginning circa 200 B C   native groups formed large agriculture based societies which lasted for hundreds of years  69  The Anasazi inhabited the northern part of the Colorado Plateau and the foothills of the Rockies  in areas such as Chaco Canyon near the San Juan River  while the Hohokam lived in present day central Arizona in the Gila River valley around the confluence with the Salt River  Mohave territory comprised a wide swath of land along the lower Colorado between Black Canyon and the present day Palo Verde Valley  Both the Anasazi and Hohokam utilized extensive systems of canals to water their farmland  with over 210 miles  340 km  built by the latter alone  70  Native civilization reached its peak from 600 to 900 A D   but began a general decline afterwards  Around the 13th century and 14th century  the Anasazi and Hohokam cultures disappeared altogether from the lands around the Colorado River  71  Their demise is believed to be linked to the overuse of water for irrigation combined with a severe half century drought  Intensive irrigation lowered the water table while increasing the salinity of the soils used for farming  eventually making them unsuitable  Flash floods during the 12th century and 13th century were probably responsible for the demise of the Chaco Canyon settlements  and the Navajo and Puebloan people who lived in the high desert in the Four Corners region near present day Lake Powell declined in numbers as well  72  It is believed that many of the peoples that once inhabited the upper regions of the Colorado watershed migrated to the Rio Grande valley and the Painted Desert in the Little Colorado River region from the 13th century through the 15th century  73  Many of the people in the Hopi and Zuni tribes of the Sonoran Desert  as well as the Acoma and Laguna people on the Rio Grande  are believed to be descended from the ancient inhabitants of the northeastern Colorado Plateau  72  Other tribes  including the Mohave  who depended on the annual flooding of the Colorado River rather than irrigation to water their farms  experienced no significant population declines until European conquest  74   edit  Exploration During the 1500s  the Spanish began to explore and colonize western North America  An early motive was the search for the Seven Cities of Gold  or  Cibola   rumored to have been built by Native Americans somewhere in the desert Southwest  In 1536 Francisco de Ulloa  the first documented European to reach the Colorado River  sailed up the Gulf of California and a short distance into the river s delta  75 Francisco V squez de Coronado s 1540 1542 expedition began as a search for the fabled Cities of Gold  but after learning from natives in New Mexico of a large river to the west  he sent Garc a L pez de C rdenas to lead a small contingent to find it  With the guidance of Hopi Indians  C rdenas and his men became the first outsiders to see the Grand Canyon  76  However  C rdenas was reportedly unimpressed with the canyon  assuming the width of the Colorado River at six feet  1 8 m  and estimating 300 foot  91 m  tall rock formations to be the size of a man  After unsuccessfully attempting to descend to the river  they left the area  defeated by the difficult terrain and torrid weather  77  Frederic Remington   Coronado Sets Out To The North  c  1905 In 1540  Hernando de Alarc n and his fleet reached the mouth of the river  intending to provide additional supplies to Coronado s expedition  Alarc n may have sailed the Colorado as far upstream as the present day California Arizona border  However  Coronado never reached the Gulf of California  and Alarc n eventually gave up and left  Melchior D az reached the delta in the same year  intending to establish contact with Alarc n  but the latter was already gone by the time of D az s arrival  D az named the Colorado River Rio del Tizon   Firebrand River   after seeing a practice used by the local natives for warming themselves  78  The name Tizon lasted for the next two hundred years  while the name Colorado   Red River   was first applied to a tributary of the Gila River  possibly the Verde River  circa 1720  The first known map to label the main stem as the Colorado was drawn by French cartographer Jacques Nicolas Bellin in 1743  79  During the 18th and early 19th centuries  many Americans and Spanish believed in the existence of the Buenaventura River  purported to run from the Rocky Mountains in Utah or Colorado to the Pacific Ocean  80  The name Buenaventura was actually given to the Green River by Silvestre V lez de Escalante as early as 1776  but Escalante did not know that the Green drained to the Colorado  Many later maps showed the headwaters of the Green and Colorado rivers connecting with the Sevier River  Rio San Ysabel  and Utah Lake  Lake Timpanogos  before flowing west through the Sierra Nevada into California  Mountain man Jedediah Smith reached the lower Colorado by way of the Virgin River canyon in 1826  Smith called the Colorado the  Seedskeedee   as the Green River in Wyoming was known to fur trappers  correctly believing it to be a continuation of the Green and not a separate river as others believed under the Buenaventura myth  81 John C  Fr mont s 1843 Great Basin expedition proved that no river traversed the Great Basin and Sierra Nevada  officially debunking the Buenaventura myth  82  In 1857  Lieutenant Joseph C  Ives led an expedition to explore the feasibility of using the Colorado River as a navigation route in the Southwest  Ives and his men used a specially built steamboat  the shallow draft U S S  Explorer  and traveled up the river as far as Black Canyon on the present Arizona Nevada border  After confronting numerous groundings and accidents and inhibited by low water in the river  Ives declared   Ours has been the first  and will doubtless be the last  party of whites to visit this profitless locality  It seems intended by nature that the Colorado River  along the greater portion of its lonely and majestic way  shall be forever unvisited and undisturbed   83  84  Up until the mid 1800s  long stretches of the Colorado and Green Rivers between Wyoming and Nevada remained largely unexplored due to the remote location and dangers of navigating the river  Because of the dramatic drop in elevation of the two rivers  there were rumors of huge waterfalls and violent rapids  and Native American tales strengthened their credibility  85  In 1869  one armed Civil War veteran John Wesley Powell led an expedition from Green River Station in Wyoming  aiming to run the two rivers all the way down to St  Thomas  Nevada  near present day Hoover Dam  86  Powell and nine men   none of whom had prior whitewater experience   set out in May  After braving the rapids of the Gates of Lodore  Cataract Canyon and other gorges along the Colorado  the party arrived at the mouth of the Little Colorado River  where Powell noted down arguably the most famous words ever written about the Colorado  Marble Canyon  one of the many gorges that Powell s expeditions traversed We are now ready to start on our way down the Great Unknown  Our boats  tied to a common stake  are chafing each other  as they are tossed by the fretful river  They ride high and buoyant  for their loads are lighter than we could desire  We have but a month s rations remaining  The flour has been resifted through the mosquito net sieve  the spoiled bacon has been dried  and the worst of it boiled  the few pounds of dried apples have been spread in the sun  and reshrunken to their normal bulk  the sugar has all melted  and gone on its way down the river  but we have a large sack of coffee  The lighting of the boats has this advantage  they will ride the waves better  and we shall have little to carry when we make a portage  We are three quarters of a mile in the depths of the earth  and the great river shrinks into insignificance  as it dashes its angry waves against the walls and cliffs  that rise to the world above  they are but puny ripples  and we but pigmies  running up and down the sands  or lost among the boulders  We have an unknown distance yet to run  an unknown river yet to explore  What falls there are  we know not  what rocks beset the channel  we know not  what walls rise over the river  we know not  Ah  well  we may conjecture many things  The men talk as cheerfully as ever  jests are bandied about freely this morning  but to me the cheer is somber and the jests are ghastly   John Wesley Powell s journal  August 1869 87  On August 28  1869  three men deserted the expedition  convinced that they could not possibly survive the trip through the canyon  Ironically  they were killed by either Native Americans or Mormon settlers after making it to the rim of the Grand Canyon  Just two days later  the expedition ran the last of the rapids and reached St  Thomas  88  Powell led a second expedition in 1871  this time with financial backing from the U S  government  89  The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green Rivers  including Glen Canyon  the Dirty Devil River  Flaming Gorge  and the Gates of Lodore  In what is perhaps a twist of irony  modern day Lake Powell  which floods Glen Canyon  is also named for their leader  90   edit  Settlers and miners During the Manifest Destiny era of the mid 19th century  American pioneers settled many western states but generally avoided the Colorado River basin until the 1850s  Under Brigham Young s grand vision for a  vast empire in the desert  91   the State of Deseret  Mormon settlers were among the first whites to establish a permanent presence in the watershed  In 1865  Mormon colonists founded St  Thomas at the confluence of the Colorado and Virgin Rivers in Nevada  The settlement reached a peak population of about 600 before being abandoned in 1871  and thereafter the surrounding valley became a haven for outlaws and cattle rustlers  92  John D  Lee  date and photographer unknown  He established a permenant ferry across the Colorado  Mormons founded the settlement of Vernal along the Green River in Utah in 1878  and populated the Little Colorado River valley later in the century  creating towns such as St  Johns  Arizona  93  They also established settlements along the Gila River in central Arizona beginning in 1871  These early settlers were impressed by the extensive ruins of the Hohokam civilization that previously occupied the Gila River valley  and are said to have  envisioned their new agricultural civilization rising as the mythical phoenix bird from the ashes of Hohokam society   94  The Mormons were among the first to develop the water resources of the basin on a large scale  and built complex networks of dams and canals to irrigate wheat  oats and barley in addition to establishing extensive sheep and cattle ranches  91  One of the main reasons the Mormons were able to colonize Arizona was the existence of Jacob Hamblin s ferry across the Colorado at Lee s Ferry  then known as Pahreah Crossing   which began running in March 1864  95  This location was the only section of river for hundreds of miles in both directions where the canyon walls dropped away  allowing for the development of a transport route  John Doyle Lee established a more permanent ferry system at the site in 1870  One reason Lee chose to run the ferry was to flee from Mormon leaders who held him responsible for the Mountain Meadows Massacre  in which 120 emigrants in a wagon train were killed by a rebel militia disguised as Native Americans  Even though it was located along a major travel route  Lee s Ferry was very isolated  and there Lee and his family established the aptly named Lonely Dell Ranch  95  In 1928  the ferry sank resulting in the deaths of three men  Later that year  the Navajo Bridge was completed at a point five miles  8 km  downstream  rendering the ferry obsolete  96  Gold strikes through the 1800s and early 1900s played a major role in attracting settlers to the upper Colorado River basin  In 1859  a group of adventurers from Georgia discovered gold along the Blue River in Colorado and established the mining boomtown of Breckenridge  97  During 1875  even bigger strikes were made along the Uncompahgre and San Miguel Rivers  also in Colorado  and these led to the creation of Ouray and Telluride  respectively  98  99  Because most gold deposits along the upper Colorado River and its tributaries occur in lode deposits  extensive mining systems and heavy machinery were required to extract them  Mining remains a substantial contributor to the economy of the upper basin and has led to acid mine drainage problems in some regional streams and rivers  100  101  The steamboat Mohave No  2 at Yuma  c  1876 Starting in the latter half of the 19th century  the lower Colorado below Black Canyon became an important waterway for steamboat commerce  In 1852  the Uncle Sam was launched to provide supplies to the U S  Army outpost at Fort Yuma  Although this vessel struck a sandbar and sank early in its career  commercial traffic quickly proliferated because river transport was much cheaper than hauling freight over land  102  Navigation on the Colorado River was dangerous because of the shallow channel and flow variations  and the first sternwheeler on the river  the Colorado of 1855  was designed to carry 60 short tons  54 t  while drawing less than 2 ft  0 61 m  of water  103  Steamboats quickly became the principal source of communication and trade along the river until competition from railroads began in the 1870s  and finally the construction of dams along the lower river  none of which had locks to allow the passage of ships  104  Prior to 1921  the upper Colorado above the confluence with the Green River in Utah was not considered part of the main stem  This section of the Colorado had been known as the Grand River since 1836  In 1921  U S  Representative Edward T  Taylor of Colorado petitioned the Congressional Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce to rename the Grand River as the Colorado River  Taylor saw the fact that the Colorado River started outside the border of his state as an  abomination   105  On July 25 the name change was made official in House Joint Resolution 460 of the 66th Congress  over the objections of representatives from Wyoming and Utah and the United States Geological Survey  which noted that the Green River was much longer and had a larger drainage basin above its confluence with the Grand  although the Grand carried a slightly higher volume of water  106   edit  Engineering and development Lake Powell  with a capacity of more than 24 million acre feet  30 km3   is the second largest reservoir on the Colorado The Colorado River is the sole source of water for the Imperial Valley  one of California s largest agricultural regions See also  International Boundary and Water Commission and William Mulholland With 36 to 40 million people dependent on its water for both agricultural and domestic needs  10  43  the Colorado River is considered one of the  most controlled  controversial and litigated rivers in the world   107  Over 29 major dams and hundreds of miles of canals serve to supply thirsty cities  provide irrigation water to some four million acres  16 000 km2   108  and generate more than 12 billion KWh of hydroelectricity each year  109  Often called  America s Nile   110  the Colorado is so carefully managed   with basin reservoirs capable of holding four times the river s annual flow   that each drop of its water is used an average of seventeen times in a single year  111  In 1890  the first water flowed through the Grand Ditch  a 16 mile  26 km  diversion canal that sends water from the Never Summer Mountains  which would naturally have drained into the headwaters of the Colorado River  to bolster supplies in Colorado s Front Range Urban Corridor  Constructed primarily by Japanese and Mexican laborers  112  the ditch was considered an engineering marvel at the time  delivering 17 700 acre feet  0 0218 km3  across the Continental Divide each year  113  Because roughly 75 percent of Colorado s precipitation falls west of the Rocky Mountains while 80 percent of the population lives east of it  more of these interbasin water transfers  locally known as transmountain diversions  followed  114  While first envisioned in the late 19th century  construction on the Colorado Big Thompson Project  C BT  did not begin until the 1930s  The C BT now delivers more than eleven times the flow through the Grand Ditch from the Colorado River watershed to cities along the Front Range  115  Meanwhile  large scale development was also beginning on the opposite end of the Colorado River  In 1900  entrepreneurs of the California Development Company  CDC  looked to the Imperial Valley in southern California as an excellent location to develop agriculture irrigated by the waters of the river  Engineer George Chaffey was hired to design the Alamo Canal  which split off from the Colorado River near Pilot Knob  curved south into Mexico  and dumped into the Alamo River  a dry arroyo which had historically been observed to carry flood flows of the Colorado into the Salton Sink  With a stable year round flow in the Alamo River  irrigators in the Imperial Valley were able to begin large scale farming and small towns in the region started to expand  116    The undammed Colorado River is  useless to anyone    I ve seen all the wild rivers I ever want to see    Floyd Dominy  USBR commissioner from 1959 1969 117  It was not long before the Colorado River began to wreak havoc with its erratic flows  In the autumns of most years  the river dropped below the level of the canal inlet and temporary brush diversion dams had to be constructed  In early 1905  heavy floods destroyed the headworks of the canal and water began to flow uncontrolled down the canal towards the Salton Sink  On August 9  the entire flow of the Colorado swerved into the canal and began to flood the bottom of the Imperial Valley  In a desperate gamble to close the breach  crews of the Southern Pacific Railroad  whose tracks ran through the valley  attempted to dam the Colorado above the canal only to see their work demolished by a flash flood  116  It took seven attempts  over US 3 million and two years for the railroad  the CDC and the federal government to permanently block the breach and send the Colorado on its natural course back to the gulf   but not before part of the Imperial Valley was flooded under a 45 mi  72 km  long lake  today s Salton Sea  After the immediate flooding threat passed  it was realized that a more permanent solution would be needed to rein in the Colorado  118  119  In 1922  the seven U S  states of the Colorado River basin signed the Colorado River Compact  which divided half of the river s flow to both the Upper Basin  the drainage area above Lee s Ferry  comprising parts of Colorado  New Mexico  Utah and Wyoming and a small portion of Arizona  and the Lower Basin  Arizona  California  Nevada  and parts of New Mexico and Utah   Each was given rights to 7 500 000 acre feet  9 3 km3  of water per year  a figure believed to represent half of the river s minimum flow at Lee s Ferry  120  This was followed by a U S  Mexico treaty in 1944  allocating 1 500 000 acre feet  1 9 km3  of Colorado River water to the latter country per annum  121  These and nine other decisions  compacts  federal acts and agreements made between 1922 and 1973 form what is now known as the Law of the River  11  122  Hoover Dam releasing water On September 30  1935  the United States Bureau of Reclamation  USBR  completed Hoover Dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River  Behind the dam rose Lake Mead  which was then and still is the largest artificial lake in the U S  19  The construction of Hoover was a major step towards stabilizing the lower channel of the Colorado River  storing water for irrigation in times of drought  and providing much needed flood control  Hoover was the tallest dam in the world at the time of construction  and also boasted the world s largest hydroelectric power plant  123  Flow regulation from Hoover Dam opened the doors for rapid development on the lower Colorado River  Imperial and Parker Dams followed in 1938  and Davis Dam was completed in 1950  124  125  Completed in 1938 some 20 miles  32 km  above Yuma  Imperial Dam diverts nearly all of the Colorado s flow into two irrigation canals  The All American Canal  built as a permanent replacement for the Alamo Canal  is so named because it lies completely within the U S   unlike its ill fated predecessor  With a capacity of over 26 000 cu ft s  740 m3 s   the All American is the largest irrigation canal in the world  126  supplying water to 500 000 acres  2 000 km2  of California s Imperial Valley  127  Because the valley s warm and sunny climate lends to an year round growing season in addition to the large water supply furnished by the Colorado  the Imperial Valley is now one of the most productive agricultural regions in North America  9  In 1957  the USBR completed a second canal  the Gila Gravity Main Canal  to irrigate about 110 000 acres  450 km2  in southwestern Arizona with Colorado River water as part of the Gila Project  128  Colorado River water allocations 120  121  129  User Amount  MAF  n 3  Percent n 4   United States 15 0 90 9   CA 4 4

supplies  Providing water for up to 10 million people each year  the Colorado River Aqueduct  which delivers water nearly 250 miles  400 km  from near Parker Dam to California s Los Angeles metropolitan area  was completed in 1941  130  The San Diego Aqueduct branch  whose initial phase was complete by 1947  furnishes water to nearly three million people in San Diego and its suburbs  131  The Las Vegas Valley of Nevada experienced rapid growth in part due to Hoover Dam construction  and tapped a pipeline into Lake Mead by 1937  Nevadan officials  believing that groundwater resources in the southern part of the state were sufficient for future growth  were more concerned with securing a large amount of the dam s power supply than water from the Colorado  thus they settled for the smallest allocation of all the states in the Colorado River Compact  132  Central Arizona initially relied on the Gila River and its tributaries through projects such as the Theodore Roosevelt and Coolidge Dams   completed in 1924 and 1928  respectively  Roosevelt was the first large dam constructed by the USBR  and provided the initial water supplies needed to start off large scale agricultural and urban development in the region  133  Agricultural and urban growth in Arizona eventually outstripped the capacity of local rivers  leading to the inception of the Central Arizona Project in 1968  which now irrigates more than 830 000 acres  3 400 km2  and provides municipal supplies to over five million people from Phoenix to Tucson using water from the Colorado River  134  Through the early decades of the 20th century  the Upper Basin states with the exception of Colorado remained relatively undeveloped and utilized little of the water allowed to them under the Colorado River Compact  However  by the 1950s urban and agricultural development was beginning to proliferate  and more water was being diverted out of the Colorado River basin to the Front Range corridor  the Salt Lake City area in Utah  and the Rio Grande basin in New Mexico  135  Without the addition of surface water storage in the upper basin  there was no guarantee that the upper basin states would be able to utilize the full amount of water given to them by the compact  There was also the concern that drought could impair the upper basin s ability to deliver the required 7 500 000 acre feet  9 3 km3  past Lee s Ferry per year as stipulated by the compact  A 1956 act of Congress cleared the way for the USBR s Colorado River Storage Project  CRSP   which entailed the construction of large dams on the Colorado  Green  Gunnison and San Juan Rivers  136  The initial blueprints for the CRSP included two dams on the Green River within Dinosaur National Monument s Echo Park Canyon  a move criticized by both the U S  National Park Service and environmentalist groups such as the Sierra Club  137  Controversy reached a nationwide scale  and the USBR dropped its plans for the Dinosaur dams in exchange for a dam at Flaming Gorge  The famed opposition to Glen Canyon Dam  the primary feature of the CRSP  did not build momentum until construction was well underway  This was primarily because of Glen Canyon s remote location and thus most of the American public did not even know of the existence of the impressive gorge  the few who had seen it knew that it had much greater scenic value than Echo Park  Sierra Club leader David Brower fought the dam both during the construction and for many years afterwards until his death in 2000  Brower strongly believed that he was personally responsible for the failure to prevent Glen Canyon s flooding  calling it his  greatest mistake  greatest sin   138  139   edit  Environmental impacts The Colorado was named for the reddish color caused by its natural sediment loads  but damming the river has caused it to acquire a clear green hue such as here in lower Glen Canyon  Historically  the Colorado transported between 85 100 million short tons  77 91 million t  of sediment or silt to the Gulf of California each year   second only to the Mississippi among North American rivers  140  This sediment nourished wetlands and riparian areas along the river s lower course  particularly in its 3 000 square mile  7 800 km2  delta  once the largest desert estuary on the continent  141  Currently  the majority of sediments carried by the Colorado River are deposited at the upper end of Lake Powell  and most of the remainder ends up in Lake Mead  Various estimates place the time it would take for Powell to completely fill with silt from three to seven hundred years  Dams trapping sediment pose not only damage to river habitat but also threatens future operations of the Colorado River reservoir system  142  Reduction in flow caused by dams  diversions and evaporation losses from reservoirs   the latter of which reduces the river s runoff by more than fifteen percent 143    has had severe ecological consequences in the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California  Historically  the delta with its large freshwater outflow and extensive salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in the Gulf  Today s desiccated delta  at only a fraction of its former size  no longer provides suitable habitat and populations of fish  shrimp and sea mammals in the gulf have seen a dramatic decline  109  Salinity in the lower Colorado River has also increased as a result of reduced flows  The lower Colorado s salt content was about 50 parts per million  ppm  in its natural state  109  but by the 1960s  it had increased to well over 2000 ppm  144  In 1997  the USBR estimated that saline irrigation water caused  500 million of crop damage in the U S  and more than  100 million in Mexico  Efforts have been made to combat the salt issue in the lower Colorado  including the construction of a desalination plant at Yuma  145  Large dams such as Hoover and Glen Canyon typically release water from lower levels of their reservoirs  resulting in stable and relatively cold year round temperatures in long reaches of the river  The Colorado s average temperature once ranged from 85  F  29  C  at the height of summer to near freezing  32  F  0  C   in winter   but modern flows through the Grand Canyon  for example  rarely deviate significantly from 46  F  8  C   146  Changes in temperature regime have caused declines of native fish populations  and stable flows enable increased vegetation growth  obstructing riverside habitat  147  These flow patterns have also made the Colorado more dangerous to recreational boaters  people are more likely to die of hypothermia in the colder water  and the general lack of flooding allows rockslides to build up  making the river more difficult to navigate  148   edit  Uncertain future Lake Mead in 2010  showing the  bathtub ring  left behind by low water levels When the Colorado River Compact was first signed in 1922  it was based on barely thirty years of streamflow records that suggested an average annual flow of 17 5 million acre feet  21 6 km3  past Lee s Ferry  Modern tree ring studies revealed that these three decades were probably the wettest in the past 500 1 200 years   and that the long term annual flow past Lee s Ferry is probably closer to 13 5 million acre feet  16 7 km3   149  This has resulted in more water being allocated to river users than actually flows through the Colorado  150  As Marc Reisner  author of Cadillac Desert puts it    the Colorado is  a  deficit  river  as if the river were somehow at fault for its overuse   151  During the 21st century  drought took hold and continues to prevail in the Colorado River system  The river only produced normal or above average runoff in 2005  2008 and 2011  and major reservoirs in the basin dropped to historic lows  152  The watershed is currently experiencing a warming trend  which is accompanied by earlier snowmelt and a general reduction in precipitation  A 2004 study showed that a 1 6  decrease of precipitation would lead to runoff declining by as much as eighteen percent by 2050  153  Average reservoir storage would decline by at least 32   further crippling the region s water supply and hydropower generation  154  A study by the Scripps Research Institute in 2008 predicted that both Lake Mead and Lake Powell stand a fifty fifty chance of dropping to useless levels or  dead pool  n 5  by 2021 if current drying trends and water usage rates continue  156  In late 2010  Lake Mead dropped to just 7 feet  2 1 m  above the first  drought trigger  elevation  or the level at which the lower basin states would begin to face water supply cuts  Despite above average runoff in 2011 that raised the immense reservoir more than 30 feet  9 1 m   officials estimate that the influx will only stave off rationing until about 2016  157  158  Rapid development and economic growth further complicates the issue of a secure water supply  particularly in the case of California and Nevada fighting over the yet unused portion of Arizona s share of the Colorado  150  Although stringent water conservation measures have been implemented  the threat of severe shortfalls in the Colorado River basin continues to increase each year  159   edit  Wildlife and plants Further information  List of flora of the Lower Colorado River Valley The Colorado River and its tributaries often nourish extensive corridors of riparian growth as they flow through the arid desert regions of the watershed  Although riparian zones represent a relatively small area and water resources development has caused environmental degradation in many places  they have the greatest biodiversity of any habitat in the basin  160  The most prominent riparian zones along the river occur along the lower Colorado below Davis Dam 24    especially in the Colorado River Delta  which supports 358 species of birds despite the reduction in flow and invasive plants such as tamarisk  salt cedar   161  Reduction of the delta s size has also threatened animals such as jaguars and the vaquita porpoise  162  However  human development of the Colorado River has also helped to create new riparian zones by smoothing out the river s seasonal flow rhythms  notably through the Grand Canyon  163  Heavily forested banks of the Colorado River near Topock  Arizona More than 1 600 species of plants grow in the Colorado River watershed  ranging from the creosote bush  saguaro cactus  and Joshua trees of the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts to the forests of the Rocky Mountains and other uplands  comprised mainly of ponderosa pine  subalpine fir  Douglas fir and Engelmann spruce  164  Before logging in the 19th century  forests were abundant in high elevations as far south as the Mexico U S  border  and runoff from these areas nourished abundant grassland communities in river valleys  Some arid regions of the watershed  such as the upper Green River valley in Wyoming  Canyonlands National Park in Utah and the San Pedro River valley in Arizona and Sonora  supported extensive reaches of grassland roamed by large mammals such as buffalo and antelope as late as the 1860s  Near Tucson  Arizona   where now there is only powder dry desert  the grass once reached as high as the head of a man on horse back   165  Rivers and streams in the Colorado basin were once home to 49 species of native fish  of which 42 are endemic  Engineering projects and river regulation have led to the extinction of four species and severe declines in the populations of 40 species  166 Bonytail chub  razorback sucker  Colorado pikeminnow  and humpback chub are among those considered the most at risk  all are unique to the Colorado River system and well adapted to the river s natural silty conditions and flow variations  Clear  cold water released by dams has significantly changed characteristics of habitat for these and other Colorado River basin fishes  167  Additionally  about 40 fish species   notably brown trout   were introduced throughout the 19th and 20th centuries  mainly for sport fishing purposes  168   edit  Recreation A rafting party on the Colorado River Famed for its dramatic rapids and canyons  the Colorado is one of the most desirable whitewater rivers in the United States and its Grand Canyon run has been called the  granddaddy of rafting trips   169  Grand Canyon trips typically begin at Lee s Ferry and take out at Diamond Creek or Lake Mead  and range from one to eighteen days for commercial trips and from two to twenty five days for private trips  170  Private  noncommercial  trips are extremely difficult to arrange because the National Park Service limits river traffic for environmental purposes  people who desire such a trip often have to wait more than ten years for the opportunity  171  Several other sections of the river and its tributaries are popular whitewater runs  and many of these are also served by commercial outfitters  The Colorado s Cataract Canyon and many reaches in the Colorado headwaters are even more heavily used than the Grand Canyon  with more than 60 000 boaters running a single 4 5 mile  7 2 km  section above Radium  Colorado each year  The upper Colorado also includes many of the river s most challenging rapids  including those in Gore Canyon  which is considered so dangerous that  boating is not recommended   172  The rapids of the Green River s Gray and Desolation Canyons 173  and the less difficult  Goosenecks  section of the lower San Juan River are also frequently traversed by boaters  174  Eleven U S  national parks   Arches  Black Canyon of the Gunnison  Bryce Canyon  Canyonlands  Capitol Reef  Grand Canyon  Mesa Verde  Petrified Forest  Rocky Mountain  Saguaro  and Zion   are in the watershed  in addition to many national forests  state parks and recreation areas  22  Hiking  backpacking  camping  skiing and fishing are among the multiple recreation opportunities offered by these areas  However  fisheries have declined in many streams in the watershed  especially in the Rocky Mountains  because of polluted runoff from mining and agricultural activities  The Colorado s major reservoirs are also extremely popular summer destinations  Houseboating and water skiing are popular on Lakes Mead  Powell  Havasu and Mojave  as well as Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Utah and Wyoming  and Navajo Reservoir in New Mexico and Colorado  Lake Powell and surrounding Glen Canyon National Recreation Area receives more than two million visitors
