v t e The History of the United States  1865 1918  covers Reconstruction  the Gilded Age  and the Progressive Era  and includes the rise of industrialization and the resulting surge of immigration in the United States  This period of rapid economic growth and soaring prosperity in North and West  but not the South  saw the U S  become the world s dominant economic  industrial and agricultural power  The average annual income  after inflation  of nonfarm workers grew by 75  from 1865 to 1900  and then grew another 33  by 1918  1  With a decisive victory in 1865 over Southern secessionists in the Civil War  the United States became a united and powerful nation with a strong national government  Reconstruction brought the end of slavery and citizenship for the former slaves  but their political power was later rolled back and they became second class citizens under a  Jim Crow  system of segregation  Politically the nation in the Third Party System and Fourth Party System was mostly dominated by Republicans  except for two Democratic presidents   After 1900 the Progressive Era brought political and social reforms  such as new roles for education and a higher status for women  and modernized many areas of government and society  The progressives worked through new middle class organizations to fight against the corruption and behind the scenes power of entrenched state party organizations and big city machines  They demanded   and obtained in 1920  votes for women and the prohibition of alcohol  In an unprecedented wave of European immigration  27 5 million new arrivals between 1865 and 1918 2  provided the labor base for the expansion of industry and agriculture and provided the population base for most of fast growing urban America  By the late nineteenth century  the United States had become a leading global industrial power  building on new technologies  such as the telegraph and steel   an expanding railroad network  and abundant natural resources such as coal  timber  oil and farmland  to usher in the Second Industrial Revolution  There were two important wars  The US easily defeated Spain in 1898  which unexpectedly brought a small empire  Cuba quickly was given independence  and eventually also the Philippines in 1946  Puerto Rico and  and some smaller islands  became permanent possessions  as did Alaska  added by purchase in 1867  and the independent Republic of Hawaii  was annexed to the United States in 1898  3  The United States tried and failed to broker a peace settlement for World War I  then entered the war to oppose German militarism  After a slow mobilization the U S  produced a decisive Allied victory thanks to American financial  agricultural  industrial and military strength  Contents 1 Reconstruction

Laws  that made blacks second class citizens with very little political power or public voice  4  The white elites   Redeemers   the southern wing of the  Bourbon Democrats   were in firm political and economic control until the rise of the Populist movement in the 1890s  Local law enforcement was weak in rural areas  allowing outraged mobs to use lynching to redress supposed crimes committed by blacks 5   edit  Indian assimilation Expansion into the plains and mountains by miners  ranchers and settlers led to increasing conflicts with the indigenous population of the West  The government insisted the Indians remain on assigned reservations  and used force to keep them there  The violence petered out in the 1880s and practically ceased after 1890  6  By 1880 the buffalo herds  a foundation for the hunting economy  had disappeared  Indians had the choice of living on reservations  but some tribes refused to live there  Here food  supplies  education and medical care was provided by the federal government  or living on their own in society and earning wages  typically as a cowboy on a ranch  or manual worker in town  Reformers wanted to give as many Indians as possible the opportunity to own and operate their own farms and ranches  and the issue was how to give individual Indians land owned by the tribe  To assimilate the Indians into American society  reformers set up training programs and schools  such as the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle  Pennsylvania  that produced many prominent Indian leaders  The anti assimilation traditionalists on the reservations  however  resisted integration  The reformers decided the solution was to allow Indians still on reservations to own land as individuals  In 1887  the Dawes Act proposed to divide tribal land and parcel out 160 acres  0 65 km   of land to each head of a family  Such allotments were to be held in trust by the government for 25 years  after which time the owner won full title to the land  so that it could be sold or mortgaged   as well as full legal citizenship  Lands not thus distributed  however  were offered for sale to settlers  This policy eventually resulted to the Indian loss  by seizure and sale  of almost half of their tribal lands  It also destroyed much of the communal organization of the tribes  further disrupting the traditional culture of the surviving indigenous population  The Dawes Act was an effort to integrate Indians into the mainstream  the majority accepted integration and were absorbed into American society  leaving a trace of Indian ancestry in millions of American families  Those who refused to assimilate remained in poverty on the reservations  supported by Federal food  medicine and schooling  In 1934  U S  policy was reversed again by the Indian Reorganization Act which attempted to protect tribal and communal life on the reservations  7   edit  Industrialization Main article  United States technological and industrial history Blast furnace at Edgar Thomson Steel Works near Pittsburgh  1915 From 1865 to about 1913  the U S  grew to become the world s leading industrial nation  Land and labor  the diversity of climate  the ample presence of railroads  as well as navigable rivers   and the natural resources all fostered the cheap extraction of energy  fast transport  and the availability of capital that powered this Second Industrial Revolution  8  The average annual income  after inflation  of nonfarm workers grew by 75  from 1865 to 1900  and then grew another 33  by 1918  9  Where the First Industrial Revolution shifted production from artisans to factories  the Second Industrial Revolution pioneered an expansion in organization  coordination  and the scale of industry  spurred on by technology and transportation advancements  Railroads opened the West  creating farms  towns and markets where none had existed  The First Transcontinental Railroad  built by nationally oriented entrepreneurs with British money and Irish and Chinese labor  provided access to previously remote expanses of land  Railway construction boosted opportunities for capital  credit  and would be farmers  10  New technologies in iron and steel manufacturing  such as the Bessemer process and open hearth furnace  combined with similar innovations in chemistry and other sciences to vastly improve productivity  New communication tools  such as the telegraph and telephone allowed corporate managers to coordinate across great distances  Innovations also occurred in how work was organized  typified by Frederick Winslow Taylor s ideas of scientific management  11  To finance the larger scale enterprises required during this era  the corporation emerged as the dominant form of business organization  Corporations expanded by merging  creating single firms out of competing firms known as  trusts   a form of monopoly   High tariffs sheltered U S  factories and workers from foreign competition  especially in the woolen industry  Federal railroad land grants enriched investors  farmers and railroad workers  and created hundreds of towns and cities  12  Business often went to court to stop labor from organizing into unions or from organizing strikes  13  Powerful industrialists  such as Andrew Carnegie  John D  Rockefeller and Jay Gould  known collectively by their enemies as  robber barons   held great wealth and power  In a context of cutthroat competition for wealth accumulation  the skilled labor of artisans gave way to well paid skilled workers and engineers  as the nation deepened its technological base  Meanwhile  a steady stream of immigrants encouraged the availability of cheap labor  especially in mining and manufacturing  14   edit  Farming Map of the United States  1870 80  Orange indicates statehood  light blue territories  and green unorganized territories Main article  History of agriculture in the United States Railroad Age  1860 1910 A dramatic expansion in farming took place  15  The number of farms tripled from 2 0 million in 1860 to 6 0 million in 1905  The number of people living on farms grew from about 10 million in 1860 to 22 million in 1880 to 31 million in 1905  The value of farms soared from  8 0 billion in 1860 to  30 billion in 1906  16  The federal government issued 160 acre  65 ha  tracts virtually free to settlers under the Homestead Act of 1862  Even larger numbers purchased lands at very low interest from the new railroads  which were trying to create markets  The railroads advertised heavily in Europe and brought over  at low fares  hundreds of thousands of farmers from Germany  Scandinavia and Britain  17  Despite their remarkable progress and general prosperity  19th century U S  farmers experienced recurring cycles of hardship  caused primarily by falling world prices for cotton and wheat  18  Along with the mechanical improvements which greatly increased yield per unit area  the amount of land under cultivation grew rapidly throughout the second half of the century  as the railroads opened up new areas of the West for settlement  A similar expansion of agricultural lands in other countries  such as Canada  Argentina  and Australia  created problems of oversupply and low prices in the international market  where half of American wheat was sold  The wheat farmers enjoyed abundant output and good years from 1876 to 1881 when bad European harvests kept the world price high  They then suffered from a slump in the 1880s when conditions in Europe improved  The farther west the settlers went  the more dependent they became on the monopolistic railroads to move their goods to market  Wheat farmers blamed local grain elevator owners  who purchased their crop   railroads and eastern bankers for the low prices  19  In the South  Reconstruction brought major changes in agricultural practices  The most significant of these was sharecropping  where tenant farmers  shared  up to half of their crop with the landowners  in exchange for seed and essential supplies  About 80  of the African American farmers and 40  of its white ones lived under this system following the Civil War  Most sharecroppers were locked in a cycle of debt  from which the only hope of escape was increased planting  This led to the over production of cotton and tobacco  and thus to declining prices and decreased income   exhaustion of the soil  and increased poverty among both the landowners and tenants  20  Granger poster  1873  The first organized effort to address general agricultural problems was the Grange movement  Launched in 1867  by employees of the U S  Department of Agriculture  the Granges focused initially on social activities to counter the isolation most farm families experienced  Women s participation was actively encouraged  Spurred by the Panic of 1873  the Grange soon grew to 20 000 chapters and 1 5 million members  The Granges set up their own marketing systems  stores  processing plants  factories and cooperatives  Most went bankrupt  The movement also enjoyed some political success during the 1870s  A few Midwestern states passed  Granger Laws   limiting railroad and warehouse fees  21   edit  Labor and management In the fast growing industrial sector  wages were about double the level in Europe  but the work was harder with less leisure  Economic depressions swept the nation in 1873 75 and 1893 97  with low prices for farm goods and heavy unemployment in factories and mines  22  Full prosperity returned in 1897 and continued  with minor dips  to 1920  23  The pool of unskilled labor was constantly growing  as unprecedented numbers of immigrants 27 5 million between 1865 and 1918 2   entered the U S  Most were young men eager for work  The rapid growth of engineering and the need to master the new technology created a heavy demand for engineers  technicians and skilled workers  Before 1874  when Massachusetts passed the nation s first legislation limiting the number of hours women and child factory workers could perform to 10 hours a day  virtually no labor legislation existed in the country  Child labor reached a peak about 1900 then declined  except in Southern textile mills  as compulsory education laws kept children in school  It was finally ended in the 1930s  24   edit  Labor organization The first major effort to organize workers  groups on a nationwide basis appeared with The Noble Order of the Knights of Labor in 1869  Originally a secret  ritualistic society organized by Philadelphia garment workers  it was open to all workers  including African Americans  women and farmers  The Knights grew slowly until they succeeded in facing down the great railroad baron  Jay Gould  in an 1885 strike  Within a year  they added 500 000 workers to their rolls  far more than the thin leadership structure of the Knights could handle  25  The Knights of Labor soon fell into decline  and their place in the labor movement was gradually taken by the American Federation of Labor  AFL   Rather than open its membership to all  the AFL  under former cigar makers union official Samuel Gompers  focused on skilled workers  His objectives were  pure and simple   increasing wages  reducing hours and improving working conditions  As such  Gompers helped turn the labor movement away from the socialist views earlier labor leaders had espoused  The AFL would gradually become a respected organization in the U S   although it would have nothing to do with unskilled laborers  26  Non skilled workers  goals and the unwillingness of business owners to grant them resulted in some of the most violent labor conflicts in the nation s history  The first of these was the Great Railroad Strike in 1877  when rail workers across the nation went on strike in response to a 10 percent pay cut by owners  Attempts to break the strike led to bloody uprisings in several cities  The Haymarket Riot took place in 1886  when an anarchist apparently threw a bomb at police dispersing a strike rally at the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company in Chicago  The killing of policemen greatly embarrassed the Knights of Labor  which was not involved with the bomb but which took much of the blame  27  In the riots of 1892 at Carnegie s steel works in Homestead  Pennsylvania  a group of 300 Pinkerton detectives  whom the company had hired to break a bitter strike by the Amalgamated Association of Iron  Steel and Tin Workers  were fired upon by strikers and 10 were killed  As a result  the National Guard was called in to guard the plant  non union workers were hired and the strike broken  The Homestead plant completely barred unions until 1937  28  Two years later  wage cuts at the Pullman Palace Car Company  just outside Chicago  led to a strike  which  with the support of the American Railway Union  soon brought the nation s railway industry to a halt  The shutdown of rail traffic meant the virtual shutdown of the entire national economy  and President Grover Cleveland acted vigorously  He secured injunctions in federal court  which Debs and the other strike leaders ignored  Cleveland then sent in the Army to stop the rioting and get the trains moving  The strike collapsed  as did the ARU 29  30  The most militant working class organization of the 1905 1920 era was the Industrial Workers of the World  IWW   The  Wobblies  as they were commonly known  gained particular prominence from their incendiary and revolutionary rhetoric  Openly calling for class warfare  the Wobblies gained many adherents after they won a difficult 1912 textile strike  commonly known as the  Bread and Roses  strike  in Lawrence  Massachusetts  They proved ineffective in managing peaceful labor relations and members dropped away  The IWW strongly opposed the 1917 18 war effort and was shut down by the federal government  with a tiny remnant still in existence   31   edit  Gilded Age Main article  Gilded Age The  Gilded Age  that was enjoyed by the topmost percentiles of American society after the recovery from the Panic of 1873 floated on the surface of the newly industrialized economy of the Second Industrial Revolution  It was further fueled by a period of wealth transfer that catalyzed dramatic social changes  It created for the first time a class of the super rich  captains of industry   the  Robber Barons  whose network of business  social and family connections ruled a largely White Anglo Saxon Protestant social world that possessed clearly defined boundaries  The term  Gilded Age  was coined by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner in their 1873 book  The Gilded Age  A Tale of Today  employing the ironic difference between a  gilded  and a Golden Age  32  With the end of Reconstruction  there were few major political issues at stake and the 1880 presidential election was the quietest in a long time  James Garfield  the Republican candidate  won a very close election  but a few months into his administration was shot by a disgruntled public office seeker  Garfield was succeeded by his VP Chester Arthur  Reformers  especially the  Mugwumps  complained that powerful parties made for corruption during the Gilded Age or  Third Party System   Voter enthusiasm and turnout during the period 1872 1892 was very high  often reaching practically all men  The major issues involved modernization  money  railroads  corruption  and prohibition  National elections  and many state elections  were very close  The 1884 presidential election saw a mudslinging campaign in which Republican James G  Blaine was defeated by Democrat Grover Cleveland  a reformer  33  During Cleveland s presidency  he pushed to have congress cut tariff duties  He also expanded civil services and vetoed many private pension bills  Many people were worried that these issues would hurt his chances in the 1888 election  When they expressed these concerns to Cleveland  he said  What is the use of being elected or reelected  unless you stand for something   The dominant social class of the Northeast possessed the confidence to proclaim an  American Renaissance   which could be identified in the rush of new public institutions that marked the period hospitals  museums  colleges  opera houses  libraries  orchestras  and by the Beaux Arts architectural idiom in which they splendidly stood forth  after Chicago hosted the World s Columbian Exposition of 1893  34   edit  Social history Urbanization  the rapid growth of cities  went hand in hand with industrialization  the growth of factories and railroads   as well as expansion of farming  The rapid growth was made possible by high levels of immigration  35  36   edit  Immigration From 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented and diverse stream of immigrants arrived in the United States  27 5 million in total  In all  24 4 million  89   came from Europe  including 2 9 million from Britain  2 2 million from Ireland  2 1 million from Scandinavia  3 8 million from Germany  4 1 million from Italy  7 8 million from Russia and other parts of eastern and central Europe  Another 1 7 million came from Canada  37  Most came through the port of New York City  and from 1892  through the immigration station on Ellis Island  but various ethnic groups settled in different locations  New York and other large cities of the East Coast became home to large Jewish  Irish  and Italian populations  while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest  obtaining jobs in industry and mining  At the same time  about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England  38  Immigrants were pushed out of their homelands by poverty or religious threats  and pulled to America by jobs  farmland and kin connections  They found economic opportunity at factories  mines and construction sites  and found farm opportunities in the Plains states  While most immigrants were welcomed  Asians were not  Many Chinese had been brought to the west coast to construct railroads  but unlike European immigrants  they were seen as being part of an entirely alien culture  After intense anti Chinese agitation in California and the west  Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882  An informal agreement in 1907  the Gentlemen s Agreement  stopped Japanese immigration  39  Some immigrants stayed temporarily in the U S  then returned home  often with savings that made them relatively prosperous  Most  however  permanently left their native lands and stayed in hope of finding a better life in the New World  This desire for freedom and prosperity led to the famous term  the American Dream   edit  Religion The Third Great Awakening was a period of renewal in evangelical Protestantism from the late 1850s to the 1900s  40  It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong sense of social activism  41  It gathered strength from the postmillennial theology that the Second Coming of Christ would come after mankind had reformed the entire earth  A major component was the Social Gospel Movement  which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening  as did the worldwide missionary movement  New groupings emerged  such as the Holiness movement and Nazarene movements  and Christian Science  42  At the same time  the Catholic Church grew rapidly  with a base in the German  Irish  Polish  and Italian immigrant communities  and a leadership drawn from the Irish  The Catholics were largely working class and concentrated in the industrial cities and mining towns  where they built churches  parochial schools  and charitable institutions  as well as colleges  43  The Jewish community grew rapidly  especially from the new arrivals from Eastern Europe who settled chiefly in New York City  They avoided the Reform synagogues of the older German Jews and instead formed Orthodox and Conservative synagogues  44   edit  Nadir of race relations Main article  Nadir of American race relations The mob style lynching of Will James  Cairo  Illinois  1909  Starting in the end of the 1870s  African Americans lost many of the civil rights obtained during Reconstruction and became increasingly subject to racial discrimination  Increased racist violence  including lynchings and race riots  lead to a strong deterioration of living conditions of African Americans in the Southern states  Jim Crow laws were established after the Compromise of 1877  Many decided to flee for the Midwest as early as 1879  an exile which was intensified during the Great Migration that began before World War I  45  In 1896  the U S  Supreme Court effectively upheld the Jim Crow system of racial segregation by its  separate but equal  doctrine  D  W  Griffith s The Birth of a Nation  1915   the first great American film  made heroes of the KKK in Reconstruction  46   edit  Populism By 1880  the Granger movement began to decline and was replaced by the Farmers Alliances  From the beginning  the Farmers Alliances were political organizations with elaborate economic programs  According to one early platform  its purpose was to  unite the farmers of America for their protection against class legislation and the encroachments of concentrated capital   Their program also called for the regulation if not the outright nationalization of the railroads  currency inflation to provide debt relief  the lowering of the tariff  and the establishment of government owned storehouses and low interest lending facilities  These were known as the Ocala Demands  47  During the late 1880s  a series of droughts devastated the West  Western Kansas lost half its population during a four year span  To make matters worse  the McKinley Tariff of 1890 was one of the highest the country had ever seen  This was detrimental to American farmers  as it drove up the prices of farm equipment  By 1890  the level of agrarian distress was at an all time high  Mary Elizabeth Lease  a noted populist writer and agitator  told farmers that they needed to  raise less corn and more hell   Working with sympathetic Democrats in the South and small third parties in the West  the Farmer s Alliance made a push for political power  From these elements  a new political party  known as the Populist Party  emerged  The elections of 1890 brought the new party into coalitions that controlled parts of state government in a dozen Southern and Western states and sent a score of Populist senators and representatives to Congress  Its first convention was in 1892  when delegates from farm  labor and reform organizations met in Omaha  Nebraska  determined at last to make their mark on a U S  political system that they viewed as hopelessly corrupted by the monied interests of the industrial and commercial trusts  The pragmatic portion of the Populist platform focused on issues of land  railroads and money  including the unlimited coinage of silver  The Populists showed impressive strength in the West and South in the 1892 elections  and their candidate for President polled more than a million votes  It was the currency question  however  pitting advocates of silver against those who favored gold  that soon overshadowed all other issues  Agrarian spokesmen in the West and South demanded a return to the unlimited coinage of silver  Convinced that their troubles stemmed from a shortage of money in circulation  they argued that increasing the volume of money would indirectly raise prices for farm products and drive up industrial wages  thus allowing debts to be paid with inflated dollars  Conservative groups and the financial classes  on the other hand  believed that such a policy would be disastrous  and they insisted that inflation  once begun  could not be stopped  Railroad bonds  the most important financial instrument of the time  were payable in gold  If fares and freight rates were set in half price silver dollars  railroads would go bankrupt in weeks  throwing hundreds of thousands of men out of work and destroying the industrial economy  Only the gold standard  they said  offered stability  The financial Panic of 1893 heightened the tension of this debate  Bank failures abounded in the South and Midwest  unemployment soared and crop prices fell badly  The crisis  and President Cleveland s inability to solve it  nearly broke the Democratic Party  The Democratic Party  which supported silver and free trade  absorbed the remnants of the Populist movement as the presidential elections of 1896 neared  The Democratic convention that year was witness to one of the most famous speeches in U S  political history  Pleading with the convention not to  crucify mankind on a cross of gold   William Jennings Bryan  the young Nebraskan champion of silver  won the Democrats  presidential nomination  The remaining Populists also endorsed Bryan  hoping to retain some influence by having a voice inside the Bryan movement  Despite carrying the South and all the West except California and Oregon  Bryan lost the more populated  industrial North and East and the election to the Republican William McKinley with his campaign slogan  A Full Dinner Pail   The following year  the country s finances began to improve  mostly from restored business confidence  Silverites who did not realize that most transactions were handled by bank checks  not sacks of gold believed the new prosperity was spurred by the discovery of gold in the Yukon  In 1898  the Spanish American War drew the nation s attention further away from Populist issues  If the movement was dead  however  its ideas were not  Once the Populists supported an idea  it became so tainted that the vast majority of American politicians rejected it  only years later  after the taint had been forgotten  was it possible to achieve Populist reforms  such as the direct popular election of Senators   edit  Women s Suffrage Further information  Women s suffrage in the United States Alice Paul stands victorious before the Women s Suffrage Amendment s ratification banner  The women s suffrage movement began with the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention  many of the activists became politically aware during the abolitionist movement  The movement reorganized after the Civil War  gaining experienced campaigners  many of who had worked for prohibition in the Women s Christian Temperance Union  By the end of the 19th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights  48  though women had made significant legal victories  gaining rights in areas such as property and child custody  49  Around 1912  the movement  which had grown sluggish  began to reawaken  This put an emphasis on its demands for equality and arguing that the corruption of American politics demanded purification by women because men could no longer do their job  50  Protests became increasingly common as suffragette Alice Paul led parades through the capitol and major cities  Paul split from the large National American Woman Suffrage Association  NAWSA   which favored a more moderate approach and supported the Democratic Party and Woodrow Wilson  led by Carrie Chapman Catt  and formed the more militant National Woman s Party  Suffragists were arrested during their  Silent Sentinels  pickets at the White House  the first time such a tactic was used  and were taken as political prisoners  51  Finally  the suffragettes were ordered released from prison  and Wilson urged Congress to pass a Constitutional amendment enfranchising women  The old anti suffragist argument that only men could fight a war  and therefore only men deserved the franchise  was refuted by the enthusiastic participation of tens of thousands of American women on the home front in World War I  Across the world  grateful nations gave women the right to vote  Furthermore  most of the Western states had already given women the right to vote in state and national elections  and the representatives from those states  including the first voting woman Jeannette Rankin of Montana  demonstrated that Women s Suffrage was a success  The main resistance came from the south  where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting  Nevertheless Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919  It became constitutional law on August 26  1920  after ratification by the 36th required state  52   edit  Foreign policy Republican campaign poster  1900  compares prosperity now with depression in 1896  and stresses humanitarian foreign policy With the landslide election victory of William McKinley  who had risen to national prominence six years earlier with the passage of the McKinley Tariff of 1890  a high tariff was passed in 1897 and a decade of rapid economic growth and prosperity ensued  building national self confidence  53   edit  War with Spain Main article  Spanish American War Post Spanish American War map of  Greater America   including Cuba and the Philippines  Spain had once controlled a vast colonial empire  but by the second half of the 19th century only Cuba  Puerto Rico  the Philippines  and some African possessions remained  The Cubans had been in a state of rebellion since the 1870s  and American newspapers  particularly New York City papers of William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer  printed sensationalized  Yellow Journalism  stories about Spanish atrocities in Cuba  However  these lurid stories reached only a small fraction of voters  most read sober accounts of Spanish atrocities  and they called for intervention  On February 15  1898  the battleship USS Maine exploded in Havana Harbor  Although it was unclear precisely what caused the blast  many Americans believed it to be the work of a Spanish mine  an attitude encouraged by the yellow journalism of Hearst and Pulitzer  The military was rapidly mobilized as the U S  prepared to intervene in the Cuban revolt  It was made clear that no attempt at annexation of Cuba would be made and that the island s independence would be guaranteed  Spain considered this a wanton intervention in its internal affairs and severed diplomatic relations  War was declared on April 25  54  The Spanish were quickly defeated  and Theodore Roosevelt s Rough Riders gained fame in Cuba  Meanwhile  Commodore George Dewey s fleet crushed the Spanish in the faraway Philippines  Spain capitulated  ending the three month long war and recognizing Cuba s independence  Puerto Rico  Guam  and the Philippines were ceded to the United States  55  Although U S  capital investments within the Philippines and Puerto Rico were small  some politicians hoped they would be strategic outposts for expanding trade with Latin America and Asia  particularly China  That never happened and after 1903 American attention turned to the Panama Canal as the key to opening new trade routes  The Spanish American War thus began the active  globally oriented American foreign policy that continues to the present day   edit  Philippines Main articles  Philippine American War and History of the Philippines  1898 1946  The U S  acquired the Philippines from Spain on December 10  1898 via the Treaty of Paris  which ended the Spanish American War  However  Philippine revolutionaries led by Emilio Aguinaldo declared independence and in 1899 began fighting the U S  troops  The Philippine American War ended in 1901 after Aguinaldo was captured and swore allegiance to the U S  Likewise the other insurgents accepted American rule and peace prevailed  except in some remote islands under Muslim control  Roosevelt continued the McKinley policies of removing the Catholic friars  with compensation to the Pope   upgrading the infrastructure  introducing public health programs  and launching a program of economic and social modernization  The enthusiasm shown in 1898 99 for colonies cooled off  and Roosevelt saw the islands as  our heel of Achilles   He told Taft in 1907   I should be glad to see the islands made independent  with perhaps some kind of international guarantee for the preservation of order  or with some warning on our part that if they did not keep order we would have to interfere again   56  By then the President and his foreign policy advisers turned away from Asian issues to concentrate on Latin America  and Roosevelt redirected Philippine policy to prepare the islands to become the first Western colony in Asia to achieve self government  57  The Filipinos fought side by side with the Americans when the Japanese invaded in 1941  and aided the American re conquest of the islands in 1944 45  Independence came in 1946 58   edit  Latin America Main articles  Banana Wars and United States Latin American relations The U S  demanded Spain stop its oppressive policies in Cuba  public opinion  overruling McKinley  led to the short  successful Spanish American War in 1898  The U S  permanently took over Puerto Rico  and temporarily held Cuba  Attention increasingly focused on the Caribbean as the rapid growth of the Pacific states  especially California  revealed the need for a canal across to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans  Plans for one in Nicaragua fell through but under Roosevelt s leadership the U S  built a canal through Panama  after finding a public health solution to the deadly disease environment  The Panama Canal opened in 1914  59  In 1904  Roosevelt announced his  Corollary  to the Monroe Doctrine  stating that the United States would intervene in cases where Latin American governments prove incapable or unstable in the interest of bringing democracy and financial stability to them  The U S  made numerous interventions  mostly to stabilize the shaky governments and permit the nations to develop their economies  The intervention policy ended in the 1930s and was replaced by the Good Neighbor policy   60  In 1909  Nicaraguan President Jos  Santos Zelaya resigned after the triumph of U S  backed rebels  This was followed up by the 1912 1933 U S  occupation of Nicaragua  The U S  military occupation of Haiti  in 1915  followed the mob execution of Haiti s leader but even more important was the threat of a possible German takeover of the island  Germans controlled 80  of the economy by 1914 and they were bankrolling revolutions that kept the country in political turmoil  The conquest resulted in a 19 year long United States occupation of Haiti  1915 1934   Haiti was an exotic locale that suggested black racial themes to numerous American writers including Eugene O Neill  James Weldon Johnson  Langston Hughes  Zora Neale Hurston and Orson Welles  61  Limited American intervention occurred in Mexico as that country fell into a long period of anarchy and civil war starting in 1910  In April 1914  U S  troops occupied the Mexican port of Veracruz following the Tampico Incident  the reason for the intervention was Woodrow Wilson s desire to overthrow the Mexican dictator Victoriano Huerta  In March 1916  Pancho Villa led 1 500 Mexican raiders in a cross border attack against Columbus  New Mexico  attacked a U S  Cavalry detachment  seized 100 horses and mules  burned the town  and killed 17 of its residents  President Woodrow Wilson responded by sending 12 000 troops  under Gen  John J  Pershing  into Mexico to pursue Villa  The Pancho Villa Expedition to capture Villa failed in its objectives and was withdrawn in January 1917 62  In 1916  the U S  occupied the Dominican Republic   edit  Progressive Era Child laborer  Newberry  South Carolina  1908  Main article  Progressive Era A new spirit of the times  known as  Progressivism   arose in the 1890s and into the 1920s  although some historians date the ending with the World War I   63  The presidential election of 1900 gave the U S  a chance to pass judgment on the McKinley Administration  especially its foreign policy  Meeting at Philadelphia  the Republicans expressed jubilation over the successful outcome of the war with Spain  the restoration of prosperity  and the effort to obtain new markets through the Open Door Policy  The 1900 election was mostly a repeat of 1896 except for imperialism being added as a new issue  Hawaii had been annexed in 1898   William Jennings Bryan added anti imperialism to his tired out free silver rhetoric  but he was defeated in the face of peace  prosperity and national optimism  64  President McKinley was enjoying great popularity as he began his second term  65  but it would be cut short  In September 1901  while attending an exposition in Buffalo  New York  McKinley was shot by an anarchist  He was the third President to be assassinated  all since the Civil War  Vice President Theodore Roosevelt assumed the presidency  66  Political corruption was a central issue  which reformers hoped to solve through civil service reforms at the national  state and local level  replacing political hacks with professionals  The 1883 Civil Service Reform Act  or Pendleton Act   which placed most federal employees on the merit system and marked the end of the so called  spoils system   permitted the professionalization and rationalization of the federal administration  However  local and municipal government remained in the hands of often corrupt politicians  political machines and their local  bosses   Henceforth  the spoils system survived much longer in many states  counties and municipalities  such as the Tammany Hall ring  which survived well into the 1930s when New York City reformed its own civil service  Illinois modernized its bureaucracy in 1917 under Frank Lowden  but Chicago held out against civil service reform until the 1970s  67  Many self styled progressives saw their work as a crusade against urban political bosses and corrupt  robber barons   There were increased demands for effective regulation of business  a revived commitment to public service  and an expansion of the scope of government to ensure the welfare and interests of the country as the groups pressing these demands saw fit  Almost all the notable figures of the period  whether in politics  philosophy  scholarship or literature  were connected at least in part with the reform movement  Trenchant articles dealing with trusts  high finance  impure foods and abusive railroad practices began to appear in the daily newspapers and in such popular magazines as McClure s and Collier s  Their authors  such as the journalist Ida M  Tarbell  who crusaded against the Standard Oil Trust  became known as  Muckrakers   In his novel  The Jungle  Upton Sinclair exposed unsanitary conditions in the Chicago meat packing houses and the grip of the beef trust on the nation s meat supply  The hammering impact of Progressive Era writers bolstered aims of certain sectors of the population  especially a middle class caught between political machines and big corporations  to take political action  Many states enacted laws to improve the conditions under which people lived and worked  At the urging of such prominent social critics as Jane Addams  child labor laws were strengthened and new ones adopted  raising age limits  shortening work hours  restricting night work and requiring school attendance  By the early 20th century  most of the larger cities and more than half the states had established an eight hour day on public works  Equally important were the Workers  Compensation Laws  which made employers legally responsible for injuries sustained by employees at work  New revenue laws were also enacted  which  by taxing inheritances  laid the groundwork for the contemporary Federal income tax  68   edit  Roosevelt s Presidency Main article  Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt Roosevelt  a progressive Republican  called for a  Square Deal   and initiated a policy of increased Federal supervision in the enforcement of antitrust laws  Later  extension of government supervision over the railroads prompted the passage of major regulatory bills  One of the bills made published rates the lawful standard  and shippers equally liable with railroads for rebates  69  Following TR s landslide victory in the 1904 election he called for still more drastic railroad regulation  and in June 1906  Congress passed the Hepburn Act  This gave the Interstate Commerce Commission real authority in regulating rates  extended the jurisdiction of the commission  and forced the railroads to surrender their interlocking interests in steamship lines and coal companies  Roosevelt held many meetings  and opened public hearings  in a successful effort to find a compromise for the Coal Strike of 1902  which threatened the fuel supplies of urban America  Meanwhile  Congress had created a new Cabinet Department of Commerce and Labor  Cartoonist admires the strict TR who teaches the childish coal barons a lesson  they raised the pay rates for minors  but did not recognize the union Conservation of the nation s natural resources and beautiful places was a very high priority for Roosevelt  and he raised the national visibility of the issue  70  The President called for a far reaching and integrated program of conservation  reclamation and irrigation as early as 1901 in his first annual message to Congress  Whereas his predecessors had set aside 46 million acres  188 000 km   of timberland for preservation and parks  Roosevelt increased the area to 146 million acres  592 000 km   and began systematic efforts to prevent forest fires and to retimber denuded tracts  His appointment of his friend Gifford Pinchot as chief forester resulted in vigorous new scientific management of public lands  TR added 50 wildlife refuges  5 new national parks  and initiated the system of designating National Monuments  such as the Devils Tower National Monument  71   edit  President Taft Main article  William Howard Taft Roosevelt s popularity was at its peak as the campaign of 1908 neared  but he was unwilling to break the tradition by which no President had held office for more than two terms  Instead  he supported William Howard Taft  On the Democratic side  William Jennings Bryan ran for a third time  but managed to carry only the South  Taft  a former judge  first colonial governor of the U S  held Philippines and administrator of the Panama Canal  made some progress with his Dollar Diplomacy  72  Taft continued the prosecution of trusts  further strengthened the Interstate Commerce Commission  established a postal savings bank and a parcel post system  expanded the civil service  and sponsored the enactment of two amendments to the United States Constitution  The 16th Amendment authorized a federal income tax  while the 17th Amendment  ratified in 1913  mandated the direct election of U S  Senators by the people  replacing the prior system established in the original Constitution  in which they were selected by state legislatures  Yet balanced against these achievements were  Taft s acceptance of a tariff with protective schedules that outraged progressive opinion  his opposition to the entry of the state of Arizona into the Union because of its progressive constitution  and his growing reliance on the conservative wing of his party  By 1910  the Republican Party was divided  and an overwhelming vote swept the Democrats back into control of Congress   edit  President Wilson Main article  Woodrow Wilson Two years later  Woodrow Wilson  the Democratic  progressive governor of the state of New Jersey  campaigned against Taft  the Republican candidate  and against Roosevelt who was appalled by his successor s policies and thus broke his earlier pledge to not run for a third term  As the Republicans would not nominate him  he ran as a third party Progressive candidate  but the ticket became widely known as the Bull Moose Party  The election was mainly a contest between Roosevelt and Wilson  Taft receiving little attention and carrying just eight electoral votes  73  Wilson  in a spirited campaign  defeated both rivals  Under his leadership  the new Congress enacted one of the most notable legislative programs in American history  Its first task was tariff revision   The tariff duties must be altered   Wilson said   We must abolish everything that bears any semblance of privilege   The Underwood Tariff in 1913 provided substantial rate reductions on imported raw materials and foodstuffs  cotton and woolen goods  iron and steel  and removed the duties from more than a hundred other items  Although the act retained many protective features  it was a genuine attempt to lower the cost of living for American workers  The second item on the Democratic program was a reorganization of the banking and currency system   Control   said Wilson   must be public  not private  must be vested in the government itself  so that the banks may be the instruments  not the masters  of business and of individual enterprise and initiative   Passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was one of Wilson s most enduring legislative accomplishments  for he successfully developed negotiated a compromise between Wall Street  and the agrarians  The plan built on ideas developed by Senator Nelson Aldrich  who discovered the European nations had more efficient central banks that helped their internal business and international trade  The new organization divided the country into 12 districts  with a Federal Reserve Bank in each  all supervised by a Federal Reserve Board  These banks were owned by local banks and served as depositories for the cash reserves of member banks  Until the Federal Reserve Act  the U S  government had left control of its money supply largely to unregulated private banks  While the official medium of exchange was gold coins  most loans and payments were carried out with bank notes  backed by the promise of redemption in gold  The trouble with this system was that the banks were tempted to reach beyond their cash reserves  prompting periodic panics during which fearful depositors raced to turn their bank paper into coin  With the passage of the act  greater flexibility in the money supply was assured  and provision was made for issuing federal reserve notes paper dollars to meet business demands  The Fed opened in 1914 and played a central role in funding the World War  After 1914  issues of money and banking faded away from the political agenda  74  To resolve the long standing dispute over trusts  the Wilson Administration dropped the  trust busting  legal strategies of Roosevelt and Taft and relied on the new a Federal Trade Commission to issue orders prohibiting  unfair methods of competition  by business concerns in interstate trade  In addition a second law  the Clayton Antitrust Act  forbade many corporate practices that had thus far escaped specific condemnation interlocking directorates  price discrimination among purchasers  use of the injunction in labor disputes and ownership by one corporation of stock in similar enterprises  After 1914 the trust issue faded away from politics  75  The Adamson Act of 1916 established an eight hour day for railroad labor and solidified the ties between the labor unions and the Democratic Party  76  The record of achievement won Wilson a firm place in American history as one of the nation s foremost liberal reformers  Wilson s domestic reputation would soon be overshadowed by his record as a wartime President who led his country to victory but could not hold the support of his people for the peace that followed   edit  World War I Main articles  United States in World War I  United States home front during World War I  American Expeditionary Force  and Aftermath of World War I Woodrow Wilson   edit  Entry Main article  American entry into World War I Firmly maintaining neutrality when World War I began in Europe in 1914  the United States helped supply the Allies  but could not ship anything to Britain because of the German blockade  Sympathies among many politically and culturally influential Americans had favored the British cause from the start of the war  as typified by industrialist Samuel Insull  born in London  who helped young Americans enlist in British or Canadian forces  On the other hand  especially in the Midwest  many Irish Americans and German Americans opposed any American involvement  the Irish because they hated the British  and the Germans because they feared they would come under attack  German efforts to use its submarines   U boats   to blockade Britain resulted in the deaths of American travelers and sailors  and attacks on passenger liners caused public outrage  Most notable was torpedoing without warning the passenger liner Lusitania in 1915  Germany promised not to repeat but decided in early 1917 that unrestricted U boat warfare against all ships headed to Britain would win the war  albeit at the cost of American entry  When Americans read the text of the German offer to Mexico  known as the Zimmermann Telegram  they saw an offer for Mexico to go to war with Germany against the United States  with German funding  with the promise of the return of the lost territories of Arizona  New Mexico  and Texas  Congress voted on April 6  1917 to declare war  but it was far from unanimous  77   edit  Germania See also  German Americans World War I anti German sentiment German Americans were sometimes accused of being too sympathetic to the German Empire  Former president Theodore Roosevelt denounced  hyphenated Americanism   insisting that dual loyalties were impossible in wartime  A small minority came out for Germany  or ridiculed the British  About 1  of the 480 000 enemy aliens of German birth were imprisoned in 1917 18  The allegations included spying for Germany  or endorsing the German war effort  78  Thousands were forced to buy war bonds to show their loyalty  79  One person was killed by a mob  in Collinsville  Illinois  German born Robert Prager was dragged from jail as a suspected spy and lynched  80  The war saw a phobia of anything German engulf the nation  Sauerkraut was rechristened  liberty cabbage   for example 81   edit  Patriotism The Wilson Administration created the Committee on Public Information  CPI  to control war information and provide pro war propaganda  The private American Protective League  working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation  was one of many private right wing  patriotic associations  that sprang up to support the war and at the same time fight labor unions and various left wing and anti war organizations  The U S  Congress passed  and Wilson signed  the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918  The Sedition Act criminalized any expression of opinion that used  disloyal  profane  scurrilous or abusive language  about the U S  government  flag or armed forces  Government police action  private vigilante groups and public war hysteria compromised the civil liberties of many Americans who disagreed with Wilson s policies  82   edit  Draft Navy poster by Howard Chandler Christy The United States was remarkably unprepared for war in 1917  as it had not fought a major conflict since 1865  The military was tiny and had some weapons that were decades old  A hasty expansion and modernization of the armed forces was thus launched  The draft began in spring 1917 but volunteers were also accepted  Four million men and thousands of women joined the services for the duration  83   edit  Economic confusion in 1917 In terms of munitions production  the 15 months after April 1917 involved an amazing parade of mistakes  misguided enthusiasm  and confusion  Americans were willing enough  but they did not know their proper role  Washington was unable to figure out what to do when  or even to decide who was in charge  Typical of the confusion was the coal shortage that hit in December 1917  Because coal was by far the major source of energy and heat a grave crisis ensued  There was in fact plenty of coal being mined  but 44 000 loaded freight and coal cars were tied up in horrendous traffic jams in the rail yards of the East Coast  Two hundred ships were waiting in New York harbor for cargo that was delayed by the mess  The solution included nationalizing the coal mines and the railroads for the duration  shutting down factories one day a week to save fuel  and enforcing a strict system of priorities  Only in March 1918 did Washington finally take control of the crisis  84   edit  Women The war saw many women taking traditionally men s jobs for the first time in American history  Many worked on the assembly lines of factories  producing tanks  trucks and munitions  For the first time  department stores employed African American women as elevator operators and cafeteria waitresses  The Food Administration helped housewives prepare nutritious meals with less waste and with optimum use of the foods available  Most important  the morale of the women remained high  as millions join the Red Cross as volunteers to help soldiers and their families  With rare exceptions  the women did not protest the draft  85   edit  Labor Samuel Gompers  head of the AFL  and nearly all labor unions were strong supporters of the war effort  They minimized strikes as wages soared and full employment was reached  The AFL unions strongly encouraged their young men to enlist in the military  and fiercely opposed efforts to reduce recruiting and slow war production by the anti war labor union called the Industrial Workers of the World  IWW  and also left wing Socialists  President Wilson appointed Gompers to the powerful Council of National Defense  where he set up the War Committee on Labor  The AFL membership soared to 2 4 million in 1917  In 1919  the Union tried to make their gains permanent and called a series of major strikes in meat  steel and other industries  The strikes  all of which failed  forced unions back to their position around 1910  86  Anti war socialists controlled the IWW  which fought against the war effort and was in turn shut down by legal action by the federal government   edit  Over there On the battlefields of France in spring 1918  the fresh American troops were enthusiastically welcomed by the war weary Allied armies in the summer of 1918  They arrived at the rate of 10 000 a day  at a time that the Germans were unable to replace their losses  After the Allies turned back the powerful final German offensive  Spring Offensive   the Americans played a central role in the Allied final offensive  Hundred Days Offensive   Victory over Germany achieved on November 11  1918  87   edit  Treaty Britain  France and Italy imposed severe economic penalties on Germany in the Treaty of Versailles  The United States Senate did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles  instead  the United States signed separate peace treaties with Germany and her allies  The Senate also refused to enter the newly created League of Nations on Wilson s terms  and Wilson rejected the Senate s compromise proposal   edit  Notes   U S
