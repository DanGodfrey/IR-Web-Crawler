Mind uploading From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This page is about whole brain emulation in futurism  transhumanism and science  See also Mind uploading in fiction  Whole brain emulation or mind uploading  sometimes called mind transfer  is the hypothetical process of transferring or copying a conscious mind from a brain to a non biological substrate by scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device  The computer would have to run a simulation model so faithful to the original that it would behave in essentially the same way as the original brain  or for all practical purposes  indistinguishably  1  The simulated mind is assumed to be part of a virtual reality simulated world  supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model  Alternatively  the simulated mind could be assumed to reside in a computer inside  or connected to  a humanoid robot or a biological body  replacing its brain  Whole brain emulation is discussed by futurists as a  logical endpoint  1  of the topical computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields  both about brain simulation for medical research purposes  It is discussed in artificial intelligence research publications 2  as an approach to strong AI  Among futurists and within the transhumanist movement it is an important proposed life extension technology  originally suggested in biomedical literature in 1971  3  It is a central conceptual feature of numerous science fiction novels and films  Whole brain emulation is considered by some scientists as a theoretical and futuristic but possible technology  1  although mainstream research funders and scientific journals remain skeptical  Several contradictory predictions have been made about when a whole human brain can be emulated  some of the predicted dates have already passed  Substantial mainstream research and development are however being done in relevant areas including development of faster super computers  virtual reality  brain computer interfaces  animal brain mapping and simulation  connectomics and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains  4  The question whether an emulated brain can be a human mind is debated by philosophers  and may be viewed as impossible by those who hold a dualistic view of the world  which is common in many religions  Contents 1 Overview 2 Theoretical benefits 2 1 Immortality backup 2 2 Speedup 2 3 Space travel 2 4 Multiple parallel existence 3 Relevant technologies and

Simple artificial neural network The human brain contains about 100 billion nerve cells called neurons  each individually linked to other neurons by way of connectors called axons and dendrites  Signals at the junctures  synapses  of these connections are transmitted by the release and detection of chemicals known as neurotransmitters  The established neuroscientific consensus is that the human mind is largely an emergent property of the information processing of this neural network  Importantly  neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind  such as learning  memory  and consciousness  are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws  For example  Christof Koch and Giulio Tononi wrote in IEEE Spectrum   Consciousness is part of the natural world  It depends  we believe  only on mathematics and logic and on the imperfectly known laws of physics  chemistry  and biology  it does not arise from some magical or otherworldly quality   5  The concept of mind uploading is based on this mechanistic view of the mind  and denies the vitalist view of human life and consciousness  Many eminent computer scientists and neuroscientists have predicted that computers will be capable of thought and even attain consciousness  including Koch and Tononi  5 Douglas Hofstadter  6 Jeff Hawkins  6 Marvin Minsky  7 Randal A  Koene  8  and Rodolfo Llinas  9  Such a machine intelligence capability might provide a computational substrate necessary for uploading  However  even though uploading is dependent upon such a general capability it is conceptually distinct from general forms of AI in that it results from dynamic reanimation of information derived from a specific human mind so that the mind retains a sense of historical identity  other forms are possible but would compromise or eliminate the life extension feature generally associated with uploading   The transferred and reanimated information would become a form of artificial intelligence  sometimes called an infomorph or  no morph   Many theorists have presented models of the brain and have established a range of estimates of the amount of computing power needed for partial and complete simulations  citation needed  Using these models  some have estimated that uploading may become possible within decades if trends such as Moore s Law continue  10  The prospect of uploading human consciousness in this manner raises many philosophical questions involving identity  individuality and if the soul and mind can be defined as the information content of the brain  as well as numerous problems of animal experiments  medical ethics and morality of the process   edit  Theoretical benefits  edit  Immortality backup Main article  Digital immortality In theory  if the information and processes of the mind can be disassociated from the biological body  they are no longer tied to the individual limits and lifespan of that body  Furthermore  information within a brain could be partly or wholly copied or transferred to one or more other substrates  including digital storage or another brain   thereby reducing or eliminating mortality risk  This general proposal appears to have been first made in the biomedical literature in 1971 by biogerontologist George M  Martin of the University of Washington  3   edit  Speedup A computer based intelligence such as an upload could potentially think much faster than a human even if it were no more intelligent  Human neurons exchange electrochemical signals with a maximum speed of about 150 meters per second  whereas the speed of light is about 300 million meters per second  about two million times faster  Also  neurons can generate a maximum of about 200 to 1000 action potentials or  spikes  per second  whereas the number of signals per second in modern when   computer chips is about 3 GHz citation needed   about two million times greater  and expected to increase by at least a factor 100  Therefore  even if the computer components responsible for simulating a brain were not significantly smaller than a biological brain  and even if the temperature of these components was not significantly lower  Eliezer Yudkowsky of the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence calculates a theoretical upper bound for the speed of a future artificial neural network  It could in theory run about 1 million times faster than a real brain  experiencing about a year of subjective time in only 31 seconds of real time  11  12  13  However  in practice this massively parallel implementation would require separate computational units for each of the hundred billion neurons and each of the hundred trillion synapses  That requires an enormously large computer or artificial neural network in comparison with today s super computers  12  In a less futuristic implementation  time sharing would allow several neurons to be emulated sequentially by the same computational unit  Thus the size of the computer would be restricted  but the speedup would be lower  Assuming that cortical minicolumns organized into hypercolumns are the computational units  mammal brains can be emulated by today s super computers  but with slower speed than in a biological brain  14   edit  Space travel Mind uploading poses potential benefits for interstellar space travel because it would allow immortal beings to travel the cosmos without suffering from extreme acceleration  A whole society of uploads can be emulated by a computer on a very small spaceship  that would consume much less energy than traditional space travels  The uploads would have control of the ship and would be able to make decisions about the crafts voyage in real time  independent of signals from Earth  that might eventually take months or years to reach the craft as it journeys out into the cosmos  Because a virtual conscious can be set into a state of hibernation  or slowed down  the virtual minds need not experience the boredom of hundreds if not thousands of years of travel  Instead they would only awake when on board computers detected that the craft had arrived at its destination  Another hypothetical benefit is that in the unlikely event that the craft comes in contact with intelligent extra terrestrial life it would be able to make rational decisions whether or not contact is feasible  citation needed  In the book Omega point  the author suggests that the universe eventually would be colonialized by such machine intelligence  Another possibility for travel would be to transmit a mind via laser  or via radio between two already inhabited locations  Such travel would require only the energy to transmit enough powerful signals so that they reach the target destination  The travelers experienced time from transmitter to receiver would be instantaneous   edit  Multiple parallel existence Another concept explored in science fiction is the idea of more than one running  copy  of a human mind existing at once  Such copies could potentially allow an  individual  to experience many things at once  and later integrate the experiences of all copies into a central mentality at some point in the future  effectively allowing a single sentient being to  be many places at once  and  do many things at once   this concept has been explored in fiction  Such partial and complete copies of a sentient being raise interesting questions regarding identity and individuality   edit  Relevant technologies and techniques  edit  Computational capacity Futurist Ray Kurzweil s projected supercomputer processing power based on Moore s law exponential development of computing capacity  Here the computational capacity doubling time is assumed to be 1 2 years  Advocates of mind uploading point to Moore s law to support the notion that the necessary computing power is expected to become available within a few decades  However  the actual computational requirements for running an uploaded human mind are very difficult to quantify  potentially rendering such an argument specious  Regardless of the techniques used to capture or recreate the function of a human mind  the processing demands are likely to be immense  due to the large number of neurons in the human brain along with the considerable complexity of each neuron  In 2004  Henry Markram  lead researcher of the  Blue Brain Project   has stated that  it is not  their  goal to build an intelligent neural network   based solely on the computational demands such a project would have  15  It will be very difficult because  in the brain  every molecule is a powerful computer and we would need to simulate the structure and function of trillions upon trillions of molecules as well as all the rules that govern how they interact  You would literally need computers that are trillions of times bigger and faster than anything existing today  16  Five years later  after successful simulation of part of a rat brain  the same scientist was much more bold and optimistic  In 2009  when he was director of the Blue Brain Project  he claimed that A detailed  functional artificial human brain can be built within the next 10 years  17   edit  Simulation model scale A high level cognitive AI model of the brain architecture is not required for brain emulation Simple neuron model  Black box dynamic non linear signal processing system Metabolism model  The movement of positively charged ions through the ion channels controls the membrane electrical action potential in an axon  Since the function of the human mind  and how it might arise from the working of the brain s neural network  are poorly understood issues  mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network emulation  Rather than having to understand the high level psychological processes and large scale structures of the brain  and model them using classical artificial intelligence methods and cognitive psychology models  the low level structure of the underlying neural network is captured  mapped and emulated with a computer system  In computer science terminology  rather than analyzing and reverse engineering the behavior of the algorithms and data structures that resides in the brain  a blueprint of its source code is translated to another programming language  The human mind and the personal identity then  theoretically  is generated by the emulated neural network in an identical fashion to it being generated by the biological neural network  On the other hand  a molecule scale simulation of the brain is not expected to be required  provided that the functioning of the neurons is not affected by quantum mechanical processes  The neural network emulation approach only requires that the functioning and interaction of neurons and synapses are understood  It is expected that it is sufficient with a black box signal processing model of how the neurons respond to nerve impulses  electrical as well as chemical synaptic transmission   A sufficiently complex and accurate model of the neurons is required  A traditional artificial neural network model  for example multi layer perceptron network model  is not considered as sufficient  A dynamic spiking neural network model is required  which reflects that the neuron fires only when a membrane potential reaches a certain level  It is likely that the model must include delays  non linear functions and differential equations describing the relation between electrophysical parameters such as electrical currents  voltages  membrane states  ion channel states  and neuromodulators  Since learning and long term memory are believed to result from strengthening or weakening the synapses via a mechanism known as synaptic plasticity or synaptic adaptation  the model should include this mechanism  The response of sensory receptors to various stimuli must also be modeled  Furthermore  the model may have to include metabolism  i e  how the neurons are affected by hormones and other chemical substances that may cross the blood brain barrier  It is considered likely that the model must include currently unknown neuromodulators  neurotransmitters and ion channels  It is considered unlikely that the simulation model has to include protein interaction  which would make it computationally complex  1  A digital computer simulation model of an analog system such as the brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion  However  the biological neurons also suffer from randomness and limited precision  for example due to background noise  The errors of the discrete model can be made smaller than the randomness of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate  and sufficiently accurate models of non linearities  The computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations  preferably in real time   edit  Scanning and mapping scale of an individual When modelling and simulating the brain of a specific individual  a brain map or connectivity database showing the connections between the neurons must be extracted from an anatomic model of the brain  For whole brain simulation  this network map should show the connectivity of the whole nervous system  including the spinal cord  sensory receptors  and muscle cells  Destructive scanning of a small sample of tissue from a mouse brain including synaptic details is possible as of 2010  18  However  if short term memory and working memory include prolonged or repeated firing of neurons  as well as intra neural dynamic processes  the electrical and chemical signal state of the synapses and neurons may be hard to extract  The uploaded mind may then perceive a memory loss of the events and mental processes immediately before the time of brain scanning  1  A full brain map would occupy less than 2 x 1016 bytes  20 000 TB  and would store the addresses of the connected neurons  the synapse type and the synapse  weight  for each of the brains  1015 synapses  1  not in citation given   edit  Serial sectioning Serial sectioning of a brain A possible method for mind uploading is serial sectioning  in which the brain tissue and perhaps other parts of the nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer  which for frozen samples at nano scale requires a cryo ultramicrotome  thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections  19  The exposed surface of frozen nerve tissue would be scanned and recorded  and then the surface layer of tissue removed  While this would be a very slow and labor intensive process  research is currently underway to automate the collection and microscopy of serial sections  20  The scans would then be analyzed  and a model of the neural net recreated in the system that the mind was being uploaded into  There are uncertainties with this approach using current microscopy techniques  If it is possible to replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone  then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique  20  However  as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events  particularly at synapses  but also at other places on the neuron s cell membrane   this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions  It may be possible to extend the techniques of serial sectioning and to capture the internal molecular makeup of neurons  through the use of sophisticated immunohistochemistry staining methods which could then be read via confocal laser scanning microscopy  However  as the physiological genesis of  mind  is not currently known  this method may not be able to access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity   edit  Brain imaging Process from MRI acquisition to whole brain structural network 21    Magnetoencephalography   It may also be possible to create functional 3D maps of the brain activity  using advanced neuroimaging technology  such as functional MRI  fMRI  for mapping change in blood flow   Magnetoencephalography  MEG  for mapping of electrical currents   or combinations of multiple methods  to build a detailed three dimensional model of the brain using non invasive and non destructive methods  Today  fMRI is often combined with MEG for creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks  as the methods complement each other  Even though current imaging technology lacks the spatial resolution needed to gather the information needed for such a scan  important recent and future developments are predicted to substantially improve both spatial and temporal resolutions of existing technologies  22   edit  Brain computer interfaces Brain computer interface  BCI  Brain computer interfaces  BCI   also known as neuro computer interfaces  direct neuron interfaces or cerebral interfaces  constitute one of the hypothetical technologies for the reading of information in the dynamically functioning brain citation needed   The production of this or a similar device may be essential to the possibility of mind uploading a living human subject   edit  Current research Main

right   January 2012  Several animal brains have been mapped and at least partly simulated   edit  Simulation of C  elegans roundworm neural system Brain map of the C  elegans roundworm 302 neurons  interconnected by 5000 synnapses  The connectivity of the neural circuit for touch sensitivity of the simple C  elegans nematode  roundworm  was mapped in 1985  23  and partly simulated in 1993  24  Several software simulation models of the complete neural and muscular system  and to some extent the worm s physical environment  have been presented since 2004  and are in some cases available for downloading  25  However  we still lack understanding of how the neurons and the connections between them generate the surprisingly complex range of behaviors that are observed in this relatively simple organism  26  27   edit  Simulation of Drosophila fruit fly neural system The brain belonging to the fruit fly Drosophila is also thoroughly studied  and to some extent simulated  28   edit  Mouse brain simulation An artificial neural network described as being  as big and as complex as half of a mouse brain  was run on an IBM blue gene supercomputer by a University of Nevada research team in 2007  A simulated time of one second took ten seconds of computer time  The researchers said they had seen  biologically consistent  nerve impulses flowed through the virtual cortex  However  the simulation lacked the structures seen in real mice brains  and they intend to improve the accuracy of the neuron model  29  Blue Brain is a project  launched in May 2005 by IBM and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne  with the aim to create a computer simulation of a mammalian cortical column  down to the molecular level  30  The project uses a supercomputer based on IBM s Blue Gene design to simulate the electrical behavior of neurons based upon their synaptic connectivity and complement of intrinsic membrane currents  The initial goal of the project  completed in December 2006  31  was the simulation of a rat neocortical column  which can be considered the smallest functional unit of the neocortex  the part of the brain thought to be responsible for higher functions such as conscious thought   containing 10 000 neurons  and 108synapses   Between 1995 and 2005  Henry Markram mapped the types of neurons and their connections in such a column  In November 2007  32  the project reported the end of the first phase  delivering a data driven process for creating  validating  and researching the neocortical column  The project seeks to eventually reveal aspects of human cognition and various psychiatric disorders caused by malfunctioning neurons  such as autism  and to understand how pharmacological agents affect network behavior  An organization called the Brain Preservation Foundation was founded in 2010 and is offering a Brain Preservation Technology prize to promote exploration of brain preservation technology in service of humanity  The Prize  currently  106 000  will be awarded in two parts  25  to the first international team to preserve a whole mouse brain  and 75  to the first team to preserve a whole large animal brain in a manner that could also be adopted for humans in a hospital or hospice setting immediately upon clinical death  Ultimately the goal of this prize is to generate a whole brain map which may be used in support of separate efforts to upload and possibly  reboot  a mind in virtual space   edit  Issues  edit  Legal  ethical  political and economical issues This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  See also  Ship of Theseus If simulated worlds would come true  it may be difficult to ensure the protection of human rights  For example  social science researchers might be tempted to secretly expose simulated minds  or whole isolated societies of simulated minds  to controlled experiments in which many copies of the same minds are exposed  serially or simultaneously  to different test conditions  The only limited physical resource to be expected in a simulated world is the computational capacity  and thus the speed and complexity of the simulation  Wealthy or privileged individuals in a society of uploads might thus experience more subjective time than others in the same real time  or may be able to run multiple copies of themselves or others  and thus produce more service and become even more wealthy  Others may suffer from computational resource starvation and show a slow motion behavior  The development of reliable whole human brain emulation technology may require extensive and sometimes painful animal experiments  citation needed   edit  Copying vs  moving This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Another philosophical issue with mind uploading is whether an uploaded mind is really the  same  sentience  or simply an exact copy with the same memories and personality  or  indeed  what the difference could be between such a copy and the original  see the Swampman thought experiment   This issue is especially complex if the original remains essentially unchanged by the procedure  thereby resulting in an obvious copy which could potentially have rights separate from the unaltered  obvious original  Most projected brain scanning technologies  such as serial sectioning of the brain  would necessarily be destructive  and the original brain would not survive the brain scanning procedure  But if it can be kept intact  the computer based consciousness could be a copy of the still living biological person  It is in that case implicit that copying a consciousness could be as feasible as literally moving it into one or several copies  since these technologies generally involve simulation of a human brain in a computer of some sort  and digital files such as computer programs can be copied precisely  It is usually assumed that once the versions are exposed to different sensory inputs  their experiences would begin to diverge  but all their memories up until the moment of the copying would remain the same  The problem is made even more serious by the possibility of creating a potentially infinite number of initially identical copies of the original person  which would of course all exist simultaneously as distinct beings  The most parsimonious view of this phenomenon is that the two  or more  minds would share memories of their past but from the point of duplication would simply be distinct minds  although this is complicated by merging   Many complex variations are possible  Depending on computational capacity  the simulation may run at faster or slower simulation time as compared to the elapsed physical time  resulting in that the simulated mind would perceive that the physical world is running in slow motion or fast motion respectively  while biological persons will see the simulated mind in fast or slow motion respectively  A brain simulation can be started  paused  backed up and rerun from a saved backup state at any time  The simulated mind would in the latter case forget everything that has happened after the instant of backup  and perhaps not even be aware that it is repeating itself  An older version of a simulated mind may meet a younger version and share experiences with it   edit  Bekenstein bound The Bekenstein bound is an upper limit on information that can be contained within a given finite region of space which has a finite amount of energy or  conversely  the maximum amount of information required to perfectly describe a given physical system down to the quantum level  33  An average human brain has a weight of 1 5 kg and a volume of 1260 cm3  The energy  E   m c2  will be 1 34813 1017 J and if the brain is approximate to a sphere then the radius  V   4   r3 3  will be 6 70030 10 2 m  The Bekenstein bound  I   2   r E   c ln 2  for an average human brain would be 2 58991 1042 bit and represents an upper bound on the information needed to perfectly recreate the average human brain down to the quantum level  This implies that the number of different states    2I  of the human brain  and of the mind if the physicalism is true  is at most 107 79640 1041  However  as described above  many mind uploading advocates expect that quantum level models and molecule scale simulation of the neurons will not be needed  so the Bekenstein bound only represents a maximum upper limit  The hippocampus of a human adult brain has been estimated to store a limit of up to 2 5 petabyte of binary data equivalent  34   edit  Mind uploading in science fiction Main article  Mind uploading in fiction  edit  Mind uploading advocates Followers of Ra lism advocate mind uploading in the process of human cloning to achieve eternal life  Living inside of a computer is also seen by followers as an eminent possibility  35  However  mind uploading is also advocated by a number of secular researchers in neuroscience and artificial intelligence  such as Marvin Minsky  In 1993  Joe Strout created a small web site called the Mind Uploading Home Page  and began advocating the idea in cryonics circles and elsewhere on the net  That site has not been actively updated in recent years  but it has spawned other sites including MindUploading org  run by Randal A  Koene  Ph D   who also moderates a mailing list on the topic  These advocates see mind uploading as a medical procedure which could eventually save countless lives  Many transhumanists look forward to the development and deployment of mind uploading technology  with transhumanists such as Nick Bostrom predicting that it will become possible within the 21st century due to technological trends such as Moore s Law  1  The book Beyond Humanity  CyberEvolution and Future Minds by Gregory S  Paul  amp  Earl D  Cox  is about the eventual  and  to the authors  almost inevitable  evolution of computers into sentient beings  but also deals with human mind transfer  Richard Doyle s Wetwares  Experiments in PostVital Living deals extensively with uploading from the perspective of distributed embodiment  arguing for example that humans are currently part of the  artificial life phenotype   Doyle s vision reverses the polarity on uploading  with artificial life forms such as uploads actively seeking out biological embodiment as part of their reproductive strategy  Raymond Kurzweil  a prominent advocate of transhumanism and the likelihood of a technological singularity  has suggested that the easiest path to human level artificial intelligence may lie in  reverse engineering the human brain   which he usually uses to refer to the creation of a new intelligence based on the general  principles of operation  of the brain  but he also sometimes uses the term to refer to the notion of uploading individual human minds based on highly detailed scans and simulations  This idea is discussed on pp  198 203 of his book
