Comics  27  the first Batman story  Originally  the vehicle was a simple red convertible with nothing special in its functions  Although the Batplane was introduced in Detective Comics No  31  the name  Batmobile  was not applied to Batman and Robin s automobile until Detective Comics No  48  February 1941   Other bat vehicles soon followed  including the Batcycle  Batboat and Robin s Redbird  The car s design gradually evolved  It became a  specially built high powered auto  by Detective Comics  30  and in Batman  5  it began featuring an ever larger bat hood ornament and an ever darker paint job  Eventually  the predominant designs included a large  dark colored body and bat like accessories  including large tailfins scalloped to resemble a bat s wings  Batman No  5  Spring 1941  introduced a long  powerful  streamlined Batmobile with a tall scalloped fin and an intimidating bat head on the front  Three pages after it was introduced  it was forced off a cliff by the Joker to crash in the ravine below  However  an identical Batmobile appeared in the next story in the same issue  The live action television series was so popular that its campy humor and its Batmobile  a superficially modified concept car  the decade old Lincoln Futura  owned by George Barris whose shop did the work  2  were quickly introduced into the Batman comic books  But the high camp and general silliness of the television show did not sit well with long time Batman comic book fans  So  when the series was canceled in 1968  the comic books reacted by becoming darker and more serious  including having Batman abandon that Batmobile  Its replacement for a number of years was a much simpler model with a stylized bat s head silhouette decal on the hood being the only decoration of note  The 1960s TV style Batmobile still appears from time to time in the comic books  most recently in Detective Comics  850 and the issues of Batman Confidential  In mid 1985  a special variation of the Super Powers toyline Batmobile appeared in both Batman and Detective Comics  3  This design had a full set of front and rear canopies   Coke bottle  sides  integrated fins  and generally rounder features  just like the toy  The only difference between this car and its toy counterpart is the nose  which was occasionally drawn to appear longer and more pointed  In Batman  The Dark Knight Returns  the Batmobile has been modified into a tank like armored riot control vehicle  complete with machine guns shooting rubber bullets  a large cannon mounted on the front  and large tank treads in place of tires  According to Batman s narration  the only thing that can penetrate its armor  isn t from this planet   Batman also mentions that it was Dick Grayson who came up with the name  The tank like vehicle appears to take up two lanes of traffic on a normal road  evidenced when returning from Batman s initial fight with the leader of the Mutants  and thus is too big for normal land travel around Gotham  In the scenes prior to Batman s last stand with the Joker  Batman uses a motorcycle to traverse the city  using the tank again after the attempted nuclear strike and fires in Gotham  This Batmobile reappeared in All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder  4  which shows its construction by robots in the Batcave  Beginning in the 1990s  the number of comics featuring Batman mushroomed with spin off titles  limited series  and graphic novels  At the same time  there was considerable experimentation with styles of illustration  With different illustration styles in so many different books  there was naturally a corresponding diversity of designs for the Batmobile  This has continued with designs for the Batmobile ranging from conservative and practical to highly stylized to outlandish  During the Cataclysm storyline  it is revealed that Batman has hidden a number of spare vehicles across the city just in case  A Humvee serves as a primary mean of transportation to cross the earthquake ravaged city during the Aftershock storyline  as most of the Batmobiles are wrecked by the quake  These vehicles are not as sophisticated as the Batmobiles  but some of them are armored to withstand weaponry mounted on military automobiles  In the Batman  Hush storyline  a splash page by Jim Lee shows all the previous Batmobiles  from comics  movies  and all TV series  in storage in the Batcave  In addition  some incarnations of the character  such as Batman  The Animated Series  establish that Batman has a large ground vehicle fleet of various makes and models as well as utility vehicles to use when the Batmobile would be too conspicuous  In Frank Miller s All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder  the car can morph into a harrier jet and a submarine  Dick Grayson comments that the name Batmobile is  totally queer   4  However  in Batman  The Dark Knight Returns  which exists in the same continuity  5  Grayson was stated as the one who invented the name  6  The metafictional Batmobile Owner s Manual  released in 2008  gives theoretical specifications of the car as if it were real  The book states that the Batmobile s five cylinder engine is more powerful than turbine jet engines  and capable of achieving up to 1 700 horsepower  1 300 kW   7  In the new series Batman and Robin  a new Batmobile is unveiled  This model is capable of flight  although is not as maneuverable as the Batwing  8  It can fire 19 types of projectiles  one of which is a flame retardant non toxic foam  and features a concussive sonic blast device  8  The new Batmobile was designed and constructed by Bruce Wayne  however  its construction was the source of great frustration to him  as mentioned by Alfred  In Batman and Robin  1 it is revealed that Bruce s son  Damian Wayne  solved the problem of its inability to fly   edit  Film serials  edit  Batman Main article  Batman  serial  In the 1943 serial film Batman  a black Cadillac was used by Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson  as well as their secret identities Batman and Robin  Alfred chauffeured the Dynamic Duo in both identities  Eventually a limousine replaced the Cadillac   edit  Batman and Robin Main

series  The Batmobile as seen in the 1960s Batman TV series  The Batmobile built for and used in the 1966 1968 live action television show Batman and its film adaptation was a customized vehicle that originated as a one off Ford concept car of the 1950s  The TV Batmobile was based on the Lincoln Futura Show Car  10  originally created by William M  Schmidt and his design team at the Lincoln Styling Department  its rakish lines are said to have been inspired by the mako shark and the manta ray  In 1954 the Futura prototype was built entirely by hand by the Ghia Body Works in Turin  Italy at a reported cost of US 250 000  it was unveiled in its original pearlescent Frost Blue white paint finish on 8 January 1955 at the Chicago Auto Show  11  In 1959  sporting a fresh red paint job  the Futura was featured in the film It Started with a Kiss  starring Debbie Reynolds and Glenn Ford  In late 1965 20th Century Fox Television and William Dozier s Greenway Productions contracted renowned Hollywood car customizer Dean Jeffries to design and build a  Batmobile  for their upcoming Batman TV series  He started customizing a 1959 Cadillac  but when the studio wanted the program on the air in January 1966  and therefore filming sooner than he could provide the car  Jeffries was paid off  and the project went to George Barris  12  Barris was trying to get Hollywood s attention with the Futura  but aside from  It Started With a Kiss  in 1959  the Futura had been languishing in his Hollywood shop for several years  With only three weeks to finish the Batmobile  although in recent years Jeffries says that his car was dropped because he was told it was needed in  a week and a half   13  he was quoted in 1988 as saying  three weeks  14  as well   Barris decided that  rather than building a car from scratch  it would be relatively easy to transform the distinctive Futura into the famous crime fighting vehicle  Design work was conducted by Herb Grasse  working as an associate designer for Barris  Barris hired Bill Cushenbery to do the metal modifications to the car and its conversion into the Batmobile was completed in just three weeks  at a reported cost of US 30 000  They used the primer painted  white striped car in October  1965  for a network presentation reel  Shortly afterward  the car was painted gloss black with  fluorescent cerise  stripes  Barris retained ownership of the car and leased it back to 20th Century Fox and Greenway Productions for use in the series  The estimated 1966 value of the Barris Batmobile was about  125 000  but today it is estimated to be worth at least US 2 million  15  In December 1965 Ford sold the Futura to Barris  despite its huge original production cost the equivalent of approximately US 2 million in 2009 16     Barris was able to purchase the vehicle for the nominal sum of  1 00 and  other valuable consideration   17  When filming for the series began  several problems arose due to the age of the car  it overheated  the battery went dead  and the expensive Mickey Thompson tires kept blowing  By mid season  the engine and transmission were replaced with those of a Ford Galaxie  The most frequent visual influence of this car is that later Batmobiles usually have a rear rocket thruster that fires as the car makes a fast start   edit  Technical specifications Curb weight  5500 lb Wheelbase  126 in

seen on the Batmobile used in these films was fully functional  including the gas turbine powering the vehicle  which consumed fuel so fast that there was only enough fuel capacity to run it for the approximately fifteen seconds of the longest shot in which the viewer can see it operating  This Batmobile s gadgets include a nose mounted aluminum Cable Cutter Blade  Bat Ray Projector  Anti Theft

the Batphone  Emergency Bat Turn Lever  Anti Fire Activator  Bat Smoke  Bat Photoscope  and many other Bat gadgets  If needed  the Batmobile is capable of a quick 180   bat turn  thanks to two rear mounted ten foot Deist parachutes  The main license plate seen throughout the series was 2F 3567  Some changes were made during the run of the series  including different license plates  removal of the Futura steering wheel and substitution with a 1958 Edsel steering wheel  and the addition of extra gadgets such as a net in the trunk  remote controlled driving  a rear facing camera under the turbine exhaust port  and the Bat Ram  18  Other devices included  19  Emergency Bat turn Lever  releases the Batmobile s parachute that enables quick turns  Bat ray  capable of many tasks  such as

can be reproduced remotely in the Batmobile   Batphone Police band cut in switch Mobile tracking scope Remote Bat Computer Switch Anti theft switch  edit  Other appearances Barris built two fiberglass copies of the original Batmobile for exhibition on the car show circuit and a third for exhibition drag racing  Eventually  the three copies  and the screen used metal Futura Batmobile  were covered with a black velvet  fuzz  paint  presumably to hide stress cracks in the fiberglass bodies  Later  all three were restored to their gloss black paint job  The three replicas are all based on a 1965 1966 Ford Galaxie  Barris has retained ownership of the original television series car  which is currently on display at Barris Customs in North Hollywood  California  The three Barris copies all reside in private collections  including the exhibition drag racing version driven by wheelstanding driver Wild Bill Shrewsberry  This car was built with a dual quad Holman Moody Ford 427 V8 engine  Art Carr prepared Ford C6 automatic transmission and 5 14 gears in the rear end  Quarter mile times were in the mid 12 second range  primarily because Shrewsberry would launch the car in second gear and smoke the overinflated rear tires for show down most of the strip  The  rocket exhaust  was made functional via a tank filled with either gasoline or kerosene which was pumped out the exhaust port and ignited electrically  The  2 Barris built Batmobile is owned by Dr  Anderson  New Jersey  The  3 Barris built Batmobile was sold by the Hart estate recently to an unknown buyer  The  4 Barris built Batmobile is owned by Mr  Jackson  California  The so called  5 Batmobile is owned by Scott Chinery s widow  New Jersey   edit  Replicas In October  2010  DC Comics authorized Fiberglass Freaks in Logansport  Indiana  to build officially licensed 1966 Batmobile replicas  One of Fiberglass Freaks  1966 Batmobile Replicas sold at an R  amp  M auction for  216 000  A replica Batmobile is displayed alongside two of the movie batmobiles at the Cars of the Stars Motor Museum in Keswick  England  A replica Batmobile was sold at the Coys Spring Classic Cars Auction on February 27  2007 at the Royal Horticultural Hall in London  Coys Auctions had said it expected the car to fetch more than  75 000 20    the final and closing bid was  119 000  equivalent to  233 000 USD at the time  21  In the movie Rock Star  Mark Wahlberg s character is given to extravagant spending  one of his first purchases is the original Batmobile from the TV series  An episode of The Simpsons guest starred Adam West with the Batmobile  Another episode featured the Batmobile in a museum of famous cars next to Herbie the Love Bug and a car from Mad Max  The latter episode featured a live Batman and Robin in the vehicle  who had both tried poorly to conceal the fact that they were not dummies  On an episode of The Man Show  a guest won a ride in the Batmobile with Adam West in the  Wheel of Destiny  segment  The Lincoln Futura version of the Batmobile is seen in the movie The Benchwarmers  driven by Jon Lovitz  The Batmobile appears as an Easter Egg in the video game King s Quest II  Romancing the Throne  accompanied by a version of the 1966 TV theme  In 2003  Adam West and Burt Ward reunited for a tongue in cheek telefilm titled Return to the Batcave  The Misadventures of Adam and Burt which combined dramatized recreations of the filming of the original series  with younger actors standing in for the stars   with modern day footage of West and Ward searching for a stolen Batmobile  In issue 9 of the comic series Justice  February 2007   Batman dons a suit of armor visually influenced by the original Batmobile from the TV series  Hobbyists have built a number of duplicates of the TV Batmobile  sharing sources for parts and assembly kits   edit  Animation  edit  Super Friends Main article  Super Friends The Batmobile as seen in the early episodes of Super Friends was based on the Lincoln Futura design as seen on the live action TV series starring Adam West  The main difference with the Super Friends version was that the lines of the car were modified substantially for use in animation  The most obvious change was to the nose of the car  where the hood received a  V  depression that echoed the lower fascia  This was also the first Batmobile  of any medium  to feature yellow bat emblems on the doors  This particular feature would be quickly adapted by the comics  Beginning with the Challenge of the Super Friends in 1978  the Batmobile got revamped  This new version was developed to have a more aerodynamic hard edged style  In addition  this Batmobile was smaller than its predecessor  It contained a sloped nose and flying buttress B pillars  Features that were carried over from the original Super Friends Batmobile were the Bat mask  low horizontal fins  twin bubble windshields  and blue coloring scheme  In 1984  Super Friends revamped its format  first as Super Friends  The Legendary Super Powers Show and then as The Super Powers Team  Galactic Guardians  to serve as a tie in to Kenner s Super Powers Collection   edit  DC Animated Universe Main article  DC animated universe The Batmobile as seen in Batman  The Animated Series  The Batmobile made appearances in the various series of the DC animated universe  including Batman  The Animated Series  Superman  The Animated Series  The New Batman Adventures  Justice League  and Justice League Unlimited  The Batmobile in Batman  The Animated Series combined style elements from various eras to produce a long  low vehicle with square lines  long fins  and a blunt nose with a massive chrome grill that could have been from any time from the 1930s to the 1990s  This version of the Batmobile also vaguely resembled the Batmobile from the first two Tim Burton movies  Despite the obvious presence of the jet exhaust  the show frequently used sound effects from a reciprocating engine for the Batmobile s driving scenes  This  plus direct views of the engine  as seen in the episode  The Mechanic    suggest that the car used a large piston engine for primary power and an auxiliary jet for high speed acceleration  Among the features of the Batmobile of The Animated Series were  smoke and oil dispensers  wheel slasher hubs  a missile rack  tear gas dispensers  ejection seats  titanium alloy wheels and body panels  and reversible jet exhausts  It also had an armoured stationary mode to prevent people from tampering with the car when it was left unattended  though it was not as overt as the  shields  used in the 1989 movie Batmobile  The original Batmobile design had many design variants that are seen throughout other DCAU shows  the most notable examples being the Batmobile  truck  seen in the Superman  The Animated Series episode  Stolen Memories  and an aging Bruce Wayne s limosine  seen in Batman Beyond  which is referred to by the producers as  an upside down Batmobile   In The New Batman Adventures  the Batmobile was redesigned  with its jet engine being most notably absent  save for one episode   This Batmobile design is re used in Justice League and Justice League Unlimited  though appears somewhat more blue than black in paint color  In Batman Beyond  there was a flying car referred to as the Batmobile  in the show s future era  flying cars had become commonplace    edit  The Batman Main article  The Batman  TV series  In the animated series The Batman  the Batmobile resembled a sports coupe with multiple jet exhaust slits protruding from the back bumper  In the third season episode  RPM   this Batmobile was wrecked beyond repair  and Batman completed a prototype design that included a Wayne Industries  EXP  power generator  This Batmobile was longer and had a lower profile with only one triangular jet exhaust coming from the rear of the car  At the end of the episode  Batman remarks that due to the Batmobile EXP s success  it is a  keeper   In the fourth season  the episode Artifacts explores Gotham City in the year 2027  complete with a new tank like Batmobile reminiscent of Frank Miller s design for the Batmobile in The Dark Knight Returns   edit  Batman  Gotham Knight Main article  Batman  Gotham Knight In the straight to DVD animated shorts collection Gotham Knight  the Batmobile makes an appearance in the feature entitled  Field Test   While set in the same continuity as Christopher Nolan s films  it is visually a pastiche of the Batmobile as it has appeared in various films  Also  the Batmobile appears in the feature entitled  Working Through Pain   wherein Alfred arrives to pick up Batman  The Batmobile appearing in this scene seems to be inspired by its appearance in the 1989 live action film   edit  Batman  The Brave and The Bold Main article  Batman  The Brave and the Bold The Batmobile in Batman  The Brave and the Bold takes design elements from the Golden Age Batmobiles and the Lincoln Futura  This Batmobile has the ability to transform into other vehicles  22  The tie in toyline s Batmobile shares this feature  transforming from car to jet  On at least one occasion  it has converted into a mecha similar to the Bat Bots seen in Kingdom Come  In the episode  Game Over for Owlman   Batman is forced to use a back up Batmobile which resembles a Studebaker   edit  Other Appearances The Batmobile made a brief cameo at the end of an episode of the Looney Tunes Show entitled  Reunion   Bugs Bunny drove off in it after seeing the Bat Signal because  in that show  he is secretly Batman  This Batmobile slightly resembles the Golden Age version   edit  Live action feature film  edit  Batman and Batman Returns Main articles  Batman  1989 film  and Batman Returns The Batmobile of Batman and Batman Returns  as seen on display outside Batman  The Ride at Six Flags Great America  Tim Burton s live action films Batman and Batman Returns presented a different version of the Batmobile  which reflected that film s Art Deco version of Gotham City  both of which were designed by Anton Furst  23  24  It was long  low and sleek  and was built on a Chevy Impala chassis   edit  Technical specifications Length  260 7 in Width  94 4 in Height  51 2 in Wheelbase  141 0 in Wheels  Cast alloy  15   6 5 Tires  High aspect L60 15 Acceleration  0 60 in 3 7 seconds Maximum Speed  330 mph with

and a central  foot  capable of lifting the car and rotating it 180    edit  Features Spherical bombs could be deployed from its sides  An afterburner 25  was housed in the back  Two Browning machine guns were hidden behind flaps in each fender  Its Grappling hook  once hooked on a structure  serves as an anchor to allow the batmobile to make an extremely sharp turn at high speed that its pursuers typically cannot duplicate  It had superhydraulics for course changes  and a batdisc ejector  side mounted  that could fire precisely 15 Batdiscs in the 1 second pulse  Other gadgets included chassis mounted shinbreakers  oil slick dispensers and smoke emitters  Inside  the two seat cockpit featured aircraft like instrumentation  a passenger s side monitor  self diagnostics system  CD recorder  and voice command recognition system  In Batman Returns it is shown to have a secondary mode referred to as the  Batmissile   where the wheels would retract inward and the sides of the vehicle would break off  converting the car into a thin bullet train like form capable of squeezing through tight alleyways  Obviously  this secondary mode would require the car to be reassembled and significantly repaired  The Batmobile s shields are made of ceramic fractal armor panels  They explode outward when struck by projectiles  deflecting injurious force away from the car and its occupants  If Batman must leave the Batmobile for an extended period of time  he can  through a voice command spoken into a wrist device  specifically  the word  shields    activate the Batmobile s shielding system  This prevents anyone from tampering with the vehicle while it is left unattended  Bulletproof and fireproof steel armor plates envelop the body and cockpit entirely  While this armor is in place  the vehicle cannot be driven  In Batman the shields 26  were not fully functioning  In reality  a life size model was built  and the shield activation sequence was created with stop motion animation technology  In Batman Returns  the shields 26  held the same characteristics  However  the design was slimmer and the special effects were provided by computer generated imagery  In shield mode  a small but powerful bomb can be deployed   edit  Other appearances The only actual turbine powered Batmobile in existence is a replica of the 1989 film car  It is powered by a military Boeing turboshaft engine driving the rear wheels through a 4 speed semi automatic transmission and is street registered  This car was designed and constructed by Casey Putsch of Putsch Racing in 2011  Putsch Racing also created a V8 powered replica complete with retractable firing machine guns  automated canopy  internet  GPS  police military scanner  etc   That car was also street registered in the United States  Replicas of the Tim Burton era Batmobiles are on display in front of several Batman  The Ride roller coasters and also in the street near Batman Adventure   The Ride 2 at Warner Bros  Movie World in Australia  Historic auto attractions in Roscoe  Illinois displays a replica Batmobile from Batman Returns as well as the  Batmissile  in addition to a replica of the Batmobile from the 1960s television series  A series of Onstar TV advertisements featured this particular Batmobile being equipped with the system  OnStar allowed Batman to call various Gotham characters  summon police  remotely unlock the vehicle s doors and find the nearest jet fuel station  This version of the Batmobile was later seen in the Lois  amp  Clark  The New Adventures of Superman episode called  Don t Tug on Superman s Cape   an episode which shows that some collectors had apparently stolen the Batmobile  In the movie Looney Tunes  Back in Action  Daffy Duck drives the Tim Burton version of the Batmobile into the water tower on the Warner Bros  studio lot  causing it to fall over and nearly crush Jenna Elfman s character  On the TV series Animaniacs  the Tim Burton version of the Batmobile approaches the WB studios front gates  the guard at the door greets the driver by saying  Good afternoon Mr  Keaton   Yet another Animaniacs cartoon features a parody of the poem  Twas the Night Before Christmas  As the WB studios empty out for the Christmas break  the Tim Burton version of the Batmobile pulls up to the gate  and Ralph the Guard waves it through  saying   Goodnight  Mr  Keaton  that s a lovely sedan   In a third Animaniacs appearance  Dot Warner s interpretation of a Puck soliloquy from A Midsummer Night s Dream renders the line   And Robin shall make amends ere long  as  And the Boy Wonder will save us   The Tim Burton version of the Batmobile then drives up to the Warner siblings and opens its canopy  Robin pulls the trio into the car  which departs  saving them from an angry fairy  In the  RPM  episode of the animated series The Batman  one of Bruce Wayne s Batmobile prototypes is the Batmobile from the Tim Burton films  In the segment Working Through Pain episode of the animated film Batman  Gotham Knight  Alfred uses the 1989 Batmobile to pull the sewer gate to rescue an injured Bruce Wayne trapped underneath  27   edit  Batman Forever Main article  Batman Forever The Batmobile of Batman Forever  As the Batman films were handed over to director Joel Schumacher from Tim Burton  the design for the Batmobile updated  Decorative lighting was added to the vehicle s rims  sides and front edge  and the wing shaped fins reached further into the air  New abilities included a grappling hook allowing the Batmobile to drive up walls  as well as the speed to perform large jumps from surface to surface during chases across Gotham City s elevated freeways and gigantic statues  The Batman Forever Batmobile s ability to drive up walls was displayed as Batman eludes a dead end provided by Two Face and his henchmen  Later in the film  Dick Grayson takes the Batmobile for a joy ride without Batman s permission or awareness  Ultimately  it was destroyed when the Riddler deposited a sack full of explosives in the cockpit  Batman Forever is also notable for the phrase uttered by Batman to Dr  Chase Meridian  It s the car  right  Chicks dig the car   The design of the Batmobiles of the Schumacher films have garnered criticism for allegedly resembling giant phalli  28   edit  Technical specifications The Batman Forever Batmobile had a Chevrolet 350 ZZ3 high performance motor  The body is made from a vacuum bagged high temperature epoxy fiberglass laminate  The wheelbase is 118 in   118 inches  3 0 m    the average car wheelbase measures around 103  USDOT Data 1980 2000  inches  In all  its size was 300 in long and 126 in high  Carbon fiber was used to build the body of this particular Batmobile  The specifications for the

Features The Batman Forever Batmobile sought to accentuate its intricate lines  To do this  the filmmakers equipped it with engine panels  wheels  and undercarriage that were indirectly lit so that they appeared to glow blue  The Batman Forever car also had a split cockpit canopy  separate fenders  and jet exhaust  The roof fin could be opened into a  V  shape for a more contemporary look  though the only time this was shown is during the scene when Dick Grayson is taking the car out for a joyride through the city  The wheels were made to keep the bat emblems upright when the wheels are turning  The bat emblem hubcaps was a counter rotating gear that transferred into a stationary point  The two seat cockpit featured a rear view monitor  system diagnostics display  and custom gauge cluster  H  R  Giger was chosen to design the Batmobile in the very early stages of production  He left due to creative differences  His designs are on his official website in illustrated and 3D Graphic Art form  There were two primary avoidance defense features on the Batman Forever version  First  it had the ability to lock all four wheels perpendicular to its centerline  to allow for quick sideways movement  Second  for more dire circumstances  the Batmobile could reroute the jet exhaust to under its front end and launch grappling cables at overhead anchors  With the nose up and the lines in place  the car could climb sheer vertical surfaces like building walls as if it were driving on flat ground   edit  Other appearances In episode 53 of the TV series The Drew Carey Show  Drew Carey won the Batman Forever Batmobile as a prize  Lewis and Oswald take it on a joyride dressed as Batman and Robin without Drew s permission  On a sidenote Oswald was played by Diedrich Bader who would later voice Batman in Batman  The Brave and the Bold  In  Legends of the Dark Knight   an episode of The New Batman Adventures  three teenagers discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like  They briefly meet an effeminate youth named Joel in front of a shoemaker s shop  whose idea of Batman consists mainly of a fascination with the tight rubber suits and a Batmobile that can drive up walls  as seen in Batman Forever   The other three children treat Joel s ideas with utter disdain  The scene was meant to be a mockery of Schumacher s interpretation of the character  which was hated by the producers  citation needed  In the 2011 remake of the comedy film Arthur  Arthur  played by Russell Brand  drives the Batman Forever Batmobile  29   edit  Batman  amp  Robin Main article  Batman  amp  Robin  film  A new Batmobile is seen in the 1997 film Batman  amp  Robin  It is prominently featured in one scene in which  as Batman and Robin are in pursuit  Mr  Freeze shoots the underside of the car for several seconds with his freeze gun  before the car crash lands  However  in the next scene in the Batcave  the Batmobile is sitting back on its pedestal appearing to be in perfect condition  30   edit  Technical specifications In Batman  amp  Robin  the aerodynamic chassis design and  T  axis wheelbase provided the Batmobile counter balance gyrometric stability  allowing for high velocity 90 degree turns at speeds greater than 70 mph without losing momentum  Initial plans had the Batmobile being able to transform into the  Bathammer  vehicle seen in this film  A  but were abandoned  The specifications for the Batmobile in this film are as follows  31  Length  396 in  33 feet  10 m   long  The six flame columns formed a V shaped output of 71 in  1 80 m  length  Height  59 05 in  1 5 m  Maximum Speed  230 mph on open road  350 mph with afterburner thrust  TFX road tested the Batmobile at 140 mph  350 km h and the additional jet propulsion brings the cars to 530 km h  Engine  Chevy 350 ZZ3  off road racing motor   Instead of a single jet exhaust  this Batmobile had a  boattail  rear flanked by separate fenders  each with three smaller exhaust nozzles  Axle Base  388 in Tires  It rode on custom 22  wheels with prototype  55 in GoodYear tires with Batsymbols in the treads   edit  Features The Batmobile of Batman  amp  Robin  The second Schumacher era Batmobile featured neither a passenger seat nor a canopy  Like the Batman Forever car  this Batmobile  which was designed by Harald Belker  32  featured light up wheels and engine panels  The displays were much more involved with this car  however  with red  orange  yellow  and blue lights  as well as special pulsating lights in the counterrotating turbine intake  The nozzles were canted away from the centerline of the car slightly  so the final effect was that the six exhausts made a  V  pattern to keep the car pointed straight ahead  A bat mask was incorporated in the nose of the car  though the sculpted lines made it somewhat difficult to make out at first  The fins were unmistakable  though  and remain as the largest set ever built into a real world Batmobile  On the Batman  amp  Robin version the arsenal of weaponry and gadgets is controlled by an onboard voice activated computer which surrounds the single seat cockpit  From behind the wheel  the driver has access to a multifunctioning key command response system which delivers immediate weapon activation during attack and defensive procedures  The Batman  amp  Robin Batmobile was equipped with dual mount  subcarriage rocket launchers  front and rear grappling hooks  multipoint infrared and laser scan tracking units  anterior posterior wheel based axle bombs  catapult ejection seat  and disguised central carriage  which detaches to become an emergency road vehicle  The single seat cockpit featured a two way videoconferencing screen  radar unit  and Redbird communication switch   edit  The Nolan Trilogy Main articles  Batman Begins  The Dark Knight  film   and The Dark Knight Rises The Batmobile of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight The Batmobile depicted in the Christopher Nolan directed films Batman Begins  2005  and The Dark Knight  2008  owes more to the tank like vehicle from Frank Miller s Batman  The Dark Knight Returns and has a much more  workhorse  appearance than the sleek automobiles seen in previous incarnations  The vehicle does not have a front axle  a design that was influenced by the spinners featured in Ridley Scott s Blade Runner  The film s production designer described the machine as a cross between a Lamborghini and a tank on the Batman Begins special features DVD  Bruce Wayne was seen driving a gray Lamborghini Murcielago in both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight  In the 2005 movie  Bruce Wayne modifies a prototype military vehicle called  the Tumbler  that was designed by Lucius Fox as a bridging vehicle for the military  It includes features like weaponry  and the ability to boost into a rampless jump  In the Nolan films the vehicle is never referred to as the  Batmobile   Six vehicles were built for the production of the film  Two full sized driving versions were used in exterior shots  One full sized model with hydraulic enhancements was used in jump sequences  One full sized  functional version carried propane tanks to fuel the rocket blast out of the rear nozzle  A radio controlled  1 3 scale electric model also performed stunts in the film  e g   the roof top chase sequence   These scenes were filmed over nine weeks  on a massive set built on a stage at Shepperton Studios  citation needed  The  Batpod  of The Dark Knight The Batmobile returns in The Dark Knight  and appears twice in the movie  when Batman captures the Scarecrow and the fake Batmen in the parking garage  and in the chase where it is damaged beyond repair by a chain  tumbling  reaction  initiated by a rocket propelled grenade fired by The Joker  Batman ejects from the Batmobile in the Batpod  a motorcycle formed by the front wheels and struts of the Batmobile   Once ejected  Batman programs the Batmobile to self destruct  the AI stating   Goodbye  before the explosion  The Batmobile is also seen in the trailers in a deleted scene  exiting the improvised Batcave  Production photos from filming of The Dark Knight Rises  2012  in Pittsburgh showed a second Tumbler chassis after the first was destroyed in The Dark Knight  33  On the WPXI morning news on July 21  2011  video was shown of three tumbler variants being removed from a cargo plane  Each of these vehicles had the original color of the Tumbler as depicted during the test drive scenes in Batman Begins  Each of these three vehicles are reported to be used by the character Bane and his gang  34   edit  Technical specifications 35  Length  15 feet  4 57 m  Width  9 feet 4 inches  2 84 m  Weight  2 5 short tons  2 3 t  Acceleration  0 60 in 5 6 seconds  Engine  5 7 liter GM V8 engine capable of 500 horsepower  370 kW   Fuel  The  jet engine  on the back of the car was fed by propane tanks  Tires  4 Interco  Super Swamper TSL  tires standing 44 inches  1 100 mm  tall 18 5 inches  470 mm  wide in the rear  and two 94 0 15 0 15 Hoosier Checkerboard dirt tires on the front   edit  Features The Batman Begins Batmobile has a pair of autocannons mounted in the nose of the car between the front wheels  In  Attack  mode  the driver s seat moves to the center of the car  and the driver is repositioned to lie face down with his head in the center section between the front wheels  This serves two main purposes  first  it provides more substantial protection with the driver shielded by multiple layers of armor plating  Second  the prone position reduces the risk of injury a driver faces when making extreme driving maneuvers  Other devices included  Rear flaps to assist brakes Dual front autocannons Rocket launcher Landing hook to Sprung landing stabilization Integrated fire extinguishing system Integrated safety connection to gasoline control Jet engine on back of car for quick boosts  rampless  jumps Stealth mode  which turns off the car s lights and cuts off the main engine  the vehicle is powered by an electric motor making the car very hard to find in dark places Explosive caltrops are deployed from the rear of the vehicle  Batman uses this to immobilize a police vehicle following him  Front of car is heavily armored  so the car can ram as a practical offensive attack  and also protects the driver  Batman  while in the prone driving position  Attack  mode Both front wheels can eject when the vehicle is damaged to form the Batpod  a motorcycle like vehicle  the rest self destructs    edit  Production process The new incarnation of the Tumbler was proposed by Nolan after he built a proof of concept model design out of Play Doh   a model he admitted looked  very very crude  more like a croissant than a car   Nathan Crowley  one of the production designers for Batman Begins  then started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by model bashing based on that shape  One of the parts that Crowley used to create the vehicle was the nose cone of a P 38 Lightning model to serve as the chassis for the car s jet engine  Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1 12 scale in the course of four months  Following the scale model creation  a crew of over 30 people  including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Andy Smith  36  carved a full size replica of the vehicle out of a large block of Styrofoam  which was a process that lasted two months  37  The Styrofoam model was used to create a steel  test frame   which had to stand up to several standards  have a speed of over 100 mph  go from 0 to 60 mph  97 km h  in 5 seconds  possess a steering system to make sharp turns at city corners  and to withstand a self propelled launch of up to 30 feet  9 1 m   On the very first jump test  the Tumbler s front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt  The basic configuration of the newly designed vehicle included a 5 7 liter Chevy V8 engine  a truck axle for the rear axle  front racing tires by Hoosier  rear 4x4 mud tires by Interco   and the suspension system of Baja racing trucks  The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars  37  With the design process completed  four street ready cars were constructed  Each vehicle possessed 65 carbon fiber panels and cost  250 000 to build  Two of the four cars were specialized versions  One version was the flap version  which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air  The other version was the jet version  in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle  fueled by six propane tanks  Due to the poor visibility inside the vehicle by the driver  monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body  The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film s scenes  37  The interior was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street capable version  The cockpit was over sized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior  In addition  another version of the car was a miniature model that was 1 5 scale of the full sized one  This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show it flying across ravines and between buildings  However  a full size car was used for the waterfall sequence  37  The scale model scenes were filmed on a massive set built on a stage at Shepperton Studios in England over the course of nine weeks  The full sized vehicles were driven and filmed on the streets of Chicago  In The Dark Knight  the Batpod ejects from the Tumbler  with the Tumbler s front wheels as the Batpod s wheels  this was rendered using computer generated imagery when attempts to achieve the separation through practical effects proved impossible   edit  Toys  edit  Hot Wheels Hot Wheels released a version of the 1960s batman TV show s Batmobile   edit  Corgi Toys Corgi Toys of England has produced a wide range of Batmobiles 38  ranging from the original sedan to the latest movie Batmobiles  They also have produced a Batboat  Red Bird  amp  Jokermobile for

Takedown engine for these levels  Batman has to ram enemy cars off the road which results in a  Take down  while picking up Nitro boosts along the way that float on the road in holographic bubbles  Xbox World Australia called these sequences the highlight of the game  41 Cheatcc com called them  by far the best Batmobile levels ever featured in a game   42   edit  Batman  Arkham Asylum Main article  Batman  Arkham Asylum In Batman  Arkham Asylum  2009   the Batmobile appears with a design resembling the one used in Batman  The Animated Series  In the game  it is vandalized by Harley Quinn and the Blackgate prisoners  Batman later controls the Batmobile remotely using his utility belt to take Bane into the sea along with it   edit  Notes   In Batman  amp  Robin  Batman uses the  Bathammer  to battle Mr  Freeze and his henchmen through the frozen streets of Gotham City  The Bathammer is  in essence  a Batmobile for travelling on icy surfaces  It is 33 feet  10 m  long  amp  6 feet  1 8 m  high  The top speed is 100 mph on ice  The Bathammer can move over enormous skids underneath  It also carries vertical stabilizers  3 m long  that can be directed upward in an emergency and used as shield  43  44   edit  See also comics portal Batpod Car body style  edit  References   Jimenez  Phil  2008    Batmobile   In Dougall  Alastair  The DC Comics Encyclopedia  London  Dorling
