the 20th century  The company was originally formed in 1957 by former Metro Goldwyn Mayer animation directors William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and live action director George Sidney in partnership with Columbia Pictures  Screen Gems television division as H B Enterprises  Inc  1   Established after MGM shut down its animation studio and ended production of its animated short films  such as the popular Tom and Jerry series   H B Enterprises  Inc  was renamed Hanna Barbera Productions  Inc  in 1959  Over the next three decades  the studio produced many successful animated shows  including The Huckleberry Hound Show  The Quick Draw McGraw Show  The Flintstones  The Yogi Bear Show  Top Cat  The Jetsons  Jonny Quest  Space Ghost  Wacky Races  Scooby Doo  Where Are You  and The Smurfs among others  The studio also produced several feature films and cartoon shorts for theaters along with a number of specials and movies for television  While Hanna and Barbera s theatrical work awarded them seven Oscars  their television productions have earned the company eight Emmys 2  and the duo was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame  In the mid 1980s  the company s fortunes declined somewhat after the profitability of Saturday morning cartoons was eclipsed by weekday afternoon syndication  In 1991  the company was purchased by Turner Broadcasting System  who began using much of the H B back catalog to program the Cartoon Network the following year 3  4   Both Hanna and Barbera went into semi retirement after Turner purchased the company  continuing to serve as ceremonial figureheads for and sporadic artistic contributors to the studio  The same year  the company was renamed H B Production Co  then became Hanna Barbera Cartoons  Inc  in 1994  and in October 1996  Turner merged with Time Warner  By the time of the merger  Turner had turned Hanna Barbera towards primarily producing new material for Cartoon Network  including the successful Cartoon Cartoons shows such as Dexter s Laboratory  Johnny Bravo  Cow and Chicken  I Am Weasel and The Powerpuff Girls  With William Hanna s death in 2001  the studio was folded into Warner Bros  Animation  and Cartoon Network Studios continued the projects for Cartoon Network output  Joseph Barbera remained with the Warner Animation division until his death in 2006  Hanna Barbera currently exists as an in name only company used to market properties and productions associated with the studio s  classic  works such as Yogi Bear  Scooby Doo and Huckleberry Hound  Contents 1 History 1 1 The beginnings of Hanna

Barbera Hanna Barbera founders William Hanna  left  and Joseph Barbera pose with several of the Emmy awards the Hanna Barbera studio has won  Melrose  New Mexico native William Hanna and New York City born Joseph Barbera first teamed together while working at the Metro Goldwyn Mayer cartoon studio in 1939  Their first directorial project was a cartoon entitled Puss Gets the Boot  1940   which served as the genesis of the popular Tom and Jerry series of cartoon theatricals  Hanna and Barbera served as the directors and story men for the shorts for eighteen years  winning seven Academy Awards for Best Short Subject  Cartoons  between 1943 and 1953 for their work  By 1956  they had become the producers in charge of the MGM animation studio s output 5   Outside of their work on the MGM shorts  Hanna and Barbera moonlighted on outside projects  including the original title sequences and commercials for the hit television sitcom I Love Lucy 6   MGM decided in early 1957 to close its cartoon studio  as it felt it had acquired a reasonable backlog of shorts for re release 5   Hanna and Barbera  contemplating their future while completing the final Tom and Jerry and Droopy cartoons  began producing animated television commercials 7   During their last year at MGM  they developed a concept for an animated television program entitled The Ruff  amp  Reddy Show  about a dog and cat pair who found themselves in various misadventures 7   After Hanna and Barbera failed to convince MGM to back their venture  live action director George Sidney  who d worked with Hanna and Barbera on several of his features  most notably Anchors Aweigh in 1945   offered to serve as their business partner and convinced Screen Gems  the television subsidiary of Columbia Pictures  to establish a deal with the animation producers 1   Screen Gems took a twenty percent ownership in Hanna and Barbera s new company  H B Enterprises  1  and provided working capital to produce Ruff and Reddy  H B Enterprises opened for business in rented offices on the lot of Kling Studios  formerly Charlie Chaplin Studios  6  on July 7  1957  two months after the MGM animation studio closed down 7   Sidney and several Screen Gems alumni became members of H B s original board of directors  and much of the former MGM animation staff   including animators Carlo Vinci  Kenneth Muse  Lewis Marshall  Michael Lah  and Ed Barge and layout artists Ed Benedict and Richard Bickenbach   as H B s production staff 7   Their first cartoon series for television  The Ruff  amp  Reddy Show  featuring live action host Jimmy Blaine and several older Columbia owned cartoons as filler  premiered on NBC in December 1957  In 1958  H B had their first big success with The Huckleberry Hound Show  a syndicated series aired in most markets just before primetime  The program was a ratings success  and introduced a new crop of cartoon stars to audiences  in particular Huckleberry Hound and Yogi Bear  The show won the 1960 Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Children s Programming  The studio began to expand rapidly following the success of Huckleberry Hound  and several animation industry alumni   in particular former Warner Bros  Cartoons storymen Michael Maltese and Warren Foster  who became H B s new head writers   joined the staff at this time 7   By 1959  H B Enterprises was reincorporated as Hanna Barbera Productions  and was slowly becoming a leader in television animation production  After introducing a second syndicated series  The Quick Draw McGraw Show  in 1959  Hanna Barbera migrated into network primetime production with the animated ABC sitcom The Flintstones in 1960  Loosely based upon the popular live action sitcom The Honeymooners yet set in a fictionalized stone age of cavemen and dinosaurs  The Flintstones ran for six seasons in prime time on ABC  becoming a ratings and merchandising success  It was the longest running animated show in American prime time television history until being beaten out by The Simpsons in 1996  Hanna Barbera moved off of the Kling lot in 1963  by then renamed the Red Skelton Studios   when the Hanna Barbera Studio  located at 3400 Cahuenga Blvd  in Studio City  California  was opened  This California contemporary office building was designed by architect Arthur Froehlich  its ultra modern design included a sculpted latticework exterior  moat  fountains  and after later additions  a Jetsons like tower  The Columbia Hanna Barbera partnership lasted until 1967  when Hanna and Barbera sold the studio to Taft Broadcasting while retaining their positions there  edit  Television cartoons The former Hanna Barbera building at 3400 Cahuenga Blvd  in Studio City  California  seen in a 2007 photograph  Hanna Barbera was one of the first animation studios to successfully produce cartoons especially for television 8   Previously  animated programming on television had consisted primarily of rebroadcasts of theatrical cartoons  During the early and mid 1960s  the studio debuted several new successful programs  among them prime time ABC series such as Top Cat  The Jetsons and Jonny Quest  New shows produced for syndication and Saturday mornings included The Yogi Bear Show  a syndicated spinoff from The Huckleberry Hound Show   The Hanna Barbera New Cartoon Series featuring Wally Gator  The Magilla Gorilla Show and The Atom Ant Secret Squirrel Show  Hanna Barbera also produced several television commercials  often starring their own characters  and animated the opening credits for the ABC sitcom Bewitched  the Bewitched characters would appear as guest stars in an episode of The Flintstones   The studio also produced a few theatrical projects for Columbia Pictures  including Loopy De Loop  a series of theatrical cartoons shorts  and two feature film projects based on its television properties  Hey There  It s Yogi Bear   1964  and The Man Called Flintstone  1966  and two TV specials  Alice in Wonderland  or What s a Nice Kid Like You Doing in a Place Like This    1966  and Jack and the Beanstalk  1967   the first ever Hanna Barbera television production to be done in live action animation  Starting in 1965  Hanna Barbera tried its hand at being a record label for a short time  Danny Hutton was hired by Hanna Barbera to become the head of Hanna Barbera Records or HBR from 1965 to 1966 9   HBR Records was distributed by Columbia Records  with artists such as Louis Prima  Five Americans  Scatman Crothers  who later lent his voice to a few Hanna Barbera cartoons  such as Hong Kong Phooey   and The 13th Floor Elevators  Previously  children s records with Hanna Barbera cartoon characters were released by Colpix Records  The Hanna Barbera studio especially captured the market for Saturday morning cartoons  After the success of The Atom Ant Secret Squirrel Show in 1965  H B debuted two new Saturday morning series the following year  Space Ghost  which featured action adventure  and Frankenstein  Jr  and The Impossibles  which blended action adventure with the earlier Hanna Barbera humor style  A slew of H B action cartoons followed in 1967  among them Shazzan  Birdman and the Galaxy Trio  Moby Dick and the Mighty Mightor  Young Samson and Goliath  The Herculoids and an adaptation of Marvel Comics  Fantastic Four along with new syndicated shows based on famous celebrities such as The Abbott and Costello Cartoon Show and Laurel and Hardy  Between these programs and others remaining on the air  reruns of The Flintstones  Jonny Quest and The Jetsons   Hanna Barbera cartoons aired on all three networks  Saturday morning lineups  and dominated the CBS and NBC schedules in particular  While the action programs were notably popular and successful  pressure from parent run organizations such as Action for Children s Television forced the cancellation of all of them by 1969 10   The reason was that children s TV became too saturated with violence  not education  In 1968  Hanna Barbera mixed live action and animated comedy action for its NBC anthology series  The Banana Splits Adventure Hour  while the successful Wacky Races  and its spinoffs The Perils of Penelope Pitstop  Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines   aired on CBS  returned H B to straight animated slapstick humor  Hanna Barbera s next runaway hit came in 1969 with Scooby Doo  Where Are You   a CBS program which blended elements of the H B comedy series  the action series  and rival Filmation s then current hit program The Archie Show  Scooby Doo centered on four teenagers and a dog solving supernatural mysteries  and was popular enough to remain on the air and in production until 1986  A cavalcade of H B Saturday morning cartoons featuring mystery solving crime fighting teenagers with comic pets soon followed  among them Josie and the Pussycats  The Funky Phantom  The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan  Goober and the Ghost Chasers  Clue Club and Jabberjaw  Cattanooga Cats came next and aired on ABC in 1969  By 1977  Scooby Doo was the centerpiece of a two hour ABC program block titled Scooby s All Star Laff a Lympics  which also included Dynomutt  Dog Wonder  Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels  and Laff a Lympics  During the 1970s in particular  most American television animation was produced by Hanna Barbera  The only competition came from Filmation  DePatie Freleng Enterprises  Ruby Spears  and a few other companies that specialized primarily in prime time specials  e g  Rankin Bass  Chuck Jones and Lee Mendelson Bill Mel ndez   Filmation  in particular  lost ground to Hanna Barbera when the failure of Filmation s Uncle Croc s Block led ABC president Fred Silverman to drop Filmation and give Hanna Barbera the majority of the network s Saturday morning cartoon time  Besides Scooby Doo and the programs derived from it  Hanna Barbera also found success with new programs such as Harlem Globetrotters  The Addams Family and Hong Kong Phooey along with the hit 1973 feature film Charlotte s Web  The syndicated Wait Till Your Father Gets Home returned Hanna Barbera to adult oriented comedy  although the show was more provocative than The Flintstones or The Jetsons had been  The studio revisited its 1960s stars with Flintstones spin offs such as The Pebbles and Bamm Bamm Show and The Flintstone Comedy Hour  both aired on CBS  In 1980  all four Flintstones specials aired in primetime on NBC as a limited run revival of the original 1960s series   All star  shows featuring Yogi Bear  Huckleberry Hound  Quick Draw McGraw and other H B animal stars included Yogi s Gang and Yogi s Space Race and the Scooby Doo spin offs  The New Scooby Doo Movies and Scooby Doo and Scrappy Doo  Hanna Barbera also produced new shows starring older cartoon characters from the theatrical era of cartoons such as Popeye  The All New Popeye Hour   Casper the Friendly Ghost  Casper and the Angels  and its founders  own Tom and Jerry  The New Tom and Jerry Grape Ape Show   Super Friends  a Hanna Barbera produced adaptation of DC Comics  Justice League of America comic book  remained on ABC Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1986  The 60 minute shows CB Bears and The Skatebirds aired on NBC and CBS respectively in 1977  H B introduced new shows and specials like  The Kwicky Koala Show  Yogi s First Christmas  A Flintstone Christmas  Amigo and Friends  a remake of the Mexican animated series Cantinflas Show  it was a joint venture between Hanna Barbera and Televisa   Yogi Bear s All Star Comedy Christmas Caper  The New Fred and Barney Show  the 1982 feature film Heidi s Song  The Flintstone Comedy Show  Casper s First Christmas and Scooby Goes Hollywood  A slew of live shows and rides based on classic Hanna Barbera series and characters were made for various theme parks including Kings Dominion  The studio also made a string of live action television and film projects  including The Gathering  Going Bananas  C H O M P S   Benji  Zax and the Alien Prince and Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park  Annual specials on both The Flintstones and Hanna Barbera aired  including Hanna Barbera s All Star Comedy Ice Revue  centering on Fred Flintstone s birthday  The Flintstones  25th Anniversary Celebration  focusing on the show s 25 years on air  The Flintstone Kids   Just Say No  Special  focusing on Fred and the gang refusing to do drugs and Hanna Barbera s 50th  A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration  centering on the 50 year partnership of Hanna and Barbera in animation   edit  Quality controversy One of the first logos used by Hanna Barbera From 1957 until 1995  Hanna Barbera produced prime time  weekday afternoon  and Saturday morning cartoons for all three major networks in the United States  and for syndication  The small budgets television animation producers had to work within prevented Hanna Barbera  and most other producers of American television animation  from working with the full theatrical quality animation the duo had been known for at MGM  While the budget for a seven minute Tom and Jerry entry of the 1950s was about  35 000  Hanna Barbera was required to produce five minute Ruff and Reddy episodes for no more than  3 000 a piece 1   To keep within these tighter budgets  Hanna Barbera modified the concept of limited animation  also called semi animation  practiced and popularized by the United Productions of America  UPA  studio  which also once had a partnership with Columbia Pictures  Character designs were simplified  and backgrounds and animation cycles  walks  runs  etc   were regularly re purposed  Characters were often broken up into a handful of levels  so that only the parts of the body that needed to be moved at a given time  i e  a mouth  an arm  a head  would be animated  The rest of the figure would remain on a held animation cel  This allowed a typical 10 minute short to be done with only 1 200 drawings instead of the usual 26 000  Dialogue  music  and sound effects were emphasized over action  leading Chuck Jones  a contemporary who worked for Hanna and Barbera s rivals at Warner Bros  Cartoons when the duo was at MGM  and one who  with his short The Dover Boys practically invented many of the concepts in limited animation   to disparagingly refer to the limited TV cartoons produced by Hanna Barbera and others as  illustrated radio  11   In a story published by The Saturday Evening Post in 1961  critics stated that Hanna Barbera was taking on more work than it could handle and was resorting to shortcuts only a television audience would tolerate 12   An executive who worked for Walt Disney Productions said   We don t even consider  them  competition  12   Ironically  during the late 1950s and early 1960s  Hanna Barbera was the only animation studio in Hollywood that was actively hiring  and it picked up a number of Disney artists who were laid off during this period  The studio s solution to the criticism over its quality was to go into features  The studio produced six theatrical features  among them higher quality versions of its hit television cartoons and adaptations of other material  They were also known to be the very first animation studios to have their animation work done overseas  contrary to the believed fact that Jay Ward was the first 13    edit  Slow rise and fall In the 1980s  competing studios such as Filmation and Rankin Bass began to introduce successful syndicated cartoon series based upon characters from popular toy lines and action figures  These included Filmation s He Man and the Masters of the Universe and She Ra  Princess of Power and Rankin Bass s Thundercats  The Hanna Barbera studio fell behind  For the most part they continued to produce for Saturday mornings  although they no longer dominated the market as before  Hanna Barbera also aligned themselves with Ruby Spears Productions  which was founded in 1977 by former H B employees Joe Ruby and Ken Spears  Hanna Barbera s then parent Taft Broadcasting purchased Ruby Spears from Filmways  to which Taft had sold syndicator Rhodes Productions several years before  in 1981  and Ruby Spears often paired their productions with Hanna Barbera shows  For example  NBC aired The Smurfs  Alvin and the Chipmunks and Snorks in their 80s Saturday morning cartoon lineup   Taft also bought Worldvision Enterprises in 1979 and became the syndication distributor for most of Hanna Barbera s shows throughout the 1980s  It was also during this time that the studio switched from cel animation to digital ink and paint  Courtesy Of Cambridge Animation Systems of London  England  United Kingdom  for some of their shows  In addition  both Hanna Barbera and Worldvision had their own home video label  Hanna Barbera Home Video  Worldvision Home Video   Many of the studio s shows  films and specials were released by other VHS distributors  Hanna Barbera followed the lead of its competitors by introducing shows based on familiar licensed properties like The Smurfs  Pac Man  Mork and Mindy  Snorks  The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang  Pound Puppies  Richie Rich  Challenge of the GoBots  Laverne  amp  Shirley in the Army  Shirt Tales  The Dukes  Monchhichis  The Little Rascals  The Gary Coleman Show  and Foofur  and also produced several ABC Weekend Specials  The popularity of The Smurfs inspired a string of seven new specials  a TV movie Smurfquest and new Smurf type cartoons such as Trollkins and The Biskitts  Some of their shows were produced at their Australian based studio  a partnership with Australian media company Southern Star Entertainment  including Drak Pack  The Berenstain Bears  Teen Wolf and almost all of the CBS Storybreak specials  The studio also worked on other special cartoon projects with less fanfare during the late 1980s  such as The Greatest Adventure  Stories from the Bible  The Little Troll Prince  A Christmas Parable  GoBots  Battle of the Rock Lords  Star Fairies and Rock Odyssey  After the success of CBS s hit 1984 Saturday morning cartoon series Muppet Babies  which featured toddler versions of the popular Muppets characters  H B began producing shows featuring  kid  versions of popular characters  based upon both their own properties  The Flintstone Kids  A Pup Named Scooby Doo  and properties from other companies  Pink Panther and Sons  Popeye and Son   In 1985  Hanna Barbera launched The Funtastic World of Hanna Barbera  a weekend only syndication package which introduced new versions of old favorites like Yogi Bear  Yogi s Treasure Hunt  and Jonny Quest  The New Adventures of Jonny Quest  alongside reruns of Saturday morning shows and brand new originals such as Galtar and the Golden Lance  Young Robin Hood  Paw Paws  Midnight Patrol  Adventures in the Dream Zone  Paddington Bear  Fantastic Max and Sky Commanders along with the block s filler segment HBTV  Also in 1985  DC Comics named Hanna Barbera as one of the honorees in the company s 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great for its work on the Super Friends series 14   New shows introduced featuring Yogi Bear  The New Yogi Bear Show  and Scooby Doo  The New Scooby and Scrappy Doo Show  The 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo  along with The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley  Wildfire and a revival of The Jetsons  with 51 new episodes featuring a new character named Orbitty  In 1987  Hanna Barbera started Hanna Barbera Superstars 10  an anthology series of ten original televised movies based on their popular stable of classic characters  such as Yogi s Great Escape  The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones  Scooby Doo Meets the Boo Brothers  Top Cat and the Beverly Hills Cats  The Good  the Bad  and Huckleberry Hound and many others   Throughout all of this  both Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears were subject to the financial troubles of parent company Taft Broadcasting  which had just been acquired by the American Financial Corporation in 1987 and had its name changed to Great American Broadcasting the following year  Many of the business deals were overseen by CEO of Taft Broadcasting  Charles Mechem  Along with much of the rest of the American animation industry  Hanna Barbera had gradually begun to move away from producing everything in house in the late 1970s and early 1980s  Much of the Hanna Barbera product was outsourced to studios in Australia and Asia  including Wang Film Productions  Cuckoo s Nest Studios  Fil Cartoons  Mook Co   Ltd   and Toei Animation  In 1989  much of Hanna Barbera s staff responded to a call from Warner Bros  to resurrect their animation department  Producer Tom Ruegger and a number of his colleagues left the studio at this time  moving to Warners to develop hit cartoon programs such as Tiny Toon Adventures and Animaniacs  In the late 1980s and 1990s  the Hanna Barbera characters were licensed to Universal Studios  who produced the live action film adaptations  The Flintstones  The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas  of The Flintstones  the pre show and ride film for The Funtastic World of Hanna Barbera attraction for Universal Studios Florida and a feature length version of The Jetsons  Hanna Barbera launched Timeless Tales from Hallmark  made in association with Hallmark Cards  It is a series of adaptations based on classic fairy tales hosted by Olivia Newton John   edit  Turner rebound David Kirschner was appointed as the head of the Hanna Barbera studio in 1989  with Hanna and Barbera remaining as co chairmen 15   In 1990  burdened with debt  Great American put both Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears up for sale  In November 1991  the Hanna Barbera studio and library  as well as much of the original Ruby Spears library  were acquired by Turner Broadcasting  which  coincidentally  by that point had also bought the pre May 1986 MGM library  for  320 million 16   Turner s president of entertainment Scott Sassa hired Fred Seibert  a former executive for MTV Networks  to head the Hanna Barbera studio  He immediately filled the gap left by the departure of most of their creative crew during the Great American years with a new crop of animators  writers  and producers  including Pat Ventura  Craig McCracken  Donovan Cook  Genndy Tartakovsky  David Feiss  Seth MacFarlane  Van Partible  Stewart St  John  and Butch Hartman and new production head Buzz Potamkin 17   In 1992  the studio was renamed H B Productions Company  changing its name once again to Hanna Barbera Cartoons  Inc  a year later 18   In the early 1990s  the studio introduced new versions of classic properties such as Yo Yogi   Tom  amp  Jerry Kids and its spin off Droopy  Master Detective  It also assumed production of TBS s Captain Planet and the Planeteers in 1993  renaming it The New Adventures of Captain Planet  A feature length adaptation of Tom and Jerry was to be made by H B but production was produced entirely by Film Roman and was distributed by Miramax Films  It was released to theaters on July 30  1993  The studio also introduced shows that were quite different from their signature cartoons  including Wake  Rattle  and Roll  a k a  Jump  Rattle and Roll   SWAT Kats  The Radical Squadron  Dumb and Dumber  2 Stupid Dogs  Fish Police  The Pirates of Dark Water  Gravedale High  Capitol Critters and a new version of The Addams Family  From 1993 to 95  Hanna Barbera produced a slew of new specials and films for television such as I Yabba Dabba Do   Hollyrock a Bye Baby  A Flintstone Family Christmas  A Flintstones Christmas Carol  Jonny s Golden Quest  Jonny Quest vs  The Cyber Insects  Yogi the Easter Bear  Arabian Nights  The Halloween Tree and The Town Santa Forgot  A new feature animation division led by David Kirschner produced Once Upon a Forest  which underperformed at the box office when released by 20th Century Fox in 1993  The feature division was spun off into Turner Feature Animation  which produced the two films  The Pagemaster and Cats Don t Dance  Near the end of production on Cats Don t Dance  the studio was folded into Warner Bros  Animation  Also in 1992  Turner launched Cartoon Network  to showcase its huge library of animated programs  of which Hanna Barbera was the core contributor  As a result  many classic cartoons   especially those by H B   were introduced to a new audience  In 1994  The Funtastic World of Hanna Barbera finally ended  so that Turner could refocus the studio to produce new shows exclusively for the Turner owned networks  especially Cartoon Network  In February 1995  Hanna Barbera and Cartoon Network launched World Premiere Toons  a k a  What A Cartoon    a format designed by Seibert  The weekly program featured 48 new creator driven cartoon shorts developed by its in house staff  Several original Cartoon Network series emerged from the project  giving the studio their first bona fide mass appeal hits since The Smurfs  The first series based on a World Premiere Toons short was Genndy Tartakovsky s Dexter s Laboratory in 1996  Others programs followed  including Johnny Bravo  Cow and Chicken  its spinoff I Am Weasel  The Powerpuff Girls  and Courage the Cowardly Dog  though Hanna Barbera financed the short and was going to convert it into a full series  actual production occurred entirely at creator John R  Dilworth s studio  Stretch Films in New York City   H B also co produced several new direct to video movies featuring Scooby Doo with Warner Bros  Animation  as well as other new productions for television such as  The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest  Cave Kids and Tom and Jerry  The Mansion Cat  After the merger between Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner in 1996  the conglomerate had two separate animation studios in its possession  Though under a common ownership  Hanna Barbera and Warner Bros  Animation operated separately until 1998  That year  the Hanna Barbera lot was closed and studio operations were moved into the same office tower  adjacent to the Sherman Oaks Galleria  as the Warner Bros  Television Animation division in Sherman Oaks  Los Angeles  California   edit  Cartoon Network Studios era See also  Cartoon Network Studios Around 1999  the Hanna Barbera name began to disappear from newer shows from the studio in favor of the Cartoon Network Studios label  This came in handy with shows that were produced outside H B  but Cartoon Network had a hand in producing  such as A K A  Cartoon  Inc  s Ed  Edd  and Eddy  KINOFILM Animation s Mike  Lu  amp  Og  Curious Pictures s Sheep in the Big City and Codename  Kids Next Door  Renegade Animation s Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi and PorchLight Entertainment s The Secret Saturdays  as well as shows the studio

Rocks was dedicated to Hanna  but the actual production of Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase was done by Warner Bros  Animation  After 2001  Hanna Barbera s animation studio was completely folded into Warner Bros  Animation but remained in name only  and further Cartoon Network projects were handled by Cartoon Network Studios  Joseph Barbera continued to work for Warner Bros  Animation on projects relating to the Hanna Barbera and Tom and Jerry properties until his death on December 18  2006  19 Tom and Jerry  A Nutcracker Tale was dedicated to Barbera  Although the Hanna Barbera name remains on the copyright notices of new productions based on  classic  properties like the Flintstones  the Jetsons and others  the studio that produces these works is Warner Bros  Animation  Most Cartoon

Statements consisting only of original research may be removed  More details may be available on the talk page   February 2012  The HB Productions had different segments and times for incidental tracks production  Between 1957 and 1960  the incidental track was basically by symphonic arrangements  being Ruff and Reddy s series had its own symphonic themes  These themes used in the 1958 and 1959 to 1960s seasons to the first HB shorts with Yogi Bear  Huckleberry Hound  Quick Draw McGraw  Pixie and Dixie and Mr  Jinks  Snooper and Blabber and Augie Doggie  From 1959 60 series Loopy De Loop and The Flintstones  softly orchestrated themes  some of them almost sounding concrete music and some played only by accordion  were used in other HB cartons between 1961 and 1963   like Top Cat  Snagglepuss  Touch  Turtle  Wally Gator and the Yogi Bear and Huckleberry Hound 1961 seasons and all of its segments   and eventually between 1964 and 1967  and rarely then until the eighties  Other incidental tracks  organ music played as The Jetsons score themes and arrangements mostly based on polka music  they were used in cartoons like The Magilla Gorilla Show and its segments  Due to HB action adventure series as Johnny Quest  Space Ghost and Herculoids  the action style incidental tracks were created and adopted between 1964 and 1968  also eventually used in cartoons like The Atom Ant Secret Squirrel Show and Space Kidettes or also some Peter Potamus episodes  In 1967  another incidental tracks  between new polka arrangements and some rock soul influences  were adopted in several cartoons as Wacky Races  Cattanooga Cats and Josie and The Pussycats  With these themes  other orchestral themes were created for Scooby Doo s incidental tracks  These themes were largely used until 1973  In the seventies  other orchestral themes  with less creative arrangements in relation to the other described above  were used in 1973 to the eighties  including 1973 s Tom and Jerry seasons  new series as Hong Kong Phooey  Jabberjaw  Scooby Doo and Flintstones    70 s and 80 s production  In the eighties  the incidental tracks in HB cartoons were made by keyboard arrangements  and it s used until the end of the production company   edit  Hanna Barbera sound effects This article may contain original research  Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding references  Statements consisting only of original research may be removed  More details may be available on the talk page   February 2012  Besides their cartoons and characters  Hanna Barbera was also noted for their large library of sound effects  Besides cartoon style sound effects  such as ricochets  slide whistles and more   they also had familiar sounds used for transportation  household items  the elements  and more  When Hanna and Barbera started their own cartoon studio in 1957  they created a handful of sound effects  and had limited choices  They also took some sounds from the then defunct MGM animation studios  By 1958  they began to expand and began adding more sound effects to their library  Besides creating a lot of their own effects  they also collected sound effects from other movie and cartoon studios  such as Universal Pictures  Warner Bros  Animation  and even Walt Disney Productions  Some of their famous sound effects included a rapid bongo drum take used for when a character s feet were scrambling before taking off  a  KaBONG  sound produced on a guitar for when Quick Draw McGraw  in his Zorro style  El Kabong  crime fighting guise  would smash a guitar over a villain s head  the sound of a car s brake drum combined with a bulb horn for when Fred Flintstone would drop his bowling ball onto his foot  an automobile s tires squealing with a  skipping  effect added for when someone would slide to a sudden stop  a bass drum and cymbal combination called the  Boom Crash  for when someone would fall down or smack into an object  a xylophone being struck rapidly on the same note for a tip toeing effect  and a violin being plucked with the tuning pegs being raised to simulate something like pulling out a cat s whisker  The cartoons also used Castle Thunder  a thunderclap sound effect that was commonly used in movies and TV shows from the 1940s to the 1970s  Other common sounds such as Peeong  a frying pan hitting sound with a doppler effect  and Bilp were used regularly in all of its cartoons  Starting in the 1960s  other cartoon studios began using the sound effects  including Nickelodeon Animation Studio  Universal Animation Studios  Disney Television Animation  Film Roman  MGM Animation  Cartoon Network Studios  DiC Entertainment  Hasbro Studios  Warner Bros  Animation and many others  By the 21st century  almost every animation studio was using the sound effects  Today  like Hanna Barbera  they are used sparingly  while some cartoons and non animated series like Warner Bros  Animation s Krypto the Superdog  Nelvana s The Magic School Bus  A amp E s Parking Wars  Disney s Bonkers and Sp mc  s Ren  amp  Stimpy  Adult Party Cartoon  make heavy use of the classic sound effects  mostly for a retro feel  Some Hanna Barbera sounds show up in various sound libraries such as Valentino and Audio Network  Hanna Barbera Records  the studio s short lived record division  released a set of LP records in the late 1960s entitled Hanna Barbera s Drop Ins  which contained quite a few of the classic sound effects  This LP set was only available for radio and TV stations and other production studios  In 1973  and again in 1986  H B released a second sound effect record set  a seven LP set entitled The Hanna Barbera Library of Sounds  which  like the previous set  contained several of the classic sound effects  Like the previous set  this was only available to production companies and radio TV stations  The 1986 version was also available as a two compact disc set  In 1993  the last president of the studio  Fred Seibert recalled his early production experiences with early LP releases of the studio s effects  and commissioned Sound Ideas to release a four CD set entitled The Hanna Barbera Sound FX Library  featuring nearly all of the original H B sound effects used from 1957 to 1990  a more vast collection compared to the early LP releases  including the sounds H B had borrowed from other studios   The sound effects were digitally remastered  so they would sound better on new digital soundtracks  A fifth CD was added in 1996  entitled Hanna Barbera Lost Treasures  and featured more sound effects  including sounds from Space Ghost and The Impossibles  Also in 1994  Rhino Records released a CD containing some of Hanna Barbera s famous sound effects  titled simply as Hanna Barbera Cartoon Sound FX  and also included some answering machine messages and birthday greetings and short stories starring classic Hanna Barbera characters  and was hosted by Fred Flintstone  In 1996  it was reissued with the Hanna Barbera s Pic A Nic Basket of Cartoon Classics CD set  which also contained three other CDs of H B TV theme songs and background music and songs from The Flintstones  Here  the CD was relabeled as The Greatest Cartoon Sound Effects Ever  In the 1980s  Hanna Barbera slowly began to cease using their trademark sound effects  This was especially true with the action cartoons of the time such as Sky Commanders  By the 1990s  with cartoons shows such as Fish Police  SWAT Kats and the animated specials The Halloween Tree and Arabian Nights  the sound effects were virtually nonexistent  being replaced with newer  digitally recorded sounds  mostly from Sound Ideas   as well as the Looney Tunes sound library by Treg Brown  A few early 1990s cartoons continued to use the sound effects  such as Tom  amp  Jerry Kids and The Addams Family  By 1996  each TV series from the studio typically had its own set of sound effects  including some selected from the classic Hanna Barbera sound library  as well as some new ones and various sounds from Disney and Warner Bros  cartoons  this was especially true of Dexter s Laboratory and Cow and Chicken   Several of the classic H B sound effects still pop up from time to time in many of Cartoon Network Studios  productions  However  on the recent Warner Bros  produced Scooby Doo shows  What s New  Scooby Doo   Shaggy  amp  Scooby Doo Get a Clue   Scooby Doo  Mystery Incorporated  and direct to video movies  the Hanna Barbera sound effects are very rarely used   edit  See also Animation portal Companies portal Film
