with inventing the first practical telephone  N 1  Bell s father  grandfather  and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech  and both his mother and wife were deaf  profoundly influencing Bell s life s work  2  His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first US patent for the telephone in 1876  N 2  In retrospect  Bell considered his most famous invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study  4  Many other inventions marked Bell s later life  including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications  hydrofoils and aeronautics  In 1888  Alexander Graham Bell became one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society  5  Bell has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history  6  Contents 1 Early years 1 1 First invention 1 2 Education 1 3 First experiments with sound 1 4

Alexander Bell was born in Edinburgh  Scotland on March 3  1847  7  The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street  and has a stone inscription  marking it as Alexander Graham Bell s birthplace  He had two brothers  Melville James Bell  1845 70  and Edward Charles Bell  1848 67   Both of his brothers died of tuberculosis  8  His father was Professor Alexander Melville Bell  and his mother was Eliza Grace  n e Symonds   N 3  Although he was born  Alexander   at age 10  he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers  9  N 4  For his 11th birthday  his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the middle name  Graham   chosen out of admiration for Alexander Graham  a Canadian being treated by his father and boarder who had become a family friend  10  To close relatives and friends he remained  Aleck  which his father continued to call him into later life  11  First invention As a child  young Alexander displayed a natural curiosity about his world  resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age  His best friend was Ben Herdman  a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill  the scene of many forays  Young Aleck asked what needed to be done at the mill  He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12  Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes  creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years  12  In return  John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to  invent   12  From his early years  Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art  poetry and music that was encouraged by his mother  With no formal training  he mastered the piano and became the family s pianist  13  Despite being normally quiet and introspective  he reveled in mimicry and  voice tricks  akin to ventriloquism that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits  13  Bell was also deeply affected by his mother s gradual deafness   she began to lose her hearing when he was 12  and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour  14  He also developed a technique of speaking in clear  modulated tones directly into his mother s forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity  15  Bell s preoccupation with his mother s deafness led him to study acoustics  His family was long associated with the teaching of elocution  his grandfather  Alexander Bell  in London  his uncle in Dublin  and his father  in Edinburgh  were all elocutionists  His father published a variety of works on the subject  several of which are still well known  especially his The Standard Elocutionist  1860   13  which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868  The Standard Elocutionist appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone  In this treatise  his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf mutes  as they were then known  to articulate words and read other people s lip movements to decipher meaning  Aleck s father taught him and his brothers not only to write Visible Speech but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound  16  Aleck became so proficient that he became a part of his father s public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities  He was able to decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language  including Latin  Scottish Gaelic and even Sanskrit  accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation  16  Wikimedia Commons has media related to  a young Bell with his parents Education As a young child  Bell  like his brothers  received his early schooling at home from his father  At an early age  however  he was enrolled at the Royal High School  Edinburgh  Scotland  which he left at age 15  completing only the first four forms  17  His school record was undistinguished  marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades  His main interest remained in the sciences  especially biology  while he treated other school subjects with indifference  to the dismay of his demanding father  18  Upon leaving school  Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather  Alexander Bell  During the year he spent with his grandfather  a love of learning was born  with long hours spent in serious discussion and study  The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction  the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself  19  At age 16  Bell secured a position as a  pupil teacher  of elocution and music  in Weston House Academy  at Elgin  Moray  Scotland  Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek  he instructed classes himself in return for board and  10 per session  20  The following year  he attended the University of Edinburgh  joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year  In 1868  not long before he departed for Canada with his family  Aleck completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to the University of London  21  First experiments with sound Bell s father encouraged Aleck s interest in speech and  in 1863  took his sons to see a unique automaton  developed by Sir Charles Wheatstone based on the earlier work of Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen  22  The rudimentary  mechanical man  simulated a human voice  Aleck was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen s book  published in German  and had laboriously translated it  he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head  Their father  highly interested in their project  offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a  big prize  if they were successful  22  While his brother constructed the throat and larynx  Aleck tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull  His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could  speak   albeit only a few words  22  The boys would carefully adjust the  lips  and when a bellows forced air through the windpipe  a very recognizable  Mama  ensued  to the delight of neighbors who came to see the Bell invention  23  Intrigued by the results of the automaton  Bell continued to experiment with a live subject  the family s Skye Terrier   Trouve   24  After he taught it to growl continuously  Aleck would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog s lips and vocal cords to produce a crude sounding  Ow ah oo ga ma ma   With little convincing  visitors believed his dog could articulate  How are you grandma   More indicative of his playful nature  his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a  talking dog   25  However  these initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound  using tuning forks to explore resonance  At the age of 19  he wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist Alexander Ellis  a colleague of his father  who would later be portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in Pygmalion   25  Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany  and also lent Aleck a copy of Hermann von Helmholtz s work  The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music  26  Dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork  contraption   he pored over the German scientist s book  Working from his own errant mistranslation of the original German edition  Aleck fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound  reporting   Without knowing much about the subject  it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means  so could consonants  so could articulate speech   He also later remarked   I thought that Helmhotz had done it     and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity  It was a valuable blunder     If I had been able to read German in those days  I might never have commenced my experiments   27  28  29  Family tragedy In 1865  when the Bell family moved to London  30  Bell returned to Weston House as an assistant master and  in his spare hours  continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment  Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a telegraph wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend  31  Throughout late 1867  his health faltered mainly through exhaustion  His younger brother  Edward  Ted   was similarly bed ridden  suffering from tuberculosis  While Bell recovered  by then referring to himself in correspondence as  A G  Bell   and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College  Bath  England  his brother s condition deteriorated  Edward would never recover  Upon his brother s death  Bell returned home in 1867  His older brother Melville had married and moved out  With aspirations to obtain a degree at the University College London  Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations  devoting his spare time at his family s residence to studying  Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to Susanna E  Hull s private school for the deaf in South Kensington  London  His first two pupils were  deaf mute  girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage  While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school  applying for a patent on an invention  and starting a family  Bell continued as a teacher  However  in May 1870  Melville died from complications due to tuberculosis  causing a family crisis  His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in Newfoundland  Bell s parents embarked upon a long planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly  Acting decisively  Alexander Melville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property  32  N 5  conclude all of his brother s affairs  Bell took over his last student  curing a pronounced lisp   33  and join his father and mother in setting out for the  New World   34  Reluctantly  Bell also had to conclude a relationship with Marie Eccleston  who  he had surmised  was not prepared to leave England with him  34  Canada In 1870  at age 23  Bell  his brother s widow  Caroline  Margaret Ottaway   35  and his parents travelled on the SS Nestorian to Canada  36  After landing at Quebec City  the Bells boarded a train to Montreal and later to Paris  Ontario  to stay with the Reverend Thomas Henderson  a family friend  After a brief stay with the Hendersons  the Bell family purchased a farm of 10 5 acres  42 000 m2  at Tutelo Heights  now called Tutela Heights   near Brantford  Ontario  The property consisted of an orchard  large farm house  stable  pigsty  hen house and a carriage house  which bordered the Grand River  37  N 6  At the homestead  Bell set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house 38  near to what he called his  dreaming place   a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river  39  Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada  Bell found the climate and environs to his liking  and rapidly improved  40  N 7  He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the Six Nations Reserve across the river at Onondaga  he learned the Mohawk language and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols  For his work  Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a Mohawk headdress and danced traditional dances  41  N 8  After setting up his workshop  Bell continued experiments based on Helmholtz s work with electricity and sound  38  He designed a piano  which  by means of electricity  could transmit its music at a distance  Once the family was settled in  both Bell and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871  he accompanied his father to Montreal  where Melville was offered a position to teach his System of Visible Speech  Work with the deaf Wikimedia Commons has media related to  the Scott Circle School for Deaf Children Bell s father was invited by Sarah Fuller  principal of the Boston School for Deaf Mutes  which continues today as the public Horace Mann School for the Deaf   42  in Boston  Massachusetts  to introduce the Visible Speech System by providing training for Fuller s instructors  but he declined the post  in favor of his son  Traveling to Boston in April 1871  Bell proved successful in training the school s instructors  43  He was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the American Asylum for Deaf mutes in Hartford  Connecticut  and the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton  Massachusetts  Returning home to Brantford after six months abroad  Bell continued his experiments with his  harmonic telegraph   44  N 9  The basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch  but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed  45  Unsure of his future  he first contemplated returning to London to complete his studies  but decided to return to Boston as a teacher  46  His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting Gardiner Greene Hubbard  the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation  Teaching his father s system  in October 1872 Alexander Bell opened his  School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech  in Boston  which attracted a large number of deaf pupils with his first class numbering 30 students  47  48  While he was working as a private tutor  one of his most famous pupils was Helen Keller  who came to him as a young child unable to see  hear  or speak  She was later to say that Bell dedicated his life to the penetration of that  inhuman silence which separates and estranges   49  Several influential people of the time  including Bell  viewed deafness as something that ought to be eradicated  and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language  thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded  50  However in several schools children were mistreated  for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing the only language they knew and were therefore forced to attempt oral communication  Due to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language  Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing deaf culture  citation needed  Continuing experimentation In the following year  Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the Boston University School of Oratory  During this period  he alternated between Boston and Brantford  spending summers in his Canadian home  At Boston University  Bell was  swept up  by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city  He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech  but although absorbed by his experiments  he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation  While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes  Bell began to stay awake late into the night  running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house  Keeping up  night owl  hours  he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment  Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover  51  Worse still  his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches  45  Returning to Boston in fall 1873  Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound  Deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice  Bell only retained two students  six year old  Georgie  Sanders  deaf from birth and 15 year old Mabel Hubbard  Each pupil would serve to play an important role in the next developments  George s father  Thomas Sanders  a wealthy businessman  offered Bell a place to stay at nearby Salem with Georgie s grandmother  complete with a room to  experiment   Although the offer was made by George s mother and followed the year long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell s boarding house  it was clear that Mr  Sanders was backing the proposal  The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together with free room and board thrown in  52  Mabel was a bright  attractive girl who was ten years his junior but became the object of Bell s affection  Losing her hearing after a near fatal bout of scarlet fever close to her fifth birthday  53  54  N 10  she had learned to read lips but her father  Gardiner Greene Hubbard  Bell s benefactor and personal friend  wanted her to work directly with her teacher  55  Telephone Main article  Invention of the telephone By 1874  Bell s initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage with progress it made both at his new Boston  laboratory   a rented facility  as well as at his family home in Canada a big success  N 11  While working that summer in Brantford  Bell experimented with a  phonautograph   a pen like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations  Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves  56  Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound  But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas  57  In 1874  telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of Western Union President William Orton  had become  the nervous system of commerce   Orton had contracted with inventors Thomas Edison and Elisha Gray to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines  58  When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi reed device  the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell s experiments  59  Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard s patent attorney  Anthony Pollok  60  In March 1875  Bell and Pollok visited the famous scientist Joseph Henry  who was then director of the Smithsonian Institution  and asked Henry s advice on the electrical multi reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph  Henry replied that Bell had  the germ of a great invention   When Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge  Henry replied   Get it   That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying  even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments  nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas  However  a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and Thomas A  Watson  an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams  changed all that  With financial support from Sanders and Hubbard  Bell was able to hire Thomas Watson as his assistant and the two of them experimented with acoustic telegraphy  On June 2  1875  Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell  at the receiving end of the wire  heard the overtones of the reed  overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech  That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary  not multiple reeds  This led to the  gallows  sound powered telephone  which was able to transmit indistinct  voice like sounds  but not clear speech  The race to the patent office Main article  Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy In 1875  Bell developed an acoustic telegraph and drew up a patent application for it  Since he had agreed to share U S  profits with his investors Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders  Bell requested that an associate in Ontario  George Brown  attempt to patent it in Britain  instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U S  only after they received word from Britain  Britain would issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented elsewhere   61  Alexander Graham Bell s telephone patent 62  drawing  March 7  1876  Meanwhile  Elisha Gray was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter  On February 14  1876  Gray filed a caveat with the U S  Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter  That same morning  Bell s lawyer filed Bell s application with the patent office  There is considerable debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell s patent  Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26  Bell s patent 174 465  was issued to Bell on March 7  1876  by the U S  Patent Office  Bell s patent covered  the method of  and apparatus for  transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically     by causing electrical undulations  similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound  63  N 12  Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work  drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray s patent caveat  On March 10  1876  three days after his patent was issued  Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work  using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray s design  Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water  varying the electrical resistance in the circuit  When Bell spoke the famous sentence  Mr Watson Come here I want to see you  into the liquid transmitter  64  Watson  listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room  heard the words clearly  65  Although Bell was  and still is  accused of stealing the telephone from Gray  66  Bell used Gray s water transmitter design only after Bell s patent was granted and only as a proof of concept scientific experiment 67  to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible  articulate speech   Bell s words  could be electrically transmitted  68  After March 1876  Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray s liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use  69  The question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the Examiner before he approved Bell s patent application  He told Bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray s caveat  Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in Bell s previous application in which Bell described a cup of mercury  not water  Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25  1875  long before Elisha Gray described the water device  In addition  Gray abandoned his caveat  and because Gray did not contest Bell s priority  the Examiner approved Bell s patent on March 3  1876  Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone  but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone  70  The patent examiner  Zenas Fisk Wilber  later stated in a sworn affidavit citation needed that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell s lawyer  Marcellus Bailey  with whom he had served in the Civil War  He claimed he showed Gray s patent caveat to Bailey  Wilber also claimed  after Bell arrived in Washington D C  from Boston  that he showed Gray s caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him  100  Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms  although in a letter to Gray  Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details  Bell denied in a sworn affidavit that he ever gave Wilber any money  Later developments Continuing his experiments in Brantford  Bell brought home a working model of his telephone  On August 3  1876  from the telegraph office in Mount Pleasant five miles  8 km  away from Brantford  Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready  With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses  faint voices were heard replying  The following night  he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford  four miles  six km  distant along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences  and laid through a tunnel  This time  guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing  These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances  71  Bell at the opening of the long distance line from New York to Chicago in 1892  Bell and his partners  Hubbard and Sanders  offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for  100 000  The president of Western Union balked  countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy  Two years later  he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for  25 million he would consider it a bargain  By then  the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent  72  Bell s investors would become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars  73  Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures in order to introduce the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public  Only one day after  his demonstration of an early telephone prototype at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia made the telephone the featured headline worldwide  74  Influential visitors to the exhibition included Emperor Pedro II of Brazil  and later Bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to William Thomson  a renowned Scottish scientist  Later Bell demonstrated the invention to Queen Victoria who had requested a private audience at Osborne House  her Isle of Wight home  She called the demonstration  most extraordinary   The enthusiasm surrounding Bell s public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device  75  The Bell Telephone Company was created in 1877  and by 1886  over 150 000 people in the U S  owned telephones  Bell company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone  which emerged as one of the most successful products ever  In 1879  the Bell company acquired Edison s patents for the carbon microphone from Western Union  This made the telephone practical for long distances and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone  In January 1915  Bell made the first ceremonial transcontinental telephone call  Calling from the AT amp T head office at 15 Dey Street in New York City  Bell was heard by Thomas Watson at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco  The New York Times reported  On October 9  1876  Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas A  Watson talked by telephone to each other over a two mile  3 km  wire stretched between Cambridge and Boston  It was the first wire conversation ever held  Yesterday afternoon  on January 25  1915  the same two men talked by telephone to each other over a 3 400 mile  5 500 km  wire between New York and San Francisco  Dr  Bell  the veteran inventor of the telephone  was in New York  and Mr  Watson  his former associate  was on the other side of the continent  They heard each other much more distinctly than they did in their first talk thirty eight years ago  76  Competitors See also  Canadian Parliamentary Motion on Alexander Graham Bell As is sometimes common in scientific discoveries  simultaneous developments can occur  as evidenced by a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone  4  Over a period of 18 years  the Bell Telephone Company faced 587 court challenges to its patents  including five that went to the US Supreme Court  77  but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent 78  79  and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage  78  Bell s laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments  78  The Bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by Elisha Gray and Amos Dolbear  In personal correspondence to Bell  both Gray and Dolbear had acknowledged his prior work  which considerably weakened their later claims  80  On January 13  1887  the US Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation  After a series of decisions and reversals  the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court  though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided  81  82  By the time that the trial wound its way through nine years of legal battles  the U S  prosecuting attorney had died and the two Bell patents  No  174 465 and dated March 7  1876 and No  186 787 dated January 30  1877  were no longer in effect  although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case s importance as a  precedent   With a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest  on both sides  arising from the original trial  the US Attorney General dropped the lawsuit on November 30  1897 leaving several issues undecided on the merits  83  During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial  Italian inventor Antonio Meucci also claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834  In 1886  in the first of three cases in which he was involved  Meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention s priority  Meucci s evidence in this case was disputed due to a lack of material evidence for his inventions as his working models were purportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph  ADT  of New York  which later  in 1901  was incorporated as a subsidiary of Western Union  84  85  Meucci s work  like many other inventors of the period  was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite evidence of earlier experiments  the final case involving Meucci was eventually dropped upon Meucci s death  86  However  due to the efforts of Congressman Vito Fossella  the U S  House of Representatives on June 11  2002 stated that Meucci s  work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged   even though this did not put an end to a still contentious issue  87  88  N 13  89  Some modern scholars do not agree with the claims that Bell s work on the telephone was influenced by Meucci s inventions  90  N 14  The value of the Bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world  and patent applications were made in most major countries  but when Bell had delayed the German patent application  the electrical firm of Siemens  amp  Halske  S amp H  managed to set up a rival manufacturer of Bell telephones under their own patent  The Siemens company produced near identical copies of the Bell telephone without having to pay royalties  91  The establishment of the International Bell Telephone Company in Brussels  Belgium in 1880  as well as a series of agreements in other countries eventually consolidated a global telephone operation  The strain put on Bell by his constant appearances in court  necessitated by the legal battles  eventually resulted in his resignation from the company  92  N 15  Further information  The Telephone Cases Family life Alexander Graham Bell  his wife Mabel Gardiner Hubbard  and their daughters Elsie  left  and Marian ca  1885 Wikimedia Commons has media related to  Bell and his family members On July 11  1877  a few days after the Bell Telephone Company was established  Bell married Mabel Hubbard  1857 1923  at the Hubbard estate in Cambridge  Massachusetts  His wedding present to his bride was to turn over 1 487 of his 1 497 shares in the newly created Bell Telephone Company  93  Shortly thereafter  the newlyweds embarked on a year long honeymoon in Europe  During that excursion  Alec took a handmade model of his telephone with him  making it a  working holiday   The courtship had begun years earlier  however Alexander waited until he was more financially secure before marrying  Although the telephone appeared to be an  instant  success  it was not initially a profitable venture and Bell s main sources of income were from lectures until after 1897  94  One unusual request exacted by his fianc e was that he use  Alec  rather than the family s earlier familiar name of  Aleck   From 1876  he would sign his name  Alec Bell   95  N 16  They had four children  Elsie May Bell  1878 1964  who married Gilbert Grosvenor of National Geographic fame  N 17  N

Bell s father in law bought a house in Washington  D C   and later in 1882 bought a home in the same city for Bell s family  so that they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes  96  Bell was a British subject throughout his early life in Scotland and later in Canada until 1882  when he became a naturalized citizen of the United States  In 1915  he characterized his status as   I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries   97  Despite this declaration  Bell has been proudly claimed as a  native son  by all three countries he resided in  the United States  Canada and Scotland  98  The Brodhead Bell mansion  the Bell family residence in Washington  D C   from 1882 to 1889  99  By 1885  a new summer retreat was contemplated  That summer  the Bells had a vacation on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia  spending time at the small village of Baddeck  100  Returning in 1886  Bell started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck  overlooking Bras d Or Lake  101  By 1889  a large house  christened The Lodge was completed and two years later  a larger complex of buildings  including a new laboratory  100  were begun that the Bells would name Beinn Bhreagh  Gaelic  beautiful mountain  after Alec s ancestral Scottish highlands  102  N 22 Bell would spend his final  and some of his most productive  years in residence in both Washington  D C   where he and his family initially resided for most of the year  and at Beinn Bhreagh  103  Until the end of his life  Bell and his family would alternate between the two homes  but Beinn Bhreagh would  over the next 30 years  become more than a summer home as Bell became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays lengthened  Both Mabel and Alec became immersed in the Baddeck community and were accepted by the villagers as  their own   100  The Bells were still in residence at Beinn Bhreagh when the Halifax Explosion occurred on December 6  1917  Mabel and Alec mobilized the community to help victims in Halifax  104  Further information  Beinn Bhreagh  Nova Scotia Later inventions Wikimedia Commons has media related to  Bell s many inventions Alexander Graham Bell in his later years  Although Alexander Graham Bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone  his interests were extremely varied  According to one of his biographers  Charlotte Gray  Bell s work ranged  unfettered across the scientific landscape  and he often went to bed voraciously reading the Encyclop dia Britannica  scouring it for new areas of interest  105  The range of Bell s inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators  These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph  four for the Photophone  one for the phonograph  five for aerial vehicles  four for  hydroairplanes  and two for selenium cells  Bell s inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing  the audiometer to detect minor hearing problems  a device to locate icebergs  investigations on how to separate salt from seawater  and work on finding alternative fuels  Bell worked extensively in medical research and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf  During his Volta Laboratory period  Bell and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record as a means of reproducing sound  Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept  they were unable to develop a workable prototype  They abandoned the idea  never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the tape recorder  the hard disc and floppy disc drive and other magnetic media  Bell s own home used a primitive form of air conditioning  in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice  He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution  Methane gas  he reasoned  could be produced from the waste of farms and factories  At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia  he experimented with composting toilets and devices to capture water from the atmosphere  In a magazine interview published shortly before his death  he reflected on the possibility of using solar panels to heat houses  Metal detector Bell is also credited with the invention of the metal detector in 1881  The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of US President James Garfield  The metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin s bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument  resulting in static  106  The president s surgeons  who were skeptical of the device  ignored Bell s requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs  Alternatively  although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test  the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus  106  Bell gave a full account of his experiments in a paper read before the American Association for the Advancement of Science  AAAS  in August 1882  Hydrofoils Main article  Hydrofoil Bell HD 4 on a test run ca  1919 The March 1906 Scientific American article by American pioneer William E  Meacham explained the basic principle of hydrofoils and hydroplanes  Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement  Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat  Bell and assistant Frederick W   Casey  Baldwin began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water  Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor Enrico Forlanini and began testing models  This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft  During his world tour of 1910 11  Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France  They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore  Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying  On returning to Baddeck  a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models  including the Dhonnas Beag  the first self propelled Bell Baldwin hydrofoil  107  The experimental boats were essentially proof of concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial HD 4  powered by Renault engines  A top speed of 54 miles per hour  87 km h  was achieved  with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration  good stability and steering along with the ability to take waves without difficulty  108  In 1913  Dr  Bell hired Walter Pinaud  a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud s Yacht Yard in Westmount  Nova Scotia to work on the pontoons of the HD 4  Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh  Bell s estate near Baddeck  Nova Scotia  Pinaud s experience in boat building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD 4  After the First World War  work began again on the HD 4  Bell s report to the U S  Navy permitted him to obtain two 350 horsepower  260 kW  engines in July 1919  On September 9  1919  the HD 4 set a world marine speed record of 70 86 miles per hour  114 04 km h   109  a record which stood for ten years  Aeronautics Main articles  Aerial Experiment Association and AEA Silver Dart AEA Silver Dart ca  1909 In 1891  Bell had begun experiments to develop motor powered heavier than air aircraft  The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife  who advised him to seek  young  help as Alexander was at the graceful age of 60  In 1898  Bell experimented with tetrahedral box kites and wings constructed of multiple compound tetrahedral kites covered in maroon silk  N 23  The tetrahedral wings were named Cygnet I  II and III  and were flown both unmanned and manned  Cygnet I crashed during a flight carrying Selfridge  in the period from 1907 1912  Some of Bell s kites are on display at the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site  111  Bell was a supporter of aerospace engineering research through the Aerial Experiment Association  AEA   officially formed at Baddeck  Nova Scotia  in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife Mabel and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real estate  112  The AEA was headed by Bell and the founding members were four young men  American Glenn H  Curtiss  a motorcycle manufacturer at the time and who held the title  world s fastest man   having ridden his self constructed motor bicycle around in the shortest time  and who was later awarded the Scientific American Trophy for the first official one kilometre flight in the Western hemisphere  and who later became a world renowned airplane manufacturer  Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge  an official observer from the US Federal government and the only person in the army who believed aviation was the future  Frederick W  Baldwin  the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in Hammondsport  New York  and J A D  McCurdy  Baldwin and McCurdy being new engineering graduates from the University of Toronto  The AEA s work progressed to heavier than air machines  applying their knowledge of kites to gliders  Moving to Hammondsport  the group then designed and built the Red Wing  framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small air cooled engine  113  On March 12  1908  over Keuka Lake  the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America  N 24  N 25  The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and tail rudder  later variations on the original design would add ailerons as a means of control   One of the AEA s inventions  the aileron  which was also created independently by Robert Esnault Pelterie and several others  was to become a standard component on all airplanes  The White Wing and June Bug were to follow and by the end of 1908  over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished  However  the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a  15 000 grant from Mrs  Bell allowed it to continue with experiments  114  Their final aircraft design  the Silver Dart embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines  On February 23  1909  Bell was present as the Silver Dart flown by J A D  McCurdy from the frozen ice of Bras d Or  made the first aircraft flight in Canada  Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to be on hand  With the successful flight  the AEA disbanded and the Silver Dart would revert to Baldwin and McCurdy who began the Canadian Aerodrome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the Canadian Army  115  Eugenics Bell was connected with the eugenics movement in the United States  In his lecture Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race presented to the National Academy of Sciences on November 13  1883 he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry  116  However  it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist David Starr Jordan s Committee on Eugenics  under the auspices of the American Breeders Association  The committee unequivocally extended the principle to man  117  From 1912 until 1918 he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the Eugenics Record Office associated with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York  and regularly attended meetings  In 1921  he was the honorary president of the Second International Congress of Eugenics held under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York  Organisations such as these advocated passing laws  with success in some states  that established the compulsory sterilization of people deemed to be  as Bell called them  a  defective variety of the human race   By the late 1930s  about half the states in the U S  had eugenics laws  and the California laws were used as a model for eugenics laws in Nazi Germany  citation needed  Legacy and honors Main articles  Volta Laboratory and Bureau and Alexander Graham Bell honors and tributes Bell statue by A E  Cleeve Horne

Ontario  Canada  Honors and tributes flowed to Bell in increasing numbers as his most famous invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew  Bell received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities  to the point that the requests almost became burdensome  118  During his life he also received dozens of major awards  medals and other tributes  These included statuary monuments to both him and the new form of communication his telephone created  notably the Bell Telephone Memorial erected in his honor in Brantford  Ontario s Alexander Graham Bell Gardens in 1917  119  A large number of Bell s writings  personal correspondence  notebooks  papers and other documents 120  reside at both the United States Library of Congress Manuscript Division  as the Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers   and at the Alexander Graham Bell Institute   Cape Breton University  Nova Scotia  major portions of which are available for online viewing  A number of historic sites and other marks commemorate Bell in North America and Europe  including the first telephone companies of the United States and Canada  Among the major sites are  The Parks Canada s Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site  which incorporates the Alexander Graham Bell Museum  in Baddeck  Nova Scotia  close to the Bell estate Beinn Bhreagh 121  The Bell Homestead  also known as Melville House  overlooking Brantford  Ontario and the Grand River  which was the Bell family s first home in North America  Canada s first telephone company building   the Henderson Home   of the nascent 1877 Bell Telephone Company of Canada  which was carefully relocated in 1969 to the historic Bell Homestead  The Bell Homestead  and the  Bell Telephone Company Building  are both maintained by the Bell Homestead Society  in Brantford  Ontario 122  The Alexander Graham Bell Memorial Park  which features a broad neoclassical monument built in 1917 by public subscription  The monument graphically depicts mankind s ability to span the globe through telecommunications  123  The Alexander Graham Bell Museum  opened in 1956   part of the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site which was completed in 1978 in Baddeck  Nova Scotia  Many of the museum s artifacts were donated by Bell s daughters  Bell Museum  Cape Breton In 1880  Bell received the Volta Prize with a purse of 50 000 francs  approximately US 250 000 in today s dollars 124   for the invention of the telephone from the Acad mie fran aise  representing the French government  Among the luminaries who judged were Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas  The Volta Prize was conceived by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801  and named in honor of Alessandro Volta  with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its history  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  Since Bell was becoming increasingly affluent  he used his prize money to create endowment funds  the  Volta Fund   and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington  D C   These included the prestigious  Volta Laboratory Association   1880   also known as the Volta Laboratory and as the  Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory   and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau  1887  as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown  Washington  D C  The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery  and the very next year invented a wax phonograph cylinder that was later used by Thomas Edison  133  The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his  proudest achievement   the Photophone  the optical telephone which presaged fibre optical telecommunications  while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing  the AG Bell   a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness  In partnership with Gardiner Hubbard  Bell helped establish the publication Science during the early 1880s  In 1888  Bell was one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society and became its second president  1897 1904   and also became a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution  1898 1922   The French government conferred on him the decoration of the L gion d honneur  Legion of Honor   the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him the Albert Medal in 1902  and the University of W rzburg  Bavaria  granted him a PhD He was awarded the Franklin Institute s Elliott Cresson Medal in 1912  He was one of the founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1884  and served as its president from 1891 92  Bell was later awarded the AIEE s Edison Medal in 1914  For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone   134  The bel  B  and the smaller decibel  dB  are units of measurement of sound intensity invented by Bell Labs and named after him  135  N 26  136  Since 1976 the IEEE s Alexander Graham Bell Medal has been awarded to honor outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications    A G  Bell   Issue of 1940 In 1940 the US Post Office issued a commemorative stamp honoring Bell in its  Famous Americans Series   The First Day of Issue ceremony was held on October 28 in Boston  Massachusetts  the city where Bell spent considerable time on research and working with the deaf  The Bell stamp became very popular and sold out in little time  The stamp became  and remains to this day  the most valuable one of the series  137  The 150th anniversary of Bell s birth in 1997 was marked by a special issue of commemorative  1 banknotes from the Royal Bank of Scotland  The illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell s face in profile  his signature  and objects from Bell s life and career  users of the telephone over the ages  an audio wave signal  a diagram of a telephone receiver  geometric shapes from engineering structures  representations of sign language and the phonetic alphabet  the geese which helped him to understand flight  and the sheep which he studied to understand genetics  138  Additionally  the Government of Canada honored Bell in 1997 with a C 100 gold coin  in tribute also to the 150th anniversary of his birth  139  and with a silver dollar coin in 2009 to honor of the 100th anniversary of flight in Canada  That first flight was made by an airplane designed under Dr  Bell s tutelage  named the Silver Dart 140  Bell s image  and also those of his many inventions have graced paper money  coinage and postal stamps in numerous countries worldwide for many dozens of years  Bell s name is widely known and still used as part of the names of dozens of educational institutes  corporate namesakes  street and place names around the world  Alexander Graham Bell was also ranked 57th among the 100 Greatest Britons  2002  in an official BBC nationwide poll  and among the Top Ten Greatest Canadians  2004   and the 100 Greatest Americans  2005   141  142  In 2006  Bell was also named as one of the 10 greatest Scottish scientists in history after having been listed in the National Library of Scotland s  Scottish Science Hall of Fame   143  Bell  an alumnus of the University of Edinburgh  Scotland  receiving an honorary Doctor of Laws degree  LL D   at the university in 1906  See also  Bell Telephone Memorial Honorary degrees Alexander Graham Bell  who was unable to complete

2  1922  at his private estate  Beinn Bhreagh  Nova Scotia  at age 75  147  Bell had also been afflicted with pernicious anemia  148  His last view of the land he had inhabited was by moonlight on his mountain estate at 2 00 A M  N 27  151  N 28  While tending to her husband after his long illness  Mabel whispered   Don t leave me   By way of reply  Bell traced the sign for no and then he expired  127  152  On learning of Bell s death  Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King cabled Mrs  Bell  saying   The Government expresses  to you our sense of the world s loss in the death of your distinguished husband  It will ever be a source of pride to our country that the great invention  with which his name is immortally associated  is a part of its history  On the behalf of the citizens of Canada  may I extend to you an expression of our combined gratitude and sympathy  127  Bell s coffin was constructed of Beinn Bhreagh pine by his laboratory staff  lined with the same red silk fabric used in his tetrahedral kite experiments  In order to help celebrate his life  his wife asked guests not to wear black  the traditional funeral color  while attending his service  during which soloist Jean MacDonald sang a verse of Robert Louis Stevenson s  Requiem   153  Under a wide and starry sky  Dig the grave and let me lie  Glad did I live and gladly die And I lay me down with a will  Upon the conclusion of Bell s funeral   every phone on the continent of North America was silenced in honor of the man who had given to mankind the means for direct communication at a distance   100  154  Dr  Alexander Graham Bell was buried atop Beinn Bhreagh mountain  on his estate where he had resided increasingly for the last 35 years of his life  overlooking Bras d Or Lake  127  He was

Developed Sign Language for Mutes   New York Times Tuesday  August 8  1905    Bell typically signed his name in full on his correspondence    The family pet was given to his brother s family    The estate is today known as the  Bell Homestead     Bell would later write that he had come to Canada a  dying man     Bell was thrilled at his recognition by the Six Nations Reserve and throughout his life would launch into a Mohawk war dance when he was excited    In later years  Bell described the invention of the telephone and linked it to his  dreaming place     Eber claimed that Mabel suffered scarlet fever in New York     shortly before her fifth birthday      however Toward provided a detailed chronology of the event claiming      shortly after their arrival in New York  in January 1863    when Mabel would have been at least five years and five weeks of age  Mabel s exact age when she became deaf would later play a part in the debate on the effectiveness of manual versus oral education for deaf children  as children who are older at the onset of deafness retain greater vocalization skills and are thus more successful in oral education programs  Some of the debate centred on whether Mabel had to relearn oral speech from scratch  or whether she never lost it    Quote   Brantford is justified in calling herself  The Telephone City  because the telephone originated there  It was invented in Brantford at Tutela Heights in the summer of 1874   44    A copy of a draft of the patent application is shown  described as  probably the most valuable patent ever     Meucci was not involved in the final trial    Tomas Farley also writes that   Nearly every scholar agrees that Bell and Watson were the first to transmit intelligible speech by electrical means  Others transmitted a sound or a click or a buzz but our boys  Bell and Watson  were the first to transmit speech one could understand     Many of the lawsuits became rancorous with Elisha Gray becoming particularly bitter
