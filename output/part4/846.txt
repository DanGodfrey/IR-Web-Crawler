team was closely associated with the original Superboy  Superman when he was a teenager   and was first portrayed as a group of time travelers who frequently visited him  In later years  the Legion s origin and back story were fleshed out  and the group replaced Superboy as the focus of their stories  eventually Superboy was removed altogether  except as an occasional guest star  The team has undergone several major reboots during its publication  The original version was replaced with a new rebooted version following the events of Zero Hour and another rebooted team was introduced in 2004  A fourth version of the team  nearly identical to the original version  was introduced in 2007  As a result  Superman  both as an adult and a teenager  and the current version of Supergirl have been

continuity  1958 1994  Main article  Legion of Super Heroes  1958 team  The cover of Adventure Comics  247  April 1958   the Legion s first appearance  Art by Curt Swan and Stan Kaye  Superboy was the featured series in Adventure Comics in the late 1950s  In Adventure Comics  247  April 1958   he was met by three teenagers from the 30th century  Lightning Boy  Saturn Girl  and Cosmic Boy  who were members of a  super hero club  called the Legion of Super Heroes  Their club had been formed with Superboy as an inspiration  and they had time travelled to recruit Superboy as a member  After a series of tests  Superboy was awarded membership and returned to his own time  Although intended as a one off story focusing on Superboy  the Legion proved so popular that it returned for an encore in Adventure Comics  267  December 1959   Lightning Boy had been renamed Lightning Lad  and their costumes were very close to those they wore throughout the Silver Age of Comic Books  The Legion s popularity grew  and they appeared in further stories in Adventure Comics and Action Comics over the next few years  The ranks of the Legion  only hinted at in those first two stories  were filled with new heroes  such as Chameleon Boy  Invisible Kid  Colossal Boy  Star Boy  Brainiac 5  Triplicate Girl  Shrinking Violet  Sun Boy  Bouncing Boy  Phantom Girl  and Ultra Boy  Even Supergirl was recruited as a member  1  In Adventure Comics  300  September 1962   the Legion received their own regular feature  cover billed  Superboy in  Tales of the Legion of Super Heroes    While they would share space with Superboy solo stories for a couple of years  they eventually displaced Superboy entirely as their popularity grew  It was this run which established the Legion s general workings and environment  A club of teenagers  they operated out of a clubhouse in the shape of a yellow rocket ship inverted as if it had been driven into the ground  The position of Legion leader rotated among the membership  sometimes through election  and sometimes by more arcane methods  Each Legionnaire had to possess at least one natural superpower  i e   powers from devices were disallowed   in particular a power which no other member possessed  Despite this  several members had overlapping powers  particularly Superboy  Supergirl  Mon El  and Ultra Boy  Some issues included comical moments where candidates with bizarre  useless  or dangerous abilities would try out for membership and be rejected  Five of these flawed candidates went on to form the Legion of Substitute Heroes  The Legion was based on Earth  and protected an organization of humans and aliens called the United Planets  The regular police force in the UP was the Science Police  The setting for each story was almost always 1000 years from the date of publication  In Adventure Comics  346  July 1966   Jim Shooter  14 years old at the time  wrote his first Legion story  2  Soon thereafter  Shooter became the regular writer of the Legion stories  with Curt Swan  and later Win Mortimer  as artist  Shooter wrote the story about Ferro Lad s death  the first  real  death of a Legionnaire  although Lightning Lad had been believed dead for a while before    and introduced many other enduring concepts  including the Fatal Five  Shadow Lass  the Dark Circle  Mordru  and the  Adult Legion   a conjecture regarding what the Legionnaires would be like when they grew up  The Legion s last appearance in Adventure Comics was  380  May 1969   when they were displaced by Supergirl  The early 1970s saw the Legion relegated to the status of back up feature  First  the team s stories were moved to Action Comics for issues  377 392  June 1969 September 1970   Following that  the Legion began appearing occasionally as a backup in Superboy  starting with  172  March 1971   with writer and artists E  Nelson Bridwell  Cary Bates  and George Tuska  Dave Cockrum began drawing the series with Superboy  184  April 1972   again increasing the team s popularity  3   edit  Superboy and their own title The Legion of Super Heroes during the 1970s  Art by Neal Adams  The first comic book published under the title Legion of Super Heroes was a four issue series published in 1973 that reprinted Legion tales from Adventure Comics  In the same year  the Legion returned to cover billing on a book when Superboy became Superboy starring the Legion of Super Heroes with  197  August 1973   Crafted by Bates and Cockrum  the feature proved popular and saw such events as the wedding of Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel in Superboy  200  Feb 1974   4  Cockrum was replaced on art by Mike Grell as of issue  203  August 1974  which featured the death of Invisible Kid  5  With  231  September 1977   the book s title officially changed to Superboy and the Legion of Super Heroes and also became a  giant size  title  At this point  the book was written by longtime fan Paul Levitz and drawn by James Sherman  although Gerry Conway frequently wrote as well  Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad were married in All New Collectors  Edition  C 55  1978   a treasury sized special written by Levitz and drawn by Grell  6  In  241 245  July December 1978  Levitz and Sherman  and then Joe Staton  produced what was at that time the most ambitious Legion storyline   Earthwar   a galactic war between the United Planets and the Khunds  with several other villains lurking in the background  During this period  Karate Kid was spun off into his own 20th Century based self titled series  which lasted 15 issues  Levitz left the book  to be replaced full time by Gerry Conway  Superboy departed from the Legion due to a plot of a villain  and the book was renamed simply Legion of Super Heroes starting with issue  259  January 1980   Jimmy Janes took over the art in a lengthy tale by Conway  and later Roy Thomas  involving Ultra Boy s disappearance during a mission  and his long odyssey to rejoin the team  7  This story told the tale of the Legionnaire Reflecto  only glimpsed during the  Adult Legion  stories in Adventure Comics   featured villainy by the Time Trapper and Grimbor the Chainsman  and saw Superboy rejoin the team  8   edit  Paul Levitz era Paul Levitz returned to write the book with  284  Pat Broderick and Bruce Patterson illustrated the book for a short time before Keith Giffen began on pencils  with Patterson  and then Larry Mahlstedt  on inks  The creative team received enhanced popularity following  The Great Darkness Saga   9  which ran from  287   290 294  and Annual  3  featuring a full assault on the United Planets by Darkseid  The Legion celebrated issue  300  June 1983  by revisiting the  Adult Legion  storyline through a series of parallel world short stories illustrated by a number of popular Legion artists from previous years  The story served to free up Legion continuity from following the  Adult Legion  edict of previous issues  Giffen s style changed abruptly a few issues later  to a darker and sketchier style inspired by Argentinian artist Jos  Mu oz  A new Legion of Super Heroes comic  the third publication under the title  was launched in August 1984  The existing Legion series  renamed Tales of the Legion of Super Heroes with issue  314  continued running new material for a year  then began reprinting stories from the new Legion of Super Heroes with issue  326  Tales continued publishing reprints until its final issue   354  December 1987   The new series was launched in August 1984 10  with a five part story featuring the Legion of Super Villains  Giffen left in the middle of the story and was replaced by Steve Lightle  who stayed on the book for a year  Greg LaRocque began a lengthy run in  16  November 1985   including a crossover with John Byrne s recently rebooted Superman titles in  37 and  38  The crossover was the first of several attempts by DC editors to explain the origins and fate of Superboy and his history with the Legion  in light of the revisions to the DC Universe caused by Crisis on Infinite Earths that removed Superman s career as Superboy from his personal history  In the crossover  the Legion s Superboy was revealed to have come from a parallel  Pocket Universe  created by the Time Trapper  11  The crossover ended with Superboy s death  Levitz s run ended with the return of Giffen and a four part story  concluding in  63  August 1989    edit   Five Years Later  The Legion  five years later   Giffen took over plotting as well as penciling with the Legion of Super Heroes volume 4 title which started in November 1989  with scripts by Tom and Mary Bierbaum and assists by Al Gordon  12  13  Five years after the Magic Wars  the United Planets is a darker place and the Legion a distant memory  However  a group of former Legionnaires worked to re form the Legion in this harsh new universe  in which Earth was ruled by the alien Dominators  Shortly after this storyline began  the decision was made to retroactively remove Superboy completely from Legion history  leaving the question of where the Legion s inspiration came from without the influence of Superboy  The writers  solution was a massive retcon  in which Mon El served in the role of paragon  with several more retcons to follow  Issue 5 featured an alternate universe story in which the restructuring took place  and the Time Trapper was replaced in continuity by his onetime underling Glorith  Giffen skipped plotting on several issues which resulted in the Bierbaums writing several fill in stories  One major storyline during this period was the discovery of Batch SW6  a group of time paradox duplicates of the early Legion  circa their Adventure Comics days  Keith Giffen s original intention for the storyline was that the clones would have eventually been revealed to be the real Legion  and the ones whose adventures had been chronicled since the 1950s were actually the clones  The adult Legion s secret programming would kick in  forcing them to fight the younger Legion and leading to a fight to the death with the victims names being picked at random out of a hat  Afterwards  the older team would explore the Vega System as a 30th century version of the Omega Men while the younger team would act as the main Legion on Earth  Giffen s other ending was for several of the younger and older Legionnaires to die while liberating Earth from the Dominion  The older Legion would defend Earth while the younger Legion would act as the last line of denfense for the United Planets as the Omega Men  14  Instead  a parallel title  Legionnaires  was launched  starring the  SW6  Legion  whose origins were not resolved until the Zero Hour crossover by a different writing team  Legionnaires was lighter in tone than the main Legion book  and was written by the Bierbaums and drawn by Chris Sprouse  Giffen left the book after a storyline which involved the destruction of Earth  15  and the Bierbaums continued writing  overseeing the return of several classic characters  When the Bierbaums left  writer Tom McCraw took over and made a number of changes  such as forcing several Legion members underground  which required them to take on new identities and costumes  and bringing back long absent Legionnaire Wildfire  In 1994  DC editors decided that after 36 years  the team s continuity would be entirely rebooted  As part of the Zero Hour company wide crossover  the Legion s original continuity came to an end with Legion of Super Heroes  vol  4   61  September 1994    edit

Lightning Lad was renamed Live Wire  and after the group s founding  a large number of heroes were added to the roster very quickly  Several members were given new code names  and some new heroes were added  including XS  the granddaughter of Barry Allen  the Flash   Kinetix  and Gates  While in some ways following the pattern of the original continuity  the new continuity diverged from the old one in several ways  some characters died as they had previously  others did not  and some Legion members spent time in the 20th century where they recruited Ferro  The Legion also started out having to earn the respect of the United Planets  which they did through two well earned victories  successfully defending Earth from the White Triangle Daxamites  a group of Nazi style racial purists  and exposing United Planets President Chu as the mastermind behind the Braal Titan War  the Sun Eater hoax  the formation of the Fatal Five and the brainwashing of future Legionnaire Jan Arrah  16  New writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning  nicknamed  DnA  by fans  came on board with penciller Olivier Coipel to produce a dark story leading to the near collapse of the United Planets and of the Legion itself  In the wake of the disaster  a group of Legionnaires disappeared through a spatial rift and the two existing Legion series came to an end  The limited series Legion Lost  2000 2001  chronicled the difficult journey of these Legionnaires to return home  while the ensuing limited series Legion Worlds  2001  showed what was happening back in the United Planets during their absence  A new series  The Legion  was launched in which the Legion was reunited and given a new base and purpose  Written for its first 33 issues by DnA  the series was cancelled with issue 38  The most notable addition to the team during the title s publication was the post  Crisis  Superboy  a 21st century clone of Superman and Lex Luthor who had previously been granted honorary membership   edit
