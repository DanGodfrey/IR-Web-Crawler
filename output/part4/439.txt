Publication history The Hood first appeared in his own self titled MAX limited series in 2002  which featured his origin  as a character who possesses a cloak and boots stolen from a Nisanti demon  which grant him invisibility and limited levitation ability  respectively  The Hood next appeared in the 2006 miniseries Beyond   a miniseries set in outer space  which had the character shift towards a slightly more anti heroic position  as opposed to a villainous one  Brian Michael Bendis stated in a 2007 Newsarama interview that within the pages of New Avengers  Parker Robbins would be getting similar treatment to Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II  Bendis says that     like the Sentry and Echo   the Hood is one of these excellent brand new creations that no one else was touching  and that s how they fall by the wayside   1  Confirming the statement and having Parker return to his villainous roots  a 2007 New Avengers storyline had Parker rise to becoming  the  Godfather  of all supervillains   mostly due to the fact that Marvel s Civil War event prevented any heroes from stopping him  Although the New Avengers defeated the Hood s new gang of supercriminals  he broke them out  only to be defeated once more  Following 2008 s Secret Invasion  The Hood has a more prominent role  as part of the Cabal  2  and features in his own tie in limited series  Dark Reign  The Hood  written by Jeff Parker  3  4  Since Bendis gained control of the character  he has not appeared with his boots  and the Nisanti demon  a tie in to Vaughn s Runaways series  was revealed to be a disguise for the Doctor Strange nemesis  Dormammu   edit  Fictional character biography  edit  Origin Robbins  father works closely with the Kingpin and is around while Parker is growing up  As a child  he witnesses a battle between Daredevil and Electro  which has a profound effect on Robbins  young adulthood  Parker s father dies  and his mother eventually enters a near vegetative state and is hospitalized  Parker visits his mother  telling her stories of jobs he s acquired and how he s making himself into a better person  while actually carrying out the life of a criminal  Parker s well meaning nature is juxtaposed with his philandering and thieving ways  such as taking care of his pregnant girlfriend Sara  while visiting a prostitute on the side  Parker s cousin and best friend  John King  is a recovering alcoholic and thief who approaches Robbins over a job in a warehouse said to be housing valuable goods  Robbins takes the job  Inside the abandoned warehouse  the two encounter an abandoned mystic ritual which results in an encounter with a creature  the Nisanti  Robbins shoots and apparently kills the demon  and steals its hood and boots rather than leave empty handed  Disposing of the gun in a dumpster  Robbins encounters a gang who wants the boots he had stolen off a HYDRA agent before going to the warehouse  Throwing the boots at the gang  he flees and puts on the demon s boots  learning of their levitation powers  Escaping  he shares his discovery with King and tries on the cloak  which grants him the ability to become invisible while holding his breath  He uses his new powers to commit petty robberies  and then John asks him for help in stealing a shipment of blood diamonds  The diamonds are the responsibility of Dennis Golembuski  the Golem  who hires Constrictor  Jack O Lantern  Shocker  and Madame Rapier to ensure the delivery  However  Robbins confronts the group and steals half the shipment  Meeting up with King  the two are confronted by two police officers  Robbins shoots one officer and King knocks the other out with a blow to the back of the head  The officer shot by Robbins ends up in a coma  and later dies  King stays behind to take the blame while Robbins flees  As a result of this incident  Robbins is dubbed  the Hood  by the authorities and a bounty is placed upon his head for his arrest  Pursued by the Golem  the cops  and two FBI agents  the Hood hatches a plan to get King out of prison  He tries to pawn the diamonds for King s lawyer fee  but runs into the Shocker  After defeating him  he finds out about Golem and Rapier  and says he will give the diamonds back in exchange for a returner s fee  Golem agrees and sends Rapier with the Hood under instructions to kill Parker after the deal is made  Knowing it is a setup  the Hood purchases a similar cloak  and goes to the rendezvous point  Robbins sets up events so Rapier confronts the FBI  wearing the fake cloak  and she is killed  He tells the living enforcers to tell Golem to leave him alone after he returns the diamonds  King tells the FBI that the Hood was a female and is released  Robbins then visits his mother and tells her that he will begin helping people and making her proud  Meanwhile  the Golem weeps over a photograph of his family  including his mutant daughter  knowing the price of failure and vowing that he isn t done with the Hood  The wife of the cop shot by King  who has died in a coma  vows to avenge him as White Fang  as she doesn t believe the Hood is dead  The Nisanti is also shown to have revived with Parker s name on its lips  thanks to King shouting out his name during the robbery attempt   edit  Beyond  Alongside Spider Man  Venom  Gravity  Medusa  Hank Pym  the Wasp  Kraven the Hunter  and Firebird  the Hood finds himself transported to the reconstructed Battleworld  While in transit  they are told that one victor will have a wish granted by the Beyonder  should the other combatants die  The Hood attempts to capitalize on this by using his invisibility to launch a sneak attack on the gathered heroes and villains  but is battered by Kraven  using his enhanced sense of smell  During the confusion of the Hood s attack  Venom manages to impale Spider Man through the chest  Crashlanding on Battleworld and losing Spider Man s body  the group encounters Deathlok  who assists them in battle against Dragon Man  After the battle  the Hood follows Kraven as the latter encounters Spider Man  who has a gaping chest wound but is still alive  After Kraven leaves  the Hood then reveals himself and shoots Spider Man in the knees  The Hood takes Spider Man to the camp and forces him to reveal himself as the original Space Phantom  After battling the Space Phantom  the Hood accompanies the group into Limbo to wait for the Space Phantom to appear when he chooses his next target for impersonation  In Limbo  Venom destroys the portal on Battleworld  claiming victory  and the Hood and Gravity bond  Using the Space Phantom to return to Battleworld  the group confronts Venom and realizes that Uatu the Watcher is there  Pym shoots the group  seemingly killing them all  in order to draw out the Beyonder  In truth  this is the Stranger  who is fooled by Pym shrinking the entire group down  The Hood then attacks the Stranger alongside the other combatants  before the Stranger leaves  With Battleworld crumbling since the Stranger s will is no longer holding it together  the Hood and the others escape  but not before Gravity sacrifices his life to save the group  While on Earth  he attends Gravity s funeral with Sara  Some time after this  Sara gives birth to his child  Gravity is returned to life a short time later   edit  Hood s Criminal Empire The Hood s crime syndicate  Art by Carlo Pagulayan  The Hood begins his quest to become the Kingpin of all supervillains in New York by inviting a large contingent of villains to a meeting where he gives each of them  25 000 of seed money  partly to gain their confidence  and partly to buy their loyalty  He promises them much more where that came from if they join him in creating a new criminal empire with Robbins at the head and John King as his lieutenant  Parker uses the cloak  but his boots are not used in the arc  The Hood s gang includes Jigsaw  who had been attacked and beaten by Tigra in an earlier robbery  To prove himself to the gathered supervillains  the Hood seeks out and viciously beats Tigra  threatening her mother s life as a warning  while Jigsaw films the attack  At the after party  Chemistro informs the Hood of a plot by the Owl to sell Deathlok  which he stole from S H I E L D   to the highest bidder  As the Owl hasn t gained permission from his new crime syndicate  The Hood decides to gatecrash the auction  He effortlessly ambushes and dispatches the Owl by sending Madame Masque  the Crimson Cowl  the Wizard  and Dr  Jonas Harrow as proxies  John King and the Hood reconvene in the back room of a rundown bar  where they are confronted by a curious Wolverine  who overhears their plans to run Deathlok through the lobby of Avengers Tower  Covering King s retreat  the Hood manages to shoot Wolverine in the crotch before assuming the form of the Nisanti demon who originally owned his gear  enabling him to overpower the mutant and escape  Chemistro  suggests that they change their plan and instead use Deathlok to rob a federal reserve bank in New Jersey  seeing it as a more profitable venture than a suicidal attack on Avengers Tower  The robbery is successful  netting them over  12 7 million  US   although Deathlok is destroyed in the process  As the group celebrates their victory  Luke Cage smashes through the wall of their base closely followed by nearly the entire population of the New York superhero community including the New Avengers  the Mighty Avengers  the Fantastic Four  including Storm and the Black Panther   Howard the Duck  Punisher  the Defenders  the Silver Surfer  and Thor  These superheroes turn out to be illusions  however  as only the New Avengers are actually present  In the ensuing battle  Doctor Strange appears to banish

Turk double crosses Mister Fear to show his allegiance to the Hood s new crime empire  6  The Hood is then mentioned by name when the Enforcers  who are working for Mister Fear  are ambushed by Wrecker and Razor Fist who are working for the Hood  7  Later  after some of Robbins  syndicates are captured by S H I E L D   Robbins reappears and frees them  He leads Wrecker and others on a rampage through the Raft  swearing to take revenge on the New Avengers  After interrogating Tigra to learn their location  the Hood leads his syndicate against the New Avengers  using the magical powers of his hood and cloak to see through the illusions defending the Sanctum Sanctorum  In the ensuing battle  the Hood fatally injures Doctor Strange before being pushed aside by Wong  and nearly blows Iron Fist s head off before being intercepted by a vengeful Tigra  The Hood  alongside both the New Avengers and his syndicate  is taken down by Doctor Strange s paralyzing spell  but manages to escape from the arriving S H I E L D  agents  In the aftermath  Robbins is seen talking to an unseen figure  exclaiming   Now I know how to beat  em   8   edit  Secret Invasion During several

mystical entity Dormammu  9  The Hood is seen watching live coverage of the Skrull Invasion on television in Brooklyn with Wizard  Madame Masque  the Blood Brothers  John King  and Bulldozer  He

acknowledge this  Dormammu  though knowing of its lethal nature consuming entire universes and the near certainty that it would be  bad for business   insists that Parker use it to ravage the planet for him to ascend there  apparently not concerned about the infection for himself  possibly due to his form being composed of pure Faltinian energy and his considerable magical prowess   Despite his advisor s complaints that the virus is far too dangerous  the Hood and his underlings  the Night Shift  meet with Black Talon on the Caribbean island Taino to obtain the zombie Deadpool s head  only to see the situation quickly spiral out of control as the zombie virus becomes airborne and infects the entire island  Seemingly abandoned by Dormammu and now fearful of the zombies  the Hood is

to his whims  The Blue Gem of Mind endowed him with vast psychic and telepathic powers  sufficient to beat Professor Xavier in mental combat  The Purple Gem of Space allowed him to exist at will at any place  or all places  and to teleport people or objects to locations across the universe  as seen when he teleports to an ocean side beach  The Red Gem of Power formerly gave him access to every form of energy and power  which can be channeled through his body to provide sufficient superhuman physicality to easily subdue Red Hulk with his fists  He also used the gems he has to sense the location of other Infinity Gems  While observing the Hood s actions  Uatu noted that the Hood s ability to use the Gems  while impressive  was still limited because he simply thought about using the Gems to enhance his own power rather than really thinking about what he could do with them  to the point of engaging his enemies in direct combat when he could simply will them out of existence   edit  Previous Dormammu related powers The mystical boots and cloak Parker wears give him superhuman abilities  When wearing the boots  the Hood can walk on air  While wearing the cloak and holding his breath  he becomes invisible  Robbins also finds that he can use the cloak to see past the illusion protecting Dr  Strange s headquarters  During the Skrull Invasion  it is revealed that Parker can detect Skrulls using an enhanced disguise that fools even the likes of Doctor Strange and Professor X  Robbins also has the ability to transform demonically when under duress  gaining physical strength and speed to match Wolverine in one on one combat  In this demon form  his voice changes and he can sprout spikes from his hands  At least once  this allows Robbins to fire electrical energy from his hands  According to Doctor Strange  Robbins  powers will eventually kill him as the Nisanti consumes his mind  body  and soul  It was revealed that the Hood s mystical powers come from Dormammu  which even enables him to resurrect the dead  A recent exorcism appears to have removed the Hood from Robbins along with its mystical abilities   edit  Previous use of the Norn Stones With Loki s help  the Hood acquires the Stones of Norn  64  According to Loki  they have the power to make him anything he wants to be  Parker has used them to power up his weapons and gain powers to replicate those given by his possession by Dormammu  They have also been shown to power up anyone he desires  65  The removal of these powers appears to cause harm to those who have been empowered  66  The Norn Stones also show the ability  similar to Thor s Hammer  to be unliftable by anyone other than the chosen bearer  67  The Hood loses the powers of the Norn Stones when Loki retakes possession of them to empower the heroes in their attack on the Sentry  68   edit  Members of The Hood s Crime Syndicate The Hood himself has answered to either the mystical entity Dormammu or the Asgardian Loki

Notably  some of the members of this syndicate later become members of MODOK s 11  including Mentallo and Living Laser  who are both thought to be killed in action while on that team  Within that series  a small amount of the Hood s influence is displayed in the Purple Man using the money he has been given  along with his powers  to take over a large casino  where he attempts to subdue Mentallo  possibly on the Hood s behalf  Since the end of the series  Living Laser has developed himself into a more complex being of energy  though he later joins the Initiative  which is now mostly just an extension of Hood s Gang posing as heroes   Armadillo departs from supervillainy to aid Deadly Nightshade in clearing the name of their friend  the Puma   edit  Other versions  edit  House of
