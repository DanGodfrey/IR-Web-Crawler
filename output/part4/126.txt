info   is a North Germanic language  spoken by approximately 10 million people  2  predominantly in Sweden and parts of Finland  especially along its coast and on the  land islands  It is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Danish  see Classification   Along with the other North Germanic languages  Swedish is a descendant of Old Norse  the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Era  It is currently the largest of the North Germanic languages by numbers of speakers  Standard Swedish  used by most Swedish people  is the national language that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established by the beginning of the 20th century  While distinct regional varieties descended from the older rural dialects still exist  the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized  Some dialects differ considerably from the standard language in grammar and vocabulary and are not always mutually intelligible with Standard Swedish  These dialects are confined to rural areas and are spoken primarily by small numbers of people with low social mobility  Though not facing imminent extinction  such dialects have been in decline during the past century  despite the fact that they are well researched and their use is often encouraged by local authorities  The standard word order is subject verb object  though this can often be changed to stress certain words or phrases  Swedish morphology is similar to English  that is  words have comparatively few inflections  There are two genders  two grammatical cases  and a distinction between plural and singular  Older analyses posit the cases nominative and genitive and there are some remains of distinct accusative and dative forms as well  Adjectives are compared as in English  and are also inflected according to gender  number and definiteness  The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes  endings   complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles  The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities  The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory  Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso palatal velar fricative  a highly variable consonant phoneme  Contents 1 Classification 2 History 2 1 Old Norse 2 2 Old Swedish 2 3 Modern Swedish 2 4 Contemporary Swedish 2 5

classification  it belongs to the East Scandinavian languages together with Danish  separating it from the West Scandinavian languages  consisting of Faroese  Icelandic and Norwegian  However  more recent analyses divide the North Germanic languages into two groups  Insular Scandinavian  Faroese and Icelandic  and Continental Scandinavian  Danish  Norwegian and Swedish  based on mutual intelligibility due to heavy influence of East Scandinavian  particularly Danish  on Norwegian during the last millennium and divergence from both Faroese and Icelandic  3  By many general criteria of mutual intelligibility  the Continental Scandinavian languages could very well be considered dialects of a common Scandinavian language  However  because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden  including a long series of wars in the 16th and 17th centuries  and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries  the languages have separate orthographies  dictionaries  grammars  and regulatory bodies  Danish  Norwegian  and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian  North Germanic   and some of the dialects  such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden  especially parts of Bohusl n  Dalsland  western V rmland  western Dalarna  H rjedalen  J mtland and Scania  could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages  3   edit  History Main article  History of Swedish In the 9th century  Old Norse began to diverge into Old West Norse  Norway and Iceland  and Old East Norse  Sweden and Denmark   In the 12th century  the dialects of Denmark and Sweden began to diverge  becoming Old Danish and Old Swedish in the 13th century  All were heavily influenced by Middle Low German during the Middle Ages  Though stages of language development are never as sharply delimited as implied here  and should not be taken too literally  the system of subdivisions used in this article is the most commonly used by Swedish linguists and is used for the sake of practicality  citation needed   edit  Old Norse Main article  Old Norse The approximate extent of Old Norse and related languages in the early 10th century     Old West Norse dialect    Old East Norse dialect    Old Gutnish dialect    Crimean Gothic    Old English    Other Germanic languages with which Old Norse still retained some mutual intelligibility In the 8th century  the common Germanic language of Scandinavia  Proto Norse  had undergone some changes and evolved into Old Norse  This language began to undergo new changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia  which resulted in the appearance of two similar dialects  Old West Norse  Norway and Iceland  and Old East Norse  Denmark and Sweden   The subdialect of Old East Norse spoken in Sweden is called Runic Swedish and the one in Denmark Runic Danish  there was also a subdialect spoken in Gotland  Old Gutnish  but until the 12th century  the dialect was the same in the two countries with the main exception of a Runic Danish monophthongization  see below   The dialects are called runic because the main body of text appears in the runic alphabet  Unlike Proto Norse  which was written with the Elder Futhark alphabet  Old Norse was written with the Younger Futhark alphabet  which only had 16 letters  Because the number of runes was limited  some runes were used for a range of phonemes  such as the rune for the vowel u which was also used for the vowels o    and y  and the rune for i which was also used for e  From 1100 onwards  the dialect of Denmark began to diverge from that of Sweden  The innovations spread unevenly from Denmark which created a series of minor dialectal boundaries  isoglosses  ranging from Zealand in the south to Norrland   sterbotten and northwestern Finland in the north  An early change that separated Runic Danish from the other dialects of Old East Norse was the change of the diphthong  i to the monophthong    as in st inn to st nn  stone   This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read stain and the later stin  There was also a change of au as in dau r into a long open   as in d  r  dead   This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from tau r into tu r  Moreover  the  y diphthong changed into a long close    as in the Old Norse word for  island   These innovations had affected most of the Runic Swedish speaking area as well in the end of the period  with the exception of the dialects spoken north and east of M lardalen where the diphthongs still exist in remote areas  4   edit  Old Swedish A copy of  ldre V stg talagen a law code of V sterg tland from the 1280s  one of the earliest texts in Swedish written in the Latin script  Main article  Old Swedish Old Swedish is the term used for the medieval Swedish language  starting in 1225  Among the most important documents of the period written in Latin script is the oldest of the provincial law codes  the V stg ta code or V stg talagen  of which fragments dated to 1250 have been found  The main influences during this time came with the firm establishment of the Christian church and various monastic orders  introducing many Greek and Latin loanwords  With the rise of Hanseatic power in the late 13th and early 14th century  the influence of Middle Low German became ever more present  The Hanseatic league provided Swedish commerce and administration with a large number of German  and Dutch speaking immigrants  Many became quite influential members of Swedish medieval society  and brought terms from their mother tongue into the vocabulary  Besides a great number of loanwords for such areas as warfare  trade and administration  general grammatical suffixes and even conjunctions were imported  Almost all of the naval terms were also borrowed from Dutch  Early medieval Swedish was markedly different from the modern language in that it had a more complex case structure and had not yet experienced a reduction of the gender system  Nouns  adjectives  pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases  besides the modern nominative  there were also the genitive  dative and accusative  The gender system resembled that of modern German  having the genders masculine  feminine and neuter  Most of the masculine and feminine nouns were later grouped together into a common gender  The verb system was also more complex  it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number  By the 16th century  the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish  The old inflections remained common in high prose style until the 18th century  and in some dialects into the early 20th century  A transitional change of the Latin script in the Nordic countries was to spell the letter combination  ae  as     and sometimes as a    though it varied between persons and regions  The combination  ao  was similarly rendered ao  and  oe  became oe  These three were later to evolve into the separate letters      and    5   edit  Modern Swedish Main article  Modern Swedish Front page of Gustav Vasa s Bible from 1541  using Fraktur  The title translated to English reads   The Bible   That is   The Holy Scripture   in Swedish  Printed in Uppsala  1541   Modern Swedish  Swedish  nysvenska  begins with the advent of the printing press and the European Reformation  After assuming power  the new monarch Gustav Vasa ordered a Swedish translation of the Bible  The New Testament was published in 1526  followed by a full Bible translation in 1541  usually referred to as the Gustav Vasa Bible  a translation deemed so successful and influential that  with revisions incorporated in successive editions  it remained the most common Bible translation until 1917  The main translators were Laurentius Andre  and the brothers Laurentius and Olaus Petri  The Vasa Bible is often considered to be a reasonable compromise between old and new  while not adhering to the colloquial spoken language of its day it was not overly conservative in its use of archaic forms  6  It was a major step towards a more consistent Swedish orthography  It established the use of the vowels           and      and the spelling  ck  in place of  kk   distinguishing it clearly from the Danish Bible  perhaps intentionally  given the ongoing rivalry between the countries  All three translators came from central Sweden which is generally seen as adding specific Central Swedish features to the new Bible  Though it might seem as if the Bible translation set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards  spelling actually became more inconsistent during the remainder of the century  It was not until the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed  around the time when the first grammars were written  The spelling debate raged on until the early 19th century  and it was not until the latter half of the 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards  Capitalization during this time was not standardized  It depended on the authors and their background  Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns  while others capitalized more sparsely  It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to the Gothic or blackletter typeface which was used to print the Bible  This typeface was in use until the mid 18th century  when it was gradually replaced with a Latin typeface  often antiqua   Some important changes in sound during the Modern Swedish period were the gradual assimilation of several different consonant clusters into the fricative     and later into      There was also the gradual softening of     and  k  into  j  and the fricative     before front vowels  The velar fricative     was also transformed into the corresponding plosive      7  August Strindberg  one of the most influential writers in modern Swedish literature   edit  Contemporary Swedish The period that includes Swedish as it is spoken today is termed nusvenska  lit   Now Swedish   in linguistic terminology and started in the last decades of the 19th century  The period saw a democratization of the language with a less formal written language that came closer to spoken language  The growth of a public schooling system also led to the evolution of so called boksvenska  literally  book Swedish    especially among the working classes  where spelling to some extent influenced pronunciation  particularly in official contexts  With the industrialization and urbanization of Sweden well under way by the last decades of the 19th century  a new breed of authors made their mark on Swedish literature  Many scholars  politicians and other public figures had a great influence on the new national language that was emerging  and among them were prolific authors like the poet Gustaf Fr ding  Nobel laureate Selma Lagerl f  and radical writer and playwright August Strindberg  8  It was during the 20th century that a common  standardized national language became available to all Swedes  The orthography was finally stabilized  and was almost completely uniform  with the exception of some minor deviations  by the time of the spelling reform of 1906  With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax  particularly in the written language  the language was the same as the Swedish spoken today  The plural verb forms remained  in ever decreasing use  in formal  and particularly written  language until the 1950s  when they were finally officially abolished even from all official recommendations  A very significant change in Swedish occurred in the late 1960s  with the so called du reformen   the you reform   Previously  the proper way to address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname  The use of herr   Mr  or  Sir    fru   Mrs  or  Ma am   or fr ken   Miss   was considered the only acceptable mode of initiating conversation with strangers of unknown occupation  academic title or military rank  The fact that the listener should preferably be referred to in the third person tended to further complicate spoken communication between members of society  In the early 20th century  an unsuccessful attempt was made to replace the insistence on titles with ni  the standard second person plural pronoun   analogous to the French Vous   Cf  T V distinction   Ni  plural second person pronoun  wound up being used as a slightly less familiar form of du  singular second person pronoun  used to address people of lower social status  With the liberalization and radicalization of Swedish society in the 1950s and 1960s  these previously significant distinctions of class became less important and du became the standard  even in formal and official contexts  Though the reform was not an act of any centralized political decrees  but rather a sweeping change in social attitudes  it was completed in just a few years from the late 1960s to early 1970s  9   edit  Former language minorities Map of the Estonian islands which formerly housed  Coastal Swede  populations From the 13th to 20th century  there were Swedish speaking communities in Estonia  particularly on the islands  e g   Hiiumaa  Vormsi  Ruhnu  in Swedish  known as Dag   Orms   Run   respectively  along the coast of the Baltic  communities which today have all but disappeared  The Swedish speaking minority was represented in parliament  and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates  After the loss of Estonia to the Russian Empire in the early 18th century  around 1 000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern Ukraine  where they founded a village  Gammalsvenskby   Old Swedish Village    A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar  although the dialect is most likely facing extinction  10  From 1918 1940  when Estonia was independent  the small Swedish community was well treated  Municipalities with a Swedish majority  mainly found along the coast  used Swedish as the administrative language and Swedish Estonian culture saw an upswing  However  most Swedish speaking people fled to Sweden before the end of World War II  that is  before the invasion of Estonia by the Soviet army in 1944  Only a handful of older speakers remain today  11   edit  Geographic distribution Swedish is the national language of Sweden and the first language for the overwhelming majority of roughly eight million Swedish born inhabitants and acquired by one million immigrants  As of 2007 around 5 5  of the population of Finland was Swedish speaking  12  though the percentage has declined steadily over the last 400 years  13  The Finland Swedish minority is concentrated in the coastal areas and archipelagos of southern and western Finland  In some of these areas  Swedish is the predominant language  Swedish is Finland s second official language  The language has the same status in Finland as the Finnish language  In 19 municipalities  16 of which are located in  land  Swedish is the only official language  14  In several more  it is the majority language and it is an official minority language in even more  There is considerable migration between the Nordic countries  but owing to the similarity between the cultures and languages  with the exception of Finnish   expatriates generally assimilate quickly and do not stand out as a group  According to the 2000 United States Census  some 67 000 people over the age of five were reported as Swedish speakers  though without any information on the degree of language proficiency  15  Similarly  there are 16 915 reported Swedish speakers in Canada from the 2001 census  16  Although there are no certain numbers  some 40 000 Swedes are estimated to live in the London area in the United Kingdom  17  Outside Sweden and Finland  there are about 40 000 active learners enrolled in Swedish language courses  18   edit  Official status A Finnish Swedish street sign in Finland Swedish is officially the main language of Sweden  19  20  It has long been used in local and state government and most of the educational system  but remained only a de facto primary language  with no official status in law  A bill was proposed in 2005 that would have made Swedish an official language  but failed to pass by the narrowest possible margin  145 147  due to a pairing off failure  21  A proposal for a broader language law  designating Swedish as the main language of the country and bolstering the status of the minority languages  was submitted by an expert committee to the Swedish Ministry of Culture in March 2008  It was subsequently enacted by the Riksdag and entered into effect on 1 July 2009  22  Swedish is the only official language of  land  an autonomous province under the sovereignty of Finland  where the vast majority of the 26 000 inhabitants speak Swedish as a first language  In Finland  Swedish is the second national language alongside Finnish on the state level  and an official language in many coastal municipalities  Three municipalities  Korsn s  N rpes  Larsmo  in mainland Finland have Swedish as their sole official language  Swedish is also one of the official languages of the European Union and one of the working languages of the Nordic Council  Under the Nordic Language Convention  citizens of the Nordic countries speaking Swedish have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs  23  24   edit  Regulatory bodies The Swedish Language Council  Spr kr det  is the official regulator of Swedish in Sweden  but does not attempt to enforce control of the language  as for instance the Acad mie fran aise does for French dubious   discuss   However  many organizations and agencies require the use of the council s publication Svenska skrivregler in official contexts  with it otherwise being regarded as a de facto orthographic standard  Among the many organizations that make up the Swedish Language Council  the Swedish Academy  established 1786  is arguably the most influential  Its primary instruments are the dictionaries Svenska Akademiens ordlista  SAOL  currently in its 13th edition  and Svenska Akademiens ordbok  in addition to various books on grammar  spelling and manuals of style  Even though the dictionaries are sometimes used as official decrees of the language  their main purpose is to describe current usage  In Finland a special branch of the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland has official status as the regulatory body for Swedish in Finland  Among its highest priorities is to maintain intelligibility with the language spoken in Sweden  It has published Finlandssvensk ordbok  a dictionary about the differences between Swedish in Finland and in Sweden   edit  Dialects Main article  Swedish dialects According to a traditional division of Swedish dialects  there are six main groups of dialects  North Swedish Finland Swedish Svealand Swedish Gotland Swedish G taland Swedish South Swedish The traditional definition of a Swedish dialect has been a local variant that has not been heavily influenced by the standard language and that can trace a separate development all the way back to Old Norse  Many of the genuine rural dialects  such as those of Orsa in Dalarna or N rpes in  sterbotten  have very distinct phonetic and grammatical features  such as plural forms of verbs or archaic case inflections  These dialects can be near incomprehensible to a majority of Swedes  and most of their speakers are also fluent in Standard Swedish  The different dialects are often so localized that they are limited to individual parishes and are referred to by Swedish linguists as sockenm l  lit   parish speech    They are generally separated into six major groups  with common characteristics of prosody  grammar and vocabulary  One or several examples from each group are given here  Though each example is intended to be also representative of the nearby dialects  the actual number of dialects is several hundred if each individual community is considered separately  25  This type of classification  however  is based on a somewhat romanticized nationalist view of ethnicity and language  The idea that only rural variants of Swedish should be considered  genuine  is not generally accepted by modern scholars  No dialects  no matter how remote or obscure  remained unchanged or undisturbed by a minimum of influences from surrounding dialects or the standard language  especially not from the late 19th century onwards with the advent of mass media and advanced forms of transport  The differences are today more accurately described by a scale that runs from  standard language  to  rural dialect  where the speech even of the same person may vary from one extreme to the other depending on the situation  All Swedish dialects with the exception of the highly diverging forms of speech in Dalarna  Norrbotten and  to some extent  Gotland can be considered to be part of a common  mutually intelligible dialect continuum  This continuum may also include Norwegian and some Danish dialects  26  The samples linked below have been taken from SweDia  a research project on Swedish modern dialects available for download  though with information in Swedish only   with

all Swedes and most Swedish speaking Finns  The Swedish term most often used for the standard language is rikssvenska   National Swedish   and to a much lesser extent h gsvenska   High Swedish    the latter term is limited to Swedish spoken in Finland and is seldom used in Sweden  There are many regional varieties of the standard language that are specific to geographical areas of varying size  regions  historical provinces  cities  towns  etc    While these varieties are often influenced by the genuine dialects  their grammatical and phonological structure adheres closely to those of the Central Swedish dialects  In mass media it is no longer uncommon for journalists to speak with a distinct regional accent  but the most common pronunciation and the one perceived as the most formal is still Central Standard Swedish  Though this terminology and its definitions have long been established among linguists  most Swedes are unaware of the distinction and its historical background  and often refer to the regional varieties as  dialects   In a poll that was conducted in 2005 by the Swedish Retail Institute  Handelns Utredningsinstitut   the attitudes of Swedes to the use of certain dialects by salesmen revealed that 54  believed that rikssvenska was the variety they would prefer to hear when speaking with salesmen over the phone  even though several dialects such as gotl ndska or sk nska were provided as alternatives in the poll  28   edit  Finland Swedish Main articles  Finland Swedish and  land Swedish Finland was a part of Sweden from the 13th century until the loss of the Finnish territories to Russia in 1809  Swedish was the sole administrative language until 1902 as well as the dominant language of culture and education until Finnish independence in 1917  The percentage of Swedish speakers in Finland has steadily decreased since then  The Swedish speaking population is mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of Ostrobothnia  Finland Proper  Nyland and  land where the percentage of Finland Swedes partly is fairly high  Swedish is still an official language in Finland  sharing the same rights as Finnish  The country s public broadcaster  YLE  provides two Swedish language radio stations  Radio Vega and YLE X3M  as well a TV channel  FST5   edit  Immigrant variants Rinkeby Swedish  after Rinkeby  a suburb of northern Stockholm with a large population of immigrants  is a common name among linguists for varieties of Swedish spoken by young people of foreign heritage in the suburbs of Stockholm  Gothenburg and Malm   These varieties could alternatively be classified as sociolects  because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers  However  some studies have found distinctive features and led to terms such as Roseng rd Swedish  after Roseng rd in Malm    an immigrant version of the Scanian dialect  29  A survey made by the Swedish linguist Ulla Britt Kotsinas showed that foreign learners had difficulties in guessing the origins of Rinkeby Swedish speakers in Stockholm  The greatest difficulty proved to be identifying the speech of a boy speaking Rinkeby Swedish whose parents were both Swedish  only 1 8  guessed his native language correctly  30   edit  Sounds Main article  Swedish phonology This article contains IPA phonetic symbols  Without

 short  e  and     coincide   There are 18 consonant phonemes out of which the voiceless palatal velar fricative       and  r  show considerable variation depending on social and dialectal context  A

Swedish is mainly Germanic  either through common Germanic heritage or through loans from German  Middle Low German  and to some extent  English  Examples of Germanic words in Swedish are mus   mouse    kung   king    and g s   goose    A significant part of the religious and scientific vocabulary is of Latin or Greek origin  often borrowed from French and  lately  English  Some words are also borrowed from Scandoromani  Romani  M nsing and Knoparmoj  a commonly used word from Romani is tjej   girl    31 Finnish and Sami language have also influenced Swedish  a word for  boy  pojke is for instance from Finnish  A word for sleigh or pulk is pulka from the Sami language  A large number of French words were imported into Sweden around the 18th century  These words have been transcribed to the Swedish spelling system and are therefore pronounced quite recognizably to a French speaker  Most of them are distinguished by a  French accent   characterized by emphasis on the last syllable  For example  niv   fr  niveau   level    f t lj  fr  fauteuil   arm chair   and aff r   shop  affair    etc  Cross borrowing from other Germanic languages has also been common  at first from Middle Low German  the lingua franca of the Hanseatic league and later from standard German  Some compounds are translations of the elements  calques  of German original compounds into Swedish  like bomull from German Baumwolle   cotton   literally tree wool   32  As with many Germanic languages  new words can be formed by compounding  e g  nouns like nagellackborttagningsmedel   nail polish remover   or verbs like smygfilma   to film in secret    Similar to German or Dutch  very long  and quite impractical  examples like produktionsstyrningssystemsprogramvaruuppdatering   production controller system software update   are possible  but it is seldom this ungainly  at least in spoken Swedish and outside of technical writing  Compound nouns take their gender from the head  which in Swedish is always the last morpheme  New words can also be coined by derivation from other established words  such as the verbification of nouns by the adding of the suffix  a  as in bil   car   and bila   travel by car     edit  Writing system The Swedish alphabet is a 29 letter alphabet  using the 26 letter ISO basic Latin alphabet plus the three additional letters           and     constructed in the 16th century by writing  o  and  e  on top of an  a   and an  e  on top of an  o   Though these combinations are historically modified versions of A and O according to the English range of usage for the term diacritic  these three characters are not considered to be diacritics within the Swedish application  but rather separate letters  and are as independent letters following z  Before the release of the 13th edition of Svenska Akademiens ordlista in April 2006  w was treated as merely a variant of v used only in names  such as  Wallenberg   and foreign words   bowling    and so was both sorted and pronounced as a v  Other diacritics  to use the broader English term usage referenced here  are unusual in Swedish    is sometimes used to indicate that the stress falls on a terminal syllable containing e  especially when the stress changes the meaning  ide vs  id    winter lair  vs   idea   as well as in some names  like Kastr n  occasionally other acute accents and  less often  grave accents can be seen in names and some foreign words  The letter   is used to refer to unit cost  a loan from the French   equivalent to the at sign     in English  The German   is treated as a variant of y and sometimes retained in foreign names and words  e g  m sli   muesli granola    A proper diaeresis may very exceptionally be seen in elaborated style  for instance   A da    The German convention of writing   and   as ae and oe if the characters are unavailable is an unusual convention for speakers of modern Swedish  Despite the availability of all these characters in the Swedish national top level Internet domain and other such domains  Swedish sites are frequently labelled using a and o  based on visual similarity  mainly to avoid lingering technical problems with the use of characters which are outside of the limited 7 bit ASCII set   In Swedish orthography  the colon is used in a similar manner as in English  with some exceptions  the colon is used for some abbreviations  such as 3 e for tredje   third   and S t for Sankt   Saint    and for all types of suffixes that can be added to numbers  letters and abbreviations  such as a et   the a   and CD n   the CD    33   edit  Grammar Main article  Swedish grammar Swedish nouns and adjectives are declined in genders as well as number  Nouns belong to one of two genders common for the en form or neuter for the ett form 34  which also determine the declension of adjectives  For example  the word fisk   fish   is a noun of common gender  en fisk  and can have the following forms  Singular Plural Indefinite form fisk fiskar Definite form fisken fiskarna The definite singular form of a noun is created by adding a suffix   en   n   et or  t   depending on its gender and if the noun ends in a vowel or not  The definite articles den  det  and de are used for variations to the definitiveness of a noun  They can double as demonstrative pronouns or demonstrative determiners when used with adverbs such as h r   here   or d r   there   to form den det h r  can also be  denna detta     this    de h r  can also be  dessa     these    den det d r   that    and de d r   those    For example  den d r fisken means  that fish  and refers to a specific fish  den fisken is less definite and means  that fish  in a more abstract sense  such as that set of fish  while fisken means  the fish   In certain cases  the definite form indicates possession  e g   jag m ste tv tta h ret   I must wash my hair    Adjectives are inflected in two declensions   indefinite and definite   and they must match the noun they modify in gender and number  The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created by adding a suffix   t or  a  to the common form of the adjective  e g   en gr n stol  a green chair   ett gr nt hus  a green house   and gr na stolar   green chairs   The definite form of an adjective is identical to the indefinite plural form  e g   den gr na stolen   the green chair    det gr na huset   the green house    and de gr na stolarna   the green chairs    Swedish pronouns are similar to those of English  Besides the two natural genders han hon   he she    there are also the two grammatical genders den det  usually termed common and neuter  Unlike the nouns  pronouns have an additional object form  derived from the old dative form  Hon  for example  has the following nominative  possessive  and object forms  hon   hennes   henne Possession is expressed with the enclitic  s  which attaches to the end of a  possibly complex  noun phrase  In formal writing  however  usage guides generally do not recommend the enclitic to attach to anything but the head noun of the phrase  but this is nevertheless common in speech  mannen   the man  mannens hatt   the man s hat  mannen i gr  kostym   the man in a grey suit  mannen i gr  kostyms hatt   the man in a grey suit s hat  mannens i gr  kostym hatt   the man s in a grey suit hat   formal  archaic  Verbs are conjugated according to tense  One group of verbs  the ones ending in  er in present tense  have a special imperative form  generally the verb stem   but with most verbs the imperative is identical to the infinitive form  Perfect and present participles as adjectival verbs are very common  Perfect participle  en stekt fisk   a fried fish   steka   to fry  Present participle  en stinkande fisk   a stinking fish   stinka   to stink  In contrast to English and many other languages  Swedish does not use the perfect participle to form the present perfect and past perfect  Rather  the auxiliary verb har   have    hade   had   is followed by a special form  called supine  used solely for this purpose  although often identical to the neuter form of the perfect participle   Perfect participle  m lad   painted    supine m lat  present perfect har m lat   have painted  Perfect participle  stekt   fried    supine stekt  present perfect har stekt   have fried  Perfect participle  skriven   written    supine skrivit  present perfect har skrivit   have written  When building the compound passive voice using the verb att bli  the past participle is used  den blir m lad   it s being painted  den blev m lad   it was painted  There exists also an inflected passive voice formed by adding  s  replacing the final r in the present tense  den m las   it s being painted  den m lades   it was painted  In a subordinate clause  the auxiliary har is optional and often omitted  particularly in written Swedish  Jag ser att han  har  stekt fisken   I see that he has fried the fish  Subjunctive mood is occasionally used for some verbs  but its use is in sharp decline and few speakers perceive the handful of commonly used verbs  as for instance  vore  m nne  as separate conjugations  most of them remaining only as set of idiomatic expressions  The lack of cases in Swedish is compensated by a wide variety of prepositions  similar to those found in English  As in modern German  prepositions formerly determined case in Swedish  but this feature remains only in idiomatic expressions like till sj ss  genitive  or man ur huse  dative singular   though some of these are still quite common  Swedish being a Germanic language  the syntax shows similarities to both English and German  Like English  Swedish has a subject verb object basic word order  but like German  it utilizes verb second word order in main clauses  for instance after adverbs  adverbial phrases and dependent clauses   Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually placed at the beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence   Prepositional phrases are placed in a place manner time order  as in English  but not German   Adjectives precede the noun they modify  35   edit  Sample Excerpt from Barfotabarn
