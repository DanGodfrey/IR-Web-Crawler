a carpenter electrician father  3  His family was Irish Catholic  4  Living in New York City s Hell s Kitchen influenced Miller s material in the 1980s  Miller lived in Los Angeles  California in the 1990s  which influenced Sin City  5  Miller moved back to Hell s Kitchen by 2001 and was creating Batman  The Dark Knight Strikes Again as the 9 11 terrorist attacks occurred about 4 miles from that neighborhood  6  In November of 2011  Miller posted incendiary remarks pertaining to the Occupy Wall Street movement in his personal blog  Among other things  Miller referred to the Occupy protestors as  pond scum  and  rapists  who were ignorant of  Islamicism  7    edit  Career Setting out to become an artist  Miller received his first published work at Western Publishing s Gold Key Comics imprint  on the licensed TV series comic book The Twilight Zone drawing the story  Royal Feast  in issue  84  June 1978   and  Endless Cloud  in  85  July 1978   8  One time Marvel editor in chief Jim Shooter recalled Miller going to DC Comics after having broken in with  a small job from Western Publishing  I think  Thus emboldened  he went to DC  and after getting savaged by Joe Orlando  got in to see art director Vinnie Colletta  who recognized talent and arranged for him to get a one page war comic job   9  The Grand Comics Database does not list the job  which may or may not have been signed  Miller s first listed work is the six page  Deliver Me From D Day   by writer Wyatt Gwyon  in Weird War Tales  64  June 1978   10  A two page story  however  written by Roger McKenzie and titled  Slowly  painfully  you dig your way from the cold  choking debris      appears in Weird War Tales  68  Oct  1978   11  Other fledgling work at DC included the six page  The Greatest Story Never Told   by writer Paul Kupperberg  in that same issue  and the five page  The Edge of History   written by Elliot S  Maggin  in Unknown Soldier  219  Sept  1978   and his first work for Marvel Comics  penciling the 17 page story  The Master Assassin of Mars  Part 3  in John Carter  Warlord of Mars  18  Nov  1978   12  Miller had a letter he wrote to Marvel as a comics fan published several years earlier in 1973  The Cat disambiguation needed    3   13  At Marvel  Miller would settle in as a regular fill in and cover artist  working on a variety of titles  One of these jobs was drawing Peter Parker  the Spectacular Spider Man  27 28  Feb  March 1979   which guest starred Daredevil  At the time  sales of the Daredevil title were poor  however  Miller saw something in the character he liked and asked editor in chief Jim Shooter if he could work on Daredevil s regular title  Shooter agreed and made Miller the new penciller on the title  As Miller recalled in 2008  When I first showed up in New York  I showed up with a bunch of comics  a bunch of samples  of guys in trench coats and old cars and such  And  comics editors  said   Where are the guys in tights   And I had to learn how to do it  But as soon as a title came along  when  Daredevil signature artist  Gene Colan left Daredevil  I realized it was my secret in to do crime comics with a superhero in them  And so I lobbied for the title and got it   3   edit  Daredevil and the early 1980s This section of a biographical article needs additional citations for verification  Please help by adding reliable sources  Contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately  especially if potentially libelous or harmful   December 2008  Miller at the 1982 Comic Con Daredevil  158  May 1979   Miller s debut on that title  was the finale of an ongoing story written by Roger McKenzie  Although still conforming to traditional comic book styles  Miller infused this first issue with his own film noir style  14  After this issue  Miller became one of Marvel s rising stars  and began plotting additional stories with McKenzie  Miller sketched the roofs of New York in an attempt to give his Daredevil art an authentic feel not commonly seen in superhero comics at the time  As one journalist noted   Daredevil s New York  under Frank s run  became darker and more dangerous than the Spider Man New York he d seemingly lived in before  New York City itself  particularly Daredevil s Hell s Kitchen neighborhood  became as much a character as the shadowy crimefighter  the stories often took place on the rooftop level  with water towers  pipes and chimneys jutting out to create a skyline reminiscent of German Expressionism s dramatic edges and shadows   15  Miller was so successful with the title that Marvel once again began publishing Daredevil monthly rather than semimonthly  With issue  168  Jan  1981   Miller took over full duties as writer and penciller  with Klaus Janson as inker  Issue  168 saw the first appearance of the ninja mercenary Elektra  who despite being an assassin for hire would become Daredevil s love interest  Miller would write and draw a solo Elektra story in Bizarre Adventures  28  Oct  1981   Daredevil  168  Jan  1981   Elektra s debut  Cover art by Miller and Klaus Janson  With his creation of Elektra  Miller s work on Daredevil was characterized by darker themes and stories  This peaked when in  181  April 1982  he had the assassin Bullseye kill Elektra  Miller finished his Daredevil run with issue  191  Feb  1983   in his time he had transformed a second tier character into one of Marvel s most popular  Additionally  Miller drew a short Batman Christmas story   Wanted  Santa Claus   Dead or Alive   written by Denny O Neil for DC Special Series  21  Spring 1980   This was his first professional experience with a character with which  like Daredevil  he would become closely associated  As penciler and co plotter  Miller  together with writer Chris Claremont  produced the miniseries Wolverine  1 4  Sept  Dec  1982   inked by Josef Rubinstein and spinning off from the popular X Men title  Miller used this miniseries to expand on Wolverine s character  16  The series was a critical success and further cemented Miller s place as an industry star  His first creator owned title was DC Comics  six issue miniseries Ronin  1983 1984   This series shows some of the strongest influences of manga and bande dessin e on Miller s style  both in the artwork and narrative style  17  In the early 1980s  Miller and Steve Gerber made a proposal to revamp DC s three biggest characters  Superman  Batman  and Wonder Woman  under a line called  Metropolis  and comics titled  Man of Steel  or  The Man of Steel    Dark Knight  and  Amazon   18  However  this proposal was not accepted  In 1985  DC Comics named Miller as one of the honorees in the company s 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great  19   edit  Batman  The Dark Knight Returns and the late 1980s Batman  The Dark Knight Returns  1  Feb  1986   Cover art by Miller  In 1986  DC Comics released writer penciler Miller s Batman  The Dark Knight Returns  a four issue miniseries printed in what the publisher called  prestige format    squarebound  rather than stapled  on heavy stock paper rather than newsprint  and with cardstock rather than glossy paper covers  It was inked by Klaus Janson and colored by Lynn Varley  The story tells how Batman retired after the death of the second Robin  Jason Todd   and at age 55 returns to fight crime in a dark and violent future  Miller created a tough  gritty portrayal of Batman  who was often referred to as the  Darknight Detective  in 1970s portrayals  Released the same year as Alan Moore s and Dave Gibbons  DC miniseries Watchmen  it showcased a new form of more adult oriented storytelling to both comics fans and a crossover mainstream audience  The Dark Knight Returns influenced the comic book industry by heralding a new wave of darker characters  20  The trade paperback collection proved to be a big seller for DC and remains in print 25 years after first being published  By this time  Miller had returned as the writer of Daredevil  Following his self contained story  Badlands   penciled by John Buscema  in  219  June 1985   he co wrote  226  Jan  1986  with departing writer Dennis O Neil  Then  with artist David Mazzucchelli  he crafted a seven issue story arc that  like The Dark Knight Returns  similarly redefined and reinvigorated its main character  The storyline  Daredevil  Born Again  in  227 233  Feb  Aug  1986  chronicled the hero s Catholic background  and the destruction and rebirth of his real life identity  Manhattan attorney Matt Murdock  at the hands of Daredevil s archnemesis  the crime lord Wilson Fisk  also known as the Kingpin  Miller and artist Bill Sienkiewicz produced the graphic novel Daredevil  Love and War in 1986  Featuring the character of the Kingpin  it indirectly bridges Miller s first run on Daredevil and Born Again by explaining the change in the Kingpin s attitude toward Daredevil  Miller and Sienkiewicz also produced the eight issue miniseries Elektra  Assassin for Epic Comics  Set outside regular Marvel continuity  it featured a wild tale of cyborgs and ninjas  while expanding further on Elektra s background  Both of these projects were well received critically  Elektra  Assassin was praised for its bold storytelling  but neither it nor Daredevil  Love and War had the influence or reached as many readers as Dark Knight Returns or Born Again  Miller s final major story in this period was in Batman issues 404 407 in 1987  another collaboration with Mazzucchelli  Titled Batman  Year One  this was Miller s version of the origin of Batman in which he retconned many details and adapted the story to fit his Dark Knight continuity  Proving to be hugely popular  21  this was as influential as Miller s previous work and a trade paperback released in 1988 remains in print and is one of DC s best selling books and adapted as an original animated film video in 2011  Miller had also drawn the covers for the first twelve issues of First Comics English language reprints of Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima s Lone Wolf and Cub  This helped bring Japanese manga to a wider Western audience  During this time  Miller  along with Marv Wolfman  Alan Moore and Howard Chaykin  had been in dispute with DC Comics over a proposed ratings system for comics  Disagreeing with what he saw as censorship  Miller refused to do any further work for DC  14  and he would take his future projects to the independent publisher Dark Horse Comics  From then on Miller would be a major supporter of creator rights and be a major voice against censorship in comics   edit  The 1990s Sin City and 300 This section may contain original research  Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding references  Statements consisting only of original research may be removed  More details may be available on the talk page   October 2007  After announcing he intended to release his work only via the independent publisher Dark Horse Comics  Miller completed one final project for Epic Comics  the mature audience imprint of Marvel Comics  Elektra Lives Again was a fully painted graphic novel written and drawn by Miller and colored by longtime partner Lynn Varley  Telling the story of the resurrection of Elektra from the dead and Daredevil s quest to find her  as well as showing Miller s will to experiment with new story telling techniques  22  Marv walking through the rain in the The Hard Goodbye cover by Frank Miller 1990 saw Miller and artist Geof Darrow start work on Hard Boiled  a three issue miniseries  The title  a mix of violence and satire  was praised 23  for Darrow s highly detailed art and Miller s writing  At the same time Miller and artist Dave Gibbons produced Give Me Liberty  a four issue miniseries for Dark Horse  Give Me Liberty was followed by sequel miniseries and specials expanding on the story of protagonist Martha Washington  an African American woman in modern and near future southern North America  all of which were written by Miller and drawn by Gibbons  Miller also wrote the scripts for the science fiction films RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3  about a police cyborg  Neither was critically well received  24  25  In 2007  Miller stated that  There was a lot of interference in the writing process  It wasn t ideal  After working on the two Robocop movies  I really thought that was it for me in the business of film   26  Miller would come into contact with the fictional cyborg once more  however  writing the comic book minieries  RoboCop vs  The Terminator  with art by Walter Simonson  In 2003  Miller s screenplay for RoboCop 2 was adapted by Steven Grant for Avatar Press s Pulsaar imprint  Illustrated by Juan Jose Ryp  the series is called Frank Miller s RoboCop and contains plot elements that were divided between RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3  In 1991  Miller started work on his first Sin City story  Serialized in Dark Horse Presents  51 62  Miller wrote and drew the story in black and white to emphasize its film noir origins  Proving to be another success  the story was released in a trade paperback  This first Sin City  yarn  was rereleased in 1995 under the name The Hard Goodbye  Sin City proved to be Miller s main project for much of the remainder of the decade  as Miller told more Sin City stories within this noir world of his creation  in the process helping to revitalize the crime comics genre  27 Sin City proved artistically auspicious for Miller and again brought his work to a wider audience without comics  Daredevil  Man Without Fear was a five issue miniseries published by Marvel Comics in 1993  In this Miller and artist John Romita Jr  told Daredevil s origins differently than in the previous comics  and provided additional detail to his beginnings  Miller also returned to superheroes by writing issue  11 of Todd McFarlane s Spawn  as well as the Spawn Batman crossover for Image Comics  28  In 1995  Miller and Darrow collaborated again on Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot  published as a two part miniseries by Dark Horse Comics  In 1999 it became an animated series on Fox Kids  During this period  Miller became one of the founding members of the comic imprint Legend  under which many of his Sin City works were released  via Dark Horse  Also  it was during the 1990s that Miller did cover art for many titles in the Comics Greatest World Dark Horse Heroes line  Written and illustrated by Frank Miller with painted colors by Varley  300 was a 1998 comic book miniseries  released as a hardcover collection in 1999  retelling the Battle of Thermopylae and the events leading up to it from the perspective of Leonidas of Sparta  300 was particularly inspired by the 1962 film The 300 Spartans  a movie that Miller watched as a young boy  29  In 2007  300 was adapted by director Zack Snyder into a successful film   edit  Batman  The Dark Knight Strikes Again and the 2000s Miller started the new millennium off with the long awaited sequel to Batman  The Dark Knight Returns for DC Comics after Miller had put past differences with DC aside  Batman  The Dark Knight Strikes Again was initially released as a three issue series  Miller also returned to writing Batman in 2005  taking on the writing duties of All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder  a series set inside of what Miller describes as the  Dark Knight Universe   30  and drawn by Jim Lee  Miller has said he opposes naturalism in comic art  In an interview on the documentary Legends of the Dark Knight  The History of Batman  31  he said   People are attempting to bring a superficial reality to superheroes which is rather stupid  They work best as the flamboyant fantasies they are  I mean  these are characters that are broad and big  I don t need to see sweat patches under Superman s arms  I want to see him fly   Miller s previous attitude towards movie adaptations was to change after he and Robert Rodriguez made a short film based on a story from Miller s Sin City entitled  The Customer is Always Right   Miller was pleased with the result  leading to him and Rodriguez directing a full length film  Sin City using Miller s original comics panels as storyboards  The film was released in the U S  on April 1  2005  The film s success brought renewed attention to Miller s Sin City projects  Similarly  a film adaptation of 300  directed solely by Zack Snyder  brought new attention and controversy to Miller s original comic book work  A sequel to the film  based around Miller s first Sin City series  A Dame to Kill For  has been reported to be in development  32   edit  Critical reaction This section requires expansion  Miller s work has often been met with positive reception  Daredevil  Born Again and The Dark Knight Returns were both a critical success  and Batman  Year One was met with even greater praise for its gritty style  Most of his previous work such as Ronin  300 and Sin City were very successful  However  Miller s later work often has been met with criticism  Batman  The Dark Knight Strikes Again received mixed reviews  All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder in particular was met with harsh criticism  33  34  35  Some of Miller s works have been accused of lacking humanity  36  particularly in regard to the abundance of prostitutes portrayed in Sin City  37  When it was released in 2008  Miller s film adaptation of Will Eisner s The Spirit met with largely negative reviews  earning a metascore of 30 100 at the review aggregation site Metacritic com  38  The film adaption  however  was very different from the original source material  His work Holy Terror has been criticized as propaganda  39  On November 7  2011  Miller posted a statement on his website in opposition to the Occupy Movement  40  This met with criticism from Alan Moore who described Miller s more recent work as homophobic and misogynistic  despite praising his early Batman and Daredevil work  even writing an introduction to an early collected edition of The Dark Knight Returns  41   edit  Cameo appearances Frank Miller  right  appearing as illegal drug chemist  Frank  in RoboCop 2 alongside Tom Noonan as  Cain   left   Frank Miller has appeared in five films in small roles  dying in each  In RoboCop 2  1990   he plays  Frank  the chemist  and dies in an explosion in the drug lab  citation needed  In Jugular Wine  A Vampire Odyssey  1994   he is killed by vampires in front of Marvel Comics  Stan Lee  42  In Daredevil  2003   43  he appears as a corpse with a pen in his head  thrown by Bullseye  who steals his motorcycle  The credits list Frank Miller as  Man with Pen in Head   In Sin City  2005   he plays the priest killed by Marv in the confessional  44  In The Spirit  2008   which was written and directed by Miller  he appears as  Liebowitz   the officer whose head is ripped off by the Octopus and thrown at the Spirit  The name alludes to Jack Liebowitz  a co founder of what would become DC Comics  45   edit  Bibliography  edit  DC Comics Titles published by DC Comics include  Weird War Tales  a    Deliver Me from D Day   with Wyatt Gwyon
