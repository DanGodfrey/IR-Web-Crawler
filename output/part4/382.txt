religion 1  based on the life and teachings of Jesus as presented in canonical gospels and other New Testament writings  2  Adherents of the Christian faith are known as Christians  3  Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God  God having become human and the saviour of humanity  Because of this  Christians commonly refer to Jesus as Christ or Messiah  4  The three largest groups in the world of Christianity are the Roman Catholic Church  the Eastern Orthodox churches  and the various denominations of Protestantism  The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox patriarchates split from one another in the East West Schism of 1054 AD  and Protestantism came into existence during the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century  splitting from the Roman Catholic Church  5  Christianity began as a Jewish sect in the mid 1st century  6  7  Originating in the eastern Mediterranean coast of the Middle East  modern Israel and Palestine   it quickly spread to Syria  Mesopotamia  Asia Minor and Egypt  It grew in size and influence over a few decades  and by the 4th century had become the dominant religion within the Roman Empire  8  During the Middle Ages  most of the remainder of Europe was Christianized  with Christians also being a sometimes large religious minority in the Middle East  North Africa  Ethiopia 9  and parts of India  10  Following the Age of Discovery  through missionary work and colonization  Christianity spread to the Americas  Australasia  sub Saharan Africa  and the rest of the world  11  12  13  Christians believe that Jesus is the Messiah prophesied in the Hebrew Bible  referred to as the  Old Testament  in Christianity  The foundation of Christian theology is expressed in the early Christian ecumenical creeds which contain claims predominantly accepted by followers of the Christian faith  14  These professions state that Jesus suffered  died  was buried  and was resurrected from the dead in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust him for the remission of their sins  salvation   15  They further maintain that Jesus bodily ascended into heaven where he rules and reigns with God the Father  Most denominations teach that Jesus will return to judge all humans  living and dead  and grant eternal life to his followers  16  He is considered the model of a virtuous life  and both the revealer and physical incarnation of God  17  Christians call the message of Jesus Christ the Gospel   good news   and hence refer to the earliest written accounts of his ministry as gospels  As of the early 21st century  Christianity has approximately 2 2 billion adherents  18  19  20  Christianity represents about a quarter to a third of the world s population and is the world s largest religion  21  22  Christianity is the state

text related to this article  Nicene Creed Though there are many important differences of interpretation and opinion of the Bible on which Christianity is based  Christians share a set of beliefs that they hold as essential to their faith  24  Creeds Main article  Creeds Icon depicting Emperor Constantine  center  and the Fathers of the First Council of Nicaea  325  as holding the Niceno Constantinopolitan Creed of 381 Creeds  from Latin credo meaning  I believe   are concise doctrinal statements or confessions  usually of religious beliefs  They began as baptismal formulae and were later expanded during the Christological controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries to become statements of faith  Many evangelical Protestants reject creeds as definitive statements of faith  even while agreeing with some or all of the substance of the creeds  The Baptists have been non creedal  in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another   25  p 111 Also rejecting creeds are groups with roots in the Restoration Movement  such as the Christian Church  Disciples of Christ   the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada and the Churches of Christ  26  27  14 15 28  123 The Apostles  Creed remains the most popular statement of the articles of Christian faith that are generally acceptable to most Christian denominations that are creedal  It is widely used by a number of Christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes  most visibly by liturgical Churches of Western Christian tradition  including the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church  Lutheranism  Anglicanism  and Western Orthodoxy  It is also used by Presbyterians  Methodists  and Congregationalists  This particular creed was developed between the 2nd and 9th centuries  Its central doctrines are those of the Trinity and God the Creator  Each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the apostolic period  The creed was apparently used as a summary of Christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of Rome  29  Its main points  belief in God the Father  Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Holy Spirit the death  descent into hell  resurrection  and ascension of Christ the holiness of the Church and the communion of saints Christ s second coming  the Day of Judgement and salvation of the faithful  The Nicene Creed  largely a response to Arianism  was formulated at the Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople in 325 and 381 respectively 30  31  and ratified as the universal creed of Christendom by the First Council of Ephesus in 431  32  The Chalcedonian Creed  developed at the Council of Chalcedon in 451  33  though rejected by the Oriental Orthodox Churches  34  taught Christ  to be acknowledged in two natures  inconfusedly  unchangeably  indivisibly  inseparably   one divine and one human  and that both natures are perfect but are nevertheless perfectly united into one person  35  The Athanasian Creed  received in the Western Church as having the same status as the Nicene and Chalcedonian  says   We worship one God in Trinity  and Trinity in Unity  neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the Substance   36  Most Christians  Roman Catholics  Eastern Orthodox  Eastern Rite and Protestants alike  accept the use of creeds  and subscribe to at least one of the creeds mentioned above  37  Ten Commandments The Ten Commandments  are a set of biblical principles relating to ethics and worship  which play a fundamental role in Judaism and most forms of Christianity  They include instructions to worship only God and to keep the Sabbath  and prohibitions against idolatry  blasphemy  murder  theft  and adultery  Different groups follow slightly different traditions for interpreting and numbering them  Jesus Christ Main articles  Christian views of Jesus  Christology  and Jesus Christ in comparative mythology A depiction of Jesus as a child with his mother  Mary  the Theotokos of Vladimir  12th century  Russia  The central tenet of Christianity is the belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah  Christ   The title  Messiah  comes from the Hebrew word           m  i    meaning anointed one  The Greek translation          Christos  is the source of the English word  Christ   17  Christians believe that Jesus  as the Messiah  was anointed by God as saviour of humanity  and hold that Jesus  coming was the fulfillment of messianic prophecies of the Old Testament  The Christian concept of the Messiah differs significantly from the contemporary Jewish concept  The core Christian belief is that through belief in and acceptance of the death and resurrection of Jesus  sinful humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life  38  While there have been many theological disputes over the nature of Jesus over the earliest centuries of Christian history  Christians generally believe that Jesus is God incarnate and  true God and true man   or both fully divine and fully human   Jesus  having become fully human  suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man  but did not sin  As fully God  he rose to life again  According to the Bible   God raised him from the dead   39  he ascended to heaven  is  seated at the right hand of the Father  40  and will ultimately return Acts 1 9 11  to fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy such as the Resurrection of the dead  the Last Judgment and final establishment of the Kingdom of God  According to the Gospels of Matthew and Luke  Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born from the Virgin Mary  Little of Jesus  childhood is recorded in the canonical Gospels  however infancy Gospels were popular in antiquity  In comparison  his adulthood  especially the week before his death  is well documented in the Gospels contained within the New Testament  The Biblical accounts of Jesus  ministry include  his baptism  miracles  preaching  teaching  and deeds  Death and resurrection of Jesus Main articles  Crucifixion of Jesus and Resurrection of Jesus Crucifixion  representing the death of Jesus on the Cross  painting by D  Vel zquez  17th c  Resurrection of Christ by Noel Coypel  1700  using a hovering depiction of Jesus  Christians consider the resurrection of Jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith  see 1 Corinthians 15  and the most important event in human history  41  Among Christian beliefs  the death and resurrection of Jesus are two core events on which much of Christian doctrine and theology is based  42  43  According to the New Testament Jesus was crucified  died a physical death  was buried within a tomb  and rose from the dead three days later  Jn  19 30 31   Mk  16 1   16 6  The New Testament mentions several resurrection appearances of Jesus on different occasions to his twelve apostles and disciples  including  more than five hundred brethren at once   1 Cor  15 6  before Jesus  Ascension to heaven  Jesus  death and resurrection are commemorated by Christians in all worship services  with special emphasis during Holy Week which includes Good Friday and Easter Sunday  The death and resurrection of Jesus are usually considered the most important events in Christian Theology  partly because they demonstrate that Jesus has power over life and death and therefore has the authority and power to give people eternal life  44  Christian churches accept and teach the New Testament account of the resurrection of Jesus with very few exceptions  45  Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus  followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the historical Jesus and the proclamation of the early church  46  Some liberal Christians do not accept a literal bodily resurrection  47  48  seeing the story as richly symbolic and spiritually nourishing myth  Arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious debates and interfaith dialogues  49 Paul the Apostle  an early Christian convert and missionary  wrote   If Christ was not raised  then all our preaching is useless  and your trust in God is useless   1 Cor  15 14   50  Salvation Main article  Salvation Paul of Tarsus  like Jews and Roman pagans of his time  believed that sacrifice can bring about new kinship ties  purity  and eternal life  51  For Paul the necessary sacrifice was the death of Jesus  Gentiles who are  Christ s  are  like Israel  descendants of Abraham and  heirs according to the promise   Gal  3 29   52  The God who raised Jesus from the dead would also give new life to the  mortal bodies  of Gentile Christians  who had become with Israel the  children of God  and were therefore no longer  in the flesh   Rom  8 9 11 16   51  Modern Christian churches tend to be much more concerned with how humanity can be saved from a universal condition of sin and death than the question of how both Jews and Gentiles can be in God s family  According to both Catholic and Protestant doctrine  salvation comes by Jesus  substitutionary death and resurrection  The Catholic Church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithfulness on the part of Christians  converts must live in accordance with principles of love and ordinarily must be baptized  53  54  Martin Luther taught that baptism was necessary for salvation  but modern Lutherans and other Protestants tend to teach that salvation is a gift that comes to an individual by God s grace  sometimes defined as  unmerited favor   even apart from baptism  Christians differ in their views on the extent to which individuals  salvation is pre ordained by God  Reformed theology places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that individuals are completely incapable of self redemption  but that sanctifying grace is irresistible  55  In contrast Catholics  Orthodox Christians and Arminian Protestants believe that the exercise of free will is necessary to have faith in Jesus  56  Trinity Main article  Trinity Three angels hosted by Abraham by Ludovico Carracci  The three angels represent the three persons of God  Trinity refers to the teaching that the one God comprises three distinct  eternally co existing persons  the Father  the Son  incarnate in Jesus Christ   and the Holy Spirit  Together  these three persons are sometimes called the Godhead  57  58  59  although there is no single term in use in Scripture to denote the unified Godhead  60  In the words of the Athanasian Creed  an early statement of Christian belief   the Father is God  the Son is God  and the Holy Spirit is God  and yet there are not three Gods but one God   61  They are distinct from another  the Father has no source  the Son is begotten of the Father  and the Spirit proceeds from the Father  Though distinct  the three persons cannot be divided from one another in being or in operation  62  The Trinity is an essential doctrine of mainstream Christianity   Father  Son and Holy Spirit  represents both the immanence and transcendence of God  God is believed to be infinite and God s presence may be perceived through the actions of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit  63  According to this doctrine  God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole  rather  each person is considered to be fully God  see Perichoresis   The distinction lies in their relations  the Father being unbegotten  the Son being begotten of the Father  and the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and  in Western Christian theology  from the Son  Regardless of this apparent difference  the three  persons  are each eternal and omnipotent  The word trias  from which trinity is derived  is first seen in the works of Theophilus of Antioch  He wrote of  the Trinity of God  the Father   His Word  the Son  and His Wisdom  Holy Spirit    64  The term may have been in use before this time  Afterwards it appears in Tertullian  65  66  In the following century the word was in general use  It is found in many passages of Origen  67  Trinitarians Main article  Trinitarianism Trinitarianism denotes those Christians who believe in the concept of the Trinity  Almost all Christian denominations and Churches hold Trinitarian beliefs  Although the words  Trinity  and  Triune  do not appear in the Bible  theologians beginning in the 3rd century developed the term and concept to facilitate comprehension of the New Testament teachings of God as Father  God as Jesus the Son  and God as the Holy Spirit  Since that time  Christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that Trinity does not imply three gods  nor that each member of the Trinity is one third of an infinite God  Trinity is defined as one God in three Persons  68  Nontrinitarians Main article  Nontrinitarianism Nontrinitarianism refers to beliefs systems that reject the doctrine of the Trinity  They are a small minority of Christians  Various nontrinitarian views  such as adoptionism or modalism  existed in early Christianity  leading to the disputes about Christology  69  Nontrinitarianism later appeared again in the Gnosticism of the Cathars in the 11th through 13th centuries  in the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century  and in some groups arising during the Second Great Awakening of the 19th century  Scriptures Main articles  Bible and Development of the Christian Biblical canon Christianity  like other religions  has adherents whose beliefs and biblical interpretations vary  However  this article s purpose is to describe those distinctives that set Christianity apart as a unique belief system  Christianity regards the Bible  a collection of canonical books in two parts  the Old Testament and the New Testament   as the authoritative word of God  Christians believe the Bible was written by human authors under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit  Some believe that divine inspiration makes our present Bibles  inerrant   Others claim inerrancy for the Bible in its original manuscripts  though none of those are extant  Still others maintain that only a particular translation is inerrant  such as the King James Version  70  71  72  Jews  Catholics  Orthodox and Protestants each define separate lists of Books of the Bible that each considers canonical  These variations are a reflection of the range of traditions and councils that have convened on the subject  Every version of the complete Bible always includes books of the Jewish scriptures  the Tanakh  and includes additional books and reorganizes them into two parts  the books of the Old Testament primarily sourced from the Tanakh  with some variations   and the 27 books of the New Testament containing books originally written primarily in Greek  73  The Roman Catholic and Orthodox canons include other books from the Septuagint which Roman Catholics call Deuterocanonical  74  Protestants consider these books to be apocryphal  Some versions of the Christian Bible have a separate Apocrypha section for the books not considered canonical by some Churches or by the groups publishing them  75  Catholic and Orthodox interpretations The inside of an Eastern Orthodox church Saint Peter s Basilica  Vatican City Inside of Saint Peter s Basilica An Eastern Catholic Bishop of the Syro Malabar Church holding the Mar Thoma Cross which symbolizes the heritage and identity of the Saint Thomas Christians of India In antiquity  two schools of exegesis developed in Alexandria and Antioch  Alexandrine interpretation  exemplified by Origen  tended to read Scripture allegorically  while Antiochene interpretation adhered to the literal sense  holding that other meanings  called theoria  could only be accepted if based on the literal meaning  76  Catholic theology distinguishes two senses of scripture  the literal and the spiritual  77  The literal sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture  The spiritual sense is further subdivided into  the allegorical sense  which includes typology  An example would be the parting of the Red Sea being understood as a  type   sign  of baptism  1 Cor  10 2  the moral sense  which understands the scripture to contain some ethical teaching  the anagogical sense  which applies to eschatology  eternity and the consummation of the world Regarding exegesis  following the rules of sound interpretation  Catholic theology holds  the injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the literal 78  79  that the historicity of the Gospels must be absolutely and constantly held 80  that scripture must be read within the  living Tradition of the whole Church  81  and that  the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter  the Bishop of Rome   82  Protestant interpretation Clarity of Scripture Protestant Christians believe that the Bible is a self sufficient revelation  the final authority on all Christian doctrine  and revealed all truth necessary for salvation  This concept is known as sola scriptura  83  Protestants characteristically believe that ordinary believers may reach an adequate understanding of Scripture because Scripture itself is clear  or  perspicuous    because of the help of the Holy Spirit  or both  Martin Luther believed that without God s help Scripture would be  enveloped in darkness   84  He advocated  one definite and simple understanding of Scripture   84 John Calvin wrote   all who   follow the Holy Spirit as their guide  find in the Scripture a clear light   85  The Second Helvetic Confession  composed by the pastor of the Reformed church in Zurich  successor to Protestant reformer Zwingli  was adopted as a declaration of doctrine by most European Reformed churches  86  Original intended meaning of Scripture Protestants stress the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture  the historical grammatical method  87  The historical grammatical method or grammatico historical method is an effort in Biblical hermeneutics to find the intended original meaning in the text  88  This original intended meaning of the text is drawn out through examination of the passage in light of the grammatical and syntactical aspects  the historical background  the literary genre as well as theological  canonical  considerations  89  The historical grammatical method distinguishes between the one original meaning and the significance of the text  The significance of the text includes the ensuing use of the text or application  The original passage is seen as having only a single meaning or sense  As Milton S  Terry said   A fundamental principle in grammatico historical exposition is that the words and sentences can have but one significance in one and the same connection  The moment we neglect this principle we drift out upon a sea of uncertainty and conjecture   90  Technically speaking  the grammatical historical method of interpretation is distinct from the determination of the passage s significance in light of that interpretation  Taken together  both define the term  Biblical  hermeneutics  91  Some Protestant interpreters make use of typology  92  Afterlife and Eschaton Main article  Christian eschatology Most Christians believe that human beings experience divine judgment and are rewarded either with eternal life or eternal damnation  This includes the general judgement at the Resurrection of the dead  see below  as well as the belief  held by Roman Catholics  93  94  Orthodox 95  96  and most Protestants  in a judgment particular to the individual soul upon physical death  In Roman Catholicism  those who die in a state of grace  i e   without any mortal sin separating them from God  but are still imperfectly purified from the effects of sin  undergo purification through the intermediate state of purgatory to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into God s presence  97  Those who have attained this goal are called saints  Latin sanctus   holy    98  Christians believe that the second coming of Christ will occur at the end of time  All who have died will be resurrected bodily from the dead for the Last Judgment  Jesus will fully establish the Kingdom of God in fulfillment of scriptural prophecies  99  100  Jehovah s Witnesses deny the existence of hell  Instead  they hold that the souls of the wicked will be annihilated  101  Worship Main article  Christian worship Samples of Catholic religious objects The Holy Bible  a Crucifix  and a Rosary  Jesus as the good shepherd by Bernhard Plockhorst Justin Martyr described 2nd century Christian liturgy in his First Apology  c  150  to Emperor Antoninus Pius  and his description remains relevant to the basic structure of Christian liturgical worship  And on the day called Sunday  all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place  and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read  as long as time permits  then  when the reader has ceased  the president verbally instructs  and exhorts to the imitation of these good things  Then we all rise together and pray  and  as we before said  when our prayer is ended  bread and wine and water are brought  and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings  according to his ability  and the people assent  saying Amen  and there is a distribution to each  and a participation of that over which thanks have been given  and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons  And they who are well to do  and willing  give what each thinks fit  and what is collected is deposited with the president  who succours the orphans and widows and those who  through sickness or any other cause  are in want  and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us  and in a word takes care of all who are in need    Justin Martyr 102  Thus  as Justin described  Christians assemble for communal worship on Sunday  the day of the resurrection  though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting  Scripture readings are drawn from the Old and New Testaments  but especially the Gospels  Often these are arranged on an annual cycle  using a book called a lectionary  Instruction is given based on these readings  called a sermon  or homily  There are a variety of congregational prayers  including thanksgiving  confession  and intercession  which occur throughout the service and take a variety of forms including recited  responsive  silent  or sung  The Lord s Prayer  or Our Father  is regularly prayed  The Eucharist  called Holy Communion  or the Lord s Supper  is the part of liturgical worship that consists of a consecrated meal  usually bread and wine  Justin Martyr described the Eucharist  And this food is called among us Eukaristia  the Eucharist   of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true  and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins  and unto regeneration  and who is so living as Christ has enjoined  For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these  but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour  having been made flesh by the Word of God  had both flesh and blood for our salvation  so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word  and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished  is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh    Justin Martyr 102  Some Christian denominations practice closed communion  They offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church  Catholics restrict participation to their members who are not in a state of mortal sin  Most other churches practice open communion since they view communion as a means to unity  rather than an end  and invite all believing Christians to participate  Some groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure  A division is often made between  High  church services  characterized by greater solemnity and ritual  and  Low  services  but even within these two categories there is great diversity in forms of worship  Seventh day Adventists meet on Saturday  while others do not meet on a weekly basis  Charismatic or Pentecostal congregations may spontaneously feel led by the Holy Spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service  including spontaneous prayer  Quakers sit quietly until moved by the Holy Spirit to speak  Some Evangelical services resemble concerts with rock and pop music  dancing  and use of multimedia  For groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers the services are generally led by a minister  preacher  or pastor  Still others may lack any formal leaders  either in principle or by local necessity  Some churches use only a cappella music  either on principle  for example   many Churches of Christ object to the use of instruments in worship  or by tradition  as in Orthodoxy   Worship can be varied for special events like baptisms or weddings in the service or significant feast days  In the early church  Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship  In many churches today  adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age appropriate teaching  Such children s worship is often called Sunday school or Sabbath school  Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services   Sacraments Main article  Sacrament See also  Sacraments of the Catholic Church  Anglican sacraments  and Lutheran sacraments The Holy Eucharist In Christian belief and practice  a sacrament is a rite  instituted by Christ  that mediates grace  constituting a sacred mystery  The term is derived from the Latin word sacramentum  which was used to translate the Greek word for mystery  Views concerning both what rites are sacramental  and what it means for an act to be a sacrament vary among Christian denominations and traditions  103  The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign  instituted by Christ  that conveys an inward  spiritual grace through Christ  The two most widely accepted sacraments are Baptism and the Eucharist  however  the majority of Christians recognize seven Sacraments or Divine Mysteries  Baptism  Confirmation  Chrismation in the Orthodox tradition   and the Eucharist  Holy Orders  Reconciliation of a Penitent  confession   Anointing of the Sick  and Matrimony  103  Taken together  these are the Seven Sacraments as recognised by churches in the High church tradition notably Roman Catholic  Eastern Orthodox  Oriental Orthodox  Independent Catholic  Old Catholic most Anglicans  and some Lutherans  Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments  while some Protestant groups  such as the Quakers  reject sacramental theology  103  Most Protestant Christian denominations who believe these rites do not communicate grace prefer to call them ordinances  Liturgical calendar Main article  Liturgical year Roman Catholics  Anglicans  Eastern Christians  and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around a liturgical calendar  This includes holy days  such as solemnities which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus or the saints  periods of fasting such as Lent  and other pious events such as memoria or lesser festivals commemorating saints  Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations  such as Christmas  Easter and Pentecost  A few churches make no use of a liturgical calendar  104  Symbols Jesus on the Cross Christian cemetery Main article  Christian symbolism The cross  which is today one of the most widely recognised symbols in the world  was used as a Christian symbol from the earliest times  105  106  Tertullian  in his book De Corona  tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross  107  Although the cross was known to the early Christians  the crucifix did not appear in use until the 5th century  108  Among the symbols employed by the primitive Christians  that of the fish seems to have ranked first in importance  From monumental sources such as tombs it is known that the symbolic fish was familiar to Christians from the earliest times  The fish was depicted as a Christian symbol in the first decades of the 2nd century  109  Its popularity among Christians was due principally  it would seem  to the famous acrostic consisting of the initial letters of five Greek words forming the word for fish  Ichthys   which words briefly but clearly described the character of Christ and the claim to worship of believers  Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter  meaning  Jesus Christ  Son of God  Saviour  109  Christians from the very beginning adorned their tombs with paintings of Christ  of the saints  of scenes from the Bible and allegorical groups  The catacombs are the cradle of all Christian art  The first Christians had no prejudice against images  pictures  or statues  The idea that they must have feared the danger of idolatry among their new converts is disproved in the simplest way by the pictures  even statues  that remain from the 1st centuries  110  Other major Christian symbols include the chi rho monogram  the dove  symbolic of the Holy Spirit   the sacrificial lamb  symbolic of Christ s sacrifice   the vine  symbolising the necessary connectedness of the Christian with Christ  and many others  These all derive from writings found in the New Testament  108  Baptism Baptism is the ritual act  with the use of water  by which a person is admitted to membership of the Church  111  Francesco Albani s The Baptism of Christ Prayer Main article  Prayer in Christianity Jesus  teaching on prayer in the Sermon on the Mount displays a distinct lack of interest in the external aspects of prayer  A concern with the techniques of prayer is condemned as  pagan   and instead a simple trust in God s fatherly goodness is encouraged  Mat  6 5 15  Elsewhere in the New Testament this same freedom of access to God is also emphasized  Phil  4 6  Jam  5 13 19  This confident position should be understood in light of Christian belief in the unique relationship between the believer and Christ through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit  112  In subsequent Christian traditions  certain physical gestures are emphasised  including medieval gestures such as genuflection or making the sign of the cross  Kneeling  bowing and prostrations  see also poklon  are often practiced in more traditional branches of Christianity  Frequently in Western Christianity the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal commendation ceremony  At other times the older orans posture may be used  with palms up and elbows in  Intercessory prayer is prayer offered for the benefit of other people  There are many intercessory prayers recorded in the Bible  included prayers of the Apostle Peter on behalf of sick persons Acts 9 40  and by prophets of the Old Testament in favor of other people  1Ki 17 19 22  In the New Testament book of James no distinction is made between the intercessory prayer offered by ordinary believers and the prominent Old Testament prophet Elijah  Jam 5 16 18  The effectiveness of prayer in Christianity derives from the power of God rather than the status of the one praying 112  The ancient church  in both Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity  developed a tradition of asking for the intercession of  deceased  saints  and this remains the practice of most Eastern Orthodox  Oriental Orthodox  Roman Catholic  and some Anglican churches  Churches of the Protestant Reformation however rejected prayer to the saints  largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of Christ  113  The reformer Huldrych Zwingli admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the Bible convinced him that this was idolatrous  114  According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church   Prayer is the raising of one s mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God   115  The Book of Common Prayer in the Anglican tradition is a guide which provides a set order for church services  containing set prayers  scripture readings  and hymns or sung Psalms  History Main articles  History

some of earliest Christian monasteries in the world  Main articles  Early Christianity and First seven Ecumenical Councils Christianity began as a Jewish sect in the eastern Mediterranean in the mid 1st century  3  6  7  Its earliest development took place under the leadership of the Twelve Apostles  particularly Saint Peter and Paul the Apostle  followed by the early bishops  whom Christians consider the successors of the Apostles  According to the scriptures  Christians were from the beginning subject to persecution by some Jewish religious authorities  who disagreed with the apostles  teachings  See Split of early Christianity and Judaism   This involved punishments  including death  for Christians such as Stephen Acts 7 59  and James  son of Zebedee  Acts 12 2  Larger scale persecutions followed at the hands of the authorities of the Roman Empire  first in the year 64  when Emperor Nero blamed them for the Great Fire of Rome  According to Church tradition  it was under Nero s persecution that early Church leaders Peter and Paul of Tarsus were each martyred in Rome  Further widespread persecutions of the Church occurred under nine subsequent Roman emperors  most intensely under Decius and Diocletian  From the year 150  Christian teachers began to produce theological and apologetic works aimed at defending the faith  These authors are known as the Church Fathers  and study of them is called Patristics  Notable early Fathers include Ignatius of Antioch  Polycarp  Justin Martyr  Irenaeus  Tertullian  Clement of Alexandria  and Origen  However  Armenia is considered the first nation to accept Christianity in 301 AD  116  117  118  State persecution ceased in the 4th century  when Constantine I issued an edict of toleration in 313  On 27 February 380  Emperor Theodosius I enacted a law establishing Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire  119  From at least the 4th century  Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization  120  Constantine was also instrumental in the convocation of the First Council of Nicaea in 325  which sought to address the Arian heresy and formulated the Nicene Creed  which is still used by the Roman Catholic Church  Eastern Orthodoxy  Anglican Communion  and many Protestant churches  37  Nicaea was the first of a series of Ecumenical  worldwide  Councils which formally defined critical elements of the theology of the Church  notably concerning Christology  121  The Assyrian Church of the East did not accept the third and following Ecumenical Councils  and are still separate today  In 395  the most Christianized regions of the world were Crete  Cyprus  Anatolia  Armenia  the Nile delta  and Numidia  present day Tunisia and Algeria   122  The presence of Christianity in Africa began in the middle of the 1st century in Egypt  and by the end of the 2nd century in the region around Carthage  Important Africans who influenced the early development of Christianity includes Tertullian  Clement of Alexandria  Origen of Alexandria  Cyprian  Athanasius and Augustine of Hippo  The later rise of Islam in North Africa reduced the size and numbers of Christian congregations  leaving only the Coptic Church in Egypt and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in the Horn of Africa  The History of Christianity in Africa began in the 1st century when Mark the Evangelist started the Orthodox Church of Alexandria in about 43 AD  123  124  125  Early Middle Ages With the decline and fall of the Roman Empire in the west  the papacy became a political player  first visible in Pope Leo s diplomatic dealings with Huns and Vandals  126  The church also entered into a long period of missionary activity and expansion among the various tribes  Whilst arianists instituted the death penalty for practicing pagans  see Massacre of Verden as example   Catholicism also spread among the Germanic peoples  126  the Celtic and Slavic peoples  the Hungarians  and the Baltic peoples  Around 500  St  Benedict set out his Monastic Rule  establishing a system of regulations for the foundation and running of monasteries  126 Monasticism became a powerful force throughout Europe  126  and gave rise to many early centers of learning  most famously in Ireland  Scotland and Gaul  contributing to the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century  In the 7th century Muslims conquered Syria  including Jerusalem   North Africa and Spain  Part of the Muslims  success was due to the exhaustion of the Byzantine empire in its decades long conflict with Persia  127  Beginning in the 8th century  with the rise of Carolingian leaders  the papacy began to find greater political support in the Frankish Kingdom  128  The Middle Ages brought about major changes within the church  Pope Gregory the Great dramatically reformed ecclesiastical structure and administration  129  In the early 8th century  iconoclasm became a divisive issue  when it was sponsored by the Byzantine emperors  The Second Ecumenical Council of Nicaea  787  finally pronounced in favor of icons  130  In the early 10th century  Western Christian monasticism was further rejuvenated through the leadership of the great Benedictine monastery of Cluny  131  High and Late Middle Ages Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont  where he preached the First Crusade  In the west  from the 11th century onward  older cathedral schools developed into universities  see University of Oxford  University of Paris  and University of Bologna   Originally teaching only theology  these steadily added subjects including medicine  philosophy and law  becoming the direct ancestors of modern institutions of learning  132  Accompanying the rise of the  new towns  throughout Europe  mendicant orders were founded  bringing the consecrated religious life out of the monastery and into the new urban setting  The two principal mendicant movements were the Franciscans 133  and the Dominicans 134  founded by St  Francis and St  Dominic respectively  Both orders made significant contributions to the development of the great universities of Europe  Another new order were the Cistercians  whose large isolated monasteries spearheaded the settlement of former wilderness areas  In this period church building and ecclesiastical architecture reached new heights  culminating in the orders of Romanesque and Gothic architecture and the building of the great European cathedrals  135  From 1095 under the pontificate of Urban II  the Crusades were launched  136  These were a series of military campaigns in the Holy Land and elsewhere  initiated in response to pleas from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I for aid against Turkish expansion  The Crusades ultimately failed to stifle Islamic aggression and even contributed to Christian enmity with the sacking of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade  137  Over a period stretching from the 7th to the 13th century  the Christian Church underwent gradual alienation  resulting in a schism dividing it into a so called Latin or Western Christian branch  the Roman Catholic Church  138  and an Eastern  largely Greek  branch  the Orthodox Church  These two churches disagree on a number of administrative  liturgical  and doctrinal issues  most notably papal primacy of jurisdiction  139  140  The Second Council of Lyon  1274  and the Council of Florence  1439  attempted to reunite the churches  but in both cases the Eastern Orthodox refused to implement the decisions and the two principal churches remain in schism to the present day  However  the Roman Catholic Church has achieved union with various smaller eastern churches  Beginning around 1184  following the crusade against the Cathar heresy  141  various institutions  broadly referred to as the Inquisition  were established with the aim of suppressing heresy and securing religious and doctrinal unity within Christianity through conversion and prosecution  142  Protestant Reformation and Counter Reformation Opening of Luther s 95 Theses Main articles  Protestant Reformation and Counter Reformation The 15th century Renaissance brought about a renewed interest in ancient and classical learning  Another major schism  the Reformation  resulted in the splintering of the Western Christendom into several Christian denominations  143 Martin Luther in 1517 protested against the sale of indulgences and soon moved on to deny several key points of Roman Catholic doctrine  Others like Zwingli and Calvin further criticized Roman Catholic teaching and worship  These challenges developed into the movement called Protestantism  which repudiated the primacy of the pope  the role of tradition  the seven sacraments  and other doctrines and practices  144  The Reformation in England began in 1534  when King Henry VIII had himself declared head of the Church of England  Beginning in 1536  the monasteries throughout England  Wales and Ireland were dissolved  145  Two priests demand a heretic to repent as he is tortured Partly in response to the Protestant Reformation  the Roman Catholic Church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal  known as the Counter Reformation or Catholic Reform  146  The Council of Trent clarified and reasserted Roman Catholic doctrine  During the following centuries  competition between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism became deeply entangled with political struggles among European states  147  Meanwhile  the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492 brought about a new wave of missionary activity  Partly from missionary zeal  but under the impetus of colonial expansion by the European powers  Christianity spread to the Americas  Oceania  East Asia  and sub Saharan Africa  Throughout Europe  the divides caused by the Reformation led to outbreaks of religious violence and the establishment of separate state churches in Europe  Lutheranism in parts of Germany and in Scandinavia and Anglicanism in England in 1534  Ultimately  these differences led to the outbreak of conflicts in which religion played a key factor  The Thirty Years  War  the English Civil War  and the French Wars of Religion are prominent examples  These events intensified the Christian debate on persecution and toleration  148  See also  European wars of religion Post Enlightenment 360 degree view from the dome over the Vatican and out into Rome In the era known as the Great Divergence  when in the West the Age of Enlightenment and the Scientific revolution brought about great societal changes  Christianity was confronted with various forms of skepticism and with certain modern political ideologies such as versions of socialism and liberalism  149  Events ranged from mere anti clericalism to violent outbursts against Christianity such as the Dechristianisation during the French Revolution  150  the Spanish Civil War  and general hostility of Marxist movements  especially the Russian Revolution  Especially pressing in Europe was the formation of nation states after the Napoleonic era  In all European countries  different Christian denominations found themselves in competition  to greater or lesser extents  with each other and with the state  Variables are the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious  political  and ideological orientation of the state  Urs Altermatt of the University of Fribourg  looking specifically at Catholicisms in Europe  identifies four models for the European nations  In traditionally Catholic countries such as Belgium  Spain  and to some extent Austria  religious and national communities are more or less identical  Cultural symbiosis and separation are found in Poland  Ireland  and Switzerland  all countries with competing denominations  Competition is found in Germany  the Netherlands  and again Switzerland  all countries with minority Catholic populations who to a greater or lesser extent did identify with the nation  Finally  separation between religion  again  specifically Catholicism  and the state is found to a great degree in France and Italy  countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the Catholic Church  151  The combined factors of the formation of nation states and ultramontanism  especially in Germany and the Netherlands but also in England  to a much lesser extent 152    often forced Catholic churches  organizations  and believers to choose between the national demands of the state and the authority of the Church  specifically the papacy  This conflict came to a head in the First Vatican Council  and in Germany would lead directly to the Kulturkampf  where liberals and Protestants under the leadership of Bismarck managed to severely restrict Catholic expression and organization  Christian commitment in Europe dropped as modernity and secularism came into their own in Europe  153  particularly in the Czech Republic and Estonia  154  while religious commitments in America have been generally high in comparison to Europe  The late 20th century has shown the shift of Christian adherence to the Third World and southern hemisphere in general  with the western civilization no longer the chief standard bearer of Christianity  Some Europeans  including diaspora   Indigenous peoples of the Americas  and natives of other continents have revived their respective peoples  historical folk religions   see Neo paganism  Native Americans in the United States Religion  Approximately 7 1 to 10  of Arabs are Christians 155  most prevalent in Egypt

Christianity   Protestantism and Anglicanism   Catholicism With around 2 2 billion adherents  18  19  20  split into 3 main branches of Catholic  Protestant and Orthodox  Christianity is the world s largest religion  156  The Christian share of the world s population has stood at around 33 per cent for the last hundred years  which says that one in three persons on earth are Christians  This masks a major shift in the demographics of Christianity  large increases in the developing world  around 23 000 per day  have been accompanied by substantial declines in the developed world  mainly in Europe and North America  around 7 600 per day   157  It is still the predominant religion in Europe  the Americas and Southern Africa  In Asia  it is the dominant religion in Georgia  Armenia  East Timor and the Philippines  158  However  it is declining in many areas including the Northern and Western United States  159  Oceania  Australia and New Zealand   northern Europe  including Great Britain  160 Scandinavia and other places   France  Germany  the Canadian provinces of Ontario  British Columbia  and Quebec  and parts of Asia  especially the Middle East  161  162  163 South Korea  164 Taiwan 165  and Macau 166    The Christian population is not decreasing in Brazil  the Southern United States 167  and the province of Alberta  Canada  168  but the percentage is decreasing  In countries such as Australia 169  and New Zealand  170  the Christian population are declining in both numbers and percentage  However  there are many charismatic movements that have become well established over large parts of the world  especially Africa  Latin America and Asia  171  172  173  174  175  A leading Saudi Arabian Muslim leader Sheikh Ahmad al Qatanni reported on Aljazeera that every day 16 000 African Muslims convert to Christianity  He claimed that Islam was losing 6 million African Muslims a year to becoming Christians  176  177  178  179  180  including Muslims in Algeria  181 France  181 India  181 Morocco  181 Russia  181  and Turkey  181  182  It is also reported that Christianity is popular among people of different backgrounds in India  mostly Hindus   183 Malaysia  184 Mongolia  185 Nigeria  186 North Korea  and Vietnam  187  In most countries in the developed world  church attendance among people who continue to identify themselves as Christians has been falling over the last few decades  188  Some sources view this simply as part of a drift away from traditional membership institutions  189  while others link it to signs of a decline in belief in the importance of religion in general  190  Christianity  in one form or another  is the sole state religion of the following nations  Costa Rica  Roman Catholic   191 Denmark  Evangelical Lutheran

Protestantism  28  14 205  There are other Christian groups that do not fit neatly into one of these primary categories  206  The Nicene Creed is  accepted as authoritative by the Roman Catholic  Eastern Orthodox  Anglican  and major Protestant churches   207  There is a diversity of doctrines and practices among groups calling themselves Christian  These groups are sometimes classified under denominations  though for theological reasons many groups reject this classification system  208  Another distinction that is sometimes drawn is between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity

authority in matters of faith  morality and Church governance  209  210  Like the Eastern Orthodox  the Roman Catholic Church through Apostolic succession traces its origins to the Christian community founded by Jesus Christ  211  212  Catholics maintain that the  one  holy  catholic and apostolic church  founded by Jesus subsists fully in the Roman Catholic Church  but also acknowledges other Christian churches and communities 213  214  and works towards reconciliation among all Christians  213  The Catholic faith is detailed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church  215  216  The 2 782 sees 217  are grouped into 23 particular rites  the largest being the Latin Rite  each with distinct traditions regarding the liturgy and the administering the sacraments  218  With more than 1 1 billion baptized members  the Catholic Church is the largest church representing over half of all Christians and one sixth of the world s population  219  220  221  Various smaller communities  such as the Old Catholic and Independent Catholic Churches  include the word Catholic in their title  and share much in common with Roman Catholicism but are no longer in communion with the See of Rome  The Old Catholic Church is in communion with the Anglican Communion  222  223  Orthodox Main articles  Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodoxy See also  Eastern Christianity and List of Orthodox Churches Eastern Orthodoxy comprises those churches in communion with the Patriarchal Sees of the East  such as the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople  224  Like the Roman Catholic Church  the Eastern Orthodox Church also traces its heritage to the foundation of Christianity through Apostolic succession and has an episcopal structure  though the autonomy of the individual  mostly national churches is emphasized  A number of conflicts with Western Christianity over questions of doctrine and authority culminated in the Great Schism  Eastern Orthodoxy is the second largest single denomination in Christianity  with over 200 million adherents  220  Gergeti Trinity Church  Georgia  The Oriental Orthodox Churches  also called Old Oriental Churches  are those eastern churches that recognize the first three ecumenical councils Nicaea  Constantinople and Ephesus but reject the dogmatic definitions of the Council of Chalcedon and instead espouse a Miaphysite christology  The Oriental Orthodox communion comprises six groups  Syriac Orthodox  Coptic Orthodox  Ethiopian Orthodox  Eritrean Orthodox  Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church  India  and Armenian Apostolic churches  225  These six churches  while being in communion with each other are completely independent hierarchically  226  These churches are generally not in communion with Eastern Orthodox Churches with whom they are in dialogue for a return to unity  227  Protestant Main article  Protestantism See also  History of Protestantism In the 16th century  Martin Luther  Huldrych Zwingli  and John Calvin inaugurated what has come to be called Protestantism  Luther s primary theological heirs are known as Lutherans  Zwingli and Calvin s heirs are far broader denominationally  and are broadly referred to as the Reformed Tradition  228  Most Protestant traditions branch out from the Reformed tradition in some way  In addition to the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation  there is Anglicanism after the English Reformation  The Anabaptist tradition was largely ostracized by the other Protestant parties at the time  but has achieved a measure of affirmation in more recent history  Some but not most Baptists prefer not to be called Protestants  claiming a direct ancestral line going back to the apostles in the 1st century  229  Historical chart of the main Protestant branches The oldest Protestant groups separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th century Protestant Reformation  followed in many cases by further divisions  228  For example  the Methodist Church grew out of Anglican minister John Wesley s evangelical and revival movement in the Anglican Church  230  Several Pentecostal and non denominational Churches  which emphasize the cleansing power of the Holy Spirit  in turn grew out of the Methodist Church  231  Because Methodists  Pentecostals  and other evangelicals stress  accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Saviour   232  which comes from John Wesley s emphasis of the New Birth  233  they often refer to themselves as being born again  234  235  Estimates of the total number of Protestants are very uncertain  partly because of the difficulty in determining which denominations should be placed in these categories  but it seems clear that Protestantism is the second largest major group of Christians after Catholicism in number of followers  although the Orthodox Church is larger than any single Protestant denomination   220  A special grouping are the Anglican churches descended from the Church of England and organised in the Anglican Communion  Some Anglican churches consider themselves both Protestant and Catholic  236  Some Anglicans consider their church a branch of the  One Holy Catholic Church  alongside of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches  a concept rejected by the Roman Catholic Church and some Eastern Orthodox  237  238  Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as  Christians  or  born again Christians   They typically distance themselves from the confessionalism and or creedalism of other Christian communities 239  by calling themselves  non denominational   Often founded by individual pastors  they have little affiliation with historic denominations  240  Non Trinitarian Main article  Non Trinitarianism Non Trinitarianism includes all Christian belief systems that reject  wholly or partly  the doctrine of the Trinity  namely  the teaching that God is three distinct yet coeternal and coequal hypostases who are indivisibly united in one essence  241  242  In antiquity  sporadically in the Middle Ages  and again following the Reformation until today  differing views existed concerning the Godhead from those of Trinitarians and the related traditional Christology  Though diverse  these views may be generally classified into those that hold Christ to be only divine and not differing from the Father hypostatically  those that hold Christ to be less fully God than the Father  in other forms being completely human and a messenger as the perfect created human  243  244  Others Main article  Esoteric Christianity Esoteric Christianity is a term which refers to an ensemble of spiritual currents which regard Christianity as a mystery religion  245  246  and profess the existence and possession of certain esoteric doctrines or practices  247  248  hidden from the public but accessible only to a narrow circle of  enlightened    initiated   or highly educated people  249  250  A special characteristic common in these mystical denominations is the belief in reincarnation  citation needed  Some of the esoteric Christian institutions include the Rosicrucian Fellowship  the Anthroposophical Society and the Martinism  The Second Great Awakening  a period of religious revival that occurred in the U S  during the early 1800s  saw the development of a number of unrelated churches  They generally saw themselves as restoring the original church of Jesus Christ rather than reforming one of the existing churches  251  A common belief held by Restorationists was that the other divisions of Christianity had introduced doctrinal defects into Christianity  which was known as the Great Apostasy  252  253  Some of the churches originating during this period are historically connected to early 19th century camp meetings in the Midwest and Upstate New York  American Millennialism and Adventism  which arose from Evangelical Protestantism  influenced the Jehovah s Witnesses movement  with 7 million members   254  and  as a reaction specifically to William Miller  the Seventh day Adventists  Others  including the Christian Church  Disciples of Christ   Evangelical Christian Church in Canada  255  256 Churches of Christ  and the Christian churches and churches of Christ  have their roots in the contemporaneous Stone Campbell Restoration Movement  which was centered in Kentucky and Tennessee  Other groups originating in this time period include the Christadelphians and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  the largest denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement with over 13 million members  257  258  259  260  While the churches originating in the Second Great Awakening have some superficial similarities  their doctrine and practices vary significantly  Cultural Christian Cultural Christian is a broad term used to describe people with either ethnic or religious Christian heritage who may not believe in the religious claims of Christianity  but who retain an affinity for the culture  art  music  and so on related to it  Many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as cultural Christians  due to the predominance of the Christian faith in Western culture  as well as widely celebrated religious holidays such as Easter and Christmas  Another frequent application of the term is to distinguish political groups in areas of mixed religious backgrounds  Ecumenism Main article  Ecumenism The Christian Flag displayed next to the pulpit on the chancel of a church sanctuary  Most churches have long expressed ideals of being reconciled with each other  and in the 20th century Christian ecumenism advanced in two ways  261  One way was greater cooperation between groups  such as the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of Protestants in 1910  the Justice  Peace and Creation Commission of the World Council of Churches founded in 1948 by Protestant and Orthodox churches  and similar national councils like the National Council of Churches in Australia which includes Roman Catholics  261  The other way was institutional union with new United and uniting churches  Congregationalist  Methodist  and Presbyterian churches united in 1925 to form the United Church of Canada  262  and in 1977 to form the Uniting Church in Australia  The Church of South India was formed in 1947 by the union of Anglican  Methodist  Congregationalist  Presbyterian  and Reformed churches  263  Steps towards reconciliation on a global level were taken in 1965 by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches mutually revoking the excommunications that marked their Great Schism in 1054  264  the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission  ARCIC  working towards full communion between those churches since 1970  265  and the Lutheran and Roman Catholic churches signing The Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification in 1999 to address conflicts at the root of the Protestant Reformation  In 2006  the Methodist church adopted the declaration  266  Another example of ecumenism is the invention of and growing usage of the Christian Flag  which was designed to represent all of Christendom  267  The flag has a white field  with a red Latin cross inside a blue canton  267  Criticism of Christianity Main article  Criticism of Christianity Throughout the history of Christianity  many have criticized Christianity  the church  and Christians themselves  Some criticism specifically addresses Christian beliefs  teachings and interpretation of scripture  Several areas of criticism include some claims of scripture itself  ethics of biblical interpretations that have been used historically to justify attitudes and behaviors that are seen by critics as clearly wrong  the question of compatibility with science  and certain Christian doctrines that some find unsettling or unreasonable  See also Christianity portal Religion portal Spirituality portal Book  Abrahamic religions Book  Christianity

of Christ   The name was given by the non Jewish inhabitants of Antioch  probably in derision  to the disciples of Jesus  In the New Testament the names by which the disciples were known among
