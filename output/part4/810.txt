Iran and the United States where 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days from November 4  1979 to January 20  1981  after a group of Islamist students and militants took over the American Embassy in Tehran in support of the Iranian Revolution  1  President Carter called the hostages  victims of terrorism and anarchy   adding that the  United States will not yield to blackmail   2  The episode reached a climax when  after failed attempts to negotiate a release  the United States military attempted a rescue operation  Operation Eagle Claw  on April 24  1980  which resulted in a failed mission  the deaths of eight American servicemen  one Iranian civilian  and the destruction of two aircraft  It ended with the signing of the Algiers Accords in Algeria on January 19  1981  The hostages were formally released into United States custody the following day  just minutes after the new American president Ronald Reagan was sworn into office  The crisis has been described as an entanglement of  vengeance and mutual incomprehension   3  In Iran  the hostage taking was widely seen as a blow against the U S  and its influence in Iran  its perceived attempts to undermine the Iranian Revolution  and its long standing support of the Shah of Iran  recently overthrown by the revolution  The Shah had been restored to power in a 1953 coup organized by the CIA at the American Embassy against a democratically elected nationalist Iranian government  4  and had recently been allowed into the United States for medical treatment  In the United States  the hostage taking was seen as an outrage violating a centuries old principle of international law granting diplomats immunity from arrest and diplomatic compounds are considered inviolable  5  The crisis has also been described as the  pivotal episode  in the history of Iran   United States relations  6  In the U S   some political analysts believe the crisis was a major reason for U S  President Jimmy Carter s defeat in the November 1980 presidential election  7  In Iran  the crisis strengthened the prestige of the Ayatollah Khomeini and the political power of those who supported theocracy and opposed any normalization of relations with the West  8  The crisis also marked the beginning of U S  legal action  or economic sanctions against Iran  that further weakened economic ties between Iran and the United States  9  Contents 1 Start 1 1 1953 coup 1 2 Carter administration 2 Planning 2 1 Takeover 2 2 Hostage holding motivations 3 444 days hostage 3 1 Hostage conditions 3 2 Impact in America 3 3

Mohammad Reza Pahlavi  the Shah of Iran  had been overthrown in a revolution  For several decades before that  the United States had been an ally and backer of the Shah  During World War II  Allied powers Britain and the Soviet Union occupied Iran and required Reza Shah the existing Shah of Iran to abdicate in favor of his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi  10  The invasion was allegedly in fear that Reza Shah was about to align his petroleum rich country with Nazi Germany during the war  However  Reza Shah s earlier Declaration of Neutrality and refusal to allow Iranian territory to be used to train  supply  and act as a transport corridor to ship arms to Russia for its war effort against Germany  was the strongest motive for the allied invasion of Iran  Because of its importance in the allied victory  Iran was subsequently called  The Bridge of Victory  by Winston Churchill  11  By the 1950s  the Shah was engaged in a power struggle with Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq  an immediate descendant of the previous monarchy  the Qajar dynasty  In 1953  the British and U S  spy agencies deposed the democratically elected government of Mossadegh in a military coup d  tat codenamed Operation Ajax  and restored the Shah as an absolute monarch  12  13  14  The anti democratic coup d  tat was a  a critical event in post war world history  that replaced Iran s post monarchic  native  and secular parliamentary democracy with an absolute monarchy  15  US support and funding continued after the coup  with the CIA training the government s secret police  SAVAK  In subsequent decades this foreign intervention  along with other economic  cultural and political issues  united opposition against the Shah and led to his overthrow  16  17  18   edit  Carter administration Shortly before the revolution on New Year s Day 1979  American president Jimmy Carter further angered anti Shah Iranians with a televised toast to the Shah  declaring how beloved the Shah was by his people  After the revolution in February  the embassy had been occupied and staff held hostage briefly  Rocks and bullets had broken enough of the embassy front facing windows for them to be replaced with bullet proof glass  Its staff was reduced to just over 60 from a high of nearly 1000 earlier in the decade  19  The Carter administration attempted to mitigate the anti American feeling by finding a new relationship with the de facto Iranian government and by continuing military cooperation in hopes that the situation would stabilize  However  on October 22  1979 the U S  permitted the Shah   who was ill with cancer   to attend the Mayo Clinic for medical treatment  The American embassy in Tehran had discouraged the request  understanding the political delicacy  20  but after pressure from influential figures including former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Council on Foreign Relations chairman David Rockefeller  the Carter administration decided to grant the Shah s request  21  22  23  The Shah s admission to the US intensified Iranian revolutionaries  anti Americanism and spawned rumors of another U S  backed coup and re installation of the Shah  24  Revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini   who had been exiled by the Shah for 15 years   heightened rhetoric against the  Great Satan   the United States  talking of what he called  evidence of American plotting   25   You have no right to complain  because you took our whole country hostage in 1953   24  In addition to putting an end to what they believed was American plotting and sabotage against the revolution  the hostage takers hoped to depose the provisional revolutionary government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan which they believed was plotting to normalize relations with the United States and extinguish Islamic revolutionary ardor in Iran  26  A later study found that there had been no plots for the overthrow of the revolutionaries by the United States  and that a CIA intelligence gathering mission at the embassy was  notably ineffectual  gathering little information and hampered by the fact that none of the three officers spoke the local language  Persian   Its work was  routine  prudent espionage conducted at diplomatic missions everywhere   27   edit  Planning The seizure of the American embassy was initially planned in September 1979 by Ebrahim Asgharzadeh  a student at that time  He consulted with the heads of the Islamic associations of Tehran s main universities  including the University of Tehran  Sharif University of Technology  Amirkabir University of Technology  Polytechnic of Tehran  and Iran University of Science and Technology  Their group was named Muslim Student Followers of the Imam s Line  Asgharzadeh later said there were five students at the first meeting  two of whom  including current Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad   although this claim has been denied by the Iranian government   the Iranian opposition as well as a CIA investigation on the matter  wanted to target the Soviet embassy because the USSR was  a Marxist and anti God regime   But two others  Mirdamadi and Habibolah Bitaraf  supported Asgharzadeh s chosen target   the United States   Our aim was to object against the American government by going to their embassy and occupying it for several hours   Asgharzadeh said   Announcing our objections from within the occupied compound would carry our message to the world in a much more firm and effective way   28  Mirdamadi told an interviewer   we intended to detain the diplomats for a few days  maybe one week  but no more   29 Masoumeh Ebtekar  spokeswoman for the Iranian students during the crisis  said that those who rejected Asgharzadeh s plan did not participate in the subsequent events  30  The Islamist students observed the security procedures of the Marine Security Guards from nearby rooftops overlooking the embassy  They also used experiences from the recent revolution  during which the U S  embassy grounds were briefly occupied  They enlisted the support of police in charge of guarding the embassy and of Islamic Revolutionary Guards  31  According to the group and other sources Khomeini did not know of the plan beforehand  32  The Islamist students had wanted to inform him but according to author Mark Bowden  Ayatollah Musavi Khoeyniha persuaded them not to  Khoeyniha feared the government would use police to expel the Islamist students as they had the last occupiers in February  The provisional government had been appointed by Khomeini and so Khomeini was likely to go along with their request to restore order  On the other hand  Khoeyniha knew that if Khomeini first saw that the occupiers were his faithful supporters  unlike the leftists in the first occupation  and that large numbers of pious Muslims had gathered outside the embassy to show their support for the takeover  it would be  very hard  perhaps even impossible   for the Imam Khomeini to oppose the takeover  and this would paralyze the Bazargan administration Khoeyniha and the students wanted to eliminate  33   edit  Takeover Around 6 30 a m  on November 4  the ringleaders gathered between 300 and 500 selected students  thereafter known as Muslim Student Followers of the Imam s Line  and briefed them on the battle plan  A female student was given a pair of metal cutters to break the chains locking the embassy s gates  and she hid them beneath her chador  34  At first the students  plan to only make a symbolic occupation  release statements to the press and leave when government security forces came to restore order  was reflected in placards saying  Don t be afraid  We just want to set in   When the embassy guards brandished firearms  the protesters retreated  one telling the Americans   We don t mean any harm   35  But as it became clear the guards would not use deadly force and that a large angry crowd had gathered outside the compound to cheer the occupiers and jeer the hostages  the occupation changed  36  According to one embassy staff member  buses full of demonstrators began to appear outside the embassy shortly after the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam s Line broke through the gates  37  As Ayatollah Musavi Khoeyniha had hoped  Khomeini supported the takeover  According to Foreign Minister Ebrahim Yazdi  when he  Yazdi came to Qom to tell the Imam about the incident  Khomeini told the minister to  go and kick them out   But later that evening  back in Tehran  the minister heard on the radio that Imam Khomeini had issued a statement supporting the seizure and calling it  the second revolution   and the embassy an  American spy den in Tehran   38  The occupiers bound and blindfolded the embassy Marines and staff and paraded them in front of photographers  In the first couple of days many of the embassy staff who had snuck out of the compound or not been there at the time of the takeover were rounded up by Islamists and returned as hostages  39  Six American diplomats did however avoid capture and found refuge at the nearby Canadian and Swiss embassies in Tehran for three months  Canadian caper   They fled Iran using Canadian passports on January 28  1980  40   edit  Hostage holding motivations The Muslim Student Followers of the Imam s Line demanded that the Shah return to Iran for trial and execution  The U S  maintained that the Shah  who died less than a year later in July 1980  had come to America only for medical attention  The group s other demands included that the U S  government apologize for its interference in the internal affairs of Iran  for the overthrow of Prime Minister Mossadeq  in 1953   and that Iran s frozen assets in the U S  be released  Hostage Barry Rosen  age 34 The initial takeover plan was to hold the embassy for only a short time  but this changed after it became apparent how popular the takeover was and that Khomeini had given it his full support  37  Some attribute the Iranian decision not to release the hostages quickly to U S  President Jimmy Carter s  blinking  or failure to immediately deliver an ultimatum to Iran  41  His immediate response was to appeal for the release of the hostages on humanitarian grounds and to share his hopes of a strategic anti communist alliance with the Islamic Republic  42  As some of the student leaders had hoped  Iran s moderate prime minister Mehdi Bazargan and his cabinet resigned under pressure just days after the event  The duration of the hostages  captivity has been blamed on internal Iranian revolutionary politics  As Ayatollah Khomeini told Iran s president  This action has many benefits      This has united our people  Our opponents do not dare act against us  We can put the constitution to the people s vote without difficulty  and carry out presidential and parliamentary elections  43  Theocratic Islamists  as well as leftist political groups and figures like leftist People s Mujahedin of Iran  44  supported the taking of American hostages as an attack on  American imperialism  and its alleged Iranian  tools of the West   Revolutionary teams displayed secret documents purportedly taken from the embassy  sometimes painstakingly reconstructed after shredding  45  to buttress their claim that  the Great Satan   the U S   was trying to destabilize the new regime  and that Iranian moderates were in league with the U S  The documents were published in a series of books called  Documents from the US Espionage Den   Persian                              These books included telegrams  correspondence  and reports from the U S  State Department and Central Intelligence Agency  A group photograph of the former hostages in the hospital  The 52 hostages are spending a few days in the hospital after their release from Iran prior to their departure for the United States  By embracing the hostage taking under the slogan  America can t do a thing   Khomeini rallied support and deflected criticism from his controversial Islamic theocratic constitution  46  which was due for a referendum vote in less than one month  47  Following the successful referendum  both leftists and theocrats continued to use the issue of alleged pro Americanism to suppress their opponents  the relatively moderate political forces  which included the Iranian Freedom Movement  National Front  Grand Ayatollah Shari atmadari  48  and later President Abolhassan Banisadr  In particular  carefully selected diplomatic dispatches and reports discovered at the embassy and released by the hostage takers led to the disempowerment and resignations of moderate figures 49  such as Premier Mehdi Bazargan  The political danger in Iran of any move seen as accommodating America  along with the failed rescue attempt  delayed a negotiated release  After the hostages were released  leftists and theocrats turned on each other  with the stronger theocratic group annihilating the

released 13 women and black people in the middle of November 1979  claiming they were sympathetic to  oppressed minorities   One more hostage  a white man named Richard Queen  was released in July 1980 after he became seriously ill with what was later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis  The remaining 52 hostages were held captive until January 1981  a total of 444 days of captivity  The hostages initially were held in buildings at the embassy  but after the failed rescue mission they were scattered to different locations around Iran to make rescue impossible  Three high level officials   Bruce Laingen  Victor Tomseth and Mike Howland   were at the Foreign ministry at the time of the takeover  They stayed there for some months  sleeping in the ministry s formal dining room and washing their socks and underwear in the bathroom  They were first treated as diplomats but after the provisional government fell relations deteriorated and by March the doors to their living space were kept  chained and padlocked   50  By midsummer 1980 the Iranians moved the hostages to prisons in Tehran 51  to prevent either escape or rescue attempts and to improve the logistics of guard shifts and food delivery  52  The final holding area  from Nov  1980 until their release  was the Teymour Bakhtiari mansion in Tehran  where the hostages were finally provided tubs  showers and hot and cold running water  53  Several foreign diplomats and ambassadors   including Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor prior to the Canadian Caper   came to visit the hostages over the course of the crisis  relaying information back to the US government   including the  Laingen dispatches   made by hostage Bruce Laingen   to help the home country stay in contact  Iranian propaganda stated that the hostages were  guests  treated with respect  Ibrahim Asgharzadeh described the original hostage taking plan as a  nonviolent  and symbolic action where the  gentle and respectful treatment  of the hostages would dramatize to the whole world the offended sovereignty and dignity of Iran  54  In America  an Iranian charg  d affaires  Ali Agha  stormed out of meeting with an American official  exclaiming  We are not mistreating the hostages  They are being very well taken care of in Tehran  They are our guests    55  In Iran one guard told several hostages  We want you to feel that you are our guests   and complained that use of the word  guard  was  too cruel   56  Visiting Iranian officials asked hostages  What can I do for you  We want to make you more comfortable   57  and told another surprised hostage that they  the hostages  should be grateful that Iran was protecting them from attempts by the US government to kill them  58  The actual treatment of the hostages was far different from that purported in Iranian propaganda  the hostages described beatings  59  theft  60  the fear of bodily harm while being paraded blindfold before a large  angry chanting crowd outside the embassy  Bill Belk and Kathryn Koob   61  having their hands bound  day and night  for days 62  or even weeks  63  long periods of solitary confinement 64  and months of being forbidden to speak to one another 65  or stand  walk  and leave their space unless they were going to the bathroom  66  In particular they felt the threat of trial and execution  67  as all of the hostages  were threatened repeatedly with execution  and took it seriously   68  The hostage takers played Russian Roulette with their victims  69  The most terrifying night for the hostages came on February 5  1980  when guards in black ski masks rousted the 52 hostages from their sleep and led them blindfolded to other rooms  They were searched after being ordered to strip themselves until they were bare  including woman  and to keep their hands up  They were then told to kneel down   This was the most terrifying moment  as one hostage said  They were still wearing the blindfolds  so naturally  they terrified even further  One of the hostages later recalled   It was an embarrassing moment  However  we were to scared to realize it   The mock execution ended after the guards cocked their weapons and readied them to fire but finally ejected their rounds and told the prisoners to wear their clothes again  The hostages were later told the exercise was  just a joke  and something the guards  had wanted to do   However  this effected a lot of the hostages long after   70  Michael Metrinko was kept in solitary confinement for months  On two occasions when he expressed his opinion of Ayatollah Khomeini and he was punished especially severely in relation to the ordinary mistreatment of the hostages   the first time being kept in handcuffs for 24 hours a day for two weeks  71  and being beaten and kept alone in a freezing cell for two weeks with a diet of bread and water the second time  72  One hostage  Army medic Donald Hohman  went on a hunger strike for several weeks 73  and two are thought to have attempted suicide  Steve Lauterbach became despondent  broke a water glass and slashed his wrists after being locked in a dark basement room of the chancery with his hand tightly bound and aching badly  He was found by guards  rushed to the hospital and patched up  74  Jerry Miele  an introverted CIA communicator technician  smashed his head into the corner of a door  knocking himself unconscious and cutting a deep gash from which blood poured   Naturally withdrawn   and looking  ill  old  tired  and vulnerable  Miele had become the butt of his guards  jokes who rigged up a mock electric chair with wires to emphasize the fate that awaited him  After his fellow hostages applied first aid and raised alarm  he was taken to a hospital after a long delay created by the guards  75

sending pieces of him to your wife    David Roeder  78  Four different hostages attempted to escape 79  all being punished with stretches of solitary confinement when their attempt was discovered  The hostage released for multiple sclerosis  Richard Queen  first developed symptoms  dizziness and numbness in his arm  six months before his release  80  It was misdiagnosed by Iranians first as a reaction to draft of cold air  and after warmer confinement didn t help as  it s nothing  it s nothing   the symptoms of which would soon disappear  81  Over the months the symptoms spread to his right side and worsened until Queen  was literally flat on his back unable to move without growing dizzy and throwing up   82  The cruelty of the Iranians became  a form of slow torture   83  Guards would often withhold mail from home  telling one hostage  Charles W  Scott   I don t see anything for you  Mr  Scott  Are you sure your wife has not found another man   84  and hostages  possessions went missing  85  As the hostages were taken to the plane that would fly them out of Tehran  they were led through a gauntlet of students forming parallel lines and shouting  Margbar Amrika    death to America  86  When the pilot announced they were out of Iran the  freed hostages went wild with happiness  Shouting  cheering  crying  clapping  falling into one another s arms   87   edit  Impact in America A heckler in Washington  D C  leans across a police line toward a demonstration of Iranians during the Iran hostage crisis  August 1980  In the United States  the hostage taking is said to have created  a surge of patriotism  and left  the American people more united than they have been on any issue in two decades   88  The action was seen  not just as a diplomatic affront   but as a  declaration of war on diplomacy itself   5  Television news gave daily updates  89  The respected CBS Evening News anchor  Walter Cronkite  began ending each show in January 1980 by saying how many days the hostage had been captive  90  President Carter applied economic and diplomatic pressure on Iran  oil imports from Iran were ended on November 12  1979  and through the issuance of Executive Order 12170  around US 8 billion of Iranian assets in the U S  were frozen by the Office of Foreign Assets Control on November 14  During the weeks leading up to Christmas in 1979  high school students created Christmas cards that were delivered to the hostages in Iran  3  This was then replicated by community groups across the country  resulting in bales of Christmas cards delivered to the hostages  The White House Christmas Tree that year was left dark except for the top star  A severe backlash against Iranians in the US developed  One Iranian later complained   I had to hide my Iranian identity not to get beaten up  even at university   91  Many Iranians in the U S  were also expelled  citation needed  According to author journalist Mark Bowden  a pattern developed in President Carter s attempts to negotiate a release of the hostages  Carter would latch on to a deal proffered by a top Iranian official and grant minor but humiliating concessions  only to have it scotched at the last minute by Khomeini  92   edit  Canadian rescue of hostages Main article  Canadian Caper On the day the hostages were seized  six American diplomats evaded capture and remained in hiding at the Swiss and Canadian embassies  In 1979  the Canadian Parliament held a secret session for the first time since World War II in order to pass special legislation allowing Canadian passports to be issued to some American citizens so that they could escape  The six American diplomats boarded a flight to Z rich  Switzerland  on January 28  1980  Their escape and rescue from Iran by Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor has come to be known as the  Canadian Caper   93   edit  Negotiations for release Anticipating the takeover of the embassy  the Americans attempted to destroy classified documents with a burn furnace  The furnace malfunctioned and the staff was forced to use cheap paper shredders  94  95  Skilled carpet weaver women were later employed to reconstruct the documents  96  In 1979  Boxer Muhammad Ali  a devout Muslim  offered to go to Iran in exchange for a couple of hostages  however  this was denied by the Iranian authorities  The first attempt to negotiate a release of the hostages involved Hector Villalon and Christian Bourget  representing Iranian Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh  They  delivered a formal request to Panama for extradition of the Shah  which was  a pretext to cover secret negotiations to free the American hostages   This happened as the Soviets invaded Iran s neighbor Afghanistan  an event America hoped would  illustrate the threat  of its superpower neighbor and need for better relations with the Soviet s enemy  America  Ghotbzadeh himself was eager to end the hostage taking  as  moderates  were being eliminated from the Iranian government one by one after being exposed by the student hostage takers as  traitors  and  spies  for having met at some time with an American official  97  Carter aide Hamilton Jordan flew to Paris  wearing a disguise   a wig  false mustache and glasses  to meet with Ghotbzadeh  After  weeks of negotiation with     emissaries      a complex multi stepped plan  was  hammered out  that included the establishment of an international commission to study America s role in Iran  98  Rumours of a release leaked to the American public and on February 19  1980  the American Vice President Walter Mondale told an interviewer that  the crisis was nearing an end   The plan fell apart however after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech praising the embassy occupation as  a crushing blow to the world devouring USA  and announced the fate of the hostages would be decided by the parliament  Majlis   which had yet to be seated or even elected  99  When the six man international UN commission came to Iran they were not allowed to see the hostages  100  and President Abolhassan Banisadr retreated from his criticism of the hostage takers  praising them as  young patriots   101  The next unsuccessful attempt occurred in April and called first for the American president Carter to publicly promise not to  impose additional sanctions  on Iran  In exchange custody of the hostages would be transferred to the government of Iran  which after a short period would release the hostages   the Iranian president and foreign minister both opposing the continued holding of the hostages  To the American s surprise and disappointment  after Carter made his promise  President Bani Sadr added additional demands  official American approval of resolution of the hostage question by Iran s parliament  which would leave the hostages in Tehran for another month or two   and a promise by Carter to refrain from making  hostile statements   Carter also agreed to these demands  but again Khomeini vetoed the plan  At this point Bani Sadr announced he was  washing his hands of the hostage mess   102  The death of the Shah on July 27 and the invasion of Iran by Iraq in September 1980 may have made Iran more receptive to the idea of resolving the hostage crisis  Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the November 1980 presidential election but Carter continued to attempt to negotiate the release of the hostages through Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher  Algerian intermediaries and members of the Iranian government in the final days of his presidency  Talks that finally succeeded in bringing a release began secretly in September 1980 and were initiated by Sadegh Tabatabai  a brother in law of Khomeini s son Ahmad and  a mid level official  in the former provisional revolutionary government  By this time resolution of the crisis was made easier by the fact that two of the hostage takers demands were met   the Shah was dead and  most  of his wealth had been  removed from American banks    while the threat of war with Iraq made availability of American made military spare parts for Iran s materiel important  Iranian demands for the release were now four  expression of remorse or an apology for the US historical role in Iran  unlocking of  Iranian assets in America and withdraw any legal claims against Iran arising from the embassy seizure  and promise not to interfere in the future   The demands were listed at the end of a speech by Khomeini considered  a major shift on Iran s side of the impasse  by journalists  103  Tabatabai  and Ahmad Khomeini secured the support of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani  the speaker of the Majlis  The talks hammered out an agreement to bring to their higher ups  with the US agreeing to three demands but not to an apology  104  Talks were stalled first by Iraq s invasion of Iran which Iranian officialdom blamed on the United States  Rafsanjani delivered a vote in parliament in favor of releasing the hostages  Then negotiations began over how much money US businesses owed Iran   Iran believing the sum to be  20 to  60 billion and the United States estimating it at  closer to  20 to 60 million   105    and how much Iran owed US businesses  106  Negotiations continued through the American elections  which President Carter lost  with pressure being added by President Elect Ronald Reagan s talk of not paying  ransom for people who have been kidnapped by barbarians   105  and a New Years Day threat from Radio Tehran that if the US did not accept Iran s demands the hostages would be tried as spies and executed  107  On November 2  the Iranian parliament finally set forth formal conditions for the hostages  release and eight days later Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived in Algiers with the first US reply setting off a slow motion diplomatic shuffle between Washington  Algiers and Tehran  108  Algeria mediated between the U S  and Iran  In the final stages of the negotiations in Algiers  the chief Algerian mediator was the Foreign Affairs Minister Mohammed Benyahia who interacted primarily with Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher from the U S  side  109  Former Algerian ambassador to the U S  Abdulkarim Ghuraib also participated in the negotiations  citation needed  The negotiations resulted in the  Algiers Accords  110  of January 19  1981  The Algiers Accords called for Iran s immediate freeing of the hostages  the unfreezing of  7 9 billion of Iranian assets and immunity from lawsuits Iran might have faced in America  and a pledge by the United States that  it is and from now on will be the policy of the United States not to intervene  directly or indirectly  politically or militarily  in Iran s internal affairs   The Accords also created the Iran   United States Claims Tribunal  http   www iusct org    and Iran deposited 1 billion dollars in an escrow account to satisfy claims adjudicated by the Tribunal in favor of American businesses which had lost assets after the hostage takeover  The Tribunal closed to new claims by private individuals on January 19  1982  In total  it received approximately 4 700 private US claims  The Tribunal has ordered payments by Iran to US nationals totaling over USD 2 5 billion  Almost all private claims have now been resolved  but several intergovernmental claims are still before the Tribunal  The hostages were released on the day President Carter s term ended  While Carter had an  obsession  with finishing the matter before stepping down  the hostage takers are thought to have wanted the release delayed as punishment for his perceived support for the Shah  111  Iranians insisted on payment in gold rather than US dollars so the U S  government transferred 50 tonnes of gold to Iran while simultaneously taking ownership of an equivalent quantity of Iranian gold that had been frozen at the New York Federal Reserve Bank  112   edit  Rescue attempts Further information

Desert One  Its crew was seen and retrieved by another helicopter that continued to Desert One  The helicopters maintained strict radio silence under orders for the entire flight  an issue which impacted their ability to maintain a cohesive flying unit while en route  as they all arrived separately and behind schedule  The strict radio silence also prevented them from requesting permission to fly above the sandstorm as the C 130s had done  and they flew the entire route at hazardous low levels  even while inside the sandstorm and with limited field of vision and erratic instrumentation  The mission plan called for a minimum of six helicopters but of the six that made it to Desert One  one had a failed primary hydraulics system and had flown on the secondary hydraulics system for the previous four hours  The failing helicopter s crew wanted to continue  but due to the increased risk of not having a backup hydraulic system during flight  the helicopter squadron s commander decided to ground the helicopter  The commander of the operation  Col  Beckwith  then recommended the mission be aborted and his recommendation was approved by President Carter  As the helicopters repositioned themselves for refueling  one helicopter ran into a C 130 tanker aircraft and crashed  killing eight U S  servicemen and injuring several more  After the mission and its failure were made known publicly Khomeini s prestige skyrocketed in Iran as he credited divine intervention on behalf of Islam for the result  113  Iranian officials who favored release of the hostages  such as President Bani Sadr  were weakened  In America  President Carter s political popularity and prospects for being reelected in 1980 were further damaged after a television address on April 25  in which he explained the rescue operation  A second rescue attempt that was planned but never attempted used highly modified YMC 130H Hercules aircraft  Outfitted with rocket thrusters fore and aft to allow an extremely short landing and takeoff in the Shahid Shiroudi soccer stadium located close to the embassy  three aircraft were modified under a rushed super secret program known as Operation Credible Sport  One aircraft crashed during a demonstration at Duke Field at Eglin Air Force Base Auxiliary Field 3 on October 29  1980  when its landing braking rockets were fired too soon  The misfire caused a hard touchdown that tore off the starboard wing and started a fire  all on board survived  The impending change in the White House following the November election led to an abandonment of this project  The two surviving airframes were returned to regular duty with the rocket packages removed  One is on display at the Museum of Aviation located next to Robins Air Force Base in Georgia  The aforementioned failed rescue attempt led to the creation of the 160th S O A R   a helicopter aviation special forces group in the United States Army and the United States Special Operations Command

challenged and removed   January 2008  Relatively little happened during the summer  as Iranian internal politics took its course  In early July  the Iranians released hostage Richard Queen  who had developed multiple sclerosis  In the States  constant media coverage yellow ribbons  footage of chanting Iranian mobs  even a whole new television news program  ABC s Nightline provided a dispiriting backdrop to the presidential election season  As Carter advisor and biographer Peter Bourne put it   Because people felt that Carter had not been tough enough in foreign policy  this kind of symbolized for them that some bunch of students could seize American diplomatic officials and hold them prisoner and thumb their nose at the United States   Finally  in September  Khomeini s government decided it was time to end the matter  There was little more advantage to be gained from further anti American  anti Shah propaganda  and the ongoing sanctions were making it harder to straighten out an already chaotic economy  Despite rumors that Carter might pull out an  October Surprise  and get the hostages home before the election  negotiations dragged on for months  even after Republican Ronald Reagan s landslide victory in November  114  After months of negotiations the United States had agreed to release several billion dollars in Iranian gold and bank assets  frozen in American banks just after the seizure of the embassy  The government of Iran  now involved in a war with neighboring Iraq  was desperate for money and therefore seemed willing to release the hostages  The Iranians refused to communicate directly with the president  or any other American  so Algeria had agreed to act as an intermediary  This arrangement slowed down the negotiating process  As Carter recalled   The Iranians  who spoke Persian  would talk only with the Algerians  who spoke French  Any question or proposal of mine had to be translated twice as it went from Washington to Algiers to Tehran  and then the answers and counter proposals had to come back to me over the same slow route   Much of the money involved was being held in overseas branches of twelve American banks  so Carter  his cabinet  and staff were constantly on the phone to London  Istanbul  Bonn  and other world capitals to work out the financial details  A series of small crises slowed down the process  Lloyd Cutler  one of the White House attorneys  told the president there was a delay in the transfer of assets  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York did not have its part of the money  so funds were shifted among the reserve banks  Another difficulty concerned the time difference between Washington and Tehran  Because of the war with Iraq  the Iranian officials had blackouts of airport lights  This meant that once it got dark in Iran  about 9 30 a m  Washington time   even if the deal had been sealed  the Algerian pilots would not take off until dawn  Thus  if the departure time passed  everyone understood that it would be another eight to ten hours before anything could happen  That morning  word came to Carter that the planes were on the runway in Tehran  and the hostages had been taken to the vicinity of the airport  At 4 44 a m  Carter went to the press briefing room to announce that with the help of Algeria the United States and Iran had reached an agreement  but was halted because the Algerian negotiator sent word that the Iranian bank officials did not agree with the terms of accountability in the banking agreements  so the planes were returned to their standby position  The staff soon understood that Carter s trip to Germany to greet hostages would not occur until after the inauguration  At 6 35 a m   Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher informed Carter that   All escrows were signed at 6 18  The Bank of England has certified that they hold  7 977 billion  the correct amount   At 8 04 a m   Algeria confirmed that the bank certification was complete  and the Algerians were notifying Iran  At 9 45 a m   Christopher told Carter take off would be by noon  but  as a security measure  the Iranian officials did not want the word released until the hostages were out of Iranian airspace  President Carter said the United States would comply  115  On January 20  1981  at the moment Reagan completed his 20 minute inaugural address after being sworn in as President  the 52 American hostages were released by Iran into U S  custody  having spent 444 days in captivity  116  117  The hostages were flown to Algeria as a symbolic gesture for the help of that government in resolving the crisis  The flight continued to Rhein Main Air Base in West Germany and on to Wiesbaden USAF Hospital  where former President Carter  acting as emissary  received them  After medical check ups and debriefings  they took a second flight to Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh  New York  with a refueling stop in Shannon  Ireland  where they were greeted by a large crowd  From Newburgh they traveled by bus to the United States Military Academy  and stayed at the Thayer Hotel at West Point for three days receiving a heroes  welcome all along the route  Ten days after their release  the former hostages were given a ticker tape parade through the Canyon of Heroes in New York City   edit  Aftermath  edit  Iran Iraq War The Iraq invasion of Iran occurred less than a year after the embassy employees were taken hostage  At least one observer  Stephen Kinzer  believes the dramatic change of US Iranian relations from ally to enemy played a part in emboldening Saddam Hussein to invade  and US anger with Iran led the US to aid Iraq after the war turned against Iraq  The US supplied Iraq with  among other things   helicopters and satellite intelligence that was used in selecting bombing targets   118  In turn  this aid and the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 in the Persian Gulf by the US Navy Cruiser USS Vincennes in 1988  deepened and widened anti American feeling in Iran   119   edit  Iran After the Iranian hostage crisis  1979 1981   the walls of the former US embassy in Tehran were covered in mostly anti US murals  The hostage taking was unsuccessful for the Islamic Republic in some respects  Iran lost international support for its war against Iraq  and the settlement was considered almost wholly favorable to the United States since it did not meet any of Iran s original demands  120  But the crisis strengthened Iranians who supported the hostage taking  Anti Americanism became even more intense  and anti American rhetoric continued unabated  121  Politicians such as Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha and Behzad Nabavi 122  were left in a stronger position  while those associated or accused of association with America were removed from the political picture  Khomeini biographer Baqer Moin describes the incident as  a watershed in Khomeini s life  transforming him from a  cautious  pragmatic politician  into  a modern revolutionary  single mindedly pursing a dogma   In his statements   imperialism  liberalism  democracy  were  negative words   while  revolution     became a sacred word  sometimes more important than Islam   123  Some have suggested that the greatest benefit of the take over of the American embassy was the acquisition of intelligence information contained within the embassy  including the identity of informants to the US government  which the new Islamic republic could use to remove potential dissenters and consolidate its gains and stabilize its place  Iranian government commemorates the event every year by demonstration at the embassy and burning US flag but on November 4  2009  when pro democracy protesters and reformists demonstrated in the streets of Tehran  despite Iranian government authorities encouraging people to chant  Death to America   protesters instead chanted  Death to the Dictator   referring to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei  and other anti government slogans  124  On 29 November 2011 groups of students stormed the British embassy in Tehran in a scene reminiscent of this storming of the American embassy  125   edit  United States In the United States  gifts were showered upon the hostages upon their return  including lifetime passes to any minor league or Major League Baseball game  126  In 2000  the hostages and their families tried to sue Iran  unsuccessfully  under the Antiterrorism Act  They originally won the case when Iran failed to provide a defense  but the U S  State Department tried to put an end to the suit  fearing that it would make international relations difficult  As a result  a federal judge ruled that nothing could be done to repay the damages the hostages faced because of the agreement the U S  made when the hostages were freed  citation needed  The US embassy building is used by Iran s government and its affiliated groups  Since 2001  the building serves as a museum to the revolution  Outside the door stand a bronze model based on New York s Statue of Liberty on one side and a statue portraying one of the hostages on the other  127  The Guardian reported in 2006 that a group called The Committee for the Commemoration of Martyrs of the Global Islamic Campaign used the US embassy to recruit  martyrdom seekers   volunteers to carry out operations against Western and Jewish targets  Mohammad Samadi  a spokesman for the group  signed up several hundred volunteers in a few days  128   edit  Hostages November 4  1979   January 20  1981  66 original captives  63 taken at the Embassy
