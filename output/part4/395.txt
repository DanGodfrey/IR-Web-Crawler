Eye is a fortnightly British satirical and current affairs magazine  edited by Ian Hislop  Since its first publication in 1961  Private Eye has been a prominent critic and lampooner of public figures and entities that it deemed guilty of any of the sins of incompetence  inefficiency  corruption  pomposity or self importance and it has become a self styled  thorn in the side  of the British establishment  It has always received criticism from some quarters for its irreverent style and for its willingness to print stories that are controversial and allegedly defamatory  This was reflected in the past by the large number of libel lawsuits against it  a phenomenon for which it became notorious  As Britain s best selling current affairs magazine  2  such is its long term popularity and impact that many recurring in jokes from Private Eye have entered popular culture  Contents 1 History 2 Nature of the magazine 2 1 Unearthing scandals and breaking news 2 2 Recurring in jokes 2 3

Ingrams  Willie Rushton  Christopher Booker and Paul Foot at Shrewsbury School in the mid 1950s  After their National Service  Ingrams and Foot went as undergraduates to Oxford University  where they met their future collaborators Peter Usborne  Andrew Osmond  3 John Wells and Danae Brook  among others  The magazine proper began when Peter Usborne learned of a new printing process  photo litho offset  which meant that anybody with a typewriter and Letraset could produce a magazine  The publication was initially funded by Osmond and was launched in 1961  It was named when Andrew Osmond looked for ideas in the famous recruiting poster of Lord Kitchener  an image of Kitchener pointing with the caption  Wants You   and  in particular  the pointing finger  After the name Finger was rejected  Osmond suggested Private Eye  in the sense of someone who  fingers  a suspect  The magazine was initially edited by Christopher Booker and designed by Willie Rushton  who also drew cartoons for it  Its later editor Richard Ingrams  who was then pursuing a career as an actor  shared the editorship with Booker  from around issue 10  and took over fully at issue 40  At first Private Eye was merely a vehicle for silly jokes  an extension of the original school magazine  and an alternative to Punch  However  according to Booker  it simply got  caught up in the rage for satire   After the magazine s initial success  more funding was provided by Nicholas Luard and Peter Cook  who ran The Establishment   a satirical nightclub   and Private Eye became a fully professional publication  Others essential to the development of the magazine were Auberon Waugh  Claud Cockburn  who had run a pre war scandal sheet  The Week   Barry Fantoni  Gerald Scarfe  Tony Rushton  Patrick Marnham and Candida Betjeman  Christopher Logue was another long time contributor  providing a column of  True Stories  featuring cuttings from the national press  The gossip columnist Nigel Dempster wrote extensively for the magazine before he fell out with the editor and other writers  and Paul Foot wrote on politics  local government and corruption  Ingrams continued as editor until 1986  when he was succeeded by Ian Hislop  Ingrams is still chairman of the holding company  4   edit  Nature of the magazine Poster produced by a Private Eye reader publicising the appearance of a local councillor in the  Rotten Boroughs  column Private Eye is often seen as specialising in scurrilous gossip and scandal about the misdeeds of the powerful and famous  and has received numerous libel writs  These include three issued by Sir James Goldsmith and several by Robert Maxwell  one of which resulted in costs and reported damages of  225 000 and attacks on the magazine through the publication of a book  Malice in Wonderland  and a magazine  Not Private Eye  published by Maxwell  5  Its defenders point out that it often carries news that the mainstream press will not use for fear of legal reprisals or because it is of minority interest   edit  Unearthing scandals and breaking news Some of the contributors to Private Eye are media figures or specialists in their field who write anonymously  often under humorous pseudonyms  Stories sometimes originate from writers for more mainstream publications who cannot get their stories published by their main employers  A financial column at the back of the magazine   In the City   written by Michael Gillard  has contributed to a wide city and business readership as a large number of financial scandals and unethical business practices and personalities were first exposed there   edit  Recurring in jokes Main article  Recurring in jokes in Private Eye The magazine has a number of recurring in jokes and convoluted references  often comprehensible only to those who have read the magazine for many years  These include references to controversies or legal ambiguities in a subtle euphemistic code  such as replacing  drunk  with  tired and emotional   or using the phrase  Ugandan discussions  to denote illicit sexual exploits  and more obvious parodies utilising easily recognisable stereotypes  such as the lampooning as  Sir Bufton Tufton  of Conservative MPs viewed to be particularly old fashioned and bigoted  Such terms have sometimes fallen into disuse as their hidden meanings have become better known  The first half of each issue of the magazine  which consists chiefly of reporting and investigative journalism  tends to include these in jokes in a more subtle manner  so as to maintain journalistic integrity  while the second half  more geared around unrestrained parody and cutting humour  tends to present itself in a more confrontational way   edit  Layout and style Private Eye has lagged behind other magazines in adopting various typesetting and printing technologies  At the start it was laid out with scissors and paste and typed on three IBM Executive typewriters   italics  pica and elite   lending an amateurish look to the pages  For some years after layout tools became available the magazine retained this technique to maintain its look  although the three older typewriters were replaced with an IBM composer  Today the magazine is still predominantly in black and white  though the cover and some cartoons inside appear in colour  and there is more text and less white space than is typical for a modern magazine  The former  Colour Section  was printed in black and white like the rest of the magazine  only the content was colourful   edit  Special editions The magazine has published a series of independent special editions dedicated solely to news reporting of particular current events  such as government inadequacy over the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak  the conviction in January 2001 of Abdelbaset al Megrahi for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing  Lockerbie  the flight from justice  May June 2001   and the MMR vaccine  The MMR  A Special Report  subtitled   The story so far  a comprehensive review of the MMR vaccination autism controversy  2002   Another special issue was published in September 2004 to mark the death of long time staff member Paul Foot   edit  Regular sections  edit  Regular columns  Ad Nauseam    the excesses  plagiarism and creative failings of the advertising industry   Brussels Sprouts    the foibles of the European Union and its

Colemanballs   verbal gaffes from broadcasting  Previously named after the former BBC broadcaster David Coleman  who was adjudged particularly prone to such solecisms during his many sporting commentaries  Variants also appear in which publications and press releases are mocked for inappropriately latching on to a current fad to draw unwarranted attention to something else  such as  Dianaballs   following Princess Diana s death in 1997    Millenniumballs   1999    Warballs   following the September 11  2001 attacks    Tsunamiballs   following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake

absurdities of the publishing business  its title taken from a now defunct British magazine   and  Library News   The column produces an annual summary of  logrolling   the activity whereby literary colleagues publish favourable reviews of each other s books  or where rivals have disparaged their competitor s publications  Bookworm s anonymity makes it impossible to identify where this applies to Private Eye  but readers lampooned the column for an uncharacteristically positive review of Paul O Grady s 2009 autobiography   Man Woman in the Eye    usually detailing the past exploits of someone recently appointed into a government advisory role and why these exploits make their appointment unsuitable or contradictory   Music and Musicians    gossip on the artistic and political intrigues

scurrilous and unfounded gossip about the London Symphony Orchestra  which resulted in a significant libel pay out   6  The title of the column is taken from a now defunct British magazine which was a sister publication of Books and Bookmen   News   previously called  The Colour Section     effectively the stories the magazine is most proud of that week or thinks most important  placed at its front

the German Spartacus League which existed during World War I  and other subsequent revolutionary groups  citation needed  Glenda Slagg   brash  libidinous and self contradictory female reporter based on Jean Rook and Lynda Lee Potter  Every sentence from Slagg ends with an onslaught of punctuation made up of repeated     and     signs  and often features intermittent editorial commentary such as  you ve done this already  get on with it  or  ultimately   you re fired   From The Messageboards   introduced in 2008  this is a spoof of Internet forums  in particular those of BBC Radio 5 Live  Gnomemart   the Christmas special edition of Private Eye includes spoof adverts for expensive but useless mail order gadgets  usually endorsed by topical celebrities and capable of playing topical songs or TV theme tunes  In the hot metal era  The Guardian was first lampooned as The Grauniad for its frequent typographical errors  The Eye continues to use the name  and the word has entered the language  Lunchtime O Booze has been among the magazine s resident journalists since the early days  The name is a comment on journalists  supposed traditional fondness for alcohol  their prandial habits  and the suspicion that they pick up many of their stories in public houses  Mary Ann Bighead   a mockery of the former The Times columnist and assistant editor Mary Ann Sieghart  Bighead is lampooned for her pretentions  ignorance  boastfulness about her children Brainella and Intelligencia  high standard of living  travels  mainly to developing countries where she patronises the locals

regular feature  in which the subject is asked about their putative collection of spoons  The style of the replies  allegedly reflecting the personal style of the interviewee  is more important than the content  The article typically ends with a hint that the next interview will be with someone whose name might bring an amusing twist to the series  such as  Next week  Ed Balls   Me and my Balls   Neasden United FC  playing in the  North Circular Relegation League   is a fictional football club from Neasden  North London  often used to satirise English football in general with the manager

less advanced country  is paid a pittance  and fails to understand the workings of some mundane aspect of  lifestyle  life  Her name is derived from Polyfilla  a DIY product used to fill holes and cracks in plaster  Polly s sister Penny Dreadful makes an occasional appearance  Like several Private Eye regulars  Polly is based on more than one female columnist  but Jane Moore of The Sun  whose remarks are often echoed by Polly or commented on elsewhere in the magazine  is a major source  Additionally  the column mocks Rupert Murdoch s media empire in general and Sky television in particular  as Polly s husband   the useless Simon   is usually mentioned as being in front of the television  wasting time  watching exotic sports on obscure satellite television channels  Police log   Neasden Central Police Station   a fictional police station log  satirising current police policies that are met with general contempt and or disdain  Ordinary police activities are ignored  with police

business and in particular Maureen Cleave  who had a column in the Evening Standard  In the early to mid 1960s  popular culture was starting to be taken more seriously by the heavier newspapers  some claim that Private Eye considered this approach pretentious and ripe for ridicule  although others argue that the magazine was in fact covering popular culture before some of the more serious newspapers  This section also provided an outlet for satirical comment on popular musicians  whose antics were usually attributed to the fictional pop group  The Turds  and their charismatic leader  Spiggy Topes   Topes and the Turds were originally based on The Beatles and a thinly disguised John Lennon  but the names were eventually applied to any rock star or band whose excesses featured in the popular press   Although at the same time there was a real group called The Thyrds who appeared in the final of ITV s Ready  Steady  Win  competition   Sally Jockstrap   a fictional sports columnist who is incapable of correctly reporting any sporting facts  Her articles are usually a mishmash of references to several sports  along the lines of  there was drama at Twickenham as Michael

usually ending with a reference to  Kilometres  Kington    edit  Prime Minister parodies Main article  Prime Minister parodies  Private Eye  A traditional fixture in Private Eye is a full page parody of the Prime Minister of the day  The style is chosen to mock the perceived foibles and folly of each Prime Minister  Harold Wilson  who cultivated an exaggerated working class image  was mocked in  Mrs  Wilson s Diary   supposedly written by his wife  Mary Wilson  This parodied Mrs  Dale s Diary  a popular BBC radio series  Edward Heath  whose government was beset by economic and political problems  presided over Heathco  permanently  going out of business   As leader of the opposition to Margaret Thatcher  Neil Kinnock was shown as  Dan Dire   based on the cartoon character Dan Dare

John Major   inspired by the Sue Townsend books Tony Blair was portrayed as the sanctimonious Vicar of St  Albion s  a fictional parish church  in  St  Albion s Parish News   Editor Ian Hislop has said the idea came about after Blair walked into Downing Street carrying his guitar in 1997  like  the new vicar  about  to sing Kumbaya   Richard Ingrams wrote in The Observer that he was amused to see the parody become true  after Blair left office and formed the Faith Foundation to promote religious harmony  During his government  Gordon Brown  2007 10  was mocked as the Supreme Leader of a North Korean style state  railing against the  running dog ex Comrade Blair  and secret plots to depose him  This enabled Private Eye to comment on Brown s lack of election as Prime Minister  either by the public or the Labour Party  as well as his supposed Stalinist style of leadership  When the Conversative and Liberal Democrat coalition took power  the column became Downturn Abbey   based upon the ITV drama Downton Abbey but featuring government officials  The current column features the newsletter of the fictional  New Coalition Academy  formerly Brown s Comprehensive    in which Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg are portrayed as headmaster and deputy headmaster  The motto of the Academy is  Duo in Uno   In theory  both leaders write a column in each issue  but in practice  Nick Clegg s contributions are frequently  held over due to lack of space   Not all of Private Eye s parodies have been unsympathetic  During the 1980s  Ingrams and John Wells wrote fictional letters from Denis Thatcher to Bill Deedes in the Dear Bill column  mocking Margaret Thatcher s husband as an amiable  golf playing drunk  The column was collected in a series of books and became a play in which Wells played the fictional Denis  a character who is now inextricably  blurred  with  the real historical figure   according to Ingrams  3   edit  Miscellanea Classified

theorists promoting their ideas  and the  Eye Need  adverts in which people request money for personal causes  Crossword   a cryptic prize crossword  notable for its vulgarity  In the early 1970s the crossword was set by the Labour MP Tom Driberg  under the pseudonym of  Tiresias   supposedly  a distinguished academic churchman    As of 2011 update  it was set by one of The Guardian s cryptic crossword setters  Eddie James   Brummie  in the paper  under the name Cyclops  The crossword frequently contains offensive language and references  both in the clues and the solutions   and a knowledge of the magazine s in jokes and slang is necessary to solve it  Letters   this frequently includes letters from high profile figures  sometimes in order for the magazine to print an apology and avoid litigation  Other letters express disgust at a recent article or cartoon  many ending by saying  sometimes in jest  that they will  or will not  cancel their subscription  This section also prints celebrity  lookalikes  and regularly prints an embarrassing picture of Andrew Neil  see  recurring in jokes   The Book of      a spoof of the Old Testament  applying language and imagery reminiscent of the King James Bible to current affairs in the Middle East  The Alternative Rocky Horror Prayer Book   a pastiche of attempts to update Anglican religious ceremonies into more modern

Waugh wrote a regular diary for the magazine  usually combining real events from his own life with fictional episodes such as parties with the Queen   from the early 1970s until 1985  It was generally written in the persona of an ultra right wing country gentleman  a subtle exaggeration of his own personality  He described it as the world s first example of journalism specifically dedicated to

journalist Claud Cockburn  Grovel   a  society  column  featuring gossip  scandal and scuttlebutt about the rich and famous  and probably the section which gave rise to the magazine s largest number of libel claims  Its character and style  accompanied by a drawing of a drunk man with a monocle  top hat and cigarette holder  was based on Nigel Dempster  lampooned as Nigel Pratt Dumpster  Grovel last appeared in issue 832  25 Nov 1993   Hallo    the  heart warming column  purportedly written by The Marquesa  was nearly identical to Grovel in content  but with a new prose style parodying the breathless and gushing format established by magazines such as Hello  Thomas  The Privatised Tank Engine   a parody of Rev  W  Awdry s Railway Series  written by Incledon Clark and printed at the time

parody and satire Main article  List of people and organisations frequently parodied by Private Eye While the magazine in general reports corruption  self interest and incompetence in a broad range of industries and lines of work  in practice certain people and entities receive a particularly large amount of coverage in its pages  As the most visible public figures  Prime Ministers and senior politicians make the most natural targets  but Private Eye also aims its criticism at journalists  newspapers and particularly prominent or interesting businesspeople  It is the habit of the magazine to attach nicknames  usually offensive and often very crude  to these people  and often to create surreal and extensive alternate personifications of them  which usually take the form of parody newspaper articles in the second half of the magazine   edit  Other media and merchandise Private Eye has from time to time produced various spin offs from the magazine  Books  e g  annuals  cartoon collections and investigative pamphlets Audio recordings Private Eye TV  a 1971 BBC TV version of the magazine Memorabilia and commemorative products  edit  Criticism and controversy  edit  Public offence The front cover of the infamous  Diana Issue  Some people have found the magazine s irreverence and occasionally distasteful humour offensive  Upon the death of Diana  Princess of Wales  Private Eye printed a cover headed  MEDIA TO BLAME   Under this headline was a picture of many hundreds of people outside Buckingham Palace  with one person commenting that the papers were  a disgrace   another agreeing  saying that it was impossible to get one anywhere  and another saying   Borrow mine  It s got a picture of the car   10  Following the abrupt change in reporting from newspapers immediately following her death  the issue also featured a mock retraction from  all newspapers  of everything negative that they had ever said about Diana  This was enough to cause a flood of complaints  many cancelled subscriptions  and the temporary removal of the magazine from the shelves of several newsagents  These included W H Smith  which had previously refused to stock Private Eye until well into the 1970s  and was characterised in the magazine as  WH Smugg  or  WH Smut  on account of its policy of stocking pornographic magazines  The Diana issue is now one of the most highly sought after back issues  Similar complaints were received about the issues that followed the Ladbroke Grove rail crash  the September 11  2001 attacks  the magazine even including a special  subscription cancellation coupon  for disgruntled readers to send in  and the Soham murders  Following the 7 July 2005 London bombings the magazine s cover featured Tony Blair saying to Ken Livingstone   We must track down the evil mastermind behind the bombers      to which Livingstone replies     and invite him around for tea   in reference to his controversial invitation of Yusuf al Qaradawi to London  11   edit  Bigotry The cover of issue 256 from 1971 showed Emperor Hirohito visiting Britain with the caption  A nasty nip in the air   subhead   Piss off  Bandy Knees    12  In the 1960s and 1970s the magazine mocked the gay rights movement as  Poove Power   citation needed   edit  Blasphemy The 2004 Christmas issue received a number of complaints and subscription cancellations after it featured Pieter Bruegel s painting of a nativity scene  in which one wise man said to another   Apparently  it s David Blunkett s   who at the time was involved in a scandal in which he was thought to have impregnated a married woman   Many readers sent letters accusing the magazine of blasphemy and anti Christian attitudes  One stated that the  witless  gutless buggers wouldn t dare mock Islam   an observation later apparently vindicated when the magazine declined to publish the Danish Mohammed cartoons for fear of firebombs  although it does regularly publish Islam related humour   Many letters in the first issue of 2005 disagreed with the former readers  complaints  and some were parodies of those letters   complaining  about the following issue s cover 13    a cartoon depicting Santa s sleigh shredded to pieces by a wind farm  one said   To use a picture of Our Lord Father Christmas and his Holy Reindeer being torn limb from limb while flying over a windfarm is inappropriate and blasphemous    edit  MMR A 2002 Private Eye special supplement on the MMR vaccine controversy was substantially supportive of the interpretation by Andrew Wakefield of published research in The Lancet by the Royal Free Hospital s Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study Group  which described an apparent link between the vaccine  autism and bowel problems  Initially dismissive of Wakefield  the magazine s 32 page special edition gave greater credence to Wakefield s assertion that MMR vaccines  should be given individually at not less than one year intervals   The British Medical Journal issued a contemporary press release 14  that concluded   The Eye report is dangerous in that it is likely to be read by people who are concerned about the safety of the vaccine  A doubting parent who reads this might be convinced there is a genuine problem and the absence of any proper references will prevent them from checking the many misleading statements   Subsequently  editor Ian Hislop has told the author and columnist Ben Goldacre that Private Eye is  not anti MMR   15  In a review article published in February 2010  regular columnist Phil Hammond  who contributes under the pseudonym  M D    stated that  Private Eye got it wrong in its coverage of MMR   in maintaining its support for Wakefield s position long after conflicting factors had emerged  16   edit  Litigation The magazine has long been famous for attracting libel lawsuits  which can lead to damages relatively easily in English law  To ensure a level of safety  the magazine maintains a large quantity of money as a  fighting fund   although the magazine invariably finds other ways to defuse legal tensions  for example by printing letters from aggrieved parties   As editor  Ian Hislop has become the most sued man in Britain  17  From 1969 to the mid 1980s  the magazine was represented by human rights lawyer Geoffrey Bindman  18  Those who have sued the magazine include many famous names  although the editor has noted that while politicians are a prime target  they  tend to take their medicine like men   the largest number of lawsuits issue from journalists  citation needed  For the tenth anniversary issue  the cover showed a cartoon headstone inscribed with a long list of well known names  and the epitaph  They did not sue in vain   19  An unlikely piece of British legal history occurred in what is now referred to as the  case  of Arkell v  Pressdram  1971   The plaintiff was the subject of an article relating to illicit payments  and the magazine had ample evidence to back up the article  Arkell s lawyers wrote a letter which concluded   His attitude to damages will be governed by the nature of your reply   The magazine s response was  in full   We acknowledge your letter of 29th April referring to Mr J  Arkell  We note that Mr Arkell s attitude to damages will be governed by the nature of our reply and would therefore be grateful if you would inform us what his attitude to damages would be  were he to learn that the nature of our reply is as follows  fuck off   In the years following  the magazine would refer to this exchange as a euphemism for a blunt and coarse dismissal  for example   We refer you to the reply given in the case of Arkell v  Pressdram   20  21  As with  tired and emotional  this usage has spread beyond the magazine  22  Possibly the most famous litigation case against the magazine was initiated by James Goldsmith  known within Private Eye s pages as   Sir  Jammy Fishpaste  23  24    who managed to arrange for criminal libel charges to be brought  effectively meaning that  if found guilty  those behind the Eye could be imprisoned   He sued over allegations that members of the Clermont Set  including Goldsmith  had conspired to shelter Lord Lucan after Lucan had murdered his family nanny  Sandra Rivett  Goldsmith won a partial victory and eventually reached a settlement with the magazine  The case threatened to bankrupt the magazine  which turned to its readers for financial support in the form of the Goldenballs Fund  Goldsmith himself was referred to as Jaws  The solicitor involved in many litigation cases against Private Eye  including the Goldsmith case  was Peter Carter Ruck  or  Carter Fuck   as the Eye referred to him   25  Robert Maxwell  known as Captain Bob  sued the magazine for the suggestion he looked like a criminal  and won a significant sum  The editor  Ian Hislop  summarised the case   I ve just given a fat cheque to a fat Czech  and later claimed this was the only known example of a joke being told on News At Ten  Sonia Sutcliffe also sued after allegations that she used her connection to her husband  the Yorkshire Ripper  Peter Sutcliffe  to make money  She won  600 000 which was later reduced to  60 000 on appeal  However  the initial award caused Hislop to quip outside the court   If this is justice  I m a banana   26  Readers raised a considerable sum in the  bananaballs fund   and Private Eye scored a PR coup by donating the surplus to the families of Sutcliffe s victims  A rare victory for the magazine came in late 2001  when a libel case brought against the magazine by a Cornish chartered accountant  Stuart Condliffe  finally came to trial after ten years  The case was thrown out after only a few weeks as Condliffe had effectively accused his own legal team  Carter Ruck and Associates  of lying  In 2009 Private Eye successfully challenged an injunction brought against it by Michael Napier  former head of the Law Society  who had sought to claim  confidentiality  for a report that he had been disciplined by the Law Society in relation to a conflict of interest  27  The ruling had wider significance in that it allowed other rulings by the Law Society to be publicised  28  29   edit  Paul Foot Award In 2005  The Guardian and Private Eye established the Paul Foot Award  with an annual  10 000 prize fund  for investigative campaigning journalism  30   edit  Ownership The magazine is apparently owned by an eclectic group of people  officially published through the mechanism of a limited company called Pressdram Ltd  31  which was bought as an  off the shelf  company by Peter Cook in November 1961  Private Eye does not publish explicit details of individuals concerned with its upkeep  and does not contain a list of its editors  writers and designers   In 1981 the book The Private Eye Story stated that the owners were Peter Cook  who owned most of the shareholding  with smaller shareholders including Dirk Bogarde  Jane Asher  and several of those involved with the founding of the magazine  Most of those on the list have since died  however  and it is unclear what happened to their shareholdings  Those concerned are reputedly contractually only able to sell their shareholdings at the price they originally paid for them  citation needed  Shareholders as of the annual return dated 26 March 2005  including shareholders who have inherited shares  are  Jane Asher Barbara Braden David Cash  also a director  Elizabeth Cook Lin Cook Barry Fantoni Tessa Fantoni Ian Hislop  also a director  Eileen Lewenstein Executor of Lord Farington Peter Cook  Productions  Ltd Private Eye  Productions  Ltd Anthony Rushton  also a director  Connor Hammil Sarah Seymour Thomas Usbourne Brock van der Bogaerde The other directors are Sheila Molnar  who is also the company secretary  and Richard Ingrams   edit  Logo The logo for the magazine s News section is a donkey riding naked Mr Punch caressing his erect and oversized penis  while hugging a female admirer  It is a detail from a frieze by  Dickie  Doyle that once formed the masthead of Punch magazine  which the editors of Private Eye had come to loathe for its perceived descent into complacency  The image  hidden away in the detail of the frieze  had appeared on the cover of Punch for nearly a century and was noticed by Malcolm Muggeridge during a guest editing spot on Private Eye  The  Rabelaisian gnome   as the character was called  was enlarged by Gerald Scarfe  and put on the front cover of issue 69 at full size  He was then formally adopted as a mascot on the inside pages  as a symbol of the old  radical incarnation of Punch magazine that the Eye admired   edit  Rally On May Day 1965  the magazine held a  Mass for Vass  rally in Central London for beleaguered former British Prime Minister Alec Douglas Home  a reference to his nickname  Baillie Vass   Under police supervision  300 marchers carried banners proclaiming  High Speed Vass Gets Things Done    The Baillie Will No Fail Ye    Hands off the Rann of Kutch   and  Who s a Cretin    a reference to a former nickname   Sir Alec Douglas Who     The march progressed from Parliament Square to Conservative Central Office  where  accompanied by a brass band  the participants sang rousing songs in mock support of Home to the occupants of the building  This incident went almost entirely unreported in the national media   edit  See also List of satirical magazines  edit  References   Tryhorn  Chris  2010 02 11    Private Eye hits best sales since 1992   PDF   London  The
