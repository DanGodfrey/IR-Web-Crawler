were largely replaced by Wasja speaking tribes during Bantu migrations  The Sotho Tswana people colonized the general region of South Africa between the 3rd and 11th centuries  The present Lesotho  then called Basutoland  emerged as a single polity under king Moshoeshoe I in 1822  Moshoeshoe  a son of Mokhachane  a minor chief of the Bakoteli lineage  formed his own clan and became a chief around 1804  Between 1821 and 1823  he and his followers settled at the Butha Buthe Mountain  joining with former adversaries in resistance against the Lifaqane associated with the reign of Shaka Zulu from 1818 to 1828  citation needed  Subsequent evolution of the state hinged on conflicts between British and Dutch colonists leaving the Cape Colony following its seizure from the French occupied Dutch by the British in 1795  and subsequently associated with the Orange River Sovereignty and subsequent Orange Free State  Missionaries invited by Moshoeshoe I  Thomas Arbousset  Eug ne Casalis and Constant Gosselin from the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society  placed at Morija  developed orthography and printed works in the Sotho language between 1837 and 1855  Casalis  acting as translator and providing advice on foreign affairs  helped to set up diplomatic channels and acquire guns for use against the encroaching Europeans and the Griqua people  citation needed  Boer trekkers from the Cape Colony showed up on the western borders of Basutoland and claimed land rights  beginning with Jan de Winnaar  who settled in the Matlakeng area in May June 1838  As more farmers were moving into the area they tried to colonise the land between the two rivers  even north of the Caledon  claiming that it had been abandoned by the Sotho people  Moshoeshoe subsequently signed a treaty with the British Governor of the Cape Colony  Sir George Thomas Napier that annexed the Orange River Sovereignty that many Boers had settled  These outraged Boers were suppressed in a brief skirmish in 1848  In 1851 a British force was defeated by the Sotho army at Kolonyama  touching off an embarrassing war for the British  After repulsing another British attack in 1852  Moshoeshoe sent an appeal to the British commander that settled the dispute diplomatically  then defeated the Tlokoa in 1853  citation needed  In 1854 the British pulled out of the region  and in 1858 Moshoeshoe fought a series of wars with the Boers in the Free State Basotho War  losing a great portion of the western lowlands  The last war in 1867 ended when Moshoeshoe appealed to Queen Victoria  who agreed to make Basutoland a British protectorate in 1868  In 1869  the British signed a treaty at Aliwal North with the Boers that defined the boundaries of Basutoland and later Lesotho  which by ceding the western territories effectively reduced Moshoeshoe s kingdom to half its previous size  citation needed  Following the cession in 1869  the British initially transferred functions from Moshoeshoe s capital in Thaba Bosiu to a police camp on the northwest border  Maseru  until administration of Basutoland was transferred to the Cape Colony in 1871  Moshoeshoe died on March 11  1870  marking the end of the traditional era and the beginning of the colonial era  and was buried at Thaba Bosiu  During their rule between 1871 and 1884  Basutoland was treated similarly to territories that had been forcefully annexed  much to the chagrin of the Basotho  6  This led to the Gun War in 1881  7  In 1884  Basutoland was restored its status as a Crown colony  with Maseru again its capital  but remained under direct rule by a governor  though effective internal power was wielded by traditional chiefs  Basutoland gained its independence from Britain and became the Kingdom of Lesotho in 1966  8  In January 1970 the ruling Basotho National Party  BNP  lost the first post independence general elections  with 23 seats to the Basutoland Congress Party s 36  Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan refused to cede power to the Basotho Congress Party  BCP   declared himself Tona Kholo  Sesotho translation of prime minister   citation needed  and imprisoned the BCP leadership  BCP began a rebellion and then received training in Libya for its Lesotho Liberation Army  LLA  under the pretense of being Azanian People s Liberation Army  APLA  soldiers of the Pan Africanist Congress  PAC   Deprived of arms and supplies by the Sibeko faction of the PAC in 1978  the 178 strong LLA was rescued from their Tanzanian base by the financial assistance of a Maoist PAC officer but launched the guerrilla war with only a handful of old weapons  The main force was defeated in northern Lesotho and later guerrillas launched sporadic but usually ineffectual attacks  The campaign was severely compromised when BCP s leader  Ntsu Mokhehle  went to Pretoria  In the early 1980s  several Basotho who sympathized with the exiled BCP were threatened with death and attacked by the government of Leabua Jonathan  In September 1981 the family of Benjamin Masilo was attacked  A few days later  Edgar Mahlomola Motuba was taken from his home and murdered  The BNP ruled from 1966 till January 1970  What later ensued was a  de facto  government led by Dr Leabua Jonathan until 1986 when a military coup forced it out of office  The Military Council that came to power granted executive powers to King Moshoeshoe II  who was until then a ceremonial monarch  But in 1987 the King was forced into exile after coming up with a six page memorandum on how he wanted the Lesotho s constitution to be  which would have given him more executive powers had the military government agreed  His son was installed as King Letsie III  The chairman of the military junta  Major General Justin Metsing Lekhanya  was ousted in 1991 and replaced by Major General Elias Phisoana Ramaema  who handed over power to a democratically elected government of the BCP in 1993  Moshoeshoe II returned from exile in 1992 as an ordinary citizen  After the return to democratic government  King Letsie III tried unsuccessfully to persuade the BCP government to reinstate his father  Moshoeshoe II  as head of state  Makhaleng River Gorges in the Highlands of Lesotho  2003  In August 1994  Letsie III staged a military backed coup that deposed the BCP government  after the BCP government refused to reinstate his father  Moshoeshoe II  according to Lesotho s constitution  The new government did not receive full international recognition  Member states of the Southern African Development Community  SADC  engaged in negotiations to reinstate the BCP government  One of the conditions Letsie III put forward for this was that his father should be re installed as head of state  After protracted negotiations  the BCP government was reinstated and Letsie III abdicated in favor of his father in 1995  but he ascended the throne again when Moshoeshoe II died at the age of fifty seven in a road accident  when his car plunged off a mountain road during the early hours of 15 January 1996  According to a government statement  Moshoeshoe had set out at 1 a m  to visit his cattle at Matsieng and was returning to Maseru through the Maluti Mountains when his car left the road  9  In 1997  the ruling BCP split over leadership disputes  Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle formed a new party  the Lesotho Congress for Democracy  LCD   and was followed by a majority of Members of Parliament  which enabled him to form a new government  Pakalitha Mosisili succeeded Mokhehle as party leader and the LCD won the general elections in 1998  Although the elections were pronounced free and fair by local and international observers and a subsequent special commission appointed by SADC  the opposition political parties rejected the results  Opposition protests in the country intensified  culminating in a peaceful demonstration outside the royal palace in August 1998  Exact details of what followed are greatly disputed  both in Lesotho and South Africa  While the Botswana Defence Force troops were welcomed  tensions with South African National Defence Force troops were high  resulting in fighting  Incidences of sporadic rioting intensified when South African troops hoisted a South African flag over the Royal Palace  By the time the SADC forces withdrew in May 1999  much of Maseru lay in ruins  and the southern provincial capital towns of Mafeteng and Mohale s Hoek had seen the loss of over a third of their commercial real estate  A number of South Africans and Basotho also died in the fighting  An Interim Political Authority  IPA   charged with reviewing the electoral structure in the country  was created in December 1998  The IPA devised a proportional electoral system to ensure that the opposition would be represented in the National Assembly  The new system retained the existing 80 elected Assembly seats  but added 40 seats to be filled on a proportional basis  Elections were held under this new system in May 2002  and the LCD won again  gaining 54  of the vote  But for the first time  opposition political parties won significant numbers of seats  and despite some irregularities and threats of violence from Major General Lekhanya  Lesotho experienced its first peaceful election  Nine opposition parties now hold all 40 of the proportional seats  with the BNP having the largest share  21   The LCD has 79 of the 80 constituency based seats  Although its elected members participate in the National Assembly  the BNP has launched several legal challenges to the elections  including a recount  none have been successful   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Lesotho The Lesotho Government is a parliamentary or constitutional monarchy  The Prime Minister  Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili  is head of government and has executive authority  The king serves a largely ceremonial function  he no longer possesses any executive authority and is prohibited from actively participating

Democratic Party  BBDP  and the Basotho Democratic National Party  BDNP  Lesotho are among the other six opposition parties represented  The ABC has brought a dramatic change in the Lesotho s politics  because of its having won 17  mainly urban  seats out of 80 Constituency seats  only a few months after it was formed in September 2006  Of the 40 Proportional Representation  PR  seats  the National Independent Party  NIP   a parliamentary ally of the ruling party  has the highest number of seats at 21  The Lesotho Workers Party has the next highest number of proportional seats with 10  The BNP

parliament  The upper house of parliament  called the Senate  is composed of twenty two principal chiefs whose membership is hereditary  and eleven appointees of the king  acting on the advice of the prime minister  The constitution provides for an independent judicial system  made up of the High Court  the Court of Appeal  Magistrate s Courts  and traditional courts that exist predominantly in rural areas  All but one of the Justices on the Court of Appeal are South African jurists  There is no trial by jury  rather  judges make rulings alone  or  in the case of criminal trials  with two other judges as observers  The constitution also protects basic civil liberties  including freedom of speech  freedom of association  freedom of the press  freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of religion  Lesotho was ranked 12th out of 48 sub Saharan African countries in the 2008 Ibrahim Index of African Governance  10  However there is a growing movement  the People s Charter Movement  calling for the practical annexation of the country by South Africa due to the AIDS epidemic which infects a third of the population  The country faces high unemployment  economic collapse  a weak currency and poor travel documents restricting their movement  An African Union report called for economic integration of Lesotho with South Africa but stopped short of suggesting annexation  In May 2010 the Charter Movement delivered a petition to the South African High Commission requesting integration  South Africa s home affairs spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa rejected the idea that Lesotho should be treated as a special case  Quoting   It is a sovereign country like South Africa  We sent envoys to our neighbours   Botswana  Zimbabwe  Swaziland and Lesotho   before we enforced the passport rule

greater Johannesburg area  which features a large concentration of South African industry  population  and agriculture  Completion of the first phase of the project has made Lesotho almost completely self sufficient in the production of electricity and generated approximately  70 million in 2010 from the sale of electricity and water to South Africa  22  The World Bank  African Development Bank  European Investment Bank  and many other bilateral donors financed the project  Diamonds are produced in Leteng  Mothae  Liqhobong and Kao mines  The sector suffered a set back in 2008 as the result

 Law Lesotho does not have a single code containing its laws  it draws them from a variety of sources including  Constitution  Legislation  Common Law  Judicial precedent  Customary Law  and Authoritative texts  40  The Constitution of Lesotho came into force after the publication of the Commencement Order  Constitutionally  legislation refers to laws that have been passed by both houses of parliament and have been assented to by the King  section 78 1    Subordinate legislation refers to laws passed by other bodies to which parliament has by virtue of section 70 2  of the Constitution validly delegated such legislative powers  These include government gazettes  ministerial orders  ministerial regulations and municipal bye laws  Although Lesotho shares with South Africa  Botswana  Swaziland  Namibia and Zimbabwe a mixed general legal system which resulted from the interaction between the Roman Dutch Civilian law and the English Common Law  its general law operates independently  Lesotho also applies the common law  which refers to unwritten law or law from non statutory sources  but excludes customary law  Decisions from South African courts are only persuasive  and courts refer to them in formulating their decisions  Decisions from similar jurisdictions can also be cited for their persuasive value  Magistrates  courts decisions do not become precedent since these are lower courts  They are however bound by decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal  At the apex of the Lesotho justice system is the Court of Appeal  which is the final appellate forum on all matters  It has a supervisory and review jurisdiction over all the courts of Lesotho  Lesotho has a dual legal system consisting of customary and general laws operating side by side  Customary law is made up of the customs of the Basotho  written and codified in the Laws of Lerotholi whereas general law consists of Roman Dutch Law imported from the Cape and the Lesotho statutes  The codification of customary law came about after a council was appointed in 1903 to advise the British Resident Commissioner on what was best for the Basotho in terms of laws that would govern them  Until this time  the Basotho customs and laws were passed down from generation to generation through oral tradition  The council was then given the task of codifying them  came up with the Laws of Lerotholi which are applied by customary courts today  local courts   Written works of eminent authors have persuasive value in the courts of Lesotho  These include writings of the old authorities as
