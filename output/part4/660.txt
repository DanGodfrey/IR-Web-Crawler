peak Mali was once part of three famed West African empires which controlled trans Saharan trade in gold  salt  slaves  and other precious commodities  7  These Sahelian kingdoms had neither rigid geopolitical boundaries nor rigid ethnic identities  7  The earliest of these empires was the Ghana Empire  which was dominated by the Soninke  a Mande speaking people  7  The empire expanded throughout West Africa from the 8th century until 1078  when it was conquered by the Almoravids  8  The Mali Empire later formed on the upper Niger River  and reached the height of power in the 14th century  8  Under the Mali Empire  the ancient cities of Djenn  and Timbuktu were centers of both trade and Islamic learning  8  The empire later declined as a result of internal intrigue  ultimately being supplanted by the Songhai Empire  8  The Songhai people originated in current northwestern Nigeria  The Songhai had long been a major power in West Africa subject to the Mali Empire s rule  8  In the late 14th century  the Songhai gradually gained independence from the Mali Empire and expanded  ultimately subsuming the entire eastern portion of the Mali Empire  8  The Songhai Empire s eventual collapse was largely the result of a Moroccan invasion in 1591  under the command of Judar Pasha  8  The fall of the Songhai Empire marked the end of the region s role as a trading crossroads  8  Following the establishment of sea routes by the European powers  the trans Saharan trade routes lost significance  8  The pages above are from Timbuktu Manuscripts written in Sudani script  a form of Arabic  from the Mali Empire showing established knowledge of astronomy and mathematics  Today there are close to a million of these manuscripts found in Timbuktu alone  One of the worst famines in the region s recorded history occurred in the 18th century  According to John Iliffe   The worst crises were in the 1680s  when famine extended from the Senegambian coast to the Upper Nile and  many sold themselves for slaves  only to get a sustenance   and especially in 1738 56  when West Africa s greatest recorded subsistence crisis  due to drought and locusts  reportedly killed half the population of Timbuktu   9  Mali fell under the control of the French during the late 19th century  8  By 1905  most of the area was under firm French control as a part of French Sudan  8  In early 1959  French Sudan  which changed its name to the Sudanese Republic  and Senegal united to become the Mali Federation  The Mali Federation gained independence from France on 20 June 1960  8  Senegal withdrew from the federation in August 1960  which allowed the Sudanese Republic to become the independent Republic of Mali on 22 September 1960  Modibo Ke ta was elected the first president  8  Ke ta quickly established a one party state  adopted an independent African and socialist orientation with close ties to the East  and implemented extensive nationalization of economic resources  8  On 19 November 1968  following progressive economic decline  the Ke ta regime was overthrown in a bloodless military coup led by Moussa Traor   10  a day which is now commemorated as Liberation Day  The subsequent military led regime  with Traor  as president  attempted to reform the economy  However  his efforts were frustrated by political turmoil and a devastating drought between 1968 to 1974  10  in which famine killed thousands of people  11  The Traor  regime faced student unrest beginning in the late 1970s and three coup attempts  However  the Traor  regime repressed all dissenters until the late 1980s  10  The government continued to attempt economic reforms  and the populace became increasingly dissatisfied  10  In response to growing demands for multi party democracy  the Traor  regime allowed some limited political liberalization  but refused to usher in a full fledged democratic system  10  In 1990  cohesive opposition movements began to emerge  and was complicated by the turbulent rise of ethnic violence in the north following the return of many Tuaregs to Mali  10  A statue of freedom in Bamako  Anti government protests in 1991 led to a coup  a transitional government  and a new constitution  10  Opposition to the corrupt and dictatorial regime of General Mousa Traor  grew during the 1980s  During this time  strict programs imposed to satisfy demands of the International Monetary Fund brought increased hardship upon the country s population while elites close to the government supposedly lived in growing wealth  Peaceful student protests in January 1991 were brutally suppressed  with mass arrests and torture of leaders and participants  Scattered acts of rioting and vandalism of public buildings followed  but most actions by the dissidents remained nonviolent  From March 22 through March 26  1991  mass pro democracy rallies and a nationwide strike was held in both urban and rural communities  which became known as les evenements   the events   or the March Revolution  In Bamako  in response to mass demonstrations organized by university students and later joined by trade unionists and others  soldiers opened fire indiscriminately on the nonviolent demonstrators  Riots broke out briefly following the shootings  Barricades as well as roadblocks were erected and Traor  declared a state of emergency and imposed a nightly curfew  Despite an estimated loss of 300 lives over the course of four days  nonviolent protesters continued to return to Bamako each day demanding the resignation of the dictatorial president and the implementation of democratic policies  12  March 26th  1991 is the day that marks the clash between military soldiers and peaceful demonstrating students which climaxed in the massacre of dozens under the orders of then President Moussa Traor   He and three associates were later tried and convicted and received the death sentence for their part in the decision making of that day  Nowadays the day is a national holiday in order to remember the tragic events and the people that were killed  13  The coup is remembered as Mali s March Revolution of 1991  By March 26  the growing refusal of soldiers to fire into the largely nonviolent protesting crowds turned into a full scale tumult  and resulted into thousands of soldiers putting down their arms and joining the pro democracy movement  That afternoon  Lieutenant Colonel Amadou Toumani Tour  announced on the radio that he had arrested the dictatorial president  Moussa Traor   As a consequence  opposition parties were legalized and a national congress of civil and political groups met to draft a new democratic constitution to be approved by a national referendum  14  In 1992  Alpha Oumar Konar  won Mali s first democratic  multi party presidential election  Upon his reelection in 1997  President Konar  pushed through political and economic reforms and fought corruption  In 2002  he was succeeded in democratic elections by Amadou Toumani Tour   a retired general  who had been the leader of the military aspect of the 1991 democratic uprising  15  Although recently Mali has been listed as one of the most politically and socially stable countries in Africa  16  the country has been facing a major internal conflict since January 2012 led by the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad against the Malian government  17  On 22 March 2012 it was reported that rebel troops from the military appeared on state TV announcing they had seized control of the country  18   edit  Geography Satellite image of
