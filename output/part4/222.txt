Despite the name  most of Rhode Island is on the mainland United States  The official name of the state  Rhode Island and Providence Plantations  derives from the merger of two colonies  Rhode Island colony was founded near present day Newport  on what is now commonly called Aquidneck Island  the largest of several islands in Narragansett Bay  Providence Plantations was the name of the colony founded by Roger Williams in the area now known as the City of Providence  9  It is unclear how Aquidneck Island came to be known as Rhode Island  although there are two popular theories  The explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano  in 1524 noted the presence of an island near the mouth of Narragansett Bay  which he likened to the Greek island of Rhodes  However  subsequent European explorers were unable to precisely identify the island that Verrazzano had named  Nevertheless  the Pilgrims who later colonized the area assumed that Verrazzano s  Rhodes  was Aquidneck  A second theory concerns the fact that Adriaen Block  during his expeditions in the 1610s  passed by Aquidneck  described in a 1625 account of his travels as  an island of reddish appearance   in 17th century Dutch   een rodlich Eylande    10  Historians have theorized that this  reddish appearance  resulted from either red autumn foliage or red clay on portions of the shore  11  12  12  Verrazzano Monument  Providence  Rhode Island  The earliest documented use of the name  Rhode Island  for Aquidneck was in 1637  by Roger Williams  The name was officially applied to the island in 1644 with these words   Aquethneck shall be henceforth called the Ile of Rods or Rhod Island   The name  Isle of Rodes  is found used in a legal document as late as 1646  13  14  However  Dutch maps as late as 1659 call the island  Red Island   Roode Eylant   Roger Williams was a theologian forced out of the Massachusetts Bay Colony  Seeking religious and political tolerance  he and others founded  Providence Plantations  as a free proprietary colony   Providence  referred to the divine providence and  plantations  referred to an English term for a colony   Rhode Island and Providence Plantations  is the longest official name of any state in the Union  On June 25  2009  the General Assembly voted to allow the people to decide whether to keep the name or drop  Providence Plantations  due to the misperception that the name relates to slavery  15  The referendum election was held on this subject during the November 2  2010 elections  and the people overwhelmingly voted  78  to 22   to keep the original name  16   edit  Geography Terrain Map of Rhode Island Further information  List of counties in Rhode Island Map of Rhode Island  showing major cities and roads Rhode Island covers an area of approximately 1 214 square miles  3 140 km2  and is bordered on the north and east by Massachusetts  on the west by Connecticut  and on the south by Rhode Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean  2  It shares a narrow maritime border with New York State between Block Island and Long Island  The mean elevation of the state is 200 feet  60 m   Nicknamed the Ocean State  Rhode Island has a number of oceanfront beaches  It is mostly flat with no real mountains  and the state s highest natural point is Jerimoth Hill  812 feet  247 m  above sea level  17  Located within the New England province of the Appalachian Region  Rhode Island has two distinct natural regions  Eastern Rhode Island contains the lowlands of the Narragansett Bay  while Western Rhode Island forms part of the New England Upland  Rhode Island s forests are part of the Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion  18  Narragansett Bay is a major feature of the state s topography  Block Island lies approximately 12 miles  19 km  off the southern coast of the mainland  Within the Bay  there are over 30 islands  The largest is Aquidneck Island  shared by the municipalities of Newport  Middletown  and Portsmouth  The second largest island is Conanicut  the third largest is Prudence   edit  Geology A rare type of rock called Cumberlandite  found only in Rhode Island  specifically in the town of Cumberland   is the state rock  There were initially two known deposits of the mineral  but since it is an ore of iron  one of the deposits was extensively mined for its ferrous content   edit  Climate Rhode Island is an example of a humid continental climate with warm  rainy summers and chilly winters  The highest temperature recorded in Rhode Island was 104  F  40  C   recorded on August 2  1975  in Providence  19  The lowest recorded temperature in Rhode Island was  25  F   32  C   on February 5  1996  in Greene  20  Monthly average temperatures range from a high of 83  F  28  C  to a low of 20  F   7  C   21   edit  History Main

signed by Chief Canonicus  Roger Williams and Narragansett Indians Main article  Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations In 1636  Roger Williams  after being banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his religious views  settled at the tip of Narragansett Bay  on land granted to him by the Narragansett and Pequot tribes  He called the site Providence and declared it a place of religious freedom  Detractors of the idea of liberty of conscience sometimes referred to it as  Rogue s Island   22  In 1638  after conferring with Williams  Anne Hutchinson  William Coddington  John Clarke  Philip Sherman  and other religious dissidents settled on Aquidneck Island  then known as Rhode Island   which was purchased from the local natives  who called it Pocasset  The settlement of Portsmouth was governed by the Portsmouth Compact  The southern part of the island became the separate settlement of Newport after disagreements among the founders  Samuel Gorton purchased the Native American lands at Shawomet in 1642  precipitating a military dispute with the Massachusetts Bay Colony  In 1644  Providence  Portsmouth  and Newport united for their common independence as the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations  governed by an elected council and  president   Gorton received a separate charter for his settlement in 1648  which he named Warwick after his patron  23  Although Rhode Island remained at peace with the Native Americans  the relationship between the other New England colonies and the Native Americans was more strained  and sometimes led to bloodshed  despite attempts by the Rhode Island leadership to broker peace  During King Philip s War  1675 1676   both sides regularly violated Rhode Island s neutrality  The war s largest battle occurred in Rhode Island  when a force of Massachusetts  Connecticut and Plymouth militia under General Josiah Winslow invaded and destroyed the fortified Narragansett Indian village in the Great Swamp in southern Rhode Island  on December 19  1675  24  The Narragansett also invaded  and burnt down several of the cities of Rhode Island  including Providence  although they allowed the population to leave first  Also in one of the final actions of the war  troops from Connecticut hunted down and killed  King Philip   as they called the Wampanoag war leader Metacomet  on Rhode Island s territory  The colony was amalgamated into the Dominion of New England in 1686  as James II of England attempted to enforce royal authority over the autonomous colonies in British North America  After the Glorious Revolution of 1688  the colony regained its independence under the Royal Charter  The bedrock of the economy continued to be agriculture  especially dairy farming  and fishing  Lumber and shipbuilding also became major industries  Slaves were introduced at this time  although there is no record of any law relegalising slave holding  Ironically  the colony later prospered under the slave trade  by distilling rum to sell in Africa as part of a profitable triangular trade in slaves and sugar with the Caribbean  25  Rhode Island was the first of the thirteen colonies to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown  on May 4  1776  It was also the last colony of the thirteen colonies to ratify the United States Constitution on May 29  1790  once assurances were made that a Bill of Rights would become part of the Constitution  26  As the home of Brown University  Rhode Island is one of only eight states hosting a colonial college chartered on its territory prior to the American Revolution   King Philip s Seat   a Native American meeting place on Mount Hope  edit  Revolution to industrialization  1770 1860 Nathanael Greene Rhode Island s tradition of independence and dissent gave it a prominent role in the American Revolution  In 1772  the first bloodshed of the American Revolution took place in Rhode Island when a band of Providence residents attacked a grounded British ship for enforcing unpopular British trade regulations  This incident would come to be known as the Gaspee Affair  Rhode Island was the first of the original thirteen colonies to declare its independence from Great Britain  May 4  1776   27  and the last to ratify the Constitution  doing the latter only after being threatened with having its exports taxed as a foreign nation  During the Revolution  the British occupied Newport  A combined Franco American force fought to drive them off of Aquidneck Island  Portsmouth was the site of the first African American military unit  the 1st Rhode Island Regiment  to fight for the U S  in the Battle of Rhode Island August 29  1778  The arrival of a far superior French fleet forced the British to scuttle their own ships  rather than surrender them to the French  National Park Service map of the Washington Rochambeau Revolutionary Route  which commenced in Rhode Island  The celebrated march of 1781 to Yorktown  Virginia that ended with the defeat of the British at the Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake began in Newport  Rhode Island under the joint command of General George Washington who led American troops and the Comte de Rochambeau who led French soldiers sent by King Louis XVI  In 2009  it was officially recognized by the National Park Service  These allied forces spent one year in Providence  Rhode Island  including at Brown University s University Hall  preparing for an opportune moment to begin their decisive march  Several patriots residing in Rhode Island were involved in the American Revolution  including Royal Governor Samuel Ward  Royal Governor and first Brown University Chancellor Stephen Hopkins  the Reverend James Manning  General James Mitchell Varnum  John Brown  Dr  Solomon Drowne  Yale College president Ezra Stiles and first United States Senator from Rhode Island Theodore Foster  Providence in the mid 19th century  The Industrial Revolution began in America in 1787 when Thomas Somers reproduced textile machine plans he imported from England  He helped to produce the Beverly Cotton Manufactory  which Moses Brown of Providence took an interest in  Teaming up with Samuel Slater  Moses Brown helped to create the second cotton mill in America  a water powered textile mill  As the Industrial Revolution moved large numbers of workers into the cities  a permanently landless  and therefore voteless  class developed  By 1829  60  of the state s free white males were ineligible to vote  Abandoned mill outside Newport  1968  Several attempts had been made to address this problem  but none were successful  In 1842  Thomas Dorr drafted a liberal constitution which was passed by popular referendum  However  the conservative sitting governor  Samuel Ward King  opposed the people s wishes  leading to the Dorr Rebellion  Although this was not a success  a modified version of the constitution was passed in November  which allowed any white male to vote if he owned land or could pay a  1 poll tax  In addition to industrialization  Rhode Island was heavily involved in the slave trade during the post revolution era  Slavery was extant in the state as early as 1652  and by 1774  the slave population of Rhode Island was 6 3   nearly twice as high as any other New England colony  In the late 18th century  several Rhode Island merchant families began actively engaging in the triangle slave trade  Notable among these was Rhode Island Senator James De Wolf and his family  as well as brothers John and Nicholas of the Brown family  for whom Brown University is named  although some Browns  particularly Moses  became prominent abolitionists  In the years after the Revolution  Rhode Island merchants controlled between 60  and 90  of the American trade in African slaves  28  29   edit  Civil War to Progressive Era  1860 1929 During the Civil War  Rhode Island was the first Union state to send troops in response to President Lincoln s request for help from the states  Rhode Island furnished 25 236 fighting men  of whom 1 685 died  On the home front  Rhode Island  along with the other northern states  used its industrial capacity to supply the Union Army with the materials it needed to win the war  The United States Naval Academy moved here temporarily during the war  In 1866  Rhode Island abolished racial segregation in the public schools throughout the state  30  Post war immigration increased the population  From the 1860s to the 1880s  most immigrants were from England  Ireland  Germany  Sweden  and Quebec  Toward the end of the century  however  most immigrants were from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean  31  At the turn of the century  Rhode Island had a booming economy  which fed the demand for immigration  In the years leading up to World War I  Rhode Island s constitution remained reactionary  in contrast to the more progressive reforms that were occurring in the rest of the country  The state never ratified the 18th Amendment establishing national prohibition of alcohol  32  During World War I  Rhode Island furnished 28 817 troops  of whom 612 died  After the war  the state was hit hard by the Spanish Influenza  33  In the 1920s and 1930s  rural Rhode Island saw a surge in Ku Klux Klan membership  largely in reaction to the large waves of immigrants moving to the state  The Klan is believed to be responsible for burning the Watchman Industrial School in Scituate  which was a school for African American children  34   edit  Growth in the modern era  1929 present In the 20th century  the state continued to grow  though the decline in industry devastated many urban areas  These areas were affected further  as with the rest of the country s urban areas  by construction of Interstate highways through city cores and the suburbanization caused by it and by the GI Bill  Since the Great Depression  the Rhode Island Democratic Party has dominated local politics  Rhode Island has comprehensive health insurance for low income children  and a large social safety net  Many urban areas still have a high rate of children in poverty  Due to an influx of residents from Boston  increasing housing costs have resulted in more homeless in Rhode Island  35  Providence in 2009  The 350th Anniversary of Rhode Island was celebrated with a free concert held on the tarmac of the Quonset State Airport  Performers included Chuck Berry  Tommy James and headliner Bob Hope  The Republican Party  virtually non existent in the state legislature  has successfully nominated state wide  good government  reform candidates who criticize the state s high taxes and what they claim are excesses of the Democratic Party  Former Governor Donald Carcieri of East Greenwich  and former Mayor Vincent A   Buddy  Cianci of Providence  who later became an independent political leader  and was convicted on RICO charges  ran as Republican reform candidates  In 2003  a nightclub fire in West Warwick claimed one hundred lives and resulted in nearly twice as many injured  and caught national attention  The fire resulted in criminal sentences  36  In March 2010  areas of the state received record flooding due to rising rivers from heavy rain  The first period of rainy weather in mid March caused localized flooding  but just two weeks later  more rain caused more widespread flooding in many towns  especially south of Providence  Rain totals on March 29 30  2010 exceeded 14 inches in many locales  resulting in the inundation of area rivers especially the Pawtuxet River which runs through central Rhode Island  The overflow of the Pawtuxet River  nearly 11 feet  3 4 m  above flood stage  submerged a sewage plant and closed a five mile  8 km  stretch of Interstate 95  In addition  it flooded two shopping malls  numerous businesses  and many homes in Warwick  West Warwick  Cranston  and Westerly  Amtrak service between New York and Boston was also suspended during this period  Following the flood  Rhode Island was in a state of emergency for two days and President Obama came to neighboring Massachusetts to assess the damage  FEMA was also called in to help flood victims

do not have an official Governor s residence  See List of Rhode Island Governors  The state legislature is the Rhode Island General Assembly  consisting of the 75 member House of Representatives and the 38 member Senate  Both houses of the bicameral body are currently dominated by the Democratic Party  Because Rhode Island s population barely crosses the threshold for additional votes in both the federal House and electoral college  it is well represented relative to its population  with the eighth highest number of electoral votes and second highest number of House Representatives per resident  Based on its area  Rhode Island even has the highest density of electoral votes  37  Federally  Rhode Island is one of the most reliably Democratic states during presidential elections  regularly giving the Democratic nominees one of their best showings  In the 1980 U S  Presidential Election  Rhode Island was one of only 6 states to vote against Ronald Reagan  Reagan did carry Rhode Island in his 49 state victory in 1984  but the state was the second weakest of the states Reagan won  Rhode Island was the Democrats  leading state in 1988 and 2000  and second best in 1966  1996 and 2004  Rhode Island s most one sided Presidential election result was in 1964  over 80  of Rhode Islanders voted for Lyndon B  Johnson  The last fifteen Presidential elections in Rhode Island have resulted in the Democratic party winning the State s electoral college votes eleven times  The state was devoted to Republicans until 1908  but has only strayed from the Democrats 7 times in the 24 elections that have followed  In 2004  Rhode Island gave John Kerry more than a 20 percentage point margin of victory  the third highest of any state   with 59 4  of its vote  All but three of Rhode Island s 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate  The only exceptions were East Greenwich  West Greenwich and Scituate  38  In 2008  Rhode Island gave Barack Obama a 29 percentage point margin of victory  the third highest of any state   with 64  of its vote  All of Rhode Island s 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate  except for Scituate  39  Also  the 2008

in the city of Cranston  46  A corridor of population can be seen from the Providence area  stretching northwest following the Blackstone River to Woonsocket  where nineteenth century mills drove industry and development  According to the U S  Census Bureau  as of 2005  Rhode Island had an estimated population of 1 076 189  which is a decrease of 3 727  or 0 3   from the prior year and an

as Rhode Island Clam Chowder available in many restaurants  According to Good Eats  the addition of tomatoes in place of milk was initially the work of Portuguese immigrants in Rhode Island  as tomato based stews were already a traditional part of Portuguese cuisine  and milk was costlier than tomatoes  Scornful New Englanders called this modified version  Manhattan style  clam chowder because  in their view  calling someone a New Yorker was an insult  citation needed  Perhaps the most unusual culinary tradition in Rhode Island is the clam cake  The clam cake  also known as a clam fritter

numbered license plate  Generally  any plates with four digits or lower are considered a status symbol  Since 1904  when the first black and white porcelain license plates were issued by the state  politicians have handed out low numbered plates as a way to reward supporters or associates  The mindset is that owners are either important enough to have a low number plate from a politician  or they come from an important family that got the plate years ago  State officials have seemingly legitimized this furor by making Rhode Island one of the few states in the country which allows the owner to will license plates to other family members  as well as holding an official license plate lottery through the Governor s Office in the past years  The caveat however depends on the category of the license plate  the general  Ocean State  is the most valuable followed by  Combination  or  Suburban  license plates  license plates under the category  Taxi    Commercial    State    Public
