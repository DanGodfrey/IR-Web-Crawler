The series originated from Frog Baseball  a 1992 short film by Judge  After seeing the short  MTV signed Judge to develop the concept  3  4 Beavis and Butt head originally aired from March 8  1993 to November 28  1997  It was revived in 2011 and new episodes began airing on MTV on October 27  5  The series has retained a cult following  Later  reruns aired on other Viacom properties  including Comedy Central and UPN  In 1996  the series was adapted into the animated feature film Beavis and Butt head Do America  The show centers on two socially awkward  rock metal loving teenage delinquents  Beavis and Butt head  both voiced by Judge   who live in the town of Highland  Texas  They have no apparent adult supervision at home  are dimwitted  woefully undereducated  barely literate  and lack any empathy or moral scruples  even regarding each other  Their most common shared activity is watching music videos  which they tend to judge by deeming them  cool   or by claiming   This sucks   They also apply these judgments to other things that they encounter  and will usually deem something  cool  if it is associated with violence  sex  or the macabre  Despite having no experience with women  their other signature trait is their obsession with sex  and their tendency to chuckle and giggle whenever they hear words or phrases that can even remotely be construed as sexual or scatological  Each episode features a few interstitial scenes in which they view videos in this manner  their commentary improvised by Judge  with the rest of the episode depicting them embarking on some scheme or adventure  6  7  They attend Highland High School  where their teachers are often at a loss as to how to deal with them  in many episodes they skip school altogether  Their actions sometimes have dire consequences  often for others   for which they show no remorse whatsoever  This has been a source of controversy as the show has been accused of promoting dangerous behavior

Statements consisting only of original research may be removed  More details may be available on the talk page   November 2011   edit  Main characters  edit  Beavis Main article  Beavis Beavis is voiced by Mike Judge  He has an underbite and a fixed countenance  which is almost always shown in profile  Like Butt head  Beavis compulsively laughs and grunts  He picks his nose  He is the more excitable of the two  despite his obliviousness to what should be obvious  he is prone to moments of insight  He is more polite and more optimistic than Butt head  He often suffers physically in the show  either at the hands of Butt head or various other characters or situations  He usually takes the beating and screams in pain before quickly reverting to his trademark laugh  Before controversy erupted  see below  he exhibited an obsession with fire and his trademark phrase was  FIRE  FIRE   which he would utter with a maniacal gaze in his eye   He also used to smoke before the controversy   One episode depicted him as having voices in his head  which told him to engage in destructive activities  however  generally he has a passive demeanor in contrast to Butt Head s more dominant personality  Beavis also wears a blue Metallica shirt with grey shorts   Beavis s shirt in trademark posters  T shirts and other merchandise reads  Death Rock    When Beavis consumes large amounts of caffeine or sugar  he transforms into his hyperactive alter ego  Cornholio  Beavis s laugh was based on a  straight A  classmate of creator Mike Judge s  who had a guttural laugh  8   edit  Butt head Main article  Butt head Voiced by Mike Judge  Has squinty eyes and a drooping nose with prominent nostrils  His top gums are often exposed due to a small upper lip and he speaks nasally with a deep voice and a slight lisp  He begins almost every statement with  Uhhhhhh     and ends with his short trademark laugh  Uh huh huh huh   Calmer though cockier and marginally more intelligent than Beavis Butt Head is oblivious to subtlety of any sort and is usually completely confident in everything he says and does  no matter how ridiculous or frivolous it is unless it has to do with females  in which case he either wavers or comes on too strongly  His trademark phrase when approaching women is  Hey baby   As the more dominant personality of the duo  he seems to derive pleasure from regularly abusing Beavis  Butt Head rarely gets perceptibly angry about anything  his usual expression of dissatisfaction being a resigned  This sucks  huh huh huh   He also frequently has to try to calm the more mercurial Beavis down  either telling him to  settle down  Beavis  huh huh huh   or in more drastic cases  slap him  Butt Head also wears a gray AC DC shirt with red shorts   Butt Head s shirt in other media reads  Skull    Judge has stated he got the idea for the name  Butt Head  from two people he knew during his childhood called  Iron Butt   who encouraged people to kick him in the butt to demonstrate his strength  and  Butt Head   9   edit  Tom Anderson Voiced by Mike Judge  The nearsighted  elderly neighbor of Beavis and Butt Head  He often hires them to do chores which results in their destroying his yard  home  or personal belongings  Due to his poor eyesight and mild senility  he never seems to recognize the two and he never remembers their names  in one episode the two wore horn rimmed glasses in an absurd disguise which Anderson did not notice   He served in the Navy during World War II and the Korean War  His character is similar in look and voice to the Hank Hill character from Judge s subsequent series  King of the Hill as both were based on the same collection of elderly men from Judge s youth   edit  David Van Driessen Voiced by Mike Judge  A teacher at Highland High School and arguably the only person who cares about Beavis and Butt Head  Ever the idealist  he never gives up on educating and enlightening the duo no matter how disastrous his attempts to do so turn out  Not only are his efforts with the two always failures  they laugh at him and are completely oblivious to his genuine concern for them  Van Driessen is a devoted hippie with a forgiving nature and gentle demeanor  His repeated attempts to teach the duo useful life lessons typically end in disaster as they almost always deduce the wrong message  He often plays songs on his acoustic guitar which typically end in him being severely hurt and in some cases almost killed  He has been shown teaching classes on biology  art  animation  economics  health  history  math  and literature  among others  Van Driessen is fired from his job in the  School Test  episode by Principal McVicker  who blamed him for Beavis and Butt Head being  so damn stupid   He also owns a substantial 8 track tape collection  which is ruined in one episode by Beavis and Butt Head  His voice and personality are similar to and may serve as a basis of sort for the character of Gerald Goode in Judge s latest animated series The Goode Family  Mike Judge has stated Van Driessen was his favourite character after Beavis to voice  He based it on an interviewer he overheard during his time in a band  8   edit  Coach Bradley Buzzcut Voiced by Mike Judge  Another of the duo s high school teachers and the antithesis of Van Driessen  Angry  impatient and short tempered Buzzcut is a Vietnam War veteran who served in the Marine Corps and  with the possible exception of Principal McVicker  hates the duo more than any other character  He is shown substitute teaching regular classes but usually teaches physical education  It has been implied that he has on occasion committed assault and battery against the duo  Coach Buzzcut drives a Jeep Grand Wagoneer  Even though Buzzcut s first name  Bradley  was never revealed in the series  it was revealed to be  Bradley  in This Book Sucks   edit  Principal McVicker Voiced by Mike Judge  McVicker is the Principal of Highland High and hates the duo  The two have unintentionally ruined his life  Many episodes begin with Beavis and Butt Head in his office  They refer to him as  McDicker   He is constantly stressed out due to having to deal with Beavis and Butt Head  he shakes when he speaks  he is frequently rummaging through his desk for prescription medications including Maalox  and in one early episode he is shown guzzling a bottle of Old Crow  In the original series finale  when he thought that Beavis and Butt Head were dead  he immediately stopped shaking and became much calmer and more cheerful  His mannerisms were based on a band director for Judge s ninth grade class  It was revealed in  Dumb Design  that he survived his heart attack and is present in the new episodes   edit  Daria Morgendorffer Main article  Daria Morgendorffer Voiced by Tracy Grandstaff  Daria is a sarcastic  vaguely alt rockerish  nerdy girl who attends Highland High with Beavis and Butt Head and she is one of the few people who sees the two for what they truly are  While not above taking jabs at them for their lack of intelligence  she also offers occasional help and advice  The duo nicknamed her  Diarrhea  but once said she was cool after she asked President Clinton a pertinent question during a school assembly  She eventually went on to star in her own spin off series  Daria  Daria is not featured in the newer episodes  but she will make a cameo  according to an August 2011 Rolling Stone interview with Mike Judge   In  Drones  Beavis says that she killed herself  while Butt Head argues that she moved away  She was the only character created at the request of MTV  who wanted a female character who could tolerate and handle the duo Judge agreed with the idea  and worked on her with series writer David Felton  8   edit  Todd Ianuzzi Originally voiced by Mike Judge in  The Crush   later by Rottilio Michieli  Todd is a trashy deadbeat and violent criminal  Although Beavis and Butt Head greatly admire him and aspire to join his  gang   Todd despises the two and frequently beats them up and takes advantage of them when he needs something  such as money  or a place to hide from other gangs or the police  although in  A Great Day  he does thank them for giving him some gas money and allows them to watch him beat up someone who bumped into his car  Beavis and Butt head seem to be to Todd what Stewart is to them  In the episode  Steamroller  it is said that Todd had dropped out of school two years before  Even though Todd s last name  Ianuzzi  was never revealed in the series  it was revealed to be  Ianuzzi  in This Book Sucks  Writers Sam Johnson and Chris Marcil suggested the idea of a character that the lads idolize even though he beats them up  Judge would base Todd on a teenaged bully that lived near him and terrified him as a kid  8   edit  Stewart Stevenson Voiced by Adam Welsh  A nerdy  wimpy  obese short boy who admires Beavis and Butt Head and mistakenly believes they are his best friends  Beavis and Butt Head relate to him mostly as Todd relates to them  They bully Stewart and regularly take advantage of his attempts to befriend them usually resulting in Stewart getting in trouble with his parents for something actually done by Beavis and Butt Head  Stewart wears a black Winger t shirt as a not so subtle reinforcement of his wimpiness  as opposed to the  coolness  of Beavis and Butt Head wearing Metallica and AC DC t shirts    edit  Minor characters Main article  List of minor characters in Beavis and Butt Head  edit  Holiday specials Four holiday specials were produced one for Halloween  two for Christmas and one for Thanksgiving  The Halloween special  titled  Bungholio  Lord of the Harvest  Butt O Ween    involved them attempting to trick or treat in ridiculous costumes  i e  Beavis dressed up as a giant nad by wearing underpants on his head and Butt Head becoming nachos by pouring hot cheese sauce over his head  although at one point he said he was dressed up as a dumbass  When Beavis eats all of Tom Anderson s candy  his Cornholio persona emerges and embarks on a rampage to acquire more from other trick or treaters  while Butt Head is taken on a  ride  to the countryside in Todd s trunk  where he encounters a strangely pale old farmer  When Beavis finally comes down from his sugar high  he is hanging on a meathook in the farmer s barn  where the old man and a similarly pale Butt Head seemingly attack him with chainsaws as the episode fades to blood red   The duo  of course  both re appear unharmed in future episodes   The first Christmas special featured the pair sitting in front of the television providing crude commentary on various aspects of Christmas  and commenting on Christmas themed music videos from various artists  The second Christmas special was simply titled  Beavis and Butt Head Christmas Special   or alternately  Beavis and Butt Head Do Christmas   It consisted of two segments that parodied A Christmas Carol directed by Tony Kluck and It s a Wonderful Life directed by former DreamWorks Animation director Mike deSeve  as well as Christmas themed music videos  taken from the first Christmas special  and several segments in which Butt Head answered fan mail dressed as Santa Claus while whipping a reindeer costumed Beavis  The MTV Thanksgiving Special  Beavis and Butt Head Do Thanksgiving  aired on November 27  1997  the day before the series finale Beavis and Butt Head Are Dead written by Andy Rheingold and Scott Sonneborn The bit featured Kurt Loder as the show s host  half reluctantly and half resigned  trying to teach the two characters the meaning of Thanksgiving as they report live from the Macy s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City  where they take more interest in people s butts and porn shops than anything else  Among others  the special featured appearances by Adam Sandler  LL Cool J  Jay Z  R E M   Ozzy Osbourne  Marilyn Manson  Ol  Dirty Bastard  Tori Amos  and the Beastie Boys  Also featured were two music videos   Long Hard Road Out of Hell  by Marilyn Manson and  Criminal  by Fiona Apple  not included in any of the show s regular episodes  The Thanksgiving special only aired once  and its inclusion in the Mike Judge Collection DVD set shows it in a heavily edited format without the music videos or the celebrity appearances   edit  Critiques of music videos One of the most well known aspects of the series was the inclusion of music videos  which occurred between animated segments  The duo would watch and make humorous observations  about the band  a song s lyrics  and or a video s visuals   or simply engage in nonsensical dialogs  Mike Judge always improvised the video comments  Almost all the animations of Beavis and Butt Head during the videos were re used from earlier episodes  9   edit  Critical assessments and controversy Over its run  Beavis and Butt Head drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reactions from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society  10  It became the focus of criticism from social conservatives  such as Michael Medved  while others  such as David Letterman  and the conservative magazine National Review  defended it as a cleverly subversive vehicle for social criticism and a particularly creative and intelligent comedy  Either way  the show captured the imaginations of many young television viewers in the United States and abroad and is often considered a classic piece of 1990s youth culture and Generation X  Trey Parker and Matt Stone  creators of South Park  cite the show as an influence and compared it to the blues  and met Mike Judge before the show aired  11  In 1997  Dan Tobin of The Boston Phoenix commented on the series  humor  stating that it transformed  stupidity into a crusade  forcing us to acknowledge how little it really takes to make us laugh   12  In 1997 Ted Drozdowski of The Boston Phoenix described the 1997 Beavis and Butt Head state as  reduced to self parody of their self parody   13  In December 2006  TV Guide ranked the duo s distinct laughing at  66 on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases  14  Mike Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes  in particular the first two  Blood Drive   Give Blood  and  Door to Door  which he described as  awful  I don t know why anybody liked it    I was burying my head in the sand   8   edit  Allegations of promoting dangerous behavior Early installments gave them a juvenile obsession with fire and dangerous behavior  summed up with Beavis  chant of  Fire  Fire     The show was blamed for a two year old s death which occurred in Moraine  Ohio in October 1993 in which a five year old boy set fire to his mother s mobile home  killing his two year old sister  15  The mother later claimed that her son had watched one of the fire related segments shortly before he burned down the home  15  although  according to an article in the March 24  1994 issue of Rolling Stone  neighbors claimed that the family did not have cable television  As a result  the references were excised from further airings  The creators found a censorship loophole and took delight in sometimes making Beavis scream things that sounded very similar to his previous  Fire  Fire    such as  Fryer  Fryer   when he and Butt Head are working the late shift at Burger World  and also having him almost say the forbidden word  such as one time when he sang  Liar  liar  pants on     and pausing before  fire   in the  Liar  Liar   episode   There was also a music video where a man runs on fire in slow motion   California  by Wax   Beavis is hypnotized by it and can barely say  Fire   References to fire were cut from earlier episodes   even the original tapes were altered permanently  16  Other episodes MTV opted not to rerun included  Stewart s House  and  Way Down Mexico Way   Early episodes with the controversial content intact are rare  and are traded on homemade video recordings made from the original broadcasts  In an interview included with the recent Mike Judge Collection DVD set  Judge said he was uncertain if some of the earlier episodes still existed in their uncensored form  In new episodes after the 2011 revival Beavis is now allowed to say fire again  17  18  the first words uttered by Beavis in the first video segment of the 2011 premiere episode were   Fire  Fire   In February 1994  watchdog group Morality in Media claimed that the death of 8 month old Natalia Rivera  struck by a bowling ball thrown from an overpass onto a Jersey City  New Jersey highway near the Holland Tunnel by 18 year old Calvin J  Settle  was partially inspired by Beavis and Butt Head  19  The group said that Settle was influenced by the episode titled  Ball Breakers   in which Beavis and Butt Head loaded a bowling ball with explosives and dropped it from a rooftop  19  While Morality in Media claimed that the show inspired Settle s actions  the case s prosecutors did not  Later it was revealed by both prosecutors and the defendant as well  that Settle did not have cable TV and did not watch the show   edit  Responses by writers and MTV In one episode titled  Lightning Strikes   the show parodied blaming actions on youth culture  When asked by a reporter why they were flying a kite in a rainstorm  the duo explained that they were inspired by a documentary about Benjamin Franklin  Not satisfied  the reporter continued asking them leading questions until they mentioned that they had watched some rock music videos earlier in the day  The reporter then expresses the conclusion to her audience that the music videos are to blame for the duo s actions  MTV also responded by broadcasting the program after 11 00 P M   and included a disclaimer  reminding viewers that  Beavis and Butt Head are not real  They are stupid cartoon people completely made up by this Texas guy whom we hardly even know  Beavis and Butt Head are dumb  crude  thoughtless  ugly  sexist  self destructive fools  But for some reason  the little wienerheads make us laugh  This was later changed to  Beavis and Butt Head are not role models  They re not even human  they re cartoons  Some of the things they do could cause a person to get hurt  expelled  arrested  possibly deported  To put it another way  Don t try this at home  This disclaimer also appears before the opening of their Sega Genesis and Super NES game as well as their Windows game Beavis and Butt head in Virtual Stupidity  They were famously lambasted by Democratic senator Fritz Hollings as  Buffcoat and Beaver   20  This subsequently became a running gag on the show where adults mispronounced their names  Tom Anderson originally calling them  Butthole and Joe   and believing the two to be of Asian ethnicity  describing them to the police as  Oriental    In later episodes  Tom Anderson uses the Hollings mispronunciation once  and on at least one occasion refers to them as  Penis and Butt Munch   President Clinton called them  Beamis and Bum head  in one episode  as well as in the movie  where an old lady consistently calls them  Travis  and  Bob head   In one episode of the series  when another student threatens to kill them  the duo uses this to their advantage  pretending to be exchange students named  Crevis and Bung Head   Beavis and Butt Head have been compared to idiot savants because of their creative and subversively intelligent observations of music videos  This part of the show was mostly improvised by Mike Judge  With regard to criticisms of the two as  idiots   Judge responded that a show about straight A students would not be funny   edit  Film Main article  Beavis and Butt Head Do America In 1996  a full length movie featuring the duo titled Beavis and Butt Head Do America was released in theaters  The movie features the voices of Bruce Willis  Demi Moore  Cloris Leachman  Robert Stack  Eric Bogosian  Richard Linklater  Greg Kinnear  in an uncredited role   and David Letterman  credited as Earl Hofert   It gained mostly positive reviews from film critics and a  two thumbs up  from Siskel and Ebert  The film earned over  60 million at the domestic box office  a strong return for a film that cost only  5 million to produce  Also  in recent interviews  Judge claims that he is interested in producing a live action movie  He said that previously he despised the idea  but now he thinks  maybe there s something there   21  During an interview for Collider on August 25  2009  Judge told them   I like to keep the door open on Beavis and Butt Head  because it s my favorite thing that I ve ever done  It s the thing I m most proud of   However  he also added   Another movie    the problem is it takes a year and half  two years  two and a half years maybe to do that right  And that s a pretty strong level of commitment  I m going to look at that again  That comes up every three years   One of his ideas is bringing back the characters as old men  instead of teenagers   I kind of think of them as being either 15 or in their 60s   he said   I wouldn t mind doing something with them as these two dirty old men sitting on the couch   Judge added that he wouldn t completely ignore the time that has passed in between   At one point I thought Butt Head might do okay on some really low level sales job   While the TV show went into reruns  Mike Judge went on to make movies  he directed such films as Extract  Idiocracy  and Office Space  which found favor with moviegoers and later became cult classics   edit  Revival On July 14  2010  a spokesperson for MTV Networks informed a New York Post reporter that Mike Judge is creating a new Beavis and Butt Head series  that Judge will reprise his voice acting roles for the show  and that the animation will be hand drawn  According to TMZ  MTV has not asked Tracy Grandstaff to reprise her role as Daria Morgendorffer  22  Later  in a Rolling Stone interview  Mike Judge was asked if Daria is coming back and he said  No  There s sort of a cameo in one episode  That ll be a surprise   18  As in the old series  Beavis and Butt Head are high school students who  among other things  criticize contemporary music videos  23  In an interview with Rolling Stone  MTV president Van Toffler said that the duo will also watch Jersey Shore  Ultimate Fighting Championship matches  and amateur videos from YouTube  as well as give movie reviews   The biggest change is obviously the references are updated  it s set in modern day  and there s going to be a movie review segment   Linn said   Otherwise they re still true to their prior passions   24  John Altschuler  formerly a writer for King of the Hill  told a Rolling Stone reporter that he saw signs that Mike Judge was thinking of reviving Beavis and Butt Head  On more than one occasion  Judge told the writers that one of their ideas for an episode of King of the Hill would work well for Beavis and Butt Head  eventually he concluded   Maybe we should just actually make some good Beavis and Butt Head episodes   Later  a Lady Gaga video convinced Van Toffler of the tenability of a Beavis and Butt Head revival   I felt like there was a whole crop of new artists and what the world sorely missed was the point of view that only Beavis and Butt Head could bring   24  As part of a promotional campaign for the new series  cinemas screening Jackass 3D opened the feature film with a 3 D Beavis and Butt Head short subject  Months later  in a media presentation on February 2  2011  MTV announced that the series would premiere in mid 2011  On July 21  2011 Mike Judge spoke and fielded questions on a panel at Comic Con International  A preview of the episode  Holy Cornholio  was also shown  25  Judge told Rolling Stone that at least 24 episodes  12 half hour programs  will definitely air  18  It was initially rumored that Judge was working on 30 new episodes for the network  26  The new episodes debuted in the United States and Canada on October 27  2011  The premiere was dubbed a ratings hit  with an audience of 3 3 million total viewers  27  The new season will air in the United Kingdom in early 2012  28  The main title card of the revival displays the show s title as Mike Judge s Beavis and Butt Head with Judge s name replacing the MTV logo  A Blu ray and DVD release of season 8  titled Beavis and Butt head   Volume 4  was released on February 14  2012 in the United States  29   edit  Related media A CD  The Beavis and Butt Head Experience  was released featuring many hard rock and heavy metal bands  such as Megadeth  Primus  Nirvana and White Zombie  Moreover  Beavis and Butt Head do a duet with Cher on  I Got You Babe  30  and a track by themselves called  Come to Butt Head   The track with Cher also resulted in a music video directed by Tamra Davis and Yvette Kaplan  In 1995 an adventure game based on the series was released called Beavis and Butt head in Virtual Stupidity on the PC  31  with a PlayStation port being released in Japan  Many video games  32  including Beavis and Butt Head  Beavis and Butt head in Virtual Stupidity  Beavis and Butt Head  Bunghole in One  Calling All Dorks  Little Thingies  Wiener Takes All  and Beavis and Butt Head Do U  33  In 2010  Beavis and Butt Head apps for iOS were released by MTV   edit  Marvel Comics From 1994 to 1996  Marvel Comics published a monthly Beavis and Butt Head comic 34  under the Marvel Absurd imprint by a variety of writers  but with each issue drawn by artist Rick Parker  It was also reprinted by Marvel UK  which created new editorial material  The letters page was answered by  Beavis and Butt Head  or one of their supporting characters  Instead of reviewing music videos  they reviewed  custom made  pages from other Marvel Comics in one with Ghost Rider  Beavis tries to avoid using the word  fire  to describe the character s fiery skull  In the comic  minor characters like Earl  Billy Bob  Clark Cobb  and Mistress Cora Anthrax would get repeated appearances  Earl was quite regular  and Anthrax was in two issues and got to answer a letter s page   edit  Other appearances The characters have made cameo appearances  either visually or only voices  and have been referenced in numerous television shows  such as Friends  Celebrity Deathmatch  Robot Chicken  Teen Titans and Saturday Night Live  TV Funhouse   in films such as Airheads  Clueless  Austin Powers  International Man of Mystery and Jackass 3D  and even parodied in children shows such as Tiny Toon Adventures and Arthur   edit  Daria spin off In 1997  a spin off show based on their classmate Daria Morgendorffer  Daria  was created  Mike Judge was not credited as a producer of this series and has said he was not involved with it at all  except to give permission for the use of the character  The Daria character had been created for Beavis and Butt Head by Glenn Eichler and originally designed by Bill Peckmann of J J  Sedelmaier Productions  Inc  Eichler then became a producer for Daria  35  In the first episode of Daria  she and her family move from Beavis and Butt Head s hometown of Highland to Lawndale the only references to the original show is a single mention of Highland in the first episode  with Daria saying Lawndale can t be a second Highland  unless there s uranium in the drinking water here too    edit  Home releases The first official home video releases of Beavis and Butt Head were two VHS tapes titled There Goes the Neighborhood and Work Sucks   distributed by Sony Music Video and MTV Home Video in 1996 in the United States  United Kingdom and Australia  Each tape contained approximately eight episodes  each selected from the first four seasons  Although most of the episodes were presented in complete form  minus the music video segments  a handful of episodes were edited for content  Eight more VHS compilations were released between 1996 and 1999 in the United States  before the final volume  Butt O Ween  was issued in October 1999  However  the series continued in Australia and the United Kingdom  with a further ten volumes being issued between 1999 and 2001  When the series ended in the United Kingdom  a further seven volumes were issued exclusively in Australia  meaning that over 28 volumes  all 200 episodes were released on VHS  Prior to the release of the VHS Volumes  a laserdisc titled Beavis and Butt Head  The Essential Collection was issued in 1994  containing sixteen episodes from the second and third seasons  Beavis and Butt Head Do America was also issued on Laserdisc in 1997  All of the U S  VHS Volumes were later issued on DVD in five two disc sets through the Time Life organisation  The DVD releases were titled The Best of Beavis and Butt Head  A two disc DVD set titled The History of Beavis and Butt Head was scheduled for release in September 2002 in the United States  However  its release was cancelled at the last moment at the demand of Judge  who owned approval rights for video releases of the series  Many copies were mistakenly put on store shelves on the scheduled release date  only to be immediately recalled  The set started selling on eBay at very high prices  sometimes over  300 USD  According to Judge  the History set was made up of episodes that he had previously rejected for home video release and had been prepared without his knowledge or consent  36  On November 8  2005  MTV and Paramount Home Entertainment released a three disc DVD compilation titled Beavis and Butt Head  The Mike Judge Collection  Volume 1  The DVD set includes 40 episodes and 11 music video segments
