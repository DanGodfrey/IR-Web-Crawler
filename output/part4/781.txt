transformation into a large  rocky creature  Whenever Richards is confronted with a challenge  his attention can be so focused that he can neglect even his own family  Regardless  he is the loving husband of Susan Storm  father of son Franklin Richards and daughter Valeria Richards  and mentor of his brother in law  the Human Torch  The character of Reed Richards was portrayed by Ioan Gruffudd

November 1961    edit  Fictional character biography  edit  Pre Fantastic Four Born in Central City  California  Reed is the son of Evelyn and Nathaniel Richards  Nathaniel was a scientific genius  and Reed inherited a similar level of intellect and interests  A child prodigy with special aptitude in mathematics  physics  and mechanics  Reed Richards had enrolled in college by the time he was 14  attending such prestigious universities as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  California Institute of Technology  Harvard University  Columbia University  and the fictional State University  By the age of 20  citation needed  he had several degrees in the sciences under his belt  It was at State University  not to be confused with Empire State University  that he met Benjamin J  Grimm  2  Reed had already begun designing a starship capable of traveling in hyperspace  Sharing his plans with his new roommate  Grimm jokingly volunteered to pilot the craft  When 19 year old Reed continued his education by attending Columbia University in Manhattan  he rented a room in a boarding house owned by the aunt of a young girl named Susan Storm  To his embarrassment  the girl  who was 13  instantly fell in love with him  Even though Reed had to move on  she continued to carry a torch for Richards  Also while at Columbia  he met a brilliant fellow student  Victor Von Doom  In Richards  Doom met the first person who could match him intellectually  regarding Richards as his ultimate rival  Doom became increasingly jealous of Richards  Determined to prove he was better  Doom conducted reckless experiments which eventually scarred his face and would lead him to become Doctor Doom  Moving on to Harvard  Reed earned Ph D s in both physics and electrical engineering while working as a military scientist  all this by the age of 22  citation needed  He also worked in communications for the Army  Three years later  in his mid 20s  Reed used his inheritance  along with government funding  to finance his research  Determined to go to Mars and beyond  Richards based the fateful project in Central City  Susan Storm  now a young adult  moved into the area  and within a short time  found herself engaged to Reed  Due to her family s lucrative savings and involvement in charitable foundations  she provided more funding when his money ran out  Likewise  Reed s old college roommate  Ben Grimm  now a successful test pilot and astronaut  was indeed slated to pilot the craft  All seemed well  however  when the government threatened to cut funding and cancel the project  Reed  Ben  Sue  and Sue s younger brother Johnny  agreed to sneak aboard the starship and take it up immediately  They knew they had not completed all the testing that had been planned  but Reed was confident they would be safe  Ben was initially skeptical about the unknown affects of radiation  while Reed theorized that their ship s shielding would be adequate to protect them  It was on Reed s initiative that the fateful mission which had Susan Storm  Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm accompanying him into space took place  When their ship passed through the Van Allen belt they found their cockpit bombarded with nearly lethal doses of cosmic radiation  Reed had neglected to account for the abnormal radiation levels in the belt s atmosphere  The cosmic rays wreaked havoc on the starship s insufficient shielding and they were forced to return to Earth immediately  When they crash landed they found that their bodies were changed dramatically  Reed s body was elastic and he could reshape any portion of his body at will  At his suggestion  they decided to use their new abilities to serve mankind as the Fantastic Four  Reed was chosen to lead the group  under the name  Mr  Fantastic   3  He later told his daughter  by way of a bedtime story  that the reason he suggested they become adventurers and gave them such outlandish costumes and names as  Mister Fantastic  and  The Thing  was that he knew they would likely be hated and feared for their powers without such an over the top public image  4  This history has been changed over the years in order to keep it current  In the original comics  Richards was a veteran of World War II who had served behind enemy lines in occupied France  and the goal of his space mission was a manned space flight to the moon before the Communists were able to  This was later changed to getting there before the Chinese Communists and to explore the interstellar areas of the red planet and beyond  Also  in the earlier stories  Reed was said to have met Susan when he was 23 and she was 12  but this has been retconned to a more reasonable six year age difference  citation needed   edit  Leadership of the Fantastic Four Mr  Fantastic in Fantastic Four  15  June 1963  Art by Jack Kirby  The early career of the Fantastic Four led Mister Fantastic to a number of discoveries  and had their first encounters with many unusual characters  In the team s first appearance  they battled the Mole Man  3  They then battled the Skrulls  5  Soon after that  the team encountered the Sub Mariner  6  They then had the first of many battles with Doctor Doom  7  They later journeyed to a subatomic world  8  Soon after that  they encountered Rama Tut  9  They then battled the Molecule Man  10  As the team leader  Mr  Fantastic created numerous exotic devices and vehicles for the team to use such as clothing made of  unstable molecules  so that it can be used with their powers safely  Furthermore  he often leads the team into daring expeditions such as into the Negative Zone in addition to opposing evil  Also  he has felt personally responsible for Ben Grimm s grotesque change and has labored off and on to reverse it permanently  Under his guidance  the team went on to become Earth s most celebrated band of heroes  Together  they would save the world countless times  Ever driven by his quest for knowledge  Reed is believed by most to be the Earth s foremost intelligence  There is little he cannot create  fix  or understand given time  The patents and royalties on his inventions alone have funded the group over the years  However  there are drawbacks to his association with the team  Chief among them is the team s violent encounters with Doctor Doom  who believes that Reed was responsible for the accident that scarred him  Doom has never forgiven Reed and has sworn revenge  Doom has even gone as far as transforming Reed into a monstrous freak  attacking Reed s children and attempting to seduce Sue   edit  Subplots and story arcs After many adventures as the Fantastic Four  Reed married Sue  11  Not long after that  the team encountered the Inhumans for the first time  12  13  They next encountered Galactus and the Silver Surfer  14  Reed then opened a portal to the Negative Zone for the first time  15  Soon  the team first battled the Psycho Man  16  Before long Reed and Sue had a baby  young Franklin Richards  the team battled Annihilus right before Franklin s birth  17  Franklin was a mutant with incredible powers  but  due to the cosmic ray alteration to his parents  DNA  they manifested while he was still very young  in the Marvel world  most mutants like the X Men get their powers while teenagers   Franklin appears to have power that can rival a member of the Celestials  the power of a living god in the body of a small child  The couple briefly separated  18  and Reed further alienated Sue by shutting down Franklin s mind in order to prevent his power from causing global catastrophe  19  Sue Storm initiated divorce proceedings but the two were reconciled soon after  20  Reed also saved Galactus s life during the course of his adventures  21  He then bought the Baxter Building  22  Later  he was tried by the Shi ar for saving Galactus s life  but the charges were dropped when Eternity briefly granted all those attending the trial a moment of  cosmic awareness  that allowed them to understand that Galactus was necessary for the continued well being of the universe  23  Reed s battle with Gormuu prior to getting his powers was recounted  24  Just after that  Reed was reunited with his father in an alternate timeline  25  Some time later  Reed and Sue retired from the Fantastic Four  26  and then joined the Avengers  although Reed s past experience as leader of the Fantastic Four meant that he had trouble adjusting to following Captain America s lead regardless of his respect for the other man  27  Eventually  Reed and Sue did rejoin the Fantastic Four  28  In the course of fighting an alien called Hunger  Doctor Doom was seriously injured  The Fantastic Four were also part of the battle against Hunger and Doom asked for his old enemy to take his hand  At that point they both disappeared in a flash  leaving nothing but ashes  It would appear as if the two sworn enemies had fittingly died in each others  hands  volume  amp  issue needed  However  unknown to anyone else at the time  Reed and Doom had actually been thrown back into the time of barbarians and onto an alien world by a being called Hyperstorm  Reed s grandchild from an alternate future  the child of Franklin Richards and Rachel Summers  daughter of Scott Summers and Jean Grey  They were so far into the past  and with no technology  that even their brilliant minds couldn t find a way back home  Doom was captured and held prisoner by Hyperstorm  Reed wandered aimlessly for about a year  volume  amp  issue needed  Meanwhile the rest of the FF recruited Scott Lang as scientific advisor  They even confronted an insane alternative version of Reed called the Dark Raider who was traveling from reality to reality  destroying all the various versions of himself after his own failure to save his world from Galactus in their original confrontation  volume  amp  issue needed  A while later  the remaining members of the FF along with the Sub Mariner  Lyja and Kristoff Vernard found themselves trapped in the same era as their Reed and Doom  They found Reed but faced a new problem  during his time alone  Reed had resigned himself to the reality that it was impossible for his old friends to stage a rescue and attacked them but soon realized that these truly were his friends  After returning to their own time period  he sought out Galactus as he was the only being in the Universe who could defeat Hyperstorm  Upon Hyperstorm s defeat at the hands of Galactus  the FF returned to the present day where they continued their lives  not only as a team  but as a family  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Onslaught and Heroes Reborn Shortly after their return  the FF were confronted by a being called Onslaught  Onslaught took control of an army of Sentinels and invaded New York City  hunting down every mutant being he could find  Onslaught wished to add the abilities of the godlike Franklin Richards to his own  Only through the apparent sacrifice of the Fantastic Four s own lives and that of many of the heroes in the Marvel universe was Onslaught finally vanquished  The heroes would have died then and there if not for Franklin  who created an alternate reality for them to reside in  Completely oblivious to what had taken place  Reed and his compatriots relived most of their lives  In their absence the Fantastic Four s headquarters  Four Freedoms Plaza  was annihilated by a super villain group called the Masters of Evil  posing as heroes  The Thunderbolts  One year later  Franklin returned with his family along with the other heroes from the parallel reality  Reed was overjoyed to see his son again  but he and the rest of the FF found themselves without a home  moving into Reed s storage warehouse on Pier 4  overlooking the East River  Making this their home  the Fantastic Four continued with their lives  eventually managing to move back into the Baxter Building  It has emerged that Reed is one of the members of the  Illuminati   unknown to his wife  He is also in possession of the  Power  gem of the Infinity Gauntlet   edit  Pro Registration Main article  Civil War  comics  In Marvel s Civil War miniseries and crossover event  Reed Richards is one of the leading figures  along with Iron Man  on the side which is in favor of the Superhuman Registration Act  He speculates that this will lead to conflict with his wife  which came true in issue  4 of the miniseries when a clone of Thor  created by him and Tony Stark  went out of control and killed Goliath and nearly killed all the rest of the Secret Avengers until Sue Storm stepped in and saved them  Soon after  Sue left Reed  along with Johnny  to join the Secret Avengers in hopes that it would drive Reed to end the conflict quickly  In The Amazing Spider Man  535  which takes place shortly before the events of Civil War  5  Peter Parker demands to see the conditions inside the detention facility designed by Reed to hold unregistered superhumans  After being escorted to and from the prison by Iron Man  Parker returns with more doubts than ever about whether he is on the right side and asks Reed why he supports the Superhuman Registration Act  a question Reed answers by telling the story of his paternal uncle  Ted  A professional writer  Reed remembers his uncle as  funny    colorful   and  accepting   As a boy  Reed loved spending time with Ted  Unfortunately  Ted was also  an eccentric  and  stubborn   Because he had a career in the arts and because he stood out  Ted was called before HUAC  imprisoned on contempt of Congress charges for six months  and was unable to find work after he d served his sentence  He was even shunned by Reed s father  Ted lost everything  which Reed says finally  killed him  without going into greater detail  Richards opines that his uncle was wrong to take such a stand  to pick a fight he couldn t win  and to fail to respect the law  However Fantastic Four  542 reveals that the real reason for supporting the registration act is due to his development of a working version of Isaac Asimov s fictional psychohistory concept  His application of this science indicates to him that billions will die in escalating conflicts without the presence of the act  In the final battle of the war  he is shot by Taskmaster  saving Sue Storm s life  With Reed on the brink of death  a furious Susan strikes Taskmaster with a telekinetic field  Reed survives  however  and Sue returns to him in the aftermath of the battle  having been granted amnesty  Seeking to repair the damage done to their marriage as a result of the war  Sue and Reed take time off from the Fantastic Four  but ask Storm and the Black Panther to take their places in the meantime   edit  World War Hulk Within the midst of Civil War  Reed Richards learned from a brief conversation with Mastermind Excello that the Hulk is not on the planet where the Illuminati attempted to exile him  After a conversation over the good the Hulk has done for humanity  Reed tells Iron Man of what happened to the Hulk and also states that the Hulk has friends  and  may God help us if they find him before we do   volume  amp  issue needed  Within the aftermath of Civil War  Reed Richards had been keeping tabs on Mastermind Excello and when the She Hulk learned about the Hulk s exile  Reed Richards sends out Doc Samson to confront her when he sees her meeting with Mastermind Excello  volume  amp  issue needed  In World War Hulk  1  Reed is shown with Tony Stark as Iron Man  Both men were trying to convince Sentry to fight the Hulk  thinking that the calm aura that the Sentry produces may be able to stop the Hulk s rampage  29  In World War Hulk  2  with the aid of the rest of the Fantastic Four  Storm  and the Black Panther  Reed is able to create a machine that projects an image of the Sentry and recreates the hero s aura of calm  He uses the machine on the Hulk just as he is about to defeat the Thing  but the Hulk knows it is not the real Sentry and destroys the machine  In a last line of defense  Sue Storm tries to protect her husband by encapsulating the Hulk in an energy field while pleading with him to spare Reed  The Hulk does not listen and is able to easily exert enough strength against her force field to cause Susan to collapse and experience a nosebleed from the stress  before she dooms Reed to the Hulk s wrath  30  Reed is later seen among the various heroes that the Hulk defeated so far  within the depths of the Hulk s Gladiator arena located within Madison Square Garden  He and all of the heroes are implanted with  obedience disks  that are used to suppress their powers  volume  amp  issue needed  These disks are the same that were used upon the Hulk during his time on Sakaar  31  The Hulk orders Iron Man and Mr  Fantastic to face off in battle  Richards  after having the upper hand on Stark  is then given the thumbs down by Hulk  instructing Richards to kill Stark  32  However the Hulk spares their lives  showing them that he proved his point to the world  They survived the encounter by Hulk s mercy and the timely intervention of the Sentry  The Illuminati are partially cleared from the responsibility of Sakaar s destruction when Miek  one of the Hulk s alien allies  admits he saw the Red King forces breach the ship s warp core  Miek kept quiet to initiate what he felt was Hulk s destiny as the  Worldbreaker   33   edit  Secret Invasion Main article  Secret Invasion Mister Fantastic was at the Illuminati s meeting discussing the threat of the Skrulls when the Black Bolt with them was revealed to be a Skrull in disguise  Mister Fantastic and Hank Pym autopsy the body of the Skrull who impersonated Elektra  with Reed pretending to be seeing the corpse for the first time  thus keeping the secret of the Illuminati   After completing the dissection  Reed claims to have discovered the secret of how the Skrulls have been able to conceal their identities  Before he can elaborate   Hank Pym  reveals himself to be a Skrull and shoots Richards with a weapon that violently leaves his elastic body in a state of chaotic disarray similar to Silly String  34  In Secret Invasion  Fantastic Four  1  it is shown that a Skrull assumed Reed s form in order to successfully ambush and capture Sue Richards  to facilitate an attack on the Fantastic Four s headquarters  A conscious but still mostly shapeless Reed Richards is seen being forcibly stretched in all directions to cover the floor of a medium sized arena aboard a Skrull ship  with all of the seats filled by Skrull onlookers  35  He is freed by Abigail Brand  and then travels with her to the Savage Land and uses a device to reveal all the Skrull invaders present  36  After helping the

expelling them from the Initiative and stripping them all their rights  Taking place a week from the Secret Invasion  which has caused Richards to seriously reevaluate his own life and the life he has built for his family  resulting in turbulent internal conflicts  Richards  as he takes a long  hard look at the life  is prompted to construct a machine that is capable of bending reality itself  to do so  Agents from H A M M E R   sent by Norman Osborn  a man well aware Reed is one of the few that has intellect exceeding even his own and thus pose a great threat to his carefully constructed shadow world  arrive just as Reed activates the machine  interfacing with the Baxter Building s power supply  resulting in an energy flactuation that sends Sue  Ben and Johnny back to the prehistoric era  fraught with dangers  which manifest in the form of the First Celestial Host  Reed searches for answers which can only be found in alternate timelines as the three find themselves in a super hero Hyborian age civil war  Franklin and Valeria are the only ones available to confront the agents Osborn sent  Richards studies other parallel Earths to see if any found a peaceful solution to the Civil War  which resulted from the Superhuman Registration Act  Reed peers into different worlds  some more bizarre than our own  to see what they did differently  This is an insightful look into where the Marvel Universe has gone in the past  year   in Marvel time  and to see who was at fault  if anyone  Reed meets with the other five Illuminati to handle the problem  Ultimately  after seeing about a million alternate Earths  he had concluded that there was no way for the Civil War to be resolved but that he  as the cleverest man in the Marvel Universe  had a responsibility to put things right  But before turning the machine off  he searches for other realities where they have the same machines he is using  the machine locates them and the people he finds tell him that they can help him  40  Reed Richards reappeared in Mighty Avengers  24 refusing to give Hank Pym an invention previously left in the care of the Fantastic Four  following Bill Foster s untimely death  41  causing the Wasp to lead the team of Mighty Avengers to retrieve the device  In the next issue  Pym s attempting to knock down the Baxter Building  due to Loki s manipulations  likely  sows further displeasure and leads to a direct conflict between the Fantastic Four and Loki s Mighty Avengers  stretching across to Mighty Avengers  26  This conflict eventually ends in a new base for the Mighty Avengers and a shockingly disturbing alliance of the Dark Reign  the next issue of the Mighty Avengers will show a new character  a ruler known as the Unspoken  one more powerful than any other in the universe  to

Future Foundation Tragedy strikes the team when Johnny is apparently killed in the Negative Zone  volume  amp  issue needed  As the Fantastic Four recover from Johnny s death  Mister Fantastic grows disillusioned at how scientists see science and its applications  Therefore  he creates a new team  the Future Foundation  to help create a better future for mankind  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Powers and abilities Reed Richards gained the power of elasticity from irradiation by cosmic rays  He has the ability to convert his entire body into a highly malleable state at will  allowing him to stretch  deform  and reform himself into virtually any shape  Reed Richards has been observed as being able to utilize his stretching form in a variety of offensive and defensive manners  such as compressing himself into a ball and ricocheting into enemies or flattening himself into a trampoline or a parachute to rescue a teammate  Reed is also able to shape his hands into hammer and mace style weapons  and concentrate his mass into his fist  All of these feats used to require extreme concentration  however  due to mental and physical training  he can now perform these feats at will  The most extreme demonstration of Reed s powers is when at one point he was able to increase his size and mass to Thing like proportions which also increased his physical strength  volume  amp  issue needed  Despite this  Reed Richards  strength comes more from the powers of his mind than the powers of his body  indeed  he once told Spider Man that he considers his stretching powers to be expendable compared to his intellect 43   although it has been implied that Reed s intellect may be a result of his powers  as he once visited an alternate universe where his other self had never been exposed to cosmic rays and was notably less intelligent than him 44    For virtually his entire publication history  Richards has been depicted as the most intelligent human in the Marvel Universe  A visionary theoretician and an inspired machine smith  he has made breakthroughs in such varied fields as space travel  time travel  extra dimensional travel  biochemistry  robotics  computers  synthetic polymers  communications  mutations  transportation  holography  energy generation  spectral analysis and more  However  he is never afraid to admit when others have greater expertise in certain fields than him  such as recognizing that Doctor Octopus possesses greater knowledge of radiation  45  that Hank Pym is a superior biochemist  46  or that Spider Man can think of a problem from a biology perspective where he would be unable to do so  since his expertise is in physics  47    Richards has earned Ph D s in mathematics  physics  and engineering  His patents are so valuable that he is able to bankroll the Fantastic Four  Inc   without any undue financial stress  Mind control is rarely effective on him and when it does work  it wears off sooner than it would a normal person  due to what he describes as an  elastic consciousness   Richards is also an accomplished fighter due to his years of combat experience with the Fantastic Four  and has earned a black belt in judo  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Equipment and technology Reed  alongside his son Franklin and the Human Torch working on the Fantasticar in the FF s Antarctic base  after returning from an interstellar adventure   Fantastic Four vol 3  1   Although the Fantastic Four have numerous devices  crafts  and weapons  there are some items that Reed Richards carries with him at all times  Fantastiflare  Launches a fiery  4  into the sky that is used during combat situations to let other members of the group know their location  Uniform Computer  Like all the Fantastic Four s costumes and the rest of Reed s wardrobe  his suit is made of  unstable molecules   This means that the suit is attuned to his powers  which is why Johnny s costume doesn t burn when he  flames on   Sue s costume turns invisible when she does  and Reed s costume stretches with him  The costume also insulates them from electrical assaults  In addition  the team s uniforms are also  in essence  wearable computers  Their costumes have a complete data processing and telemetry system woven into the material of the uniform on a molecular level  This forms a network with the entire team  providing a constant  real time uplink of everyone s physical condition as well as their location and current situation  The suit is capable of displaying data and touch pad controls on the gauntlets  Its sensors can track all of the team s uniforms and provide a picture of their immediate vicinity  The suit has an intricate scanner system which can detect things around the wearer  from how many people are in the next room to what dimension or planet they are on  Reed can also up link the bodysuit to any computer by stretching his fingertips to filament size and plugging them into an I O data port  With this  Reed can establish a fairly comprehensive database of any computer s cybernetic protocols and encryption algorithms   edit  Other versions Main article  Alternative versions of Mister Fantastic
