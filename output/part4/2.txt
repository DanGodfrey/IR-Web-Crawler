York City on December 28  1922  in the apartment of his Romanian born Jewish immigrant parents  Celia  n e Solomon  and Jack Lieber  at the corner of West 98th Street and West End Avenue in Manhattan  His father  trained as a dress cutter  worked only sporadically after the Great Depression  1  and the family moved further uptown to Fort Washington Avenue  2  in Washington Heights  Manhattan  When Lee was nearly 9  his only sibling  brother Larry Lieber  was born  3  He said in 2006 that as a child he was influenced by books and movies  particularly those with Errol Flynn playing heroic roles  4  By the time Lee was in his teens  the family was living in a one bedroom apartment at 1720 University Avenue in The Bronx  Lee described it as  a third floor apartment facing out back   with him and his brother sharing a bedroom and his parents using a foldout couch  3  Lee attended DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx  5  As a youth  Lee enjoyed writing  and entertained dreams of one day writing The Great American Novel  6  He has said that as a youth he worked such part time jobs as writing obituaries for a news service and press releases for the National Tuberculosis Center  delivering sandwiches for the Jack May pharmacy to offices in Rockefeller Center  working as an office boy for a trouser manufacturer  ushering at the Rivoli Theater on Broadway  citation needed  and selling subscriptions to the New York Herald Tribune newspaper  He graduated high school early  at age 16  in 1939  and joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project  7  A text filler in Captain America Comics  3  May 1941  was Lee s first published work  Cover art by Alex Schomburg   edit  Career  edit  Early career With the help of his uncle  Robbie Solomon  8  9  Lee that same year became an assistant at the new Timely Comics division of pulp magazine and comic book publisher Martin Goodman s company  9  Timely  by the 1960s  would evolve into Marvel Comics  Lee  whose cousin Jean 10  was Goodman s wife  was formally hired by Timely editor Joe Simon  9  His duties were prosaic at first   In those days  the artists  dipped the pen in ink   so  I had to make sure the inkwells were filled   Lee recalled in 2009   I went down and got them their lunch  I did proofreading  I erased the pencils from the finished pages for them   11  Marshaling his childhood ambition to be a writer  young Stanley Lieber made his comic book debut with the text filler  Captain America Foils the Traitor s Revenge  in Captain America Comics  3  May 1941   using the pseudonym  Stan Lee   which years later he would adopt as his legal name  Lee later explained in his autobiography and numerous other sources that he had intended to save his given name for more literary work  This initial story also introduced Captain America s trademark ricocheting shield toss  which immediately became one of the character s signatures  12  He graduated from writing filler to actual comics with a backup feature    Headline  Hunter  Foreign Correspondent   two issues later  Lee s first superhero co creation was the Destroyer  in Mystic Comics  6  Aug 1941   Other characters he created during this period fans and historians call the Golden Age of comics include Jack Frost  debuting in USA Comics  1  Aug  1941   and Father Time  debuting in Captain America Comics  6  Aug  1941   13  When Simon and his creative partner Jack Kirby left late in 1941  following a dispute with Goodman  the 30 year old publisher installed Lee  just under 19 years old  as interim editor  14  The youngster showed a knack for the business that led him to remain as the comic book division s editor in chief  as well as art director for much of that time  until 1972  when he would succeed Goodman as publisher  15  16  Lee entered the United States Army in early 1942 and served stateside in the Signal Corps  writing manuals  training films  and slogans  and occasionally cartooning  His military classification  he says  was  playwright   he adds that only nine men in the U S  Army were given that title  17 Vincent Fago  editor of Timely s  animation comics  section  which put out humor and funny animal comics  filled in until Lee returned from his World War II military service in 1945  Lee now lived in the rented top floor of a brownstone in the East 90s in Manhattan  18  He married Joan Clayton Boocock on December 5  1947  1  and in 1949  the couple bought a two story  three bedroom home at 1084 West Broadway in Woodmere  New York  on Long Island  living there through 1952  19  By this time  the couple had daughter Joan Celia  J C   Lee  born in 1950  another child  Jan Lee  died three days after delivery in 1953  1  Lee by this time had bought a home at 226 Richards Lane in the Long Island town of Hewlett Harbor  New York  where he and his family lived from 1952 to 1980  20  including the 1960s period when Lee and his artist collaborators would revolutionize comic books  In the mid 1950s  by which time the company was now generally known as Atlas Comics  Lee wrote stories in a variety of genres including romance  Westerns  humor  science fiction  medieval adventure  horror and suspense  By the end of the decade  Lee had become dissatisfied with his career and considered quitting the field  21  22  The Fantastic Four No 1  November 1961   Cover art by Jack Kirby  penciller  and an unconfirmed inker   edit  Marvel revolution In the late 1950s  DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz revived the superhero archetype and experienced a significant success with its updated version of the Flash  and later with super team the Justice League of America  In response  publisher Martin Goodman assigned Lee to create a new superhero team  Lee s wife urged him to experiment with stories he preferred  since he was planning on changing careers and had nothing to lose  21  22  Lee acted on that advice  giving his superheroes a flawed humanity  a change from the ideal archetypes that were typically written for preteens  Before this  most superheroes were idealistically perfect people with no serious  lasting problems  23  Lee introduced complex  naturalistic characters 24  who could have bad tempers  melancholy fits  vanity  they bickered amongst themselves  worried about paying their bills and impressing girlfriends  got bored or even were sometimes physically ill  The first superhero group Lee and artist Jack Kirby created was the Fantastic Four  The team s immediate popularity led Lee and Marvel s illustrators to produce a cavalcade of new titles  With Kirby primarily  Lee created the Hulk  Iron Man  Thor and the X Men  with Bill Everett  Daredevil  and with Steve Ditko  Doctor Strange and Marvel s most successful character  Spider Man  all of whom lived in a thoroughly shared universe  25  Comics historian Peter Sanderson wrote that in the 1960s  DC was the equivalent of the big Hollywood studios  After the brilliance of DC s reinvention of the superhero     in the late 1950s and early 1960s  it had run into a creative drought by the decade s end  There was a new audience for comics now  and it wasn t just the little kids that traditionally had read the books  The Marvel of the 1960s was in its own way the counterpart of the French New Wave     Marvel was pioneering new methods of comics storytelling and characterization  addressing more serious themes  and in the process keeping and attracting readers in their teens and beyond  Moreover  among this new generation of readers were people who wanted to write or draw comics themselves  within the new style that Marvel had pioneered  and push the creative envelope still further  26  Stan Lee s Marvel revolution extended beyond the characters and storylines to the way in which comic books engaged the readership and built a sense of community between fans and creators  27  Lee introduced the practice of including a credit panel on the splash page of each story  naming not just the writer and penciller but also the inker and letterer  Regular news about Marvel staff members and upcoming storylines was presented on the Bullpen Bulletins page  which  like the letter columns that appeared in each title  was written in a friendly  chatty style  Amazing Fantasy 15  1962   the first appearance of Spider Man  Cover art by Jack Kirby  penciller   amp  Steve Ditko  inker   Throughout the 1960s  Lee scripted  art directed  and edited most of Marvel s series  moderated the letters pages  wrote a monthly column called  Stan s Soapbox   and wrote endless promotional copy  often signing off with his trademark phrase  Excelsior    which is also the New York state motto   To maintain his taxing workload  yet still meet deadlines  he used a system that was used previously by various comic book studios  but due to Lee s success with it  became known as the  Marvel Method  or  Marvel style  of comic book creation  Typically  Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script  Based on the synopsis  the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel to panel storytelling  After the artist turned in penciled pages  Lee would write the word balloons and captions  and then oversee the lettering and coloring  In effect  the artists were co plotters  whose collaborative first drafts Lee built upon  Because of this system  the exact division of creative credits on Lee s comics has been disputed  especially in cases of comics drawn by Kirby and Ditko  Lee shares co creator credit with Kirby and Ditko on  respectively  the Fantastic Four and Spider Man feature film series  In 1971  Lee indirectly helped reform the Comics Code  28  The US Department of Health  Education and Welfare had asked Lee to write a comic book story about the dangers of drugs and Lee conceived a three issue subplot in The Amazing Spider Man  96 98  cover dated May July 1971   in which Peter Parker s best friend becomes addicted to pills  The Comics Code Authority refused to grant its seal because the stories depicted drug use  the anti drug context was considered irrelevant  The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts  The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs  among other new freedoms  29  Lee also supported using comic books to provide some measure of social commentary about the real world  often dealing with racism and bigotry   Stan s Soapbox   besides promoting an upcoming comic book project  also addressed issues of discrimination  intolerance  or prejudice  30  31   edit  Later career Signed photo of Lee at the 1975 San Diego Comic Con  In later years  Lee became a figurehead and public face for Marvel Comics  He made appearances at comic book conventions around America  lecturing at colleges and participating in panel discussions  and by now owning a vacation home on Cutler Lane in Remsenburg  New York 32  and  from 1975 to 1980  a two bedroom condominium on the 14th floor of 220 East 63rd Street in Manhattan  33  He moved to California in 1981 to develop Marvel s TV and movie

owned by comedian Jack Benny s radio announcer  Don Wilson  34  Lee was briefly president of the entire company  but soon stepped down to become publisher instead  finding that being president was too much about numbers and finance and not enough about the creative process he enjoyed  1  Peter Paul and Lee began to start a new Internet based superhero creation  production and marketing studio  Stan Lee Media  in 1998  It grew to 165 people and went public  but near the end of 2000  investigators discovered illegal stock manipulation by Paul and corporate officer Stephan Gordon  35  Stan Lee

account of how he began working for Marvel s predecessor  Timely  has varied  He has said in lectures and elsewhere that he simply answered a newspaper ad seeking a publishing assistant  not knowing it involved comics  let alone his cousin s husband  I applied for a job in a publishing company     I didn t even know they published comics  I was fresh out of high school  and I wanted to get into the publishing business  if I could  There was an ad in the paper that said   Assistant Wanted in a Publishing House   When I found out that they wanted me to assist in comics  I figured   Well  I ll stay here for a little while and get some experience  and then I ll get out into the real world       I just wanted to know   What do you do in a publishing company   How do you write      How do you publish  I was an assistant  There were two people there named Joe Simon and Jack Kirby   Joe was sort of the editor artist writer  and Jack was the artist writer  Joe was the senior member  They were turning out most of the artwork  Then there was the publisher  Martin Goodman     And that was about the only staff that I was involved with  After a while  Joe Simon and Jack Kirby left  I was about 17 years old  sic   and Martin Goodman said to me   Do you think you can hold down the job of editor until I can find a real person   When you re 17  what do you know  I said   Sure  I can do it   I think he forgot about me  because I stayed there ever since    Lee  in Plume  Kenneth  June 26  2000    Stan Lee interview part 1 of 5   IGN com  Archived from the original on July 31  2011  http

at a publishing company where he worked  The idea of being involved in publishing definitely appealed to me      So I contacted the man Robbie said did the hiring  Joe Simon  and applied for a job  He took me on and I began working as a gofer for eight dollars a week     Joe Simon  in his autobiography The Comic Book Makers  Crestwood II  1990  ISBN 1 887591 35 4  reissued Vanguard Productions  2003  ISBN 1 887591 35 4   gives the account slightly differently  One day  Goodman s relative known as  Uncle Robbie came to work with a lanky 17 year old in tow   This is Stanley Lieber  Martin s wife s cousin   Uncle Robbie said   Martin wants you to keep him busy   In an appendix  however  Simon appears to reconcile the two accounts  He relates a 1989 conversation with Lee  Lee  I ve been saying this  classified ad  story for years  but apparently it isn t so  And I can t remember because I  ve  said it so long now that I believe it      Simon   Your Uncle Robbie brought you into the
