Outdoor Equipment Football Olympic No Was demonstrated in the 1932 Summer Olympics Not recognized as an Olympic sport American football is a sport played between two teams of eleven with the objective of scoring points by advancing the ball into the opposing team s end zone  Known in the United States simply as football  it may also be referred to informally as gridiron football  1  2  The ball can be advanced by running with it or throwing it to a teammate  Points can be scored by carrying the ball over the opponent s goal line  catching a pass thrown over that goal line  kicking the ball through the opponent s goal posts or tackling an opposing ball carrier in his own end zone  In the United States  the major forms are high school football  college football and professional football  Each of these are played under slightly different rules  3  High school football is governed by the National Federation of State High School Associations and college football by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics  The major league for professional football is the National Football League  American football is closely related to Canadian football but with some differences in rules and the field  4  Both sports can be traced to early versions of association football and rugby football  Contents 1 History 2 Rules 2 1 Field

ball  front row  right   The history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and association football  Both games have their origins in varieties of football played in the United Kingdom in the mid 19th century  in which a ball is kicked at a goal and or run over a line  Many games known as  football  were being played at colleges and universities in the United States in the first half of the 19th century  5  6  Rutgers University and its neighbor  Princeton University  played the first game of intercollegiate football on 6 November 1869 on a plot of ground where the present day Rutgers gymnasium now stands in New Brunswick  N J  Rutgers won that first game  6 4  7  Walter Camp American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby football  most notably the rule changes instituted by Walter Camp  considered the  Father of American Football   Among these important changes were the introduction of the line of scrimmage and of down and distance rules  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries  game play developments by college coaches such as Eddie Cochems  Amos Alonzo Stagg  Knute Rockne  and Glenn  Pop  Warner helped take advantage of the newly introduced forward pass  The popularity of collegiate football grew as it became the dominant version of the sport for the first half of the twentieth century  Bowl games  a college football tradition  attracted a national audience for collegiate teams  Bolstered by fierce rivalries  college football still holds widespread appeal in the US  5  8  9  The origin of professional football can be traced back to 1892  with William  Pudge  Heffelfinger s  500 contract to play in a game for the Allegheny Athletic Association against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club  The first Professional  league  was the Ohio League  formed in 1903  and the first Professional Football championship game was between the Buffalo Prospects and the Canton Bulldogs in 1919  In 1920  the American Professional Football Association was formed  The first game was played in Dayton  Ohio on October 3  1920 with the host Triangles defeating the Columbus Panhandles 14 0  The league changed its name to the National Football League  NFL  two years later  and eventually became the major league of American football  Initially a sport of Midwestern industrial towns in the United States  professional football eventually became a national phenomenon  Football s increasing popularity is usually traced to the 1958 NFL Championship Game  a contest that has been dubbed the  Greatest Game Ever Played   A rival league to the NFL  the American Football League  AFL   began play in 1960  the pressure it put on the senior league led to a merger between the two leagues and the creation of the Super Bowl  which has become the most watched television event in the United States on an annual basis  10  High school football dates to the 1880s and enjoys regional popularity  Rules Main article  American football rules Field and players The numbers on the field indicate the number of yards to the nearest goal line  Football is played on a field 360 by 160 feet  120 0 by 53 3 yards  109 7 by 48 8 meters   11  The longer boundary lines are sidelines  while the shorter boundary lines are end lines  Sidelines and end lines are out of bounds  Near each end of the field is a goal line  they are 100 yards  91 4 m  apart  A scoring area called an end zone extends 10 yards  9 1 m  beyond each goal line to each end line  The end zone includes the goal line but not the end line  11  While the playing field is effectively flat  it is common for a field to be built with a slight crown with the middle of the field higher than the sides to allow water to drain from the field  Yard lines cross the field every 5 yards  4 6 m   and are numbered every 10 yards from each goal line to the 50 yard line  or midfield  similar to a typical rugby league field   Two rows of short lines  known as inbounds lines or hash marks  run at 1 yard  91 4 cm  intervals perpendicular to the sidelines near the middle of the field  All plays start with the ball on or between the hash marks  Because of the arrangement of the lines  the field is occasionally referred to as a gridiron in a reference to the cooking grill with a similar pattern of lines  At the back of each end zone are two goalposts  also called uprights  connected by a crossbar 10 feet  3 05 m  from the ground  For high skill levels  the posts are 18 feet 6 inches  5 64 m  apart  For lower skill levels  these are widened to 23 feet 4 inches  7 11 m   Each team has 11 players on the field at a time  Usually there are many more players off the field  an NFL team has a limit of 53 players on their roster  46 of which can be dressed for a game   However  teams may substitute for any or all of their players during the breaks between plays  As a result  players have very specialized roles and are divided into three separate units  the offense  the defense and the special teams  It is rare for all team members to participate in a given game  as some roles have little utility beyond that of an injury substitute  Start of halves The game begins with a coin toss to determine which team will kick off to begin the game and which goal each team will defend  12  The options are presented again to start the second half  the choices for the first half do not automatically determine the start of the second half  The referee conducts the coin toss with the captains  or sometimes coaches  of the opposing teams  The team that wins the coin toss has three options  12  They may choose whether to kick or receive the opening kickoff  They may choose which goal to defend  They may choose to defer the first choice to the other team and have first choice to start the second half  13  Whatever the first team chooses  the second team has the option on the other choice  for example  if the first team elects to receive at the start of the game  the second team can decide which goal to defend   At the start of the second half  the options to kick  receive  or choose a goal to defend are presented to the captains again  The team which did not choose first to start the first half  or which deferred its privilege to choose first  now gets first choice of options  12  14  Game duration A standard football game consists of four 15 minute quarters  12 minute quarters in high school football and often shorter at lower levels   15  with a half time intermission after the second quarter  16  Depending upon the level of competition  the duration of the half time ranges from 10 to 20 minutes  At all levels  a down  play  that begins before time expires is allowed to continue until its completion  even after the clock reaches zero  The clock is also stopped after certain plays  therefore  a game can last considerably longer  often more than three hours in real time   and if a game is broadcast on television  TV timeouts are taken at certain intervals of the game to broadcast commercials outside of game action  If an NFL game is tied after four quarters  the teams play an additional period lasting up to 15 minutes  In a regular season NFL overtime game  the first team that scores wins  even if the other team does not get a possession  this is referred to as sudden death  However  in a post season NFL game during the playoffs  if the first team with possession scores only a field goal  the other team is allowed the opportunity to match or better this score  This rule only affects playoff games in overtime in which the first team with possession scores a field goal  if the first team with possession scores a touchdown  the sudden death rules take effect  In a regular season NFL game  if neither team scores in overtime  the game is a tie  In an NFL playoff game  additional overtime periods are played  as needed  to determine a winner  College overtime rules are more complicated  A line of scrimmage on the 48 yard line  The offense is on the left  A quarterback searching for an opportunity to throw a pass  A running back being tackled when he tries to run with the ball  Air Force Academy quarterback Shea Smith prepares to throw a pass  Forward pass in progress  during practice  A kicker attempts an extra point  Advancing the ball The team that takes possession of the ball  the offense  has four attempts  called downs  in which to advance the ball at least 10 yards toward their opponent s  the defense s  end zone  When the offense succeeds in gaining at least 10 yards  it gets a first down  meaning the team starts a new set of four downs to gain yet another 10 yards or to score  If the offense fails to gain a first down  10 yards  after four downs  the other team gets possession of the ball at the point where the fourth down ended  beginning with their first down to advance the ball in the opposite direction  Except at the beginning of halves and after scores  the ball is always put into play by a snap  Offensive players line up facing defensive players at the line of scrimmage  the position on the field where the play begins   One offensive player  the center  then passes  or  snaps   the ball backwards between his legs to a teammate behind him  usually the quarterback  Players can then advance the ball in two ways  By running with the ball  also known as rushing  By throwing the ball to a teammate  known as a pass or as passing the football  If the pass is thrown down field  it is known as a forward pass  The forward pass is a key factor distinguishing American and Canadian football from other football sports  The offense can throw the ball forward only once during a down and only from behind the line of scrimmage  However  the ball can be handed off to another player or thrown  pitched  or tossed sideways or backwards  a lateral pass  at any time  A down ends  and the ball becomes dead  after any of the following  The player with the ball is forced to the ground  a tackle  or has his forward progress halted by members of the other team  as determined by an official   A forward pass flies beyond the dimensions of the field  out of bounds  or touches the ground before it is caught  This is known as an incomplete pass  The ball is returned to the most recent line of scrimmage for the next down  The ball or the player with the ball goes out of bounds  A team scores  Officials blow a whistle to notify players that the down is over  Before each down  each team chooses a play  or coordinated movements and actions  that the players should follow on a down  Sometimes  downs themselves are referred to as  plays   Change of possession The offense maintains possession of the ball unless one of the following things occurs  The team fails to get a first down  i e   in four downs they fail to move the ball past a line 10 yards ahead of where they got their last first down  The defensive team takes over the ball at the spot where the 4th down play ends  A change of possession in this manner is commonly called a turnover on downs  The offense scores a touchdown or field goal  The team that scored then kicks the ball to the other team in a special play called a kickoff  The offense punts the ball to the defense  A punt is a kick in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground  Punts are nearly always made on fourth down  when the offensive team does not want to risk giving up the ball to the other team at its current spot on the field  through a failed attempt to make a first down  and feels it is too far from the other team s goal post to attempt a field goal  A defensive player catches a forward pass  This is called an interception  and the player who makes the interception can run with the ball until he is tackled  forced out of bounds  or scores  An offensive player drops the ball  a fumble  and a defensive player picks it up  As with interceptions  a player recovering a fumble can run with the ball until tackled  forced out of bounds  or scoring  Passes that are thrown either backwards or parallel with the line of scrimmage  lateral passes  that are not caught do not cause the down to end as incomplete forward passes do  instead the ball is still live as if it had been fumbled  Lost fumbles and interceptions are together known as turnovers  The offensive team misses a field goal attempt  The defensive team gets the ball at the spot where the previous play began  or  in the NFL  at the spot of the kick   If the unsuccessful kick was attempted from within 20 yards of the end zone  the other team gets the ball at its own 20 yard line  that is  20 yards from the end zone   If a field goal is missed or blocked and the ball remains in the field of play  a defensive player may pick up the ball and attempt to advance it  In this last case  possession is awarded at the spot where the recovering player is ruled down   Rare  While in his own end zone  an offensive ball carrier is tackled  forced out of bounds  loses the ball out of bounds  or the offense commits certain fouls in the end zone  This fairly rare occurrence is called a safety   Rare  An offensive ball carrier fumbles the ball forward into the opposing end zone  and then the ball goes out of bounds  This rare occurrence leads to a touchback  with the ball going over to the opposing team at their 20 yard line  Note that touchbacks during non offensive special teams plays  such as punts and kickoffs  are quite common   Scoring Main article  American football rules Scoring A team scores points by the following plays  A touchdown  TD  is worth 6 points  16  It is scored when a player runs the ball into or catches a pass in his opponent s end zone  16  A touchdown is analogous to a try in rugby  Unlike rugby  a player does not have to touch the ball to the ground to score  a touchdown is scored any time a player has possession of the ball while any part of the ball is beyond the vertical plane created by the leading edge of the opponent s goal line stripe  the stripe itself is a part of the end zone   After a touchdown  the scoring team attempts a try  which is also analogous to the conversion in rugby   The ball is placed at the other team s 3 yard line  the 2 yard line in the NFL   The team can attempt to kick it through the goalposts  over the crossbar and between the uprights  in the manner of a field goal for 1 point  an extra point or point after touchdown  PAT  17    or run or pass it into the end zone in the manner of a touchdown for 2 points  a two point conversion   In college football  if the defense intercepts or recovers a fumble during a one or two point conversion attempt and returns it to the opposing end zone  the defensive team is awarded the two points  A field goal  FG  is worth 3 points  and it is scored by kicking the ball through the goalposts defended by the opposition  16  Field goals may be place kicked  kicked when the ball is held vertically against the ground by a teammate  or drop kicked  extremely uncommon in the modern game due to the better accuracy of place kicks  with only two successful drop kicks in sixty plus years in the NFL   A field goal is usually attempted on fourth down instead of a punt when the ball is close enough to the opponent s goalposts  or  when there is little or no time left to otherwise score   Rare  A safety  worth 2 points  is scored by the opposing team when the team in possession at the end of a down is responsible for the ball becoming dead behind its own goal line  For instance  a safety is scored by the defense if an offensive player is tackled  goes out of bounds  or fumbles the ball out of bounds in his own end zone  16  Safeties are relatively rare  Note that  though even more rare  the team initially on offense during a down can score a safety if a player of the original defense gains possession of the ball in front of his own goal line and then carries the ball or fumbles it into his own end zone where it becomes dead  However  if the ball becomes dead behind the goal line of the team in possession and its opponent is responsible for the ball being there  for instance  if the defense intercepts a forward pass in its own end zone and the ball becomes dead before the ball is advanced out of the end zone  it is a touchback  no points are scored and the team last in possession keeps possession with a first down at its own 20 yard line  In the extremely rare instance that a safety is scored on a try  it is worth only 1 point  Kickoffs and free kicks The Florida State Seminoles  in red  at top  line up to kick off to the Virginia Tech Hokies  Each half begins with a kickoff  Teams also kick off after scoring touchdowns and field goals  The ball is kicked using a kicking tee from the team s own 35 yard line in the NFL  as of the 2011 season  and 30 yard line in college football  as of the 2007 season   The other team s kick returner tries to catch the ball and advance it as far as possible  Where he is stopped is the point where the offense will begin its drive  or series of offensive plays  If the kick returner catches the ball in his own end zone  he can either run with the ball  or elect for a touchback by kneeling in the end zone  in which case the receiving team then starts its offensive drive from its own 20 yard line  A touchback also occurs when the kick goes out of bounds in the end zone   Punts and turnovers in the end zone can also result in a touchback   A kickoff that goes out of bounds anywhere other than the end zone before being touched by the receiving team is a foul  and the ball will be placed within the hash marks of the yard line where it went out of bounds  or 30 yards from the kickoff spot  depending on which is more advantageous to the receiving team  18  Unlike with punts  once a kickoff goes 10 yards and the ball has hit the ground  it can be recovered by the kicking team  18  A team  especially one who is losing  can try to take advantage of this by attempting an onside kick  After safeties  the team that gave up the points must free kick the ball to the other team from its own 20 yard line  19  Penalties A penalty flag on the field during a game on November 16  2008 between the San Francisco 49ers and St  Louis Rams  Main article  Penalty  American football  Fouls  a type of rule violation  are punished with penalties against the offending team  Most penalties result in moving the football towards the offending team s end zone  If the penalty would move the ball more than half the distance towards the offender s end zone  the penalty becomes half the distance to the goal instead of its normal value  Most penalties result in replaying the down  Some defensive penalties give the offense an automatic first down  20  Conversely  some offensive penalties result in loss of a down  loss of the right to repeat the down   20  If a penalty gives the offensive team enough yardage to gain a first down  they get a first down  as usual  The only penalty that results in points is if a team on offense commits certain fouls  such as holding  in its own end zone  which results in a safety  If a foul occurs during a down  after the play has begun   the down is allowed to continue and an official throws a yellow penalty flag near the spot of the foul  When the down ends  the team that did not commit the foul has the option of accepting the penalty  or declining the penalty and accepting the result of the down  Variations See also  List of gridiron football codes Limited contact touch football  A play ends when a defender touches the ball carrier  sometimes with two hands   flag football  A play ends when a defender removes a designated token   flag   worn by the ball carrier  Wrap  A play ends when a defender wraps his arms round the ball carrier  Fewer players nine man football eight man football six man football Smaller field The Arena Football League is a league that plays eight man football  but also plays indoors and on a much smaller playing surface with rule changes to encourage a much more offensive game  Catch and Run In this game  the children split into two teams and line up at opposite sides of the playing field  One side throws the ball to the other side  If the opposing team catches the ball  that player tries to run to the throwing teams touchdown without being tagged tackled  If no one catches the ball or if the player is tagged tackled  then that team has to throw the ball to the opposing team  This repeats until time runs out or the players decide to quit  Players This diagram shows typical offensive and defensive formations  Because teams can change any or all of the players between plays  the number of players at certain positions may differ on a given play  Here the offense is in the Normal I Formation while the defense is in a 4 3 Normal  Main article  American football positions See also  Formation  American football  Most football players have highly specialized roles  At the college and NFL levels  most play only offense or only defense  Offense The offensive line  OL  consists of five players whose job is to protect the passer and clear the way for runners by blocking members of the defense  The lineman in the middle is the center  Outside the center are the guards  and outside them are the tackles  Except for the center  who snaps the ball to one of the backs  offensive linemen generally do not handle the ball  The quarterback  QB  receives the snap from the center on most plays  He then hands or tosses it to a running back  throws it to a receiver or runs with it himself  The quarterback is the leader of the offense and calls the plays that are signaled to him from the sidelines  Running backs  RB  line up behind or beside the QB and specialize in running with the ball  They also block  catch passes and  on rare occasions  pass the ball to others or even receive the snap  If a team has two running backs in the game  usually one will be a halfback  HB   or tailback  TB    who is more likely to run with the ball  and the other will usually be a fullback  FB   who is more likely to block  Wide receivers  WR  line up near the sidelines  They specialize in catching passes  though they also block for running plays or downfield after another receiver makes a catch  Tight ends  TE  line up next to the offensive line  They can play either like wide receivers  catch passes  or like offensive linemen  protect the QB or create spaces for runners   Sometimes an offensive lineman takes the tight end position and is referred to as a tackle eligible  21  At least seven players must line up on the line of scrimmage on every offensive play  The other players may line up anywhere behind the line  The exact number of running backs  wide receivers and tight ends may differ on any given play  For example  if the team needs only one yard  it may use three tight ends  two running backs and no wide receivers  On the other hand  if it needs 20 yards  it may replace all of its running backs and tight ends with wide receivers  Defense In contrast to members of the offense  the rules of professional football  NFL Rulebook  and American college football  NCAA Rulebook  do not specify starting position  movement  or coverage zones for members of the defensive team  except that they must be in the defensive zone at the start of play  The positions  movements and responsibilities of all defensive players are assigned by the team by selection of certain coverages  or patterns of placement and assignment of responsibilities  The positional roles are customary  These roles have varied over the history of American football  The following are customary defensive positions used in many coverages in modern American football  The defensive line consists of three to six players who line up immediately across from the offensive line  They try to occupy the offensive linemen in order to free up the linebackers  disrupt the backfield  behind the offensive line  of the offense  and tackle the running back if he has the ball before he can gain yardage or the quarterback before he can throw or pass the ball  They are the first line of defense  Behind the defensive line are the linebackers  They line up between the defensive line and defensive backs and may either rush the quarterback or cover potential receivers  The last line of defense is known as the secondary  comprising at least three players who line up as defensive backs  who are either cornerbacks or safeties  They cover the receivers and try to stop pass completions  They occasionally rush the quarterback  Special teams The units of players who handle kicking plays are known as special teams  Three important special teams players are the punter  who handles punts  the placekicker or kicker  who kicks off and attempts field goals and extra points  and the long snapper  who snaps the ball for extra points  field goals  and punts  Also included on special teams are the returners  These players return punts or kickoffs and try to get in good field position  These players can also score touchdowns  Uniform numbering Quarterback Shaun Carney has uniform number 5  In the NFL  ranges of uniform numbers are  usually  reserved for certain positions  1 19  Quarterbacks  punters and placekickers  by rule  22  20 49  Running backs and defensive backs  by rule  23  50 59  Centers and linebackers  by custom  24  60 79  Offensive guards and tackles  mandatory   25  defensive guards and tackles  by custom  10 19  80 89  Wide receivers  by rule  26  80 89  by rule   27  40 49  optional   Tight ends 90 99  Defensive ends and linebackers  by custom  Players who switch positions in their career can keep their number if they played their prior position for at least a year and move from a position that is eligible to receive passes to another eligible position  or if he is moving from one ineligible position to another ineligible position  28  29  Players wearing numbers between 50 and 79 inclusive are ineligible to receive forward passes  unless they  report as eligible  to the official  NCAA and high school rules specify only that offensive linemen must have numbers in the 50 79 range  but the NCAA  strongly recommends  that quarterbacks and running backs have numbers below 50 and wide receivers numbers above 79  30  This helps officials  as it means that numbers 50 to 79 are ineligible receivers  or players that may not receive a forward pass  except in the rare instance when a Tackle lines up as the outermost lineman on his side of the line and the officials are notified that he will be an eligible receiver for that particular play   There are no numbering restrictions on defensive players in the NCAA  other than that a team may not have two players on the field at the same time with the same jersey number  31  Basic strategy Main article  American football strategy Because the game stops after every down  giving teams a chance to call a new play  strategy plays a major role in football  Each team has a playbook of dozens to hundreds of plays  Ideally  each play is a scripted  strategically sound team coordinated endeavor  Some plays are very safe  they are likely to get only a few yards  Other plays have the potential for long gains but at a greater risk of a loss of yardage or a turnover  Generally speaking  rushing plays are less risky than passing plays  However  there are relatively safe passing plays and risky running plays  To deceive the other team  some passing plays are designed to resemble running plays and vice versa  These are referred to as play action passes and draws  respectively  There are many trick or gadget plays  such as when a team lines up as if it intends to punt and then tries to run or pass for a first down  Such high risk plays are a great thrill to the fans when they work  However  they can spell disaster if the opposing team realizes the deception and acts accordingly  The defense also plans plays in response to expectations of what the offense will do  For example  a  blitz   using linebackers or defensive backs to charge the quarterback  is often attempted when the team on defense expects a pass  A blitz makes downfield passing more difficult but exposes the defense to big gains if the offensive line stems the rush  Many hours of preparation and strategizing  including film review by both players and coaches  go into the days between football games  This  along with the demanding physicality of football  see below   is why teams typically play at most one game per week  Physicality Main articles  Health issues in American football and American football protective equipment A halfback leads fellow backs through an agility drill at the Air Force Academy Football is a collision sport  To stop the offense from advancing the ball  the defense must tackle the player with the ball by knocking or pulling him down  As such  defensive players must use some form of physical contact to bring the ball carrier to the ground  within certain rules and guidelines  Tacklers cannot kick or punch the runner  They also cannot grab the face mask of the runner s helmet or lead into a tackle with their own helmet   spearing    Despite these and other rules regarding unnecessary roughness  most other forms of tackling are legal  Blockers and defenders trying to evade them also have wide leeway in trying to force their opponents out of the way  Quarterbacks are regularly hit by defenders coming on full speed from outside the quarterback s field of vision  This is commonly known as a blindside  To compensate for this  players must wear special protective equipment  such as a padded plastic helmet  shoulder pads  hip pads and knee pads  These protective pads were introduced decades ago and have improved ever since to help minimize lasting injury to players  An unintended consequence of all the safety equipment has resulted in increasing levels of violence in the game  Players may now hurl themselves at one another at high speeds without a significant chance of injury  The injuries that do result tend to be severe and often season or career ending and sometimes fatal  In previous years with less padding  tackling more closely resembled tackles in Rugby football  Better helmets have allowed players to use their helmets as weapons  This form of tackling is particularly unwise  because of the great potential for brain or spinal injury  All this has caused the various leagues  especially the NFL  to implement a complicated series of penalties for various types of contact  Most recently  virtually any contact with the helmet of a defensive player on the quarterback  or any contact to the quarterback s head  is now a foul  During the late 1970s  the penalty in high school football for spearing included ejection from the game  32  Despite protective equipment and rule changes to emphasize safety  injuries remain very common in football  It is increasingly rare  for example  for NFL quarterbacks or running backs  who take the most direct hits  to make it through an entire season without missing some time to injury  citation needed  Additionally  28 football players died from direct football injuries in the years 2000 05 and an additional 68 died indirectly from dehydration or other examples of  non physical  dangers  according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research  33 Concussions are common  with about 41 000 suffered every year among high school players according to the Brain Injury Association of Arizona  34  In 1981  U S  President Ronald Reagan  who played football in high school  commented on the contact of the sport   Football is the last thing left in civilization where men can literally fling themselves bodily at one another in combat and not be at war   35  Extra and optional equipment such as neck rolls  spider pads  rib protectors  referred to as  flak jackets    and elbow pads help against injury as well  though they do not tend to be used by the majority of players due to their lack of requirement  The danger of football  and the equipment required to reduce it  make regulation football impractical for casual play  Flag football and touch football are less violent variants of the game popular among recreational players  Nutrition and dehydration Football players typically begin their season while the weather is still extremely warm and with the dangerous combination of warm weather and high humidity  dehydration is a great risk for the players  36  The players are usually required to follow a hydration schedule  It is extremely important for players to drink enough fluids because dehydration can seriously reduce athletic performance and increase the risk of heat illnesses  Most trainers and coaches make it imperative for their players to drink fluids before they are thirsty  36  Brain injury The Concussions Committee of the NFL  co chaired by Dr  Ira Casson  has generally denied that concussions result in permanent brain injury  However  there is some research  reported in 2009  which  using phone interviews based on the National Health Interview Survey  showed increased incidence of diagnosis of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players  chronic traumatic encephalopathy diagnoses are increasingly common among deceased football players  Such symptoms are believed related to the effects of concussions  More rigorous research is being conducted by Dr  Casson  neurologist  for the NFL  This finding is considered significant as such injuries may potentially affect high school and college players also  37  Heart disease While retired NFL players have a lower overall rate of death compared to men in the general U S  population  players at certain positions have a higher incidence of heart disease  Defensive linemen were 42  more likely to die from heart disease than men in the general population  They also faced a greater risk of cardiomyopathy  The increased incidence of heart disease may be attributed to high BMI measurements  retired players notably offensive and defensive linemen with a playing time BMI of 30 or more had double the risk of dying from heart disease as compared to other players  Steroid use may also play a role  In a survey of more than 3 000 retired players  9  reported having used anabolic steroids while playing  Among them  offensive and defensive linemen were the most likely to report use  16 3  and 14 8   respectively   38  Organization in the United States Main article  American football in the United States In the United States  the major forms are high school football  college football and professional football  Most American high schools field football teams  In general  high school teams play only against other teams within the same state  but there are some exceptions like nearby schools located on opposite sides of a state line  Most of college football in the United States is governed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association  NCAA   and most colleges and universities around the country have football teams  These teams mostly play other similarly sized schools  through the NCAA s divisional system  which divides the schools into four divisions  Division I Bowl Subdivision  Division I Championship Subdivision  Division II  and Division III  Unlike the three smaller NCAA football divisions  the Division I Bowl Subdivision does not have an organized tournament to determine its national champion  Instead  teams are invited to compete in a number of post season bowl games  In addition  the champions of six conferences in the Division I Bowl Subdivision receive automatic bids  and four other schools receive  at large  bids  to those five bowl games under the highly lucrative Bowl Championship Series to help determine the national champion  The highest level major professional league in the United States is the 32 team National Football League  NFL   Another professional league  the 5 team United Football League  also currently operates  Several semi professional  women s semi professional football  and indoor football leagues are also played across the country  Calendar Amateurs playing on Thanksgiving Although professional football has been played in every month of the year  football is traditionally an autumn sport  A season typically begins in mid to late August and runs through December  into January  This arrangement arose when football was in its early stages  and many of the early professional teams shared playing fields  and sometimes players  with baseball teams  the end of baseball season was accordingly set up to also serve as the start of football season  Although Thanksgiving was the traditional end of the season for most college and early professional teams  playoffs and extended seasons have pushed seasons further into the winter season  The NFL playoffs run further through January  and the Super Bowl is often played in the first week of February  As such  the sport is played in a wide range of weather conditions  from the heat and humidity of late summer  to the cold winds and snow in mid winter  Unlike rainouts in baseball  play is only generally postponed or canceled for conditions that would pose a hazard to the safety of the fans and personnel involved  such as blizzards  hurricanes and severe thunderstorms  Because of the amount of physical wear the game can inflict on the human body  American football seasons are typically far shorter than the comparable seasons of other popular American sports  It is very rare for football teams at any level to play more than one game in a week  For comparison  the National Hockey League and National Basketball Association traditionally play an 82 game regular season over the course of six months  plus a postseason composed of four rounds of best of seven series  The NFL plays 16 games over the course of four months  with a single elimination tournament of three to four rounds  The NFL Draft is usually held in April  in which eligible college football players are selected by NFL teams  the order of selection determined by the teams  final regular season records  It is a long standing tradition in the United States  though not universally observed  that high school football games are played on Friday night  college games on Saturday  and professional games on Sunday  In the 1970s  the NFL began to schedule one game on Monday nights  Beginning in 2006  the NFL began scheduling games on Thursday nights in mid November  aired on the NFL Network  NFL games have also been scheduled on Saturday nights toward the end of the season  Nationally televised Thursday night college games have become a weekly fixture on ESPN  and most nights of the week feature at least one college game  though most games are still played on the traditional Saturday  Certain fall and winter holidays such as the NFL s Thanksgiving Classic and numerous New Year s Day college bowl games have traditional football games associated with them  Despite this  there are a few professional leagues that have played in the late winter  spring  or summer  mainly to avoid competition with the established leagues  Examples include the now defunct XFL  the United States Football League  and the proposed All American Football League  Indoor football is played primarily in spring for this same reason  leagues that are based in Europe and Asia also generally play an earlier season  At most levels of competition  college football teams hold several weeks of practices in the spring  These practices typically end with an intramural scrimmage open to the public  In certain areas  high school football teams also hold spring practices  Outside the United States Outside the United States  the sport is referred to as  American football   or a translation thereof  to differentiate it from other football codes such as association football  soccer   Rugby League  Rugby Union  Australian rules football and Gaelic football  In Australia and New Zealand the game is also known as gridiron football  or more commonly as gridiron  1  39  although in the United States the term gridiron refers only to the playing field itself  40  The term gridiron has also been used in the UK to describe the game  41  In much of the world  the term football is unambiguous and refers to association football  known commonly as  soccer  in the United States   Exportation by the established U S  leagues and organizations In 1977  the semi pro football teams Newton Nite Hawks and Chicago Lions completed a five game tour in Europe  42  These were the first professional or semi professional American football teams to play organized games on the European continent  Games were played in Versailles  France  Lille  France  Landstuhl  Germany  Gratz Austria  and Vienna  Austria  43  In 1985  Bethany College head coach and future College Football Hall of Fame member Ted Kessinger brought the first American football team to play in Sweden  The Bethany  Terrible Swedes  defeated the Swedish all star team 72 7 in Stockholm Olympic Stadium  44  The NFL has attempted to introduce the game to other nations and operated a developmental league  NFL Europa  also known as the World League of American Football and NFL Europe  with teams in various European cities  but this league was closed down following the 2007 season  The professional Canadian Football League and collegiate Canadian Interuniversity Sport play under the slightly different Canadian rules  Major American leagues have also held some regular season games outside of the United States  On October 2  2005  the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers played the first regular season NFL game outside of the United States  in Mexico City s Estadio Azteca  45  From 2007  the NFL has played or has plans to play at least one regular season game outside of the United States during each season  The NCAA will also play games outside of the U S  In 2012  The United States Naval Academy will play the University of Notre Dame in Dublin  Ireland  46  Leagues by country Main article  List of leagues of American and Canadian football  Australia   Gridiron Australia is the overall governing body for American
