of Nauru and formerly known as Pleasant Island  is an island country in Micronesia in the South Pacific  Its nearest neighbour is Banaba Island in Kiribati  300 kilometres  186 mi  to the east  Nauru is the world s smallest republic  covering just 21 square kilometres  8 1 sq mi   With just over 9 322 residents  it is the second least populated country after Vatican City  Settled by Micronesian and Polynesian people  Nauru was annexed and claimed as a colony by the German Empire in the late 19th century  After World War I  Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia  New Zealand  and the United Kingdom  During World War II  Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops  who were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific  After the war ended  it entered into trusteeship again  3  Nauru gained its independence in 1968  Throughout the first half of the 20th century  Nauru was a  rentier state   Nauru is a phosphate rock island  with rich deposits close to the surface  which allow for simple strip mining operations  moreover  it has some phosphate reserves which are presently  as of 2011  not economically viable for extraction  4  Nevertheless  this island was a major exporter of phosphate starting in 1907  when the Pacific Phosphate Company began mining there  through the formation of the British Phosphate Commission in 1919  and continuing after independence  This gave Nauru back full control of its minerals under the Nauru Phosphate Corporation  until the deposits ran out during the 1980s  For this reason  Nauru briefly boasted the highest per capita income enjoyed by any sovereign state in the world during the late 1960s and early 1970s  When the phosphate reserves were exhausted  and the environment had been seriously harmed by mining  the trust that had been established to manage the island s wealth diminished in value  To earn income  Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre  From 2001 to 2008  it accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for housing a Nauru detention centre that held and assessed the refugee claims of asylum seekers who had arrived unauthorised in Australia  The island has one airport  Nauru International Airport  From January to September 2006  Nauru became partially isolated from the outside world when Air Nauru  the airline which served the island  ceased operations in December 2005 and left the island accessible only by ship  The airline was subsequently able to restart operations in October 2006 under the name Our Airline with monetary aid from the Taiwan  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 3 Politics 3 1 Administrative divisions 4 Foreign relations 5 Geography 6 Economy 7 Demographics 8 Culture 9 See also 10 Further reading 11

the beach   The German settlers called the island Nawodo or Onawero   edit  History Main article  History of Nauru Nauruan warrior  1880 Nauru was first inhabited by Micronesian and Polynesian people at least 3 000 years ago  6  There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru  which are represented in the 12 pointed star in the flag of the country  Nauruans traced their descent matrilineally  Nauruans practiced aquaculture   they caught juvenile ibija fish  acclimatised them to fresh water  and raised them in the Buada Lagoon  providing an additional and more reliable source of food  The other locally grown components of their diet included coconuts and pandanus fruit  7  The British sea captain John Fearn  a whale hunter  became the first Westerner to visit this island in 1798  and he named it  Pleasant Island   From around 1830  Nauruans had contact with Europeans from whaling ships and traders who replenished their supplies  such as fresh water  at Nauru  Around this time  deserters from the ships began to live on the island  The islanders traded food for alcoholic palm wine and firearms  The firearms were used during the 10 year Nauruan Tribal War that began in 1878  and by 1888 had resulted in a reduction of the population of Nauru from 1 400 to 900 people  Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany s Marshall Island Protectorate  The Germans called the island Nawodo or Onawero  The arrival of the Germans ended the war  and social changes brought about by the war established kings as rulers of the island  The most widely known of these was King Auweyida  Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands arrived in 1888  8  The Germans ruled Nauru for almost three decades  Robert Rasch  a German trader who married a native woman  was the first administrator  appointed in 1890  Phosphate was discovered on Nauru in 1900 by the prospector Albert Ellis  The Pacific Phosphate Company started to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany  The company exported its first shipment in 1907  9  In 1914  following the outbreak of World War I  Nauru was captured by Australian troops  Australia  New Zealand and the United Kingdom signed the Nauru Island Agreement in 1919  creating a board known as the British Phosphate Commission  BPC   This took over the rights to phosphate mining  10  According to the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics  now the Australian Bureau of Statistics    In common with other natives  the islanders are very susceptible to tuberculosis and influenza  and in 1921 an influenza epidemic caused the deaths of 230 islanders   In 1923  the League of Nations gave Australia a trustee mandate over Nauru  with the United Kingdom and New Zealand as co trustees  11  12  On 6 and 7 December 1940  the German auxiliary cruisers Komet and Orion sank four supply ships in the vicinity of Nauru  On the next day  Komet shelled Nauru s phosphate mining areas  oil storage depots  and the shiploading cantilever  13  In 1943  the U S  Army Air Force bombed the Japanese airstrip  destroying about 15 Japanese warplanes 13  Japanese troops occupied Nauru on 26 August 1942  14  The Japanese troops built an airfield on Nauru which was bombed for the first time on 25 March 1943  preventing food supplies from being flown to Nauru  The Japanese deported 1 200 Nauruans to work as labourers in the Chuuk islands  13  Nauru  which had been bypassed and left to  wither on the vine  by American forces  was finally set free from the Japanese on 13 September 1945  when Captain Hisayaki Soeda  the commander of all the Japanese troops on Nauru  15  surrendered the island to the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy  This surrender was accepted by Brigadier J  R  Stevenson  who represented Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee  the commander of the First Australian Army  on board the warship HMAS Diamantina  16  17  Arrangements were made to repatriate from Chuuk the 737 Nauruans who survived Japanese captivity there  They were returned to Nauru by the BPC ship Trienza in January 1946  18  In 1947  a trusteeship was established by the United Nations  and Australia  New Zealand  and the United Kingdom became the U N  trustees of the island  Nauru became self governing in January 1966  and following a two year constitutional convention  it became independent in 1968  led by founding president Hammer DeRoburt  In 1967  the people of Nauru purchased the assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners  and in June 1970  control passed to the locally owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation  One of the ships commissioned to ship the natural resources of Nauru was the Eigamoiya  built by the Henry Robb shipyard at Leith in Scotland  19  Income from the mining of phosphate gave Nauruans one of the highest living standards in the Pacific and the world  20  In 1989  Nauru took legal actions against Australia in the International Court of Justice over Australia s actions during its administration of Nauru  In particular  Nauru made a legal complaint against Australia s failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining  21  22 Certain Phosphate Lands  Nauru v  Australia led to an out of court settlement to rehabilitate the mined out areas of Nauru   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Nauru The Nauruan parliament  Nauru is a republic with a parliamentary system of government  The president is both the head of state and of government  An 18 member unicameral parliament is elected every three years  The parliament elects a President from its members  and the President appoints a cabinet of five to six members  Nauru does not have any formal structure for political parties  Candidates typically stand for office as independents  Fifteen of the 18 members of the current Parliament are independents  and alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties  23  Three parties that have sometimes been active in Nauruan politics are the Democratic Party  Nauru First  and the Centre Party  Since 1992  local government has been the responsibility of the Nauru Island Council  NIC   The NIC has limited powers  and it functions as an advisor to the national government on local matters  The role of the NIC is to concentrate its efforts on local activities relevant to Nauruans  An elected member of the Nauru Island Council cannot simultaneously be a member of parliament  NIC was itself dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government  24 Land tenure on Nauru is unusual  all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island  which is owned by individuals and family groups  Government and corporate entities do not own any land  and they must enter into a lease arrangement with the landowners to use land  Non Nauruans cannot own land  6  Former President Marcus Stephen  Nauru had 17 changes of administration between 1989 and 2003  23  Between 1999 and 2003  a series of no confidence votes and elections resulted in two people  Ren  Harris and Bernard Dowiyogo  leading the country for alternating periods  Dowiyogo died in office in March 2003 and Ludwig Scotty was elected as the President  Scotty was re elected to serve a full term in October 2004  Following a vote of  no confidence  by Parliament against President Scotty on 19 December 2007  Marcus Stephen became the President  Nauru has a complex legal system  Its Supreme Court  headed by the Chief Justice  is paramount on constitutional issues  Other cases can be appealed to the two judge Appellate Court  Parliament cannot overturn court decisions  but Appellate Court rulings can be appealed to the High Court of Australia  25  However  in practice  this rarely happens  Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court  both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate  who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court  Finally  there also are two quasi courts  the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board  both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice  26  Nauru  with its small population  has no armed forces  Under an informal agreement  its defence is the responsibility of Australia  There is a small police force under civilian control  1   edit  Administrative divisions Main article  Districts of Nauru Nauru is divided into fourteen administrative districts which are grouped into eight electoral constituencies  The districts are Aiwo   Anabar   Anetan   Anibare   Baiti   Boe   Buada   Denigomodu   Ewa   Ijuw   Meneng   Nibok   Uaboe   Yaren  edit  Foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of Nauru Following independence in 1968  Nauru joined the Commonwealth of Nations as a Special Member  and it became a full member in 2000  5  Nauru was admitted to the Asian Development Bank in 1991 and to the United Nations in 1999  Nauru is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum  the South Pacific Regional Environmental Program  the South Pacific Commission  and the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission  The American Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program operates a climate monitoring facility on Nauru  Symbol of the Pacific Islands Forum Nauru has no armed forces  and Australia is responsible for Nauru s defense under an informal agreement between the two countries  27  The September 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between the two countries provides Nauru with financial aid and technical assistance  including a Secretary of Finance to prepare Nauru s budget  and advisers on health and education  This aid is in return for Nauru s housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed  23  Nauru uses the Australian dollar as its official currency  Nauru has used its position as a member of the United Nations to gain financial support from both Taiwan and China by changing its recognition from one to the other  see One China policy   During 2002  Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC on 21 July  Nauru accepted  130m from PRC for this action  28  In response  the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later  Nauru later re established links with the ROC on 14 May 2005  29  and diplomatic ties with the PRC were officially severed on 31 May 2005  However  the PRC continues to maintain a representative office on Nauru  Similarly in 2008  Nauru recognised Serbian break away region Kosovo as an independent country  Then  in 2009  Nauru became the fourth country  after Russia  Nicaragua  and Venezuela to recognise Abkhazia  a breakaway region of Georgia  Russia was reported to be giving Nauru  50M in humanitarian aid in return  30  On 15 July  the Nauru government announced a port refurbishment programme to be completed in early 2011  The programme is financed with US 9 million of development aid received from Russia  The Nauru government claims this aid is not related to its recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia  31  In recent times  a significant portion of Nauru s income has been in the form of aid from Australia  In 2001  the MV Tampa  a Norwegian ship that had rescued 433 32  refugees  from various countries including Afghanistan  from a stranded 20 metre long boat and was seeking to dock in Australia  was diverted to Nauru as part of the Pacific Solution  Nauru operated the detention centre in exchange for Australian aid  By November 2005  only two refugees  Mohammed Sagar and Muhammad Faisal  remained on Nauru from those first sent there in 2001  33  with Sagar finally resettling in early 2007  The Australian government sent further groups of asylum seekers to Nauru in late 2006 and early 2007  34  In late January 2008  following Australia s decision to close the processing centre  Nauru announced that they will request a new aid deal to ease the resulting blow to the economy  35   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Nauru Map of Nauru Nauru is a 21 square kilometres  8 sq mi   1  oval shaped island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean  42 kilometres  26 mi  south of the Equator  5  The island is surrounded by a coral reef  which is exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles  The reef is bounded seaward by deep water  and on the inside by a sandy beach  The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a seaport  although 16 channels in reef allow small boats access to the island  A 150 to 300 metre  about 500 to 1 000 ft   wide fertile coastal strip lies inland from the beach  Coral cliffs surround Nauru s central plateau  which is known as  Topside   The highest point of the plateau  called the Command Ridge  is 71 metres above sea level  36  The only fertile areas on Nauru are the narrow coastal belt  where coconut palms flourish  The land surrounding Buada Lagoon supports bananas  pineapples  vegetables  pandanus trees  and indigenous hardwoods such as the tomano tree  The population of Nauru is concentrated in the coastal belt and around Buada Lagoon  Nauru was one of three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean  the others were Banaba  Ocean Island  in Kiribati and Makatea in French Polynesia   However  the phosphate reserves on Nauru are depleted for all practical purposes  Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to 15 metres  49 ft  high  A century of mining has stripped and devastated about 80  of the land area  Mining has also affected the surrounding Exclusive Economic Zone  with 40  of marine life estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff  37  A limestone plateau surrounded by a coral reef  an airstrip  and channels  but no seaport  There are limited natural fresh water resources on Nauru  Rooftop storage tanks collect rainwater  but the islanders are mostly dependent on three desalination plants housed at Nauru s Utilities Agency  Nauru s climate is hot and very humid year round   because of the proximity of the island to the Equator and the ocean  Nauru is hit by monsoon rains between November and February  Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the El Ni o Southern Oscillation  with several significant recorded droughts  6  The temperature on Nauru ranges between 26  C  79  F  and 35  C  95  F  during the day and between 22  C  72  F  and 34  C  93  F  at night  38  As an island country  Nauru is quite vulnerable to climate change and sea level change  but to what degree is difficult to predict  At least 80  of the land of Nauru is well elevated  but this area will be uninhabitable until the phosphate mining rehabilitation program is implemented  37  Also  the agricultural area of Nauru is quite close to the seashore  Climate data for Yaren District  Nauru Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high  C   F  34  93  37  99  35

are endemic  Coconut farming  mining  and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation  6  There are no native land mammals  but there are native birds  including the endemic Nauru Reed Warbler  insects  and land crabs  The Polynesian rat  cats  dogs  pigs  and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships  either accidentally or on purpose   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Nauru An aerial image of Nauru in 2002 from the U S  Department of Energy s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program  Regenerated vegetation covers 63  of land that was mined  37  The Nauruan economy peaked in the early 1980s  dependent almost entirely on the phosphate deposits that originate from the droppings of sea birds  There are few other resources  and most necessities are imported  39  Small scale mining is still conducted by the RONPhos  formerly known as the Nauru Phosphate Corporation  The government places a percentage of RONPhos s earnings into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust  The Trust manages long term investments  which were intended to support the citizens once the phosphate reserves were exhausted  The Trust s fixed and current assets  many of which were in Melbourne  were reduced considerably  and many never fully recovered  Some of the failed investments included financing 1993 s Leonardo the Musical  which was a financial failure  the purchase of the vacant Carlton and United Breweries site on Swanston Street in 1994 which was sold undeveloped in 1998  and a loan to the Fitzroy Football Club which went into liquidation in 1996  The Mercure Hotel in Sydney 40  and Nauru House in Melbourne were sold in 2004 to finance debts and Air Nauru s only Boeing 737  which was repossessed in December 2005  Normal air service resumed after the aircraft was replaced with a Boeing 737 300 airliner in June 2006  41  42  The value of the Trust is estimated to have shrunk from A 1 3 billion in 1991 to  138 million in 2002  43  In 2005  the corporation sold its property asset in Melbourne  the vacant Savoy Tavern site  for  7 5 million  44  Nauru currently lacks money to perform many of the basic functions of government  for example  the National Bank of Nauru is insolvent  The CIA World Factbook estimated GDP per capita at  5 000 in 2005  1  The Asian Development Bank 2007 economic report on Nauru estimated GDP per capita at  2 400 to  2 715  2  There are no personal taxes in Nauru  The unemployment rate is estimated to be 90   and the government employs 95  of those Nauruans who are employed  1  45  The Asian Development Bank notes that although the Administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms  in the absence of an alternative to phosphate mining  the medium term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance  43  The rental of tuna fishing opportunities within the Nauru Exclusive Economic zone generates significant revenue  Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy because there is little to see or do  and there are few facilities for tourists  The Menen Hotel and the OD N Aiwo Hotel are the only two hotels on the island  Limestone pinnacles remain after phosphate mining removed the guano  In the 1990s  Nauru became a tax haven and it offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee  46  The inter governmental Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering  FATF  then identified Nauru as one of 15  non cooperative  countries in its fight against money laundering  During the 1990s  it was possible to establish a licensed bank in Nauru for only  25 000 with no other requirements  Under pressure from FATF  Nauru introduced anti avoidance legislation in 2003  after which foreign hot money left the country  In October 2005  after satisfactory results from the legislation and its enforcement  FATF lifted the non cooperative designation  47  From 2001 to 2007  the Nauru detention centre provided a source of income for Nauru  The Nauruan authorities reacted with concern to its closure by Australia  48  In February 2008  the Foreign Affairs Minister  Dr  Kieren Keke  stated that it would result in 100 Nauruans losing their jobs  and would affect 10  of the island s population directly or indirectly    We have got a huge number of families that are suddenly going to be without any income  We are looking at ways we can try and provide some welfare assistance but our capacity to do that is very limited  Literally we have got a major unemployment crisis in front of us   49   edit  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Nauru Nauruan districts of Denigomodu and Nibok Nauru had 9 265 residents at end of 2006  2  The population was previously larger  but in 2006 some 1500 people left the island during a repatriation of immigrant workers from Kiribati and Tuvalu  The repatriation was motivated by wide scale reductions in force in the phosphate mining industry  2  The official language of Nauru is Nauruan  a distinct Pacific island language  which is spoken by 96  of ethnic Nauruans at home  2  English is widely spoken and it is the language of government and commerce  as Nauruan is not common outside of the country  The top ethnic groups of Nauru are Nauruan  58    other Pacific Islander  26    European  8    and Chinese  8    All Europeans are of British origin  and most of these have left since independence  The main religion practiced on the island is Christianity  two thirds Protestant  one third Roman Catholic   There is also a sizeable Bah    population  10     the largest proportion of any country in the world 50    and a Buddhist population  9   and a Muslim population  2 2    The Constitution provides for freedom of religion  However  the government restricts this right in some circumstances  and it has restricted the practice of religion by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and members of the Jehovah s Witnesses  most of whom are foreign workers employed by the government owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation  51  Literacy on Nauru is 96   and education is compulsory for children from six to 15 years old  and two more non compulsory years are offered  years 11 and 12   52  There is a campus of the University of the South Pacific on Nauru  Before this school was built  eligible students travelled to Australia  New Zealand  etc   for their college educations  Nauruans are the most obese people in the world  53  90  of adults have a higher BMI than the world average  54  97  of men and 93  of women are overweight or obese  53  Nauru has the world s highest level of type 2 diabetes  with more than 40  of the population affected  55  47  in American Samoa  44  in Tokelau  53  Other significant dietary related problems on Nauru include kidney disease and heart disease  Life expectancy on Nauru in 2009 was 60 6 years for males and 68 0 years for females  56   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of Nauru Nauruans descended from Polynesian and Micronesian seafarers who believed in a female deity  Eijebong  and a spirit land  an island called Buitani  Two of the 12 original tribal groups became extinct in the 20th century  Angam Day  held on 26 October  celebrates the recovery of the Nauruan population after the two World Wars  which together reduced the indigenous population to fewer than 1500  The displacement of the indigenous culture by colonial and contemporary  western influences is significant  Few of the old customs have been preserved  but some forms of traditional music  arts and crafts  and fishing are still practiced  Australian rules football  played at Linkbelt Oval There are no daily news publications on Nauru  although there is one fortnightly publication   Mwinen Ko   meaning  let s talk about it   There is a state owned television station  Nauru Television  NTV   which broadcasts programmes from New Zealand and Australia  and there is a state owned non commercial radio station  Radio Nauru  which carries programs from Radio Australia and the BBC  57  Australian rules football is the most popular sport in Nauru  There is a football league with seven teams  All games are played at the Linkbelt Oval  one of only two stadiums in Nauru  Other sports popular in Nauru include volleyball  netball  weightlifting  fishing and tennis  Nauru participates in the Commonwealth Games and the Summer Olympic Games  where team members have been somewhat successful in weightlifting  Marcus Stephen has been a medallist  and he was elected to Parliament in 2003  and was elected as President of Nauru in 2007  A traditional activity is catching noddy terns when they return from foraging at sea  At sunset  men stand on the beach ready to throw their lassos at the incoming birds  The Nauruan lasso is supple rope with a weight at the end  When a bird approaches  the lasso is thrown up  hits or drapes itself over the bird  which falls to the ground  The noddy is then killed  plucked  cleaned  cooked  and eaten  58   edit  See also Geography portal Oceania portal Micronesia portal Outline of Nauru Index of Nauru related articles  edit  Further reading John M  Gowdy  Carl N
