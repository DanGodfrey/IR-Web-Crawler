v t e Monetary policy is the process by which the monetary authority of a country controls the supply of money  often targeting a rate of interest for the purpose of promoting economic growth and stability  1  2  The official goals usually include relatively stable prices and low unemployment  Monetary theory provides insight into how to craft optimal monetary policy  It is referred to as either being expansionary or contractionary  where an expansionary policy increases the total supply of money in the economy more rapidly than usual  and contractionary policy expands the money supply more slowly than usual or even shrinks it  Expansionary policy is traditionally used to try to combat unemployment in a recession by lowering interest rates in the hope that easy credit will entice businesses into expanding  Contractionary policy is intended to slow inflation in hopes of avoiding the resulting distortions and deterioration of asset values  Monetary policy differs from fiscal policy  which refers to taxation  government spending  and associated borrowing  3  Contents 1 Overview 1 1 Theory 2 History of monetary policy 2 1 Trends in central banking 2 2 Developing countries 3

External links  edit  Overview Monetary policy rests on the relationship between the rates of interest in an economy  that is  the price at which money can be borrowed  and the total supply of money  Monetary policy uses a variety of tools to control one or both of these  to influence outcomes like economic growth  inflation  exchange rates with other currencies and unemployment  Where currency is under a monopoly of issuance  or where there is a regulated system of issuing currency through banks which are tied to a central bank  the monetary authority has the ability to alter the money supply and thus influence the interest rate  to achieve policy goals   The beginning of monetary policy as such comes from the late 19th century  where it was used to maintain the gold standard  A policy is referred to as contractionary if it reduces the size of the money supply or increases it only slowly  or if it raises the interest rate  An expansionary policy increases the size of the money supply more rapidly  or decreases the interest rate  Furthermore  monetary policies are described as follows  accommodative  if the interest rate set by the central monetary authority is intended to create economic growth  neutral  if it is intended neither to create growth nor combat inflation  or tight if intended to reduce inflation  There are several monetary policy tools available to achieve these ends  increasing interest rates by fiat  reducing the monetary base  and increasing reserve requirements  All have the effect of contracting the money supply  and  if reversed  expand the money supply  Since the 1970s  monetary policy has generally been formed separately from fiscal policy  Even prior to the 1970s  the Bretton Woods system still ensured that most nations would form the two policies separately  Within almost all modern nations  special institutions  such as the Federal Reserve System in the United States  the Bank of England  the European Central Bank  the People s Bank of China  and the Bank of Japan  exist which have the task of executing the monetary policy and often independently of the executive  In general  these institutions are called central banks and often have other responsibilities such as supervising the smooth operation of the financial system  The primary tool of monetary policy is open market operations  This entails managing the quantity of money in circulation through the buying and selling of various financial instruments  such as treasury bills  company bonds  or foreign currencies  All of these purchases or sales result in more or less base currency entering or leaving market circulation  Usually  the short term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short term interest rate target  In other instances  monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold  For example  in the case of the USA the Federal Reserve targets the federal funds rate  the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight  however  the monetary policy of China is to target the exchange rate between the Chinese renminbi and a basket of foreign currencies  The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include   i  Discount window lending  lender of last resort    ii  Fractional deposit lending  changes in the reserve requirement    iii  Moral suasion  cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes    iv   Open mouth operations   talking monetary policy with the market    edit  Theory Monetary policy is the process by which the government  central bank  or monetary authority of a country controls  i  the supply of money   ii  availability of money  and  iii  cost of money or rate of interest to attain a set of objectives oriented towards the growth and stability of the economy  1  Monetary theory provides insight into how to craft optimal monetary policy  Monetary policy rests on the relationship between the rates of interest in an economy  that is the price at which money can be borrowed  and the total supply of money  Monetary policy uses a variety of tools to control one or both of these  to influence outcomes like economic growth  inflation  exchange rates with other currencies and unemployment  Where currency is under a monopoly of issuance  or where there is a regulated system of issuing currency through banks which are tied to a central bank  the monetary authority has the ability to alter the money supply and thus influence the interest rate  to achieve policy goals   It is important for policymakers to make credible announcements  If private agents  consumers and firms  believe that policymakers are committed to lowering inflation  they will anticipate future prices to be lower than otherwise  how those expectations are formed is an entirely different matter  compare for instance rational expectations with adaptive expectations   If an employee expects prices to be high in the future  he or she will draw up a wage contract with a high wage to match these prices  citation needed  Hence  the expectation of lower wages is reflected in wage setting behavior between employees and employers  lower wages since prices are expected to be lower  and since wages are in fact lower there is no demand pull inflation because employees are receiving a smaller wage and there is no cost push inflation because employers are paying out less in wages  To achieve this low level of inflation  policymakers must have credible announcements  that is  private agents must believe that these announcements will reflect actual future policy  If an announcement about low level inflation targets is made but not believed by private agents  wage setting will anticipate high level inflation and so wages will be higher and inflation will rise  A high wage will increase a consumer s demand  demand pull inflation  and a firm s costs  cost push inflation   so inflation rises  Hence  if a policymaker s announcements regarding monetary policy are not credible  policy will not have the desired effect  If policymakers believe that private agents anticipate low inflation  they have an incentive to adopt an expansionist monetary policy  where the marginal benefit of increasing economic output outweighs the marginal cost of inflation   however  assuming private agents have rational expectations  they know that policymakers have this incentive  Hence  private agents know that if they anticipate low inflation  an expansionist policy will be adopted that causes a rise in inflation  Consequently   unless policymakers can make their announcement of low inflation credible   private agents expect high inflation  This anticipation is fulfilled through adaptive expectation  wage setting behavior  so  there is higher inflation  without the benefit of increased output   Hence  unless credible announcements can be made  expansionary monetary policy will fail  Announcements can be made credible in various ways  One is to establish an independent central bank with low inflation targets  but no output targets   Hence  private agents know that inflation will be low because it is set by an independent body  Central banks can be given incentives to meet targets  for example  larger budgets  a wage bonus for the head of the bank  to increase their reputation and signal a strong commitment to a policy goal  Reputation is an important element in monetary policy implementation  But the idea of reputation should not be confused with commitment  While a central bank might have a favorable reputation due to good performance in conducting monetary policy  the same central bank might not have chosen any particular form of commitment  such as targeting a certain range for inflation   Reputation plays a crucial role in determining how much markets would believe the announcement of a particular commitment to a policy goal but both concepts should not be assimilated  Also  note that under rational expectations  it is not necessary for the policymaker to have established its reputation through past policy actions  as an example  the reputation of the head of the central bank might be derived entirely from his or her ideology  professional background  public statements  etc  In fact it has been argued 4  that to prevent some pathologies related to the time inconsistency of monetary policy implementation  in particular excessive inflation   the head of a central bank should have a larger distaste for inflation than the rest of the economy on average  Hence the reputation of a particular central bank is not necessary tied to past performance  but rather to particular institutional arrangements that the markets can use to form inflation expectations  Despite the frequent discussion of credibility as it relates to monetary policy  the exact meaning of credibility is rarely defined  Such lack of clarity can serve to lead policy away from what is believed to be the most beneficial  For example  capability to serve the public interest is one definition of credibility often associated with central banks  The reliability with which a central bank keeps its promises is also a common definition  While everyone most likely agrees a central bank should not lie to the public  wide disagreement exists on how a central bank can best serve the public interest  Therefore  lack of definition can lead people to believe they are supporting one particular policy of credibility when they are really supporting another  5   edit  History of monetary policy Monetary policy is associated with interest rates and availabilility of credit  Instruments of monetary policy have included short term interest rates and bank reserves through the monetary base  6  For many centuries there were only two forms of monetary policy   i  Decisions about coinage   ii  Decisions to print paper money to create credit  Interest rates  while now thought of as part of monetary authority  were not generally coordinated with the other forms of monetary policy during this time  Monetary policy was seen as an executive decision  and was generally in the hands of the authority with seigniorage  or the power to coin  With the advent of larger trading networks came the ability to set the price between gold and silver  and the price of the local currency to foreign currencies  This official price could be enforced by law  even if it varied from the market price  Paper money called  jiaozi  originated from promissory notes in 7th century China  Jiaozi did not replace metallic currency  and were used alongside the copper coins  The successive Yuan Dynasty was the first government to use paper currency as the predominant circulating medium  In the later course of the dynasty  facing massive shortages of specie to fund war and their rule in China  they began printing paper money without restrictions  resulting in hyperinflation  With the creation of the Bank of England in 1694  which acquired the responsibility to print notes and back them with gold  the idea of monetary policy as independent of executive action began to be established  7  The goal of monetary policy was to maintain the value of the coinage  print notes which would trade at par to specie  and prevent coins from leaving circulation  The establishment of central banks by industrializing nations was associated then with the desire to maintain the nation s peg to the gold standard  and to trade in a narrow band with other gold backed currencies  To accomplish this end  central banks as part of the gold standard began setting the interest rates that they charged  both their own borrowers  and other banks who required liquidity  The maintenance of a gold standard required almost monthly adjustments of interest rates  During the 1870 1920 period  the industrialized nations set up central banking systems  with one of the last being the Federal Reserve in 1913  8  By this point the role of the central bank as the  lender of last resort  was understood  It was also increasingly understood that interest rates had an effect on the entire economy  in no small part because of the marginal revolution in economics  which demonstrated how people would change a decision based on a change in the economic trade offs  Monetarist economists long contended that the money supply growth could affect the macroeconomy  These included Milton Friedman who early in his career advocated that government budget deficits during recessions be financed in equal amount by money creation to help to stimulate aggregate demand for output  9  Later he advocated simply increasing the monetary supply at a low  constant rate  as the best way of maintaining low inflation and stable output growth  10  However  when U S  Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker tried this policy  starting in October 1979  it was found to be impractical  because of the highly unstable relationship between monetary aggregates and other macroeconomic variables  11  Even Milton Friedman acknowledged that money supply targeting was less successful than he had hoped  in an interview with the Financial Times on June 7  2003  12  13  14  Therefore  monetary decisions today take into account a wider range of factors  such as  short term interest rates  long term interest rates  velocity of money through the economy  exchange rates  credit quality  bonds and equities  corporate ownership and debt   government versus private sector spending savings  international capital flows of money on large scales  financial derivatives such as options  swaps  futures contracts  etc  A small but vocal group of people  primarily libertarians and Constitutionalists 15   advocate for a return to the gold standard  the elimination of the dollar s fiat currency status and even of the Federal Reserve Bank   Their argument is basically that monetary policy is fraught with risk and these risks will result in drastic harm to the populace should monetary policy fail  Others who   see another problem with our current monetary policy  The problem for them is not that our money has nothing physical to define its value  but that fractional reserve lending of that money as a debt to the recipient  rather than a credit  causes all but a small proportion of society  including all governments  to be perpetually in debt  In fact  many economists who   disagree with returning to a gold standard  They argue that doing so would drastically limit the money supply  and throw away 100 years of advancement in monetary policy  The sometimes complex financial transactions that make big business  especially international business  easier and safer would be much more difficult if not impossible  Moreover  shifting risk to different people companies that specialize in monitoring and using risk can turn any financial risk into a known dollar amount and therefore make business predictable and more profitable for everyone involved  Some have claimed that these arguments lost credibility in the global financial crisis of 2008 2009   edit  Trends in central banking The central bank influences interest rates by expanding or contracting the monetary base  which consists of currency in circulation and banks  reserves on deposit at the central bank  The primary way that the central bank can affect the monetary base is by open market operations or sales and purchases of second hand government debt  or by changing the reserve requirements  If the central bank wishes to lower interest rates  it purchases government debt  thereby increasing the amount of cash in circulation or crediting banks  reserve accounts  Alternatively  it can lower the interest rate on discounts or overdrafts  loans to banks secured by suitable collateral  specified by the central bank   If the interest rate on such transactions is sufficiently low  commercial banks can borrow from the central bank to meet reserve requirements and use the additional liquidity to expand their balance sheets  increasing the credit available to the economy  Lowering reserve requirements has a similar effect  freeing up funds for banks to increase loans or buy other profitable assets  A central bank can only operate a truly independent monetary policy when the exchange rate is floating  16  If the exchange rate is pegged or managed in any way  the central bank will have to purchase or sell foreign exchange  These transactions in foreign exchange will have an effect on the monetary base analogous to open market purchases and sales of government debt  if the central bank buys foreign exchange  the monetary base expands  and vice versa  But even in the case of a pure floating exchange rate  central banks and monetary authorities can at best  lean against the wind  in a world where capital is mobile  Accordingly  the management of the exchange rate will influence domestic monetary conditions  To maintain its monetary policy target  the central bank will have to sterilize or offset its foreign exchange operations  For example  if a central bank buys foreign exchange  to counteract appreciation of the exchange rate   base money will increase  Therefore  to sterilize that increase  the central bank must also sell government debt to contract the monetary base by an equal amount  It follows that turbulent activity in foreign exchange markets can cause a central bank to lose control of domestic monetary policy when it is also managing the exchange rate  In the 1980s  many economists who   began to believe that making a nation s central bank independent of the rest of executive government is the best way to ensure an optimal monetary policy  and those central banks which did not have independence began to gain it  This is to avoid overt manipulation of the tools of monetary policies to effect political goals  such as re electing the current government  Independence typically means that the members of the committee which conducts monetary policy have long  fixed terms  Obviously  this is a somewhat limited independence  In the 1990s  central banks began adopting formal  public inflation targets with the goal of making the outcomes  if not the process  of monetary policy more transparent  In other words  a central bank may have an inflation target of 2  for a given year  and if inflation turns out to be 5   then the central bank will typically have to submit an explanation  The Bank of England exemplifies both these trends  It became independent of government through the Bank of England Act 1998 and adopted an inflation target of 2 5  RPI  now 2  of CPI   The debate rages on about whether monetary policy can smooth business cycles or not  A central conjecture of Keynesian economics is that the central bank can stimulate aggregate demand in the short run  because a significant number of prices in the economy are fixed in the short run and firms will produce as many goods and services as are demanded  in the long run  however  money is neutral  as in the neoclassical model   There is also the Austrian school of economics  which includes Friedrich von Hayek and Ludwig von Mises s arguments  17  which argues that central bank monetary policy aggravates the business cycle  creating malinvestment and maladjustments in the economy which then cause downcycle corrections  but most economists fall into either the Keynesian or neoclassical camps on this issue   edit  Developing countries Developing countries may have problems establishing an effective operating monetary policy  The primary difficulty is that few developing countries have deep markets in government debt  The matter is further complicated by the difficulties in forecasting money demand and fiscal pressure to levy the inflation tax by expanding the monetary base rapidly  In general  the central banks in many developing countries have poor records in managing monetary policy  This is often because the monetary authority in a developing country is not independent of government  so good monetary policy takes a backseat to the political desires of the government or are used to pursue other non monetary goals  For this and other reasons  developing countries that want to establish credible monetary policy may institute a currency board or adopt dollarization  Such forms of monetary institutions thus essentially tie the hands of the government from interference and  it is hoped  that such policies will import the monetary policy of the anchor nation  Recent attempts at liberalizing and reforming financial markets  particularly the recapitalization of banks and other financial institutions in Nigeria and elsewhere  are gradually providing the latitude required to implement monetary policy frameworks by the relevant central banks   edit  Types of monetary policy In practice  to implement any type of monetary policy the main tool used is modifying the amount of base money in circulation  The monetary authority does this by buying or selling financial assets  usually government obligations   These open market operations change either the amount of money or its liquidity  if less liquid forms of money are bought or sold   The multiplier effect of fractional reserve banking amplifies the effects of these actions  Constant market transactions by the monetary authority modify the supply of currency and this impacts other market variables such as short term interest rates and the exchange rate  The distinction between the various types of monetary policy lies primarily with the set of instruments and target variables that are used by the monetary authority to achieve their goals  Monetary Policy  Target Market Variable  Long Term Objective  Inflation Targeting Interest rate on overnight debt A given rate of change in the CPI Price Level Targeting Interest rate on overnight debt A specific CPI number Monetary Aggregates The growth in money supply A given rate of change in the CPI Fixed Exchange Rate The spot price of the currency The spot price of the currency Gold Standard The spot price of gold Low inflation as measured by the gold price Mixed Policy Usually interest rates Usually unemployment   CPI change The different types of policy are also called monetary regimes  in parallel to exchange rate regimes  A fixed exchange rate is also an exchange rate regime  The Gold standard results in a relatively fixed regime towards the currency of other countries on the gold standard and a floating regime towards those that are not  Targeting inflation  the price level or other monetary aggregates implies floating exchange rate unless the management of the relevant foreign currencies is tracking exactly the same variables  such as a harmonized consumer price index    edit  Inflation targeting Main article  Inflation targeting Under this policy approach the target is to keep inflation  under a particular definition such as Consumer Price Index  within a desired range  The inflation target is achieved through periodic adjustments to the Central Bank interest rate target  The interest rate used is generally the interbank rate at which banks lend to each other overnight for cash flow purposes  Depending on the country this particular interest rate might be called the cash rate or something similar  The interest rate target is maintained for a specific duration using open market operations  Typically the duration that the interest rate target is kept constant will vary between months and years  This interest rate target is usually reviewed on a monthly or quarterly basis by a policy committee  Changes to the interest rate target are made in response to various market indicators in an attempt to forecast economic trends and in so doing keep the market on track towards achieving the defined inflation target  For example  one simple method of inflation targeting called the Taylor rule adjusts the interest rate in response to changes in the inflation rate and the output gap  The rule was proposed by John B  Taylor of Stanford University  18  The inflation targeting approach to monetary policy approach was pioneered in New Zealand  It is currently used in Australia  Brazil  Canada  Chile  Colombia  the Czech Republic  Hungary  New Zealand  Norway  Iceland  India  Philippines  Poland  Sweden  South Africa  Turkey  and the United Kingdom   edit  Price level targeting Price level targeting is similar to inflation targeting except that CPI growth in one year over or under the long term price level target is offset in subsequent years such that a targeted price level is reached over time  e g  five years  giving more certainty about future price increases to consumers  Under inflation targeting what happened in the immediate past years is not taken into account or adjusted for in the current and future years   edit  Monetary aggregates In the 1980s  several countries used an approach based on a constant growth in the money supply  This approach was refined to include different classes of money and credit  M0  M1 etc    In the USA this approach to monetary policy was discontinued with the selection of Alan Greenspan as Fed Chairman  This approach is also sometimes called monetarism  While most monetary policy focuses on a price signal of one form or another  this approach is focused on monetary quantities   edit  Fixed exchange rate This policy is based on maintaining a fixed exchange rate with a foreign currency  There are varying degrees of fixed exchange rates  which can be ranked in relation to how rigid the fixed exchange rate is with the anchor nation  Under a system of fiat fixed rates  the local government or monetary authority declares a fixed exchange rate but does not actively buy or sell currency to maintain the rate  Instead  the rate is enforced by non convertibility measures  e g  capital controls  import export licenses  etc    In this case there is a black market exchange rate where the currency trades at its market unofficial rate  Under a system of fixed convertibility  currency is bought and sold by the central bank or monetary authority on a daily basis to achieve the target exchange rate  This target rate may be a fixed level or a fixed band within which the exchange rate may fluctuate until the monetary authority intervenes to buy or sell as necessary to maintain the exchange rate within the band   In this case  the fixed exchange rate with a fixed level can be seen as a special case of the fixed exchange rate with bands where the bands are set to zero   Under a system of fixed exchange rates maintained by a currency board every unit of local currency must be backed by a unit of foreign currency  correcting for the exchange rate   This ensures that the local monetary base does not inflate without being backed by hard currency and eliminates any worries about a run on the local currency by those wishing to convert the local currency to the hard  anchor  currency  Under dollarization  foreign currency  usually the US dollar  hence the term  dollarization   is used freely as the medium of exchange either exclusively or in parallel with local currency  This outcome can come about because the local population has lost all faith in the local currency  or it may also be a policy of the government  usually to rein in inflation and import credible monetary policy   These policies often abdicate monetary policy to the foreign monetary authority or government as monetary policy in the pegging nation must align with monetary policy in the anchor nation to maintain the exchange rate  The degree to which local monetary policy becomes dependent on the anchor nation depends on factors such as capital mobility  openness  credit channels and other economic factors  See also  List of fixed currencies  edit  Gold standard Main article  Gold standard The gold standard is a system under which the price of the national currency is measured in units of gold bars and is kept constant by the government s promise to buy or sell gold at a fixed price in terms of the base currency  The gold standard might be regarded as a special case of  fixed exchange rate  policy  or as a special type of commodity price level targeting  The minimal gold standard would be a long term commitment to tighten monetary policy enough to prevent the price of gold from permanently rising above parity  A full gold standard would be a commitment to sell unlimited amounts of gold at parity and maintain a reserve of gold sufficient to redeem the entire monetary base  Today this type of monetary policy is no longer used by any country  although the gold standard was widely used across the world between the mid 19th century through 1971  19  Its major advantages were simplicity and transparency  The gold standard was abandoned during the Great Depression  as countries sought to reinvigorate their economies by increasing their money supply  20  The Bretton Woods system  which was a modified gold standard  replaced it in the aftermath of World War II  However  this system too broke down during the Nixon shock of 1971  The gold standard induces deflation  as the economy usually grows faster than the supply of gold  When an economy grows faster than its money supply  the same amount of money is used to execute a larger number of transactions  The only way to make this possible is to lower the nominal cost of each transaction  which means that prices of goods and services fall  and each unit of money increases in value  Absent precautionary measures  deflation would tend to increase the ratio of the real value of nominal debts to physical assets over time  For example  during deflation  nominal debt and the monthly nominal cost of a fixed rate home mortgage stays the same  even while the dollar value of the house falls  and the value of the dollars required to pay the mortgage goes up  Mainstream economics considers such deflation to be a major disadvantage of the gold standard  Unsustainable  i e  excessive  deflation can cause problems during recessions and financial crisis lengthening the amount of time an economy spends in recession  William Jennings Bryan rose to national prominence when he built his historic  though unsuccessful  1896 presidential campaign around the argument that deflation caused by the gold standard made it harder for everyday citizens to start new businesses  expand their farms  or build new homes   edit  Policy of various

that the Fed funds rate responds to shocks in inflation and output  Further information  Monetary policy of the USA  edit  Monetary policy tools  edit  Monetary base Monetary policy can be implemented by changing the size of the monetary base  Central banks use open market operations to change the monetary base  The central bank buys or sells reserve assets  usually financial instruments such as bonds  in exchange for money on deposit at the central bank  Those deposits are convertible to currency  Together such currency and deposits constitute the monetary base which is the general liabilities of the central bank in its own monetary unit  Usually other banks can use base money as a fractional reserve and expand the circulating money supply by a larger amount   edit  Reserve requirements The monetary authority exerts regulatory control over banks  Monetary policy can be implemented by changing the proportion of total assets that banks must hold in reserve with the central bank  Banks only maintain a small portion of their assets as cash available for immediate withdrawal  the rest is invested in illiquid assets like mortgages and loans  By changing the proportion of total assets to be held as liquid cash  the Federal Reserve changes the availability of loanable funds  This acts as a change in the money supply  Central banks typically do not change the reserve requirements often because it creates very volatile changes in the money supply due to the lending multiplier   edit  Discount window lending Discount window lending is where the commercial banks  and other depository institutions  are able to borrow reserves from the Central Bank at a discount rate  This rate is usually set below short term market rates  T bills   This enables the institutions to vary credit conditions  i e   the amount of money they have to loan out   thereby affecting the money supply  It is of note that the Discount Window is the only instrument which the Central Banks do not have total control over  By affecting the money supply  it is theorized  that monetary policy can establish ranges for inflation  unemployment  interest rates  and economic growth  A stable financial environment is created in which savings and investment can occur  allowing for the growth of the economy as a whole   edit  Interest rates Main article  Interest rates The contraction of the monetary supply can be achieved indirectly by increasing the nominal interest rates  Monetary authorities in different nations have differing levels of control of economy wide interest rates  In the United States  the Federal Reserve can set the discount rate  as well as achieve the desired Federal funds rate by open market operations  This rate has significant effect on other market interest rates  but there is no perfect relationship  In the United States open market operations are a relatively small part of the total volume in the bond market  One cannot set independent targets for both the monetary base and the interest rate because they are both modified by a single tool   open market operations  one must choose which one to control  In other nations  the monetary authority may be able to mandate specific interest rates on loans  savings accounts or other financial assets  By raising the interest rate s  under its control  a monetary authority can contract the money supply  because higher interest rates encourage savings and discourage borrowing  Both of these effects reduce the size of the money supply   edit  Currency board Main article  currency board A currency board is a monetary arrangement that pegs the monetary base of one country to another  the anchor nation  As such  it essentially operates as a hard fixed exchange rate  whereby local currency in circulation is backed by foreign currency from the anchor nation at a fixed rate  Thus  to grow the local monetary base an equivalent amount of foreign currency must be held in reserves with the currency board  This limits the possibility for the local monetary authority to inflate or pursue other objectives  The principal rationales behind a currency board are threefold  To import monetary credibility of the anchor nation  To maintain a fixed exchange rate with the anchor nation  To establish credibility with the exchange rate  the currency board arrangement is the hardest form of fixed exchange rates outside of dollarization   In theory  it is possible that a country may peg the local currency to more than one foreign currency  although  in practice this has never happened  and it would be a more complicated to run than a simple single currency currency board   A gold standard is a special case of a currency board where the value of the national currency is linked to the value of gold instead of a foreign currency  The currency board in question will no longer issue fiat money but instead will only issue a set number of units of local currency for each unit of foreign currency it has in its vault  The surplus on the balance of payments of that country is reflected by higher deposits local banks hold at the central bank as well as  initially  higher deposits of the  net  exporting firms at their local banks  The growth of the domestic money supply can now be coupled to the additional deposits of the banks at the central bank that equals additional hard foreign exchange reserves in the hands of the central bank  The virtue of this system is that questions of currency stability no longer apply  The drawbacks are that the country no longer has the ability to set monetary policy according to other domestic considerations  and that the fixed exchange rate will  to a large extent  also fix a country s terms of trade  irrespective of economic differences between it and its trading partners  Hong Kong operates a currency board  as does Bulgaria  Estonia established a currency board pegged to the Deutschmark in 1992 after gaining independence  and this policy is seen as a mainstay of that country s subsequent economic success  see Economy of Estonia for a detailed description of the Estonian currency board   Argentina abandoned its currency board in January 2002 after a severe recession  This emphasized the fact that currency boards are not irrevocable  and hence may be abandoned in the face of speculation by foreign exchange traders  Following the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995  Bosnia and Herzegovina established a currency board pegged to the Deutschmark  since 2002 replaced by the Euro   Currency boards have advantages for small  open economies that would find independent monetary policy difficult to sustain  They can also form a credible commitment to low inflation   edit  Unconventional monetary policy at the zero bound This section requires expansion  Other forms of monetary policy  particularly used when interest rates are at or near 0  and there are concerns about deflation or deflation is occurring  are referred to as unconventional monetary policy  These include credit easing  quantitative easing  and signaling  In credit easing  a central bank purchases private sector assets  in order to improve liquidity and improve access to credit  Signaling can be used to lower market expectations for future interest rates  For example  during the credit crisis of 2008  the US Federal Reserve indicated
