Norman Osborn  America s last hero  That s what I am     Iron Patriot   Norman Osborn was just a child when he first became obsessed with acquiring wealth and power after his father  a failed business inventor who claimed that he was swindled out of his inventions and personal fortune  took out his rage on Norman  Norman realized that he couldn t depend on his father for financial security  so he began working after school and saving every cent he earned  He wouldn t allow himself to become a failure like his father  Norman studied chemistry and electrical engineering in college  He also took a number of courses in business administration  One of his teachers was Professor Mendel Stromm  They became good friends and later formed a business partnership  Since Norman put up the bulk of the financing  they called their company Osborn Chemical  or Oscorp  Norman married his college sweetheart and they had a son  Harry  Unfortunately  his wife became ill  After she died  Norman buried himself in his work and rarely had time for young Harry  As the brilliant co owner of a chemical manufacturer known as Oscorp  Norman Osborn  loving wealth and power  decided to take control and had his partner Stromm arrested when he found he was committing embezzlement  granting him complete control over the company and making Norman the official CEO of Oscorp  While going through Stromm s notes  he found a secret formula that would make him superhumanly powerful  However  his son  Harry  who was tired of always being ignored and rejected by his father  switched the chemicals in the serum  which turned it green and caused it to explode in his face  Later  at the hospital  Norman Osborn found himself thinking more clearly than ever before  not knowing that he would slowly become insane  Attempting to achieve power beyond his wildest dreams  Norman Osborn planned to become the most powerful gang lord of all by uniting all the independent gangs under his leadership in an attempt to gain control over all of New York s crime  To prove his power and establish his reputation  he decided to choose Spider Man as his victim of choice  and sent two criminals  the Headsman and Scorcher  after Spider Man  The two were soundly defeated  and Norman Osborn decided to take matters into his own hands  Remembering a giant green goblin monster from childhood nightmares  he created a costume that reflected that monster  and he became the Green Goblin  He first battled Spider Man with the help of the Enforcers  by getting Spider Man to participate in a movie about him  Attempting to defeat him in New Mexico  he let Spider Man battle the Hulk  whose stomping grounds the Goblin  the Enforcers  and Spider Man accidentally stumbled upon  Escaping the Hulk  Spider Man attempted to capture the Green Goblin  but was too exhausted to prevent his escape  Returning to New York  the Green Goblin easily hid amongst New York s population  1  Spider Man and the Green Goblin fought a few months later at a fan club meeting for Spider Man organized by Flash Thompson  However  when Spider Man heard that his Aunt May was extremely ill  he was forced to retreat  giving him a sour reputation by most of New York s citizens  including several superheroes  super villains  citizens  and  of course  J  Jonah Jameson  and giving the Green Goblin an impressive reputation 2   Later still  the Green Goblin pretended to be helping the police by attempting to capture Lucky Louis  a big gang leader  and  after seeing defeat by Spider Man  attempted a partnership with the Crime Master  which again ended in defeat  With every one of these defeats  the Green Goblin became more determined  In time  Osborn became totally obsessed with Spider Man and finally began directing all of his efforts to finding a way to conquer his web swinging adversary  One of the biggest success in the Green Goblin s career was learning Spider Man s secret identity  by utilizing a false gang that sprayed Spider Man with a gas that nullified his spider sense  allowing the Goblin to follow him without being detected  Capturing Spider Man with ease  he brought him to his hideout and revealed himself to be Norman Osborn  the father of Harry Osborn  one of Peter Parker s classmates  After gloating and revealing his past  he let Spider Man escape his bindings  so as to prove his superiority  Spider Man managed to defeat the Goblin by sending him into a bunch of disconnected  high voltage wires that were drenched in chemicals  Gaining amnesia  Norman Osborn lost all memory up to the years that his son was in high school  Spider Man  content in this knowledge  burned the Green Goblin s costume  hoping never to see him again  Green Goblin  amp  Gwen Stacy  by Dan Brereton  Added by Copycat989  Death  of the Green Goblin Norman s memories eventually returned  and the Green Goblin attempted to overcome Norman and defeat Spider Man once more  this time with a bomb that was filled with a gas that nullified his wall clinging ability  Spider Man defeated him this time by landing on his back and luring him to the hospital room of Norman s son  who was extremely ill from drug abuse  Snapped back to reality  Norman returned to normal  The Goblin s Last Stand Added by ADour Osborn was involved in a brief affair with Gwen Stacy  which resulted in the birth of twins  Gabriel and Sarah  The twins were taken with Osborn to Europe to be raised during his sabbatical  They rapidly aged and developed superhuman strength and endurance  Somehow  though  by as of yet unknown means  Norman regained his memories  He nearly killed Gwen Stacy after kidnapping her and throwing her off a bridge  after which Spider Man attempted to save her with a web line  but the  romantic idiot  killed her by applying the 1100 pounds of force required to bring her to a dead stop  Filled with rage  Spider Man savagely attacked the Goblin  nearly killing him  He returned to his senses at the last minute  however and the Goblin took the opportunity to attempt one final play by remote controlling his goblin glider to impale the wall crawler  Spider Man was able to dodge the glider which instead impaled the Goblin  seemingly killing him  The nightmare was over  or at least that s what Peter thought  Harry Osborn  Norman s son  had witnessed the final defeat of his father at the hands of Spider Man and removed his costume before the authorities could arrive  thus preserving his secret identity  He even bribed the coroner so that further autopsies would show no trace of the  Goblin  formula in Norman s blood  And for many years  the world believed Norman Osborn to be dead  After the apparent death of the Green Goblin  many tried to follow in his footsteps  including his son Harry  Harry s therapist Bart Hamilton  Phil Urich  and millionaire Roderick Kingsley who attempted to create his own variation and legacy on the goblin motif as the murderous Hobgoblin  Each subsequent version of the goblin was defeated and Harry eventually died as a result of exposure to an untested experimental version of the formula that had given his father his abilities  Little did anyone know that Norman Osborn was in fact alive and well and putting a master plan into place that he hoped would ruin Spider Man forever  The Return of Norman Osborn The same formula that had given Osborn his heightened strength and intellect also gave him powerful regenerative abilities  allowing him to survive the impalement by his goblin glider  He had escaped the morgue  replacing his body with that of a drifter he had murdered  and impaled through the chest  and fled to Europe  There he joined the Cabal of Scriers  eventually moving up in their ranks and completely taking them over  After the death of his son Harry  whom Norman believed would prove himself in his absence  Osborn accelerated a series of plans he had formulated over the past several years  From the shadows  Osborn manipulated Empire State University Professor Miles Warren as part of a grand scheme to have Parker believe he was in fact a clone and that Ben Reilly  the real clone  was the real Peter Parker  However  with Peter s wife Mary Jane Watson pregnant and the possibility of a life without Spider Man on the horizon  Peter freely relinquished his alter ego to Reilly  Unsatisfied with these results  Osborn returned as the Green Goblin revealing himself as the mastermind behind the entire fiasco and killed Ben Reilly who sacrificed himself to save Peter  Reilly s body disintegrated  proving that Peter was in fact the real Spider Man all along  In addition  Osborn had an employee of his  Alison Mongrain poison Mary Jane into an induced premature labor  kidnapping the child  Osborn s next grand scheme was to make Spider man his heir  first drugging him into wearing the Goblin costume and attacking his friends  After days of physical and mental torture at the Osborn Estate  Peter nearly gave in  but refused at the last minute  Next  the Goblin used a drunken Flash Thompson to drive a truck into Midtown High School  where Peter had taken a job as a teacher  The accident caused Flash brain damage  and spurred Peter into a final battle with his old enemy  Although  it seemed that in some strange way Norman wanted Peter to finish him off  Peter refused saying he did not want to fight him anymore and declared a truce  Green Goblin and Spider Man Added by Moshikal15 Sometime later  Norman Osborn was finally revealed to the public as the Green Goblin and after an climatic battle with Spider Man and Luke Cage that raged across Manhattan  he was finally imprisoned  However  things were far from over  From behind bars  Osborn once again masterminded a plan against Spider Man  This time he had Mac Gargan  also known as the Scorpion  kidnap Peter s Aunt May  The plan was for Spider Man to break Osborn out of prison in exchange for his Aunt s life  Peter reluctantly agreed and with the help of the Black Cat proceeded to break Osborn out  only to have twelve of his greatest enemies waiting for him on the outside  Osborn had assembled a Sinister Twelve  which included Mac Gargan newly bonded with the Venom symbiote  However  Mary Jane had contacted SHIELD and the villains were faced with the combined might of Captain America  Iron Man  Yellowjacket  Daredevil and the Fantastic Four  During the fracas  the Goblin had escaped to kidnap Mary Jane and took her to the George Washington Bridge in order to replay his murder of Gwen Stacy  a final act of vengeance against Spider Man  However  a drugged Doctor Octopus intervened  attacking the Goblin  Spider Man was able to save Mary Jane after a bolt of lightning sent the two villains into the river  Following some verbal clues from the Goblin  Peter was also able to discover where he had hidden Aunt May and rescued her as well  It was revealed that Osborn sent Peter a letter before the fight  thanking Peter for giving his life meaning and purpose  but Peter never received the letter due to moving from his residence  After the Goblin s take down  Norman and Gwen s twins confronted Spider Man  They believed Parker to be their real father as well as responsible for killing their mother and abandoning them  Spider Man told the twins the truth   Gabriel rejected Spider Man  and accepted the Goblin mantle as the Gray Goblin  becoming insane in the process  After battling Spider Man  a deranged Gabriel disappeared  while Sarah sought training to use her powers for good  The Goblin later watched in shock as Spider Man publicly revealed his identity as Peter Parker  railing that Peter  broke the rules   Peter also confirmed on TV that Osborn was the Goblin  and that he killed Gwen Stacy  He was then approached by S H I E L D  agents who were seeking his aid  When Osborn fled during his last jail break  S H I E L D  agents picked him up outside of Paris and returned him to his jail cell under heightened security  The Goblin confronted and attacked Ben Urich in an alley  but SHIELD s nano machines caused him to stop  involuntarily making him collapse and foam at the mouth  The director of the Thunderbolts Added by UtterKhaos The Thunderbolts Later he made a deal with a shadowy figure from the pro registration side who gave him a serum to override the control nano machines implanted by SHIELD  The figure was indicated to be highly trusted by the superhero community  though whether he was himself a superhero was unspecified  Sally Floyd and Ben Urich believe it to be Tony Stark himself  3  He attacked a group of Atlanteans in his Goblin gear  killing and wounding many  Later  when an Atlantean ambassador attempted to give a speech  Norman appeared and shot him  wounding but not killing him  As he was being taken away by security  Norman said he was  sick  and not in control of his actions  While being interrogated by two officers  Norman became increasingly agitated when they questioned who gave Norman access to the press conference and assisted in smuggling a weapon there  At first  Norman became angry  threatening to kill the two officers  families  then he became more and more afraid until a government figure interrupted the interview  assumed from Norman s comments to be the man who neutralized his nano machines  at which point Norman begged the officers not to let him go  even promising to reveal all he knew to them  Norman Osborn became the government appointed new director of the Thunderbolts and was prescribed medication to stabilize his personality  He remained unbalanced  however  and prone to maniacal laughing fits  One such occurrence happened after he read a file on the Steel Spider   Steel Spider  man   After Mephisto changed reality  Norman s son  Harry  was alive once more and no one  including Norman  knew Spider Man s secret identity  In addition to calling the Thunderbolts to New York to hunt down Spider Man  Norman agreed to help New York mayoral candidate Randall Crowne  who got into trouble when Ben Urich s newspaper Frontline revealed that he had been operating an illegal sweatshop  Norman confronted the man who took the photos  Peter Parker  Norman was unable to find a way Parker could contact Spider Man and left him  When he later observed a fight between Venom  Anti Venom  and Spider Man  Norman was confronted by Menace  After a short confrontation  Menace spared him  after accusing Osborn of being a fool for devoting all his time and assets to Spider Man s destruction  As Menace left  Norman found Peter Parker s camera and used it to reverse engineer the tracing system allowing the camera to zero on Spider Man s chest  Norman later used the captured villain Freak to produce a counter measure for Anti Venom  at the same time providing Gargan with a protective Scorpion battle suit that would distribute the cure throughout his body  healing the symbiote faster  However when faced with the combined might of Anti Venom and Spider man  Anti Venom fled the fight and Norman had to destroy his recent New York Headquarters after his fight with Spider man  However  he was still regarded as a hero within the eyes of the public  Secret Invasion Captain Marvel  revealed to be a Skrull sleeper agent  attacked Thunderbolt Mountain  but he couldn t bring himself to kill Norman  Osborn offered him a chance to explain himself  spoke with him in private  and convinced him to leave  Following this  it became clear the Thunderbolts   due to Norman forcing the usage of Oscorp technology over Stark Industries products  the latter of which had been deactivated by Skrull agents   were the only team that could reach and defend Washington  D C   Norman successfully managed and directed the team  while personally joining the battle with a machine gun  During the conflict  several Skrulls shape shifted into duplicates of Spider Man  the sight of whom drove Norman into an apparent nervous breakdown  He gunned down every one of them  stating the slaughter to be  therapeutic  for him  After saving the capital city  Norman successfully manipulated the media to promote himself and the team as patriotic heroes  and undermined the CSA and his former industrial rival Tony Stark  who appeared to retreat in the heat of battle  He subsequently led the team to New York  joining the final battle  His  heroic  status was exemplified when numerous TV cameras captured his gunshot killing Skrull Queen Veranke  When the President of the United States shut down S H I E L D  and indicted Tony Stark  Norman was given the role of running the SHRA and the Avengers Initiative     The Dark Reign    Norman Osborn as the Iron Patriot Added by THOR66 Norman was seen as the Earth s greatest hero  and had been effectively granted the power to restructure the U S  military industrial complex to fill the gap left by S H I E L D  Osborn secretly brought together a group of super villains and morally ambiguous heroes  comprised of Doctor Doom  Namor  Emma Frost  The Hood  Loki  and  later  Taskmaster  under the name of the Cabal  Norman and his Cabal would initiate drastic changes that would tip the scales in favor of super villainy  with Osborn promising to give them all an opportunity to reach their respective goals  4  To counteract the villain s inherently treacherous natures  they were threatened into compliance by the Sentry  though Namor  Emma Frost  and Doctor Doom would all later leave or defect  Norman reformed S H I E L D  into H A M M E R   with himself as director  and former S H I E L D  accountant Victoria Hand as deputy  Tony Stark  formerly Director of S H I E L D   was portrayed as being indirectly responsible for the Skrull Invasion  Osborn had him hunted down as a fugitive  with the intention of recovering the sole remaining copy of the SHRA database  and also to obtain the secret behind the Iron Man armor s repulsor batteries  Osborn renamed the 50 State Initiative to the Thunderbolts Initiative  With many of the previous members of the Thunderbolts folded into his new Dark Avengers  he created a new team of Thunderbolts as his own black ops team  Led by the second Black Widow  this team s first mission was to assist Osborn in divesting himself of the bad publicity attached to Green Goblin image  When Osborn was called to ride aboard Air Force One by the new U S  President  he was confronted by Doc Samson  who possessed footage of one of the Green Goblin s murderous rampages  However  Osborn s new Thunderbolts engineered a scenario in which Osborn appeared to save the President from a gamma irradiated Doc Samson and a copycat Green Goblin  in actual fact  the Thunderbolt Headsman   Grateful  the President gave Osborn and H A M M E R  his blessings  When overseeing the closure of Thunderbolts Mountain  an irate Swordsman confronted Norman about his actions  Norman seized his sword and murdered him in a psychotic tantrum  Norman then began to realize that his Green Goblin persona was starting to resurface  The Dark Avengers  Added by Peteparker the Dark Avengers Osborn s next order of business was setting up his new team of Avengers  He was able to recruit Ares  The Sentry  and Marvel Boy  now calling himself Captain Marvel   as well as giving his former Thunderbolts new identities  Moonstone became Ms  Marvel  Venom became Spider Man  Bullseye became Hawkeye  and the addition of Daken who took the identity of Wolverine   With the help of Ghost  Osborn was able to break into one of Tony Stark s armories and create his own suit  fusing elements of the design of both Tony Stark s  Extremis  suit and the Captain America s costume  naming his new super  hero  persona the Iron Patriot  5  The Dark Avengers  first mission was a response to a distress call from Doctor Doom  who had been attacked in his homeland of Latveria by Morgan le Fay  5  Osborn and Doom linked their armors to travel back in time  killing Morgan before she could launch her assault  6  Osborn and the Dark Avengers would later encounter rogue Atlanteans 7  and Molecule Man  8  The Void and the Green Goblin resurgent Osborn appeared initially to use his experiences of mental illness to empathize with Robert Reynolds  schizophrenia  helping to suppress the Sentry s evil alter ego  the Void  However  it would gradually become apparent that Osborn was merely callously gaining Reynold s trust  so that he would more willingly acquiesce to Osborn s later requests to allow to the Void to take control  Perhaps as a result of Osborn s manipulations  the Void would eventually establish itself as the dominant persona and begin to destroy New York  Osborn was able to negotiate a deal of sorts  with Osborn promising the Void happiness if he followed his orders  9  Concurrent to Reynolds  deterioration  Osborn s own psyche appeared to be fracturing  He began to suffer auditory and visual hallucinations of the Green Goblin persona   some  if not all  of which were revealed to be due to Loki s sorcery  10  American Son Norman became the father of Lily Hollister s child  Norman wanted to turn Harry into the  American Son   a hero combining Iron Man s armor technology and Captain America s super soldier serum  He offered Harry a job at H A M M E R  Harry refused  but reconsidered later when he found out that Lily Hollister was pregnant  believing the child was his  After Harry s first day working at the Avengers  Tower  he snuck into restricted areas  using Green Goblin gadgets   and found a antidote serum for Lily  Lily mocked Harry  claiming she wanted to be Menace  and confessed the child was Norman s  Harry confronted Norman who confessed his plan to have the American Son die after his inception  to bring Americans around the Iron Patriot  11  Harry fought Norman using the American Son armor  Norman insulted Harry saying that he had to breed a better child to make up for Harry s failure  Harry almost decapitated Norman but instead walked away  accepting that Norman was no longer his father  ruining his greatest plan  12  Utopia When riots began in San Francisco over regulation for mutants  H A M M E R  moved in to secure the situation  Osborn branded Cyclops as the instigator of the chaos and turned public opinion against him and the X Men  He had Namor and Emma assemble a team of mutants to serve as Osborn s X Men for the riots and round up many hostile mutants to subject to the Omega Machine  a device created by Dark Beast to sap them of their powers  13  Cyclops negotiated with Osborn and demanded that he leave the city once he had the riots under control  However  their arguments went nowhere  so Cyclops left  In a more sinister moment  as the Iron Patriot   Osborn announced that he would kill Cyclops personally  14  Soon enough  Frost and Namor turned on Osborn  having been working for Cyclops the whole time  allowing X Force to evacuate the captive mutants  They retreated to a rebuilt Asteroid M  christened the Utopia  Cyclops denounced Osborn and his methods on live television  Angered at this betrayal  Osborn became determined to kill his fellow Cabal members  15  However  his team was defeated one by one by the X Men  Eventually  only Osborn and Sofen were left  forcing them to retreat  The List During his Dark Reign  Norman Osborn drew up a  to do  list  consisting of solutions to major threats to his status quo  which he pursued with varying degress of success  Osborn leads the Siege of Asgard Added by Matthew Stanley Feldman The Siege Of Asgard Osborn viewed the presence of Asgard above Oklahoma as a threat to the American way of life  At Loki s suggestion 16   Osborn sought to create a scenario that would force the President of the United States to allow H A M M E R  to invade and destroy Asgard  Osborn tasked the Hood with recruiting a team of villains that would be able to instigate the Siege  The Hood s U Foes implicated Volstagg  an Asgardian  in the massacre of thousands of innocent spectators at a football match at Soldier Field Stadium in Chicago  With an Asgardian apparently responsible  Osborn was now able to justify his invasion  Despite Ares s initial misgivings  and without receiving official clearance from the President  Osborn led the Dark Avengers  members of the Thunderbolts Initiative and the Hood s gang  and a surfeit of H A M M E R  troops and helicarriers in an assault of Asgard  17  While the Void set about destroying Asgard proper  Osborn and his cronies battled with Thor  Maria Hill  Nick Fury and his Secret Warriors  the New and Young Avengers  the recently returned Steve Rogers  and the recently revived  Extremis free Tony Stark  18  Meanwhile  in the White House  appalled by Osborn s unsanctioned attack on Asgard  the President gave the order to dissolve H A M M E R  and arrest Osborn for treason  Back in Oklahoma  Tony Stark swiftly disabled Osborn s Iron Patriot armor with his own MK IV armor  and Osborn  realizing his imminent defeat  commanded the Void to destroy Asgard utterly  Before Steve Rogers could place Osborn under arrest  the compromised Iron Patriot armor disintegrated  revealing that the stress of running H A M M E R  had taken a grievous toll on Osborn s mental health  underneath  Osborn had been wearing a crude face paint rendition of the Green Goblin mask  The images of Osborn s breakdown were broadcast worldwide  cementing his downfall and the end of the Dark Reign  The assembled heroes were subsequently threatened by the grotesquely malformed Void  Osborn  deranged and defiant  claimed that his sympathy and influence was all that had kept the Void under control  and that without it  the Void was unstoppable  In the ensuing battle  Osborn briefly escaped  only to be recaptured by Volstagg and Steve Rogers  19  In Prison Osborn was initially incarcerated in the Raft penitentiary  still tormented by his Goblin persona  whom Osborn blamed for preventing him from successfully remaking the world as he saw fit  Later  Osborn was secretly transferred to the Special Containment Center  There  he met Father Coulmier  his secret follower  When his other imprisoned followers rioted in the Second Wing  he and other dangerous villains  including Ai Apaec and June Covington  broke free  Afterwords  Osborn surrendered himself to the police  Return of Norman Osborm In his cell alone  the Goblin persona began to harass Osborn over his failure  and how he can still make a difference  that he has followers everywhere  H A M M E R  still exists and everyone knows he s right all he needs to do is call them  Later that day Luke Cage s Avengers are told by Victoria Hand that he is being transferred  and are chosen to escort him  as expected H A M M E R  agents come to spring him during the transfer  one group fail due to Dr  Strange s illusion magic  while another group manage to get him to safety  not before he threatens Jessica Jones  baby and states  the call has been given  causing H A M M E R  Sleeper agents to come to his aid and free him before he can be apprehended  Later he is seen in a large gathering surrounded by many followers  of which include Superia  madame Hydra and Gorgon  They make a target of taking out the Avengers  specifically Luke s team  by using Ultimo  and good tactics to anticipate the moves  his main goal was to get Tony Stark s armor  but as Ultimo was destroyed he sent a machine to collect Wolverines blood  being a  genetic goldmine   and flying to a safe location  after which he initiated a self destruct on Ultimo  Norman is back Added by ADour The New Dark Avengers Osborn went about recruiting a new team  First  he traveled to the Savage Land to recruit Skaar  as his Hulk  Next  he faked the death of Barney Barton and enlisted him  Third  he went to the jungles of Brazil and met with Ai Apaec  He fed Apaec some sort of drug  transforming his usual monstrous body into that of a six armed Spider Man  He also recruited Gorgon to be his Wolverine  June Covington to be his Scarlet Witch and Superia to be his Ms  Marvel  With his new Avengers now assembled  Norman jokingly asks for a suit of armor  Helped by Victoria Hand  Osborn s Avengers made their first appearance controlling a situation at Miami  the New Avengers arrived there late by Victoria s  on purpose  fault and faced Osborn  As the Super Adaptoid Added by ADour Hail H A M M E R  At the same time  Osborn tended a trap to the main team of Avengers  who where subdued by H A M M E R  agents with super powers  such as  Spider Hulks   Giant Men and Wasps  Osborn negotiated with the President to be in charge of USA security again  seizing the Avengers Mansion and making the New Avengers fugitives  When the main Avengers team managed to get free from H A M M E R  s HQ  Osborn appeared with a defeated Vision  leading a full army of Hand ninjas  Meanwhile  Skaar betrayed his team and attacked them when they where about to attack the New Avengers  After Red Hulk touches Norman  the Avengers realizes he had Super Adaptoid s powers  The Avengers tried to take Osborn down at distance  but using Vision s phasing powers it was useless  It was when that team with the help of the New Avengers they managed to defeat Osborn  by everybody entering in contact with Norman  overpowering him  leaiving him in coma  H A M M E R  is disbanded  and Madame Hydra uses the remaining members to reinforce Hydra  Powers and AbilitiesEdit Powers Spider Man believes Norman to have retained his Goblin powers  12  Genius Intelligence  Even before consuming the Goblin Formula  Norman was extremely smart and intelligent  who was especially skilled with mathematics and science  possessing a wide spectrum knowledge of chemistry  the side effects of drugs and other doses on humans and animals  The Goblin Formula enhanced Osborn s mental capacities and creative talents  The Goblin Formula gives endows him with superhuman powers  powers way beyond that of natural limits  surpassing logic  Are thoroughly detailed down below  Superhuman Strength  Norman  after drinking the Goblin formula  become superhumanly strong hence he possessed an extreme strength capacity potential  So with that said  Norman  as the Green Goblin  can easily overpower humans by sending them flying and lifting them up with one hand or by hurling them around  and can also lift extremely heavy objects  crush and break through wood panels and templates  can bend metal  and can punch through glass without gaining injury  As shown on many occasions  Norman  as the Green Goblin  can match Spiderman  More recently his strength has increased to a degree that he was able to throw Luke Cage a considerable distance  Osborn demonstrates increased power  Added by Drakolord7 Superhuman Speed  Norman can  thanks to the Goblin formula  run and or exercise as well as operate at superhuman speeds hence his overall body equilibrium is also heightened although he isn t nearly as fast as speedsters  With his speed  he can outrun vehicles  Superhuman Stamina  Norman can  thanks to the Goblin formula  operate or maintain continuous physical motion in activities or simply in his movements for prolonged periods of time without getting tired or weary in the process  Superhuman Durability  The formula also fortified all of Osborn s bodily tissues  making them far tougher and more resistant to injury than normal humans  While Osborn can be injured by something along the lines of a knife or small conventional bullets composed of conventional material  he is very resistant to great impact forces and blunt trauma  He can withstand powerful impacts  such as falling from several stories or being repeatedly struck by a superhuman enemy  that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury to himself  Regenerative Healing Factor  If Osborn does sustain injury  his body s increased metabolism allows him to heal damaged tissue much faster and more extensively than a normal human is capable of  While not nearly as efficient as the healing powers possessed by Wolverine  he can heal from injuries that would prove lethal to an ordinary human  For example  Osborn survived being impaled by his Goblin Glider and made a full recovery with only a scar left on his chest  He also recovered from having over a dozen of his bombs explode while webbed to his chest  Superhuman Agility  The Goblin s agility  balance  and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete  Superhuman Reflexes  His reflexes are similarly enhanced and are superior to those of the finest human athlete  Mimicry  As the Super Adaptoid  Osborn can copy the powers  of any superpowered who he manages to touch  It then becomes a duplicate of that being  visually indistinguishable from it  Given the opportunity  it can copy up to eight different beings at one time  If he touches too many super humans he would overpower and stay in coma  His ability given to him via the Super Adaptoid are so powerful  he can absorb Thor s godly abilities as well as copying with many others at the same time  Power Grid  20  Intelligence 4  Strength 4  Speed  3 Durability 4  Energy Projection  3 Fighting Skills  3 Abilities Genius Level Intellect  Aside from his physical advantages  the serum also greatly enhanced Norman s already highly above average intellect  making him a true genius capable of making progress in advanced areas of genetics  robotics  engineering  and applied chemistry that most professional scientists can scarcely comprehend  Expert Marksman  As the Green Goblin  Norman uses various hand held throwing weapons such as explosives and razor projectiles which he will throw with great aim rarely ever missing his target  He is also a skilled sharpshooter with various firearms  Skilled Combatant  He is a skilled unarmed combatant that is capable of using most weapons proficiently Strength level Class 10  Norman is able to lift 10 tons under his own Goblin powers  Class 100 while in the Iron Patriot armor  Norman s strength is augmented to the point where he can lift up to 100 tons  21 Weaknesses Insanity  A downside to the increased intellect and physical capabilities afforded by the Goblin Formula is responsible for Osborn s insanity  While always mentally unstable  the formula has greatly diminished his already fragile grip on reality  His increased mental instability causes him to sometimes be extremely impulsive  not thinking before plunging into a potentially dangerous situation  making it relatively easy to lure him into a trap  Osborn also suffers from the delusion that he is invincible  claiming that  not even death could defeat him  this has caused him to fight when at a severe disadvantage  resulting in his defeat  ParaphernaliaEdit Equipment Formerly The Green Goblin s costume incorporated chain mail in the tunic  giving him further protection from high impacts  such as the punches or kicks inflicted during his battles with Spider Man  Iron Patriot Armor  Norman Osborn wears a full battle suit patterned after the heroic images of Captain America and Iron Man  The battle suit was cobbled together from StarkTech that had been confiscated from Tony Stark s armory at Avengers Tower shortly following the formation of H A M M E R   However  the armor was disabled by Tony Stark in the middle of Osborn s fight with Steve Rogers during the Siege of Asgard Transportation Formerly Flying Broomstick  The Green Goblin originally rode through the air on a one man  miniature turbo fan powered vertical thrust  flying broomstick   Goblin Glider  He soon re designed this device into an improved version that he called his  goblin glider   capable of great maneuverability and speeds of up to 90 miles per hour  It was capable of supporting about 400 lbs including Norman s weight  and far more for very brief periods of time   Top speed and a full normal load would exhaust the fuel supply in about one hour  The main microprocessor assisted manual controls were behind the head of the glider  and later modifications added voice activated radio linked controls integrated into the Green Goblin s mask  The goblin glider was steered primarily  however  by the weight and attitude of its rider  The Green Goblin s boots locked into the stirrups of the glider electromagnetically Weapons Formerly Explosives  The Green Goblin created and utilized various concussive  incendiary  and other specialized explosives in his career  most in the form of miniature jack o lanterns  The Goblin usually carried these in a shoulder bag  nicknamed his  bag of tricks   Incendiary  The incendiary grenades ignited almost soundlessly and released enough heat to melt through a three inch thick sheet of steel  Smoke Gas  He also carried a variety of smoke and gas emitting bombs  which were surrounded by a light plastic mantle that fluttered like a wraith when the bomb was thrown  Other gas bombs emitted hallucinogenic gases  and others released a specially concocted gas that could neutralize Spider Man s spider sense for a limited period of time  Flying Razor Bats  The Green Goblin sometimes threw razor sharp bat shaped projectiles which could slice into or ram and impale themselves into opponents  Electrical Discharges  The Green Goblin s gloves were interwoven with microcircuit conducting filaments capable of high frequency electrical power from rechargeable power packs in both his glove cuffs and costume tunics  They had the capacity to discharge for up to five minutes of sustained fire before depleting their power supplies  Bag Of Tricks  In addition to the common Goblin weapons  there are many others in the bag of tricks like a crescent moon boomerang  a ghost that is stronger than steel  a frog that can emit sonic blasts  and can carry many other weapons in it most of which are unrevealed  LinksEdit 567 Appearances of Norman Osborn  Earth 616  142 Images featuring Norman Osborn  Earth 616  47 Quotations by or about Norman
