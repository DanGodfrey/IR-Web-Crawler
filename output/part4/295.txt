an American cartoon series by Marvel Animation  It is based on the Marvel Super Hero Squad action figure line from Hasbro  which portray the characters of the Marvel Universe in a cartoonish super deformed style  It is also a self aware parody of the Marvel characters in that the heroes find themselves in comedic situations and have cartoonish bents to their usually serious personalities  such as The Incredible Hulk being jovial and good natured but with  major anger issues   The series  animation was produced by Film Roman and Marvel Animation  The show s first season was to debut on

power of the  Infinity Sword   He is stopped by Iron Man  but as a consequence of their battle  the sword is shattered into numerous  fractals  that rain down on Super Hero City  Doctor Doom has forged alliances with just about every supervillain forming the Lethal Legion in order to hunt down the scattered fractals  each of which possess dangerous and different powers of their own  Doom s forces  including his two primary henchmen MODOK and the Abomination  dwell in Villainville which is separated from Super Hero City by a giant wall directly seen at the start of the series premiere  Once again opposing Doom s plan is Iron Man  now leading the elite team known as the Super Hero Squad  consisting of Falcon  Hulk  Silver Surfer  Thor  and Wolverine  Marvel initially intended to put Spider Man in at least one episode of the show  but Sony Pictures Entertainment  then owners of Spider Man s television rights  possibly chose not to lend the rights  However  Spider Man appeared in Marvel Super Hero Squad s video games and other tie ins  Spider Man was later briefly mentioned in  Election of Evil  as  a guy who got incredible powers for being bitten by a radioactive bug   The Super Hero Squad are headquartered in the S H I E L D  Helicarrier  and are frequently aided in their defense of Super Hero City by their boss Captain America  S H I E L D  leader Ms  Marvel  rookie  Squaddie  and Wolverine s apprentice Reptil  and many more of their superhero friends  By the end of Season One  the Infinity Sword is reforged when Galactus arrives to devour the Earth  It is later revealed that the Infinity Sword can be wielded only by someone who wields The Infinity Gauntlet  Silver Surfer rejoins Galactus as his Herald and leaves the team with the Infinity Sword in his possession  As of the aftermath of the battle  Villainville is destroyed  and Doctor Doom and his henchmen are arrested   edit  Season 2 A second season involves having the Scarlet Witch as a replacement of the Silver Surfer and focuses on traveling to different parts of the Marvel Universe  the galaxy  different dimensions  and through time  Thanos becomes the main villain for the first half of the season  as he will seek the six Infinity Stones in order to prove his superiority to Nebula and gain supremacy over the universe  He does eventually gain all six Infinity Stones  however  the Silver Surfer  who was corrupted by the Infinity Sword  steals the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos  takes over the universe  and Silver Surfer transforms into the Dark Surfer  The Dark Surfer replaces Thanos as the main villain of the season  The squad s roster was changed in the season  due to Silver Surfer leaving the cast to once again become a herald of Galactus  Scarlet Witch 8  replaces Surfer  with original squad members Iron Man  Hulk  Falcon  Wolverine and Thor returning  To reflect the updated version of Marvel Universe Thor receives his  chain armor  as a gift from father  Odin in the episode Support your Local Sky Father  The second season premiered in the United States on October 23  2010 on Cartoon Network  9  to coincide with the release of its video game follow up Marvel Super Hero Squad  The Infinity Gauntlet   edit  Parodying of Marvel characters Comedy is the driving factor of The Super Hero Squad Show  and the members of the squad have a comedic bend that parodies their usually serious personalities and their powers  Iron Man is obsessed with high tech solutions for even the most mundane of tasks  and his newest gadgets tend to either go untested or blow up in his face  The Hulk is childlike  good natured  and even jovial  but is prone to  major anger issues  that lead to unintended mishaps  He owns a massive collection of comic books  and tends to get into juvenile arguments with The Thing from the Fantastic Four over which one of them is stronger  He also has a strong aversion to water  due to his heavy weight  which causes him to sink like a rock  Thor is overly enthusiastic about everything  and the other Squaddies sometimes cannot understand his archaic Shakespearean English  Wolverine resents being a mentor to Reptil  choosing to go it alone  yet concedes they make a great duo  He also hates being nicknamed  Wolvie   The Silver Surfer talks in a stereotypical surf culture accent and likes to engage in philosophical discussions  The Falcon is often paired with the Hulk  who calls him  Bird   and is like a big brother or mentor to him in that he either keeps the Hulk from losing his temper or frequently reminds him of the task at hand  Captain America frequently uses sayings or thinks things that imply he believes he still is in the 1940s  for instance  mentioning Franklin D  Roosevelt when referring to the President  or shocked when sees karaoke  as that was invented by the Japanese  and the other characters explain to him that they made up a while ago   This is a reference to his classic origin  getting frozen in ice during World War II  and then getting unfrozen during modern times  In addition  he has been present at various events in American history  though how he witnessed these events is unclear and not explained   and will tell the others about it in full detail unless they keep moving   edit  Episodes Main article  List of The Super Hero Squad Show episodes During the first season in the opening sequence of the show  there is a running sight gag similar to The Simpsons where the Hulk picks up an Infinity Fractal and is transformed by its power into something different every episode  such as the classic grey colored Hulk  a toddler Hulk  a disco Hulk parodying John Travolta  and a Hulk similar to Homer Simpson  This feature was removed in the second season
