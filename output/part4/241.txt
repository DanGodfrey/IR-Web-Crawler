mention on what is nowadays Romanian territory  Minimal until the 18th century  the size of the Jewish population increased after around 1850  and more especially after the establishment of Greater Romania in the aftermath of World War I  A diverse community  albeit an overwhelmingly urban one  Jews were a target of religious persecution and racism in Romanian society   from the late 19th century debate over the  Jewish Question  and the Jewish residents  right to citizenship  to the genocide carried out in the lands of Romania as part of The Holocaust  The latter  coupled with successive waves of aliyah  has accounted for a dramatic decrease in the overall size of Romania s present day Jewish community  Today only about 6000 Jews remain in Romania  primarily in urban areas

Notes 12 References 13 External links  edit  Early history Jewish communities on what would later become Romanian territory were attested as early as the 2nd century  at a time when the Roman Empire had established its rule over Dacia  Inscriptions and coins have been found in such places as Sarmizegetusa and Or ova  In the 8th century  Judaic Khazars were present as far west as Bessarabia  Three centuries later  Benjamin of Tudela attested that Jews from the Byzantine Empire were engaged in commerce with the Vlachs living south of the Danube  The existence of the Crimean Karaites  an ethnic group adherent of Karaite Judaism  and apparently of Cuman origins  suggests that there was a steady Jewish presence around the Black Sea  including in parts of today s Romania  in the trading ports from the mouths of the Danube and the Dniester  see Cumania   they may have been present in some Moldavian fairs by the 16th century or earlier  2  The earliest Jewish  most likely Sephardi  presence in what would become Moldavia was recorded in Cetatea Alb   1330   in Wallachia  they were first attested in the 1550s  living in Bucharest  3  During the second half of the 14th century  the future territory of Romania became an important place of refuge for Jews expelled from the Kingdom of Hungary and Poland by King Louis I  In Transylvania  Hungarian Jews were recorded in Saxon citadels around 1492  4  Prince Roman I  1391 1394   exempted the Jews from military service  in exchange for a tax of 3 l wenthaler per person  Also in Moldavia  Stephen the Great  1457 1504  treated Jews with consideration  Isaac ben Benjamin Shor of Ia i  Isak Bey  originally employed by Uzun Hassan  was appointed stolnic  being subsequently advanced to the rank of logof t  he continued to hold this office under Bogdan the Blind  1504 1517   the son and successor of Stephen  At this time both Danubian Principalities came under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire  and a number of Sephardim living in Istanbul migrated to Wallachia  while Jews from Poland and the Holy Roman Empire settled in Moldavia  Although they took an important part in Ottoman government and formed a large part of a community of foreign creditors and traders  2  Jews were harassed by the hospodars of the two Principalities  Moldavia s Prince  tef ni    1522  deprived the Jewish merchants of almost all the rights given to them by his two predecessors  Petru Rare  confiscated Jewish wealth in 1541  after alleging that Jews in the cattle trade had engaged in tax evasion  2 Alexandru L pu neanu  first rule  1552 61  persecuted the community alongside other social categories  until he was dethroned by Jacob Heraclides  a Greek Lutheran  who was lenient to his Jewish subjects  L pu neanu did not renew his persecutions after his return on the throne in 1564  The role of Ottoman and local Jews in financing various princes increased as Ottoman economic demands were mounting after 1550  in the 1570s  the influential Jewish Duke of the Archipelago  Joseph Nasi  backed both Heraclides and L pu neanu to the throne   several violent incidents throughout the period were instigated by princes unable to repay their debts  5  During the first short reign of Peter the Lame  1574 1579  the Jews of Moldavia  mainly traders from Poland who were competing with locals  were taxed and ultimately expelled  6  In 1582  he succeeded in regaining his rule over the country with the help of the Jewish physician Benveniste  who was a friend of the influential Solomon Ashkenazi  6  the latter then exerted his influence with the Prince in favor of his coreligionists  In Wallachia  Prince Alexandru II Mircea  1567 1577  engaged as his private secretary and counselor Isaiah ben Joseph  who used his influence on behalf of the Jews  In 1573 Isaiah was dismissed  owing to court intrigues  but he was not harmed any further  and subsequently left for Moldavia  where he entered the service of Muscovy s Grand Prince Ivan the Terrible   Through the efforts of Solomon Ashkenazi  Aron Tiranul was placed on the throne of Moldavia  nevertheless  the new ruler persecuted and executed nineteen Jewish creditors in Ia i  who were decapitated without process of law  6  At around the same time  in Wallachia  the violent repression of creditors peaked under Michael the Brave  who  after killing Turkish creditors in Bucharest  1594   probably enagaged in violence against Jews settled south of the Danube during his campaign in Rumelia  while maintaining good relations with Transylvanian Jews   7   edit  Early Modern Age In 1623  the Jews in Transylvania were awarded certain privileges by Prince Gabriel Bethlen  who aimed to attract entrepreneurs from Ottoman lands into his country  the grants were curtailed during following decades  when Jews were only allowed to settle in Gyulafeh rv r  Alba Iulia   8  Among the privileges granted was one allowing Jews to wear traditional dress  eventually  the authorities in Gyulafeh rv r decided  in 1650 and 1741   to allow Jews to wear only clothing evidencing their status and ethnicity  9  The status of Jews who had converted to Eastern Orthodoxy was established in Wallachia by Matei Basarab s Pravila de la Govora and in Moldavia by Vasile Lupu s Carte rom neasc  de  nv   tur   10  The latter ruler  1634 1653  treated the Jews with consideration until the appearance of the Cossacks  1648   who marched against the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth and who  while crossing the region  killed many Jews  the violence  led many Ashkenazi Jews from Poland took refuge in Moldavia and Wallachia  establishing small but stable communities  11  Massacres and forced conversions by the Cossacks occurred in 1652  when the latter came to Ia i on the occasion of the Vasile Lupu s daughter marriage to Timush  the son of Bohdan Khmelnytsky  and during the rule of Gheorghe  tefan  12  According to Anton Maria Del Chiaro  secretary of the Wallachian princes between 1710 1716  the Jewish population of Wallachia was required to respect a certain dresscode  Thus  they were prohibited from wearing clothes of other color than black or violet  or to wear yellow or red boots  13  Nevertheless  the Romanian scholar Andrei Oi teanu argued that such ethnic and religious social stigma was uncommon in Moldavia and Wallachia  as well as throughout the Eastern Orthodox areas of Europe  14  The first blood accusation in Moldavia  and  as such  in Romania  was made April 5  1710  when the Jews of T rgu Neam  were charged with having killed a Christian child for ritual purposes  15  The instigator was a baptized Jew who had helped to carry the body of a child  murdered by Christians  into the courtyard of the synagogue citation needed   On the next day five Jews were killed  others were maimed  and every Jewish house was pillaged  while the representatives of the community were imprisoned and tortured  Meanwhile  some influential Jews appealed to Prince Nicholas Mavrocordatos  the first Phanariote ruler  in Ia i  who ordered an investigation resulting in the freeing of those arrested  This was the first time that the Orthodox clergy participated in attacks on Jews  It was due to the clergy s instigations that in 1714 a similar charge was brought against the Jews of the city of Roman   the murder by a group of Roman Catholics of a Christian girl servant to Jewish family was immediately blamed on Jews  every Jewish house was plundered  and two prominent Jews were hanged  before the real criminals were discovered by the authorities  The Great Synagogue  Ia i   built ca  1670 Under Constantin Br ncoveanu  Wallachian Jews were recognized as a special guild in Bucharest  led by a starost  16  Jews in both Wallachia and Moldavia were subject to the Hakham Bashi in Ia i  but soon the Bucharest starost assumed several religious duties  17  Overtaxed and persecuted under  tefan Cantacuzino  1714 1716   18  Wallachian Jews obtained valuable privileges during Nicholas Mavrocordatos  rule  1716 1730  in that country  the Prince notably employed the Jewish savant Daniel de Fonseca at his court   19  Another anti Jewish riot occurred in Bucharest in the 1760s  and was encouraged by the visit of Ephram II  Patriarch of Jerusalem  20  In 1726  in the Bessarabian borough of Oni cani  four Jews were accused of having kidnapped a five year old child  of killing him on Easter and of collecting his blood in a barrel  They were tried at Ia i under the supervision of Moldavian Prince Mihai Racovi    and eventually acquitted following diplomatic protests  The event was echoed in several contemporary chronicles and documents   for example  the French ambassador to the Porte  Jean Baptiste Louis Picon  remarked that such an accusation was no longer accepted in  civilized countries   21  The most obvious effects on the condition of the Jewish inhabitants of Moldavia were witnessed during the reign of John Mavrocordatos  1744 1747   a Jewish farmer in the vicinity of Suceava reported the prince to the Porte for allegedly using his house to rape a number of kidnapped Jewish women  Mavrocordatos had his accuser hanged  This act aroused the anger of Mahmud I s kapucu in Moldavia  and the prince paid the penalty with the loss of his throne  20   edit  Russo Turkish Wars Main article  History of the Russo Turkish wars During the Russo Turkish War  1768 1774 the Jews in the Danubian Principalities had to endure great hardships  Massacres and pillages were perpetrated in almost every town and village in the country  When peace was restored  both princes  Alexander Mavrocordatos of Moldavia and Nicholas Mavrogheni of Wallachia  pledged their special protection to the Jews  whose condition remained favorable until 1787  when both Janissaries and the Imperial Russian Army engaged in pogroms  The community was also subject to persecutions by the locals  Jewish children were seized and forcibly baptized  The ritual murder accusation became widespread  one made at Gala i in 1797 led to exceptionally severe results   the Jews were attacked by a large mob  driven from their homes  robbed  waylaid on the streets  and many killed on the spot  while some were forced into the Danube and drowned  others who took refuge in the synagogue were burned to death in the building  a few escaped after being given protection and refuge by a priest  In 1803  shortly before his death  the Wallachian Metropolitan Iacob Stamati instigated attacks on the Bucharest community by publishing his  nfruntarea jidovilor   Facing the Jews    which pretended to be the confession of a former rabbi  however  Jews were offered refuge by Stamati s replacement  Veniamin Costachi  22  A seminal event occurred in 1804  when ruler Constantine Ypsilanti dismissed accusations of ritual murder as  the unfounded opinion  of  stupid people   and ordered that their condemnation be read in churches throughout Wallachia  the allegations no longer surfaced during the following period  23  During the Russo Turkish War of 1806 1812  the Russian invasion was again accompanied by massacres of the Jews  Kalmyk irregular soldiers in Ottoman service  who appeared in Bucharest at the close of the Russo Turkish War of 1806 1812  exercised terror on the city s Jewish population  At around the same time  a conflict emerged in Wallachia between Jews under foreign protection  sudi i  and local ones  hrisovoli i   after the latter tried to impose a single administration for the community  a matter which was finally settled in favor of the hrisovoli i by Prince Jean Georges Caradja  1813   17  In Habsburg ruled Transylvania  the reforms carried out by Joseph II allowed Jews to settle in towns directly subject to the Hungarian Crown  However  pressured placed on the community remained stringent for the following decades   edit  Early 19th century Lithograph of a cosmopolitan fair in Ia i  ca  1845   two Orthodox Jews are visible to the right By 1825  Jewish population in Wallachia  almost completely Sephardi  was estimated at between 5 000 and 10 000 people   of these  the larger part resided in Bucharest  probably as much as 7 000 in 1839   around the same time  Moldavia was home to about 12 000 Jews  24  In parallel  the Jewish population in Bukovina rose from 526 in 1774 to 11 600 in 1848  25  In the early 19th century  Jews who sought refuge from Osman Pazvanto lu s campaign in the Balkans established communities in Wallachian ruled Oltenia  19  In Moldavia  Scarlat Callimachi s Code  1817  allowed members of the community to purchase urban property  but prevented them from settling in the countryside  while purchasing town property became increasingly difficult due to popular prejudice   19  During the Greek War of Independence  which signalled the Wallachian uprising of 1821 and the Danubian Principalities  occupation by Filiki Eteria troops under Alexander Ypsilantis  Jews were victims of pogroms and persecutions in places such as F lticeni  Hertsa  Piatra Neam   the Secu Monastery  T rgovi te  and T rgu Frumos  Jews in Gala i managed to escape over the Prut River with assistance from Austrian diplomats  23  Weakened by the clash between Ypsilantis and Tudor Vladimirescu  the Eterists were massacred by the Ottoman intervention armies   during this episode  Jewish communities engaged in retaliations in Secu and Slatina  23  Following the 1829 Treaty of Adrianople  which allowed the two Principalities to freely engage in foreign trade   Moldavia  where commercial niches had been largely left unoccupied  became a target for migration of Ashkenazi Jews persecuted in Imperial Russia and the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria   by 1838  their number seems to have reached 80 000  26  and over 195 000  or almost 12  of the country s population  in 1859  with an additional 50 000 passing through to Wallachia between the two estimates   27  Despite initial interdictions under the Russian occupation of 1829  when it was first regulated that non Christians were not to be regarded as citizens   many of the new immigrants became leaseholders of estates and tavern keepers  serving to increase both the revenue and demands of boyars   leading in turn to an increase in economic pressures over those working the land or buying products 28   usual prejudice against Jews accused tavern keepers of encouraging alcoholism   At the same time  several Jews rose to prominence and high social status   most families involved in Moldavian banking around the 1850s were of Jewish origin  29  After 1832  following adoption of the Organic Statute  Jewish children are accepted in schools in the two Principalities only if they wore the same clothing as others  In Moldavia  authorities forced the community to abandon its traditional dress code through the 1847 decree of Prince Mihail Sturdza  30  Before the Revolutions of 1848  which found their parallel in the Wallachian revolution  many restrictive laws against the Jews had been enacted  although they had some destructive effects  they were never strictly enforced  In various ways  Jews took part in the Wallachian revolt   Constantin Daniel Rosenthal  the painter  distinguished himself in the revolutionary cause  and paid for his activity with his life  being tortured to death by Austrian authorities in Budapest   The major document to be codified by the 1848 Wallachian revolutionaries  the Islaz Proclamation  called for  the emancipation of Israelites and political rights for all compatriots of different faiths   31  After the close of the Crimean War the struggle for the union of the two principalities began  The Jews were sought after by both parties  Unionists and anti Unionists  each of which promised them full equality  and proclamations to this effect were issued  1857 1858   In 1857  the community began issuing its first magazine  Israelitul Rom n  edited by the Romanian radical Iuliu Barasch  This process of gradual integration resulted in the creation of an informal Romanian identity assumed by Jews  while conversion to Christianity  despite encouragement by the authorities  19  remained confined to exceptional cases  23   edit  Under Alexandru Ioan Cuza From the beginning of the reign of Alexandru Ioan Cuza  1859 1866   the first ruler  Domnitor  of the united principalities  the Jews became a prominent factor in the politics of the country  This period was  however  inaugurated by another riot motivated by blood libel accusations  begun during Easter 1859 in Gala i  32  Regulations on clothing were confirmed inside Moldavia by two orders of Mihail Kog lniceanu  Minister of Internal Affairs  issues in 1859 and 1860 respectively   30  Following adoption of the 1859 regulation  soldiers and civilians would walk the streets of Ia i and some other Moldavian towns  assaulting Jews  using scissors to shred their clothing  but also to cut their beards or their sidelocks  drastic measures applied by the Army Headquarters put a stop to such turmoil  30  In 1864  Prince Cuza  owing to difficulties between his government and the general assembly  dissolved the latter and decided to submit a draft of a constitution granting universal suffrage  He proposed creating two chambers  of senators and deputies respectively   to extend the franchise to all citizens  and to emancipate the peasants from forced labor  expecting to nullify the remaining influence of the landowners   no longer boyars after the land reform   In the process  Cuza also expected financial support from both the Jews and the Armenians   it appears that he kept the latter demand reduced  asking for only 40 000 Austrian guilder  the standard gold coins  about US  90 000 at the exchange rate of the time  from the two groups  The Armenians discussed the matter with the Jews  but they were not able to come to a satisfactory agreement in the matter  While Cuza was pressing in his demands  the Jewish community debated the method of assessment  The rich Jews  for unclear reasons  refused to advance the money  and the middle class argued that the sum would not lead to tangible enough results  Religious Jews insisted that such rights would only interfere with the exercise of their religion  Cuza  on being informed that the Jews hesitated to pay their share  inserted in his draft of a constitution a clause excluding from the right of suffrage all who did not profess Christianity   edit  1860s and 1870s When Charles von Hohenzollern succeeded Cuza in 1866 as Carol I of Romania  the first event that confronted him in the capital was a riot against the Jews  A draft of a constitution was then submitted by the government  Article 6 of which declared that  religion is no obstacle to citizenship   but   with regard to the Jews  a special law will have to be framed in order to regulate their admission to naturalization and also to civil rights   33  On June 30  1866  the Bucharest Synagogue was desecrated and demolished  it was rebuilt in the same year  then restored in 1932 and 1945   Many Jews were beaten  maimed  and robbed  As a result  Article 6 was withdrawn and Article 7 was added to the 1866 Constitution  it read that  only such aliens as are of the Christian faith may obtain citizenship   Nicolae Grigorescu  Jew with Goose  ca  1880    a Hasidic Jew in Romania  holding a petition addressed to the Chamber of Deputies For the following decades  the issue of Jewish rights occupied the forefront of the Regat s political scene  With few notable exceptions  including some of Junimea affiliates 34    Petre P  Carp  George Panu  and Ion Luca Caragiale   most Romanian intellectuals began professing anti Semitism  its most virulent form was the one present with advocates of Liberalism  in contradiction to their 1848 political roots   especially Moldavians  who argued that Jewish immigration had prevented the rise of an ethnic Romanian middle class  The first examples of modern prejudice were the Moldavian Frac iunea liber   i independent   later blended into the National Liberal Party  PNL  and the Bucharest group formed around Cezar Bolliac  35  Their discourse saw Jews as non assimilated and perpetually foreign   this claim was  however  challenged by some contemporary sources  36  and by the eventual acceptance of all immigrants other than Jews  Anti Semitism was carried into the PNL s mainstream  and was officially enforced under the premierships of Ion Br tianu  During his first years in office  Br tianu reinforced and applied old discrimination laws  insisting that Jews were not allowed to settle in the countryside  and relocating those that had done so   while declaring many Jewish urban inhabitants to be vagrants and expelling them from the country  According to the 1905 Jewish Encyclopedia   A number of such Jews who proved their Romanian birth were forced across the Danube  and when  the Ottoman Empire  refused to receive them  were thrown into the river and drowned  Almost every country in Europe was shocked at these barbarities  The Romanian government was warned by the powers  and Br tianu was subsequently dismissed from office   Cabinets formed by the Conservative Party  although including Junimea s leaders  did not do much to improve the Jews  condition   mainly due to PNL opposition  Nonetheless  during this same era  Romania was the cradle of Yiddish theatre  The Russian born Abraham Goldfaden started the first professional Yiddish theatre company in Ia i in 1876 and for several years  especially during the Russo Turkish War of 1877 1878 Romania was the home of Yiddish theatre  While its center of gravity would move first to Russia  then London  then New York City  both Bucharest and Ia i would continue to figure prominently in its history over the next century  37   edit  Treaty of Berlin and aftermath A Greek pie maker and his Jewish client in Bucharest  ca  1880 When Br tianu resumed leadership  Romania faced the emerging conflict in the Balkans  and saw its chance to declare independence from Ottoman suzerainty by dispatching its troops on the Russian side in the Russo Turkish War of 1877 1878  The war was concluded by the Treaty of Berlin  1878   which stipulated  Article 44  that the non Christians in Romania  including both Jews and Muslims in the newly acquired region of Northern Dobruja  should receive full citizenship  After a prolonged debate at home and diplomatic negotiations abroad  the Romanian government ultimately agreed  1879  to abrogate Article 7 of its constitution  This was  however  reformulated to make procedures very difficult   the naturalization of aliens not under foreign protection should in every individual case be decided by Parliament   the action involved  among others  a ten year term before the applicant was given an evaluation   38  The gesture was doubled by a show of compliance   883 Jews  participants in the war  were naturalized in a body by a vote of both chambers  Fifty seven persons voted upon as individuals were naturalized in 1880  6  in 1881  2  in 1882  2  in 1883  and 18  from 1886 to 1900  in all  85 Jews in twenty one years  27 of whom in the meantime died  ca  4 000 people had obtained citizenship by 1912  39  Various laws were passed until the pursuit of virtually all careers was made dependent on the possession of political rights  which only Romanians could exercise  more than 40  of Jewish working men  including manual labourers  were forced into unemployment by such legislation  Similar laws were passed in regard to Jews exercising liberal professions  40  In 1893  a piece of legislation was voted to deprive Jewish children of the right to be educated in the public schools   they were to be received only if and where children of citizens had been provided for  and their parents were required to pay preferential tuition fees  In 1898  it was passed into law that Jews were to be excluded from secondary schools and the universities  Another notable measure was the expulsion of vocal Jewish activists as  objectionable aliens   under the provisions of an 1881 law   including those of Moses Gaster and Elias Schwarzfeld  41  The courts exacted the Oath More Judaico in its most offensive form   it was only abolished in 1904  following criticism in the French press  In 1892  when the United States addressed a note to the signatory powers of the Berlin treaty on the matter  it was attacked by the Romanian press  The Lasc r Catargiu government was  however  concerned   the issue was debated among ministers  and  as a result  the Romanian government issued pamphlets in French  reiterating its accusations against the Jews and maintaining that persecutions were deserved in exchange for the community s alleged exploitation of the rural population   edit  20th century  edit  Before and after World War I The Synagogue of Bra ov  built 1901  The emigration of Romanian Jews on a larger scale commenced soon after 1878  numbers rose and fell  with a major wave of Bessarabian Jews after the Kishinev pogrom in Imperial Russia  1905   The Jewish Encyclopedia wrote in 1905  shortly before the pogrom   It is admitted that at least 70 per cent would leave the country at any time if the necessary traveling expenses were furnished   There are no official statistics of emigration  but it is safe to place the minimum number of Jewish emigrants from 1898 to 1904 at 70 000  By 1900 there were 250 000 Romanian Jews  3 3  of the population  14 6  of the city dwellers  32  of the Moldavian urban population and 42  of Ia i  42  Land issues and predominantly Jewish presence among estate leaseholders accounted for the 1907 Romanian Peasants  Revolt  partly anti Semitic in message  43  During the same period  the anti Jewish message first expanded beyond its National Liberal base  where it was soon an insignificant attitude   44  to cover the succession of more radical and Moldavian based organizations founded by A C  Cuza  his Democratic Nationalist Party  created in 1910  had the first anti Semitic program in Romanian political history   45  No longer present in the PNL s ideology by the 1920s  anti Semitism also tended to surface in on the left wing of the political spectrum  in currents originating in Poporanism   which favoured the claim that peasants were being systematically exploited by Jews  46  World War I  during which 882 Jewish soldiers died defending Romania  and 825 were decorated   brought about the creation of Greater Romania after the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and subsequent treaties  The enlarged state had an increased Jewish population  corresponding with the addition of communities in Bessarabia  Bukovina  and Transylvania  On signing the treaties  Romania agreed to change its policy towards the Jews  promising to award them both citizenship and minority rights  the effective emancipation of Jews  39  The 1923 Constitution of Romania sanctioned these requirements  meeting opposition from Cuza s National Christian Defense League and rioting by far right students in Ia i  47  the land reform carried out by the Ion I  C  Br tianu cabinet also settled problems connected with land tenancy  Political representation for the Jewish community in the inter war period was divided between the Jewish Party and the Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania 48   the latter was re established after 1989   During the same period  a division in ritual became apparent between Reform Jews in Transylvania and usually Orthodox ones in the rest of the country 49   while Bessarabia was the most open to Zionism and especially the socialist Labor Zionism   Jewish population per county in Greater Romania  according to the Wiesel Commission report  pp  81  which counted 728 115 Jews by ethnicity and 756 930 Jews by religion The popularity of anti Jewish messages was  nevertheless  on the rise  and merged itself with the appeal of fascism in the late 1920s   both contributed to the creation and success of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu s Iron Guard and the appearance of new types of anti Semitic discourses  Tr irism and G ndirism   The idea of a Jewish quota in higher education became highly popular among Romanian students and teachers  50  According to Andrei Oi teanu s analysis  a relevant number of right wing intellectuals refused to adopt overt anti Semitism  which was ill reputed through its association with A  C  Cuza s violent discourse  nevertheless  a few years later  such cautions were cast aside  and anti Semitism became displayed as  spiritual health   51  The first motion to exclude Jews from professional associations came on May 16  1937  when the Confederation of the Associations of Professional Intellectuals  Confedera ia Asocia iilor de Profesioni ti Intelectuali din Rom nia  voted to exclude all Jewish members from its affiliated bodies  calling for the state to withdraw their licenses and reassess their citizenship  52  Although illegal  the measure was popular and it was commented that  in its case  legality had been supplanted by a  heroic decision   52  According to Oi teanu  the initiative had a direct influence on anti Semitic regulations passed during the following year  52  The threat posed by the Iron Guard  the emergence of Nazi Germany as a European power  and his own fascist sympathies citation needed   made King Carol II  who was still largely identified as a philo Semite  53  adopt racial discrimination as the norm  In the recent election  over 25  of the electorate had voted for explicitly anti semitic groups  either the Goga Cuza alliance  9   or the Iron Guard s political mouthpiece  TPT 16 5     and as a result  Carol was forced to let one of the two into his cabinet  he instantly chose the Goga Cuza alliance over the rabid fascism of the Iron Guard  according to modern historian of the Balkans  Misha Glenny  he also thought that this would  take the sting out of the Guard s tail    citation needed  On January 21  1938  Carol s executive  led by Cuza and Octavian Goga  passed a law aimed at reviewing criteria for citizenship  after it cast allegations that previous cabinets had allowed Ukrainian Jews to obtain it illegally   39  and requiring all Jews who had received citizenship in 1918 1919 to reapply for it  while providing a very short term in which this could be achieved   20 days   54  However  Carol II himself was highly hostile to anti Semitism  His lover  Elena Lupescu  was Jewish  as were a number of his friends in government  and he soon reverted to his original policies  that is  fiercely opposing the anti Semites and fascists   but with a newly violent sting  On February 12  1938  he used the rising violence between political groups as context to seize absolute power  a move which was tacitly supported by the liberals who had come to view him as a lesser evil in comparison to Codreanu s fascist movement   As an authentic Romanian nationalist  albeit  one who had a view of a Westernized  forcefully industrialized Romania at the expense of the peasants whom he viewed with disdain  making him completely the antithesis of the views of Codreanu   Carol was determined that Romania should not fall into the near absolute economic and political control that many of its neighbors already had  and moved to theatrical resistance against Nazi ideology  The King then arrested the entire leadership of the Iron Guard  on the grounds that they were in the pay of the Nazis  and began using the same accusation against various political opponents  both to solidify his absolute control of the country as well as negatively stigmatize Germany  In November  the fourteen most important fascist leaders  the first of which being Codreanu  were  rinsed  in acid  55  However  Carol s policy was doomed by the reluctance of France and Britain to engage the fascist powers of Germany  Italy and Russia  or rather  Stalinist communist  in the case of the latter  in war  Russia attacked Romania and declared annexation of Bukovina and Bessarabia  which was to be renamed Moldova   and when Carol turned to the only possible hope   that is  assistance from the former  eternal foe   Nazi Germany   he was angrily rejected by Hitler personally  who did not have to try hard to remember how Carol had previously humiliated the cause of his ideology  Carol was forced to acknowledge the annexation  leading directly to his overthrow in a coup led by Ion Antonescu

Jewish if he or she had a Jewish grandparent on one side of the family   56   edit  The Holocaust  edit  The Iron Guard Victims of the Ia i pogrom Between the establishment of the National Legionary State and 1942  80 anti Jewish regulations were passed  Starting at the end of October  1940  the Iron Guard began a massive anti Semitic campaign  torturing and beating Jews and looting their shops  see Dorohoi Pogrom   culminating in the failed coup and a pogrom in Bucharest  in which 120 Jews were killed  57  Antonescu eventually stopped the violence and chaos created by the Iron Guard by brutally suppressing the rebellion  but continued the policy of oppression and massacre of Jews  and  to a lesser extent  of Roma   edit  Antonescu s regime Main article  Ion Antonescu Antonescu and the Holocaust After Romania entered the war at the start of Operation Barbarossa atrocities against the Jews became common  starting with the Ia i pogrom   on June 27  1941  Romanian dictator Ion Antonescu telephoned Col  Constantin Lupu  commander of the Ia i garrison  telling him formally to  cleanse Ia i of its Jewish population   though plans for the pogrom had been laid even earlier   13 266 Jews  according to Romanian authorities  were killed in July 1941  In July August 1941  the yellow badge was imposed by local initiatives in several cities  Ia i  Bac u  Cern u i   A similar measure imposed by the national government lasted only five days  between September 3 and September 8  1941   before being annulled on Antonescu s order  58  However  on local initiative  the badge was still worn especially in the towns of Moldavia  Bessarabia and Bukovina  Bac u  Ia i  C mpulung  Boto ani  Cern u i  etc    59  Victims of Ia i Pogrom Monument According to the Wiesel Commission report released by the Romanian government in 2004  Romania murdered in various forms  between 280 000 to 380 000 Jews in Romania and in the war zone of Bessarabia  Bukovina and Transnistria  60  61  Until 2004  when researchers made numerous documents publicly available  many in Romania denied knowledge that their country participated in the Holocaust  62  In 1941  following the advancing Romanian Army after Operation Barbarossa  and  according to Antonescu propaganda  alleged attacks by Jewish  Resistance groups of Soviet partisans   for Antonescu  all Jews were communists  see Odessa massacre   Antonescu ordered the deportation to Transnistria  of all Jews of Bessarabia and Bukovina  between 130 000 and 145 000   who were considered en masse  Communist agents  by the official propaganda   Deportation  however was a euphemism  as part of the process involved killing many Jews before deporting the rest in the  trains of death   in reality long exhausting marches on foot  to the East  Of those who escaped the initial ethnic cleansing in Bukovina and Bessarabia  only very few managed to survive  trains  and the concentration camps set up in Transnistria  Further killings perpetrated by Antonescu s death squads  documents prove his direct orders citation needed   targeted the Jewish population that the Romanian Army managed to round up when occupying Transnistria  Over one hundred thousand of these were in massacres staged in such places as Odessa  Bogdanovka  Akmecetka in 1941 and 1942  Antonescu did halt deportations despite German pressure starting with October 1942  63  as he began to seek peace with the Allies  although at the same time he levied heavy taxes and forced labor on the remaining Jewish communities  Also  sometimes with the encouragement of Antonescu s regime  thirteen boats left Romania for the British Mandate of Palestine during the war  carrying 13 000 Jews  two of these ships sunk  and the effort was discontinued after German pressure was applied   Half of the estimated 270 000 to 320 000 Jews living in Bessarabia  Bukovina  and the former Dorohoi County in Romania were murdered between June 1941 and spring of 1944  After a wave of random initial killings  Jews in Moldavia were subject to pogroms  while those in Bessarabia  Bukovina and Dorohoi were concentrated into ghettos from which they were deported to concentration camps in Transnistria  including camps built and run by Romanians  Romanian soldiers also worked with the German Einsatzkommando to massacre Jews in conquered territories east of the Romania s 1940 border  The total number of deaths is not certain  but even the lowest respectable estimates run to about 250 000 Jews  plus 25 000 deported Roma  of which half perished   At the same time  120 000 of Transylvania s 150 000 Jews died at the hands of the Fascist Hungarians later in the war  see Northern Transylvania   Also  Antonescu s government made plans for mass deportations from the Regat to Belzec  but never carried them out  Nonetheless  in stark contrast to many countries of Eastern and Central Europe  the majority of Romanian Jews  if restricted to rump Romania  outside the territories occupied in 1940 by Hungary and the Soviet Union  survived the war  although they were subject to a wide range of harsh conditions  including forced labor  financial penalties  and discriminatory laws  The number of victims  however  makes Romania count as  according to the Wiesel Commission   Of all the allies of Nazi Germany   responsible  for the deaths of more Jews than any country other than Germany itself   61   edit  Post War According to the Wiesel Commission       at least 290 000 Romanian Jews survived   Mass emigration ensued  much of it to the British Mandate of Palestine and later Israel see Bricha and Aliyah   From 1948 until 1960  most of the Jews went to Israel  reducing the Jewish population in Romania  During the period of transition towards a communist regime in Romania  following Soviet occupation  see Soviet occupation of Romania   Jewish society and culture were subject to the same increasingly tight control by the authorities  The community leader Wilhelm Filderman was arrested in 1945  and had to flee the country in 1948  64  On April 22  1946  Gheorghe Gheorghiu Dej attended a meeting of Jewish organizations and called for the creation of a new body  the Jewish Democratic Committee  which was in reality a section of the Romanian Communist Party  PCR   65  After the proclamation of the People s Republic  the government formed by the PCR outlawed all Jewish organizations at a meeting on June 10 June 11  1948  stating that  the party must take a stand on every question concerning the Jews of Romania and fight vigorously against reactionary nationalist Jewish currents  that is  Zionism    In 1952 1953  the Stalinist anti Semitic charge of  rootless cosmopolitanism  brought the purging of the party s own leadership  including Ana Pauker   66  the charge was then inflicted on the larger part of the Jewish community  beginning with a trial engineered by Iosif Chi inevschi  67  Jews who were perceived as Zionists were given harsh labour sentences in communist prisons such as Pite ti  where they were subject to torture and brainwashing experiments  several died   64  The 1952 trial of engineers made responsible for the failure of the Danube Black Sea Canal project also involved allegations of Zionism  notably aimed at Aurel Rozei Rozenberg  who was eventually executed   68  Jews in Romania  2002
