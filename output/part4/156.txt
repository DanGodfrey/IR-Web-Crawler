of  the Netherlands    The Netherlands is a geographically low lying country  with about 25  of its area and 21  of its population located below sea level  9  and 50  of its land lying less than one metre above sea level  10  This distinct feature contributes to the country s name  in Dutch  Nederland   English  and in many other European languages  e g  German  Niederlande  Croatian  Nizozemska  French  Les Pays Bas  Italian  Paesi Bassi and Spanish  Pa ses Bajos   its name literally means   The  Low Countries  or  Low Country   Significant land area has been gained through land reclamation and preserved through an elaborate system of polders and dikes  Much of the Netherlands is formed by the estuary of three important European rivers  which together with their distributaries form the Rhine Meuse Scheldt delta  Most of the country is very flat  with the exception of foothills in the far southeast and several low hill ranges in the central parts  The Netherlands was one of the first countries to have an elected parliament  Among other affiliations the country is a founding member of the EU  NATO  OECD and WTO  With Belgium and Luxembourg it forms the Benelux economic union  The country is host to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and five international courts  the Permanent Court of Arbitration  the International Court of Justice  the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia  the International Criminal Court and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon  The first four are situated in The Hague as is the EU s criminal intelligence agency Europol and judicial co operation agency Eurojust  This has led to the city being dubbed  the world s legal capital   11  The Netherlands has a capitalist market based economy  ranking 13th of 157 countries according to the Index of Economic Freedom  12  In May 2011  the Netherlands was ranked as the  happiest  country according to results published by the Organisation for Economic Co operation

territories administered by the Dutch East India Company  dark green  the Dutch West India Company  Under Charles V  Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain  the Netherlands region was part of the Seventeen Provinces  which also included most of present day Belgium  Luxembourg  and some land in France and Germany  The Eighty Years  War between the provinces and Spain began in 1568  In 1579  the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces formed the Union of Utrecht  a treaty in which they promised to support each other in their defence against the Spanish army  14  The Union of Utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern Netherlands  In 1581 the northern provinces adopted the Act of Abjuration  the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed Philip II of Spain as reigning monarch in the northern provinces  15  Queen Elizabeth I of England sympathised with the Dutch struggle against the Spanish  and in 1585 she concluded a treaty with the Dutch whereby she promised to send an English army to the Netherlands to aid the Dutch in their war with the Spanish  16  In December 1585  7 600 soldiers were sent to the Netherlands from England under the command of Robert Dudley  1st Earl of Leicester  However  the English army was of no real benefit to the Dutch rebellion  17  Although Robert Dudley returned to the Netherlands in November 1586 with another army  the army still had little effect in the rebellion  18  Philip II  the son of Charles V  was not prepared to let them go easily  and war continued until 1648  when Spain under King Philip IV finally recognised the independence of the seven northwestern provinces in the Peace of M nster  Parts of the southern provinces became de facto colonies of the new republican mercantile empire   edit  Dutch Republic 1581 1795 Main article  Dutch Republic After independence  the provinces of Holland  Zeeland  Groningen  Friesland  Utrecht  Overijssel  and Gelre formed a confederation known as the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands  All these provinces were autonomous and had their own government  the  States of the Province   The States General  the confederal government  were seated in The Hague and consisted of representatives from each of the seven provinces  The sparsely populated region of Drenthe  mainly consisting of poor peatland  was part of the republic too  although Drenthe was not considered one of the provinces  it had its own States  but the landdrost of Drenthe was appointed by the States General  Moreover  the Republic had come to occupy during the Eighty Years  War a number of so called Generality Lands  Generaliteitslanden in Dutch   These territories were governed directly by the States General  They did not have a government of their own and did not have representatives in the States General  Their population was mainly Roman Catholic  and these areas were used as a buffer zone between the Republic and the Southern Netherlands  citation needed  The Dutch Empire grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers of the 17th century  In the Dutch Golden Age   Gouden Eeuw    colonies and trading posts were established all over the world  Dutch settlement in North America began with the founding of New Amsterdam  on the southern tip of Manhattan in 1614  In South Africa  the Dutch settled the Cape Colony in 1652  By 1650  the Dutch owned 16 000 merchant ships  19  During the 17th century  the Dutch population increased from an estimated 1 5 million to almost 2 million  20  For a comprehensive list of the territories that formed the Dutch Empire  see Evolution of the Dutch Empire  Many economic historians regard the Netherlands as the first thoroughly capitalist country in the world  In early modern Europe it featured the wealthiest trading city  Amsterdam  and the first full time stock exchange  The inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the boom bust cycle  the world s first asset inflation bubble  the tulip mania of 1636 1637  and  according to Murray Sayle  the world s first bear raider  Isaac le Maire  who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount  21  The republic went into a state of general decline in the later 18th century  with economic competition from England and long standing rivalries between the two main factions in Dutch society  the Staatsgezinden  Republicans  and the Prinsgezinden  Royalists or Orangists  as main factors  citation needed  In the 17th century  plantation colonies were established by the Dutch and English along the many rivers in the fertile Guyana plains  The earliest documented colony in Guiana was along the Suriname River and called Marshall s Creek  The area was named after an Englishman  22  Disputes arose between the Dutch and the English  In 1667  the Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of Suriname conquered from the English  resulting from the Treaty of Breda  The English were left with New Amsterdam  a small trading post in North America  which is now known as New York City  citation needed   edit  French domination 1795 1814 Further information  Batavian Republic and Kingdom of Holland On 19 January 1795  one day after stadtholder William V of Orange fled to England  the Bataafse Republiek  Batavian Republic  was proclaimed  rendering the Netherlands a unitary state  From 1795 to 1806  the Batavian Republic designated the Netherlands as a republic modelled after the French Republic  From 1806 to 1810  the Koninkrijk Holland  Kingdom of Holland  was set up by Napoleon Bonaparte as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother Louis Bonaparte in order to control the Netherlands more effectively  The name of the leading province  Holland  was used for the whole country  The Kingdom of Holland covered the area of the present day Netherlands  with the exception of Limburg and parts of Zeeland  which were French territory  In 1807  Prussian East Frisia and Jever were added to the kingdom  In 1809  however  after a failed British invasion  Holland had to give over all territories south of the Rhine to France  King Louis Bonaparte did not meet Napoleon s expectations   he tried to serve Dutch interests instead of his brother s  allowed trade with the British in spite of the Continental System and even tried to learn Dutch   and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810  He was succeeded by his five year old son Napoleon Louis Bonaparte  Napoleon Louis reigned as Louis II for just ten days as Napoleon ignored his young nephew s accession to the throne  The Emperor sent in an army to invade the country and dissolved the Kingdom of Holland  The Netherlands then became part of the French Empire  The Netherlands remained part of the French Empire until the autumn of 1813  when Napoleon was defeated in the Battle of Leipzig and forced to withdraw his troops from the country   edit  Kingdom of the Netherlands 1815 1940 Main articles  United Kingdom of the Netherlands and Kingdom of the Netherlands William I of the Netherlands  son of the last stadtholder William V van Oranje  returned to the Netherlands in 1813 and became Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands  On 16 March 1815  the Sovereign Prince became King of the Netherlands  In 1815  the Congress of Vienna formed the United Kingdom of the Netherlands by expanding the Netherlands with Belgium in order to create a strong country on the northern border of France  In addition  William became hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg  The Congress of Vienna gave Luxembourg to William as personal property in exchange for his German possessions  Nassau Dillenburg  Siegen  Hadamar  and Diez  Belgium rebelled and gained independence in 1830  while the personal union between Luxembourg and the Netherlands was severed in 1890  when King William III of the Netherlands died with no surviving male heirs  Ascendancy laws prevented his daughter Queen Wilhelmina from becoming the next Grand Duchess  Therefore the throne of Luxembourg passed over from the House of Orange Nassau to the House of Nassau Weilburg  a junior branch of the House of Nassau  The largest Dutch settlement abroad was the Cape Colony  It was established by Jan van Riebeeck on behalf of the Dutch East India Company at Cape Town  Dutch  Kaapstad  in 1652  The Prince of Orange acquiesced to British occupation and control of the Cape Colony in 1788  The Netherlands also possessed several other colonies  but Dutch settlement in these lands was limited  Most notable were the vast Dutch East Indies  now Indonesia  and Dutch Guiana  now Suriname   These  colonies  were first administered by the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company  both collective private enterprises  Three centuries later these companies got into financial trouble  and the territories in which they operated were taken over by the Dutch government  in 1815 and 1791 respectively   Only then did they become official colonies  During its colonial period the Netherlands was heavily involved in the slave trade  The Dutch planters relied heavily on African slaves to cultivate the coffee  cocoa  sugar cane and cotton plantations along the rivers  Treatment of the slaves by their owners was notoriously bad  and many slaves escaped the plantations  Slavery was abolished by the Netherlands in Dutch Guiana in 1863  but the slaves were not fully released until 1873  after a mandatory 10 year transition period during which time they were required to work on the plantations for minimal pay and without state sanctioned torture  As soon as they became truly free  the slaves largely abandoned the plantations where they had suffered for several generations in favor of the city Paramaribo  Every year this is remembered during Keti Koti  1 July  Emancipation Day  end of slavery   During the 19th century  the Netherlands was slow to industrialize compared to neighbouring countries  mainly because of the great complexity involved in modernizing the infrastructure  consisting largely of waterways  and the great reliance its industry had on windpower  Although the Netherlands remained neutral during World War I  it was heavily involved in the war  23  German general Count Schlieffen  who was Chief of the Imperial German General Staff had originally planned to invade the Netherlands while advancing into France in the original Schlieffen Plan  This was changed by Schlieffen s successor Helmuth von Moltke the Younger in order to maintain Dutch neutrality  Later during the war Dutch neutrality proved essential to German survival until the blockade by Great Britain in 1916  when the import of goods through the Netherlands was no longer possible  However  the Dutch were able to continue to remain neutral during the war using their diplomacy and their ability to trade  23   edit  Second World War 1940 1945 Main article  History of the Netherlands  1939 1945  Rotterdam after German air raids in 1940  The Netherlands intended to remain neutral during the Second World War  although contingency plans involving the armies of Belgium  France and the United Kingdom were drawn up in case of German aggression  Despite this neutrality  Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 as part of their campaign against the Allied forces  French forces in the south and British ships in the west came to help but turned around quickly  evacuating many civilians and several thousand German prisoners of war from the German elite airborne divisions  The country was overrun in five days  Only after  but not because of  the bombing of Rotterdam  the main element of the Dutch army surrendered on 14 May 1940  although a Dutch and French force held the western part of Zeeland for some time after the surrender  The Kingdom as such  continued the war from the colonial empire  the government in exile resided in London  During the occupation  over 100 000 Dutch Jews 24  were rounded up to be transported to Nazi German concentration camps in Germany  German occupied Poland and German occupied Czechoslovakia  By the time these camps were liberated  only 876 Dutch Jews survived  Dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in German factories  civilians were killed in reprisal for attacks on German soldiers  and the countryside was plundered for food for German soldiers in the Netherlands and for shipment to Germany  Although there were thousands of Dutch who risked their lives by hiding Jews from the Germans  as recounted in The Hiding Place by Corrie ten Boom and The Heart Has Reasons by Mark Klempner  25  there were also Dutch who collaborated with the occupying force in hunting down hiding Jews  26  Local

September 1944  On 8 December 1941  the Netherlands declared war on Japan  28  The government in exile then lost control of its major colonial stronghold  the Netherlands East Indies  Indonesia   to Japanese forces in March 1942   American British Dutch Australian   ABDA  forces fought hard in some instances but were overwhelmed  During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia  the Japanese interned Dutch civilians and used Dutch and Indos  Eurasians of Dutch and Indonesian descent  alike as forced labour  both in the Netherlands East Indies and in neighbouring countries  29  This included forcing women to work as  comfort women   sex slaves  for Japanese personnel  Liberation of Eindhoven  September 1944  The Dutch Red Cross reported the deaths in Japanese custody of 14 800 European civilians out of 80 000 interned and 12 500 of the 34 000 POW captured  30  A later UN report stated that 4 million people died in Indonesia as a result of famine and forced labour  known as romusha  during the Japanese occupation  31  Some military personnel escaped to Australia and other Allied countries from where they carried on the fight against Japan  The Japanese furthered the cause of independence for the colony  so that after VE day many young Dutchmen found themselves fighting a colonial war against the new republic of Indonesia  Princess Juliana of the Netherlands  the only child of Queen Wilhelmina and heir to the throne  sought refuge in Ottawa  Canada  with her two daughters  Beatrix and Irene  during the war  During Princess Juliana s stay in Canada  preparations were made for the birth of her third child  To ensure the Dutch citizenship of this royal baby  the Canadian Parliament passed a special law declaring Princess Juliana s suite at the Ottawa Civic Hospital  extraterritorial   On 19 January 1943  Princess Margriet was born  The day after Princess Margriet s birth  the Dutch flag was flown on the Peace Tower  This was the only time in history a foreign flag has waved above Canada s Parliament Buildings  In 1944 45  the First Canadian Army  which included Canadian  British and Polish troops  was responsible for liberating much of the Netherlands 32  from German occupation  The joyous  Canadian summer  that ensued after the liberation  forged deep and long lasting bonds of friendship between the Netherlands and Canada 33   See Canada Netherlands relations   In 1949  Dutch troops occupied an area of 69 km2  27 sq mi  of the British zone of occupied Germany and annexed it  At that time  these areas were inhabited by almost 10

by leaving behind an era of neutrality and gaining closer ties with neighbouring states  The Netherlands was one of the founding members of the Benelux  Belgium  the Netherlands and Luxembourg  grouping  was among the twelve founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  NATO   and was among the six founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community  which would later evolve  via the EEC  Common Market   into the European Union  The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change  such as rapid ontzuiling  literally  depillarisation   a term that describes the decay of the old divisions along class and religious lines  Youths  and students in particular  rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters like women s rights  sexuality  disarmament and environmental issues  Today  the Netherlands is regarded as a liberal country  considering its drugs policy and its legalisation of euthanasia  On 1 April 2001  the Netherlands became the first nation to recognize same sex marriage  On 10 October 2010 the Netherlands Antilles a former country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean was dissolved  Referendums were held on each island of the Netherlands Antilles between June 2000 and April 2005 to determine their future status  As a result the islands of Bonaire  Sint Eustatius and Saba  the BES islands  were to obtain closer ties with the Netherlands  This led to the incorporation of these three islands into the country of the Netherlands as special municipalities upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles  The special municipalities are collectively known as the Caribbean Netherlands   edit  Geography Satellite overview of the Netherlands Main article  Geography of the Netherlands The European area of the Netherlands lies between latitudes 50  and 54  N  and longitudes 3  and 8  E  The country is divided into two main parts by three large rivers  the Rhine  Rijn  and its main distributaries  the Waal and the Meuse  Maas   These rivers functioned as a natural barrier between earlier fiefdoms and hence created traditionally a cultural divide  as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognizable north and south of these  Large Rivers   de Grote Rivieren   The southwestern part of the Netherlands is a river delta and two tributaries of the Scheldt  Westerschelde and Oosterschelde   Only one significant branch of the Rhine flows northeastward  the IJssel river  discharging into the IJsselmeer  the former Zuiderzee   southern sea    This river also forms a linguistic divide  people to the east of this river speak Dutch Low Saxon dialects  except for the province of Friesland  which has its own language   34   edit  Floods Main articles  Flood control in the Netherlands  Floods in the Netherlands  and Storm tides of the North Sea Over the centuries  the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of human intervention and natural disasters  Most notable in terms of land loss is the 1134 storm  which created the archipelago of Zeeland in the southwest  On 14 December 1287  St  Lucia s flood affected the Netherlands and Germany killing more than 50 000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history  35  The St  Elizabeth flood of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed polder  replacing it with the 72 square kilometre  28 sq mi  Biesbosch tidal floodplains in the south centre  The last major flood in the Netherlands took place in early February 1953  when a huge storm caused the collapse of several dikes in the southwest of the Netherlands  More than 1 800 people drowned in the ensuing inundations  The Dutch government subsequently decided on a large scale program of public works  the  Delta Works   to protect the country against future flooding  The project took more than thirty years to complete  The disasters were partially increased in severity through human influence  People had drained relatively high lying swampland to use it as farmland  This drainage caused the fertile peat to compress and the ground level to drop  whereby they would lower the water level to compensate for the drop in ground level  causing the underlying peat to compress even more  Due to the flooding  farming was difficult  which encouraged foreign trade  the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th 15th century  36  The flooding problem remains unsolvable to this day  Also  up until the 19th century peat was mined  dried  and used for fuel  further adding to the problem  To guard against floods  a series of defences against the water were contrived  In the first millennium AD  villages and farmhouses were built on man made hills called terps  Later  these terps were connected by dikes  In the 12th century  local government agencies called  waterschappen   English  water bodies   or  hoogheemraadschappen    high home councils   started to appear  whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods   These agencies exist to this day  performing the same function   As the ground level dropped  the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system  By the 13th century  windmills had come into use in order to pump water out of areas below sea level  The windmills were later used to drain lakes  creating the famous polders  citation needed  In 1932  the Afsluitdijk  English  Closure Dike   was completed  blocking the former Zuiderzee  Southern Sea  from the North Sea and thus creating the IJsselmeer  IJssel Lake   It became part of the larger Zuiderzee Works in which four polders totalling 2 500 square kilometres  965 sq mi  were reclaimed from the sea  37  38  Additionally  the Netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from climate change  Not only is the rising sea a problem  but also erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow  39  40  41   edit  Delta Works Main article  Delta Works The Delta Works are located in the provinces of South Holland and Zeeland  After the 1953 disaster  the Delta Works were constructed  a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast  The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the Maeslantkering  A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10 000 years  compared to1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country   This was achieved by raising 3 000 kilometers  1 864 mi  of outer sea dykes and 10 000 kilometers  6 214 mi  of inner  canal  and river dikes  and by closing off the sea estuaries of the Zeeland province  New risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional Delta project dyke reinforcements  The Delta project is one of the largest construction efforts in human history citation needed  and is considered by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world  42   edit  Climate The predominant wind direction in the Netherlands is southwest  which causes a moderate maritime climate  with cool summers and mild winters  This is especially the case with places within direct proximity of the Dutch coastline  which sometimes are over 10  C  18  F  warmer  in winter  or cooler  in summer  than places in the  south east of the country  The following tables are based on mean measurements by the KNMI weather station in De Bilt between 1981 and 2010  Climate data for De Bilt  1981 2010 averages

C  occur much more often  usually ranging from mid November to late March  but not rarely measured as early as mid October and as late as mid May  If one chooses the height of measurement to be 10 cm  above ground instead of 150 cm   one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer  Warm days  maximum temperature above 20  C  in De Bilt are usually measured in the time span of April until September  but in some parts of the country such temperatures can also occur in March and October  this is usually not in De Bilt  however   Summer days  maximum temperature above 25  C  are usually measured in De Bilt from May until August  tropical days  maximum temperature above 30  C  are rare and usually occur only from June until August  Precipitation throughout the year is relatively equally shared by each month  Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little bit more precipitation than other months  mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days  this is especially the case in summer  when lightning too is much more frequent than otherwise   The number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that due to the geographical latitude the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June   edit  Environment Further information  List of national parks of the

of the States General meet  Mark Rutte of the VVD has been the Prime Minister of the Netherlands since October 2010  The Netherlands has been a constitutional monarchy since 1815 and a parliamentary democracy since 1848  The Netherlands is described as a consociational state  Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues  within both the political community and society as a whole  In 2010  The Economist ranked the Netherlands as the 10th most democratic country in the world  The monarch is the head of state  at present Queen Beatrix  Constitutionally  the position is equipped with limited powers  The monarch can exert some influence during the formation of a new cabinet  where they serve as neutral arbiter between the political parties  Additionally  the king  the title queen has no constitutional significance  has the right to be informed and consulted  Depending on the personality and qualities of the king and the ministers  the king might have influence beyond the power granted by the constitution  In practice  the executive power is formed by the ministerraad  the deliberative council of the Dutch cabinet  The cabinet consists usually of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of state secretaries  One to three ministers are ministers without portfolio  The head of government is the Prime Minister of the Netherlands  who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition  In fact  this has been continuously the case since 1973  The Prime Minister is a primus inter pares  meaning he has no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers  Currently  the Prime Minister is Mark Rutte  The cabinet is responsible to the bicameral parliament  the States General  which also has legislative powers  The 150 members of the House of Representatives  the Lower House  are elected in direct elections  which are held every four years or after the fall of the cabinet  by example  when one of the chambers carries a motion of no confidence  the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch   The States Provincial are directly elected every four years as well  The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the Senate  the upper house  which has less legislative powers  as it can merely reject laws  not propose or amend them  Both trade unions and employers organisations are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial  economic and social areas  They meet regularly with government in the Social Economic Council  This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily  The Netherlands has a long tradition of social tolerance  In the 18th century  while the Dutch Reformed Church was the state religion  Catholicism  other forms of Protestantism  such as Baptists and Lutherans  and Judaism were tolerated  In the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of pillarisation  in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government  This tradition of tolerance is linked to Dutch criminal justice policies on recreational drugs  prostitution  LGBT rights  euthanasia  and abortion  which are among the most liberal in the world   edit  Political parties Main article  Political parties of the Netherlands Due to the multi party system  no single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century  and coalition cabinets had to be formed  Since suffrage became universal in 1919  the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties  the strongest family were the Christian democrats  currently represented by the Christian Democratic Appeal  CDA   second were the social democrats  of which the Labour Party  PvdA   and third were the liberals  of which the People s Party for Freedom and Democracy  VVD  is the main representative  These parties cooperated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian democrats had always been a partner  so either a centre left coalition of the Christian democrats and social democrats was ruling or a centre right coalition of Christian democrats and liberals  In the 1970s  the party system became more volatile  the Christian democratic parties lost seats  while new parties became successful  such as the radical democrat and progressive liberal D66  In the 1994 election  the CDA lost its dominant position  A  purple  cabinet was formed by VVD  D66  and PvdA  In the 2002 elections  this cabinet lost its majority  due to an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the LPF  a new political party around Pim Fortuyn  who was assassinated a week before the elections  A short lived cabinet was formed by CDA  VVD  and LPF  which was led by CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende  After the 2003 elections in which the LPF lost most of its seats  a cabinet was formed by CDA  VVD  and D66  The cabinet initiated an ambitious program of reforming the welfare state  the health care system  and the immigration policies  In June 2006  the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against minister of immigration and integration Rita Verdonk  who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of VVD MP Ayaan Hirsi Ali  A caretaker cabinet was formed by CDA and VVD  and general elections were held on 22 November 2006  In these elections  the CDA remained the largest party and the SP made the largest gains  The formation of a new cabinet took three months  resulting in a coalition of CDA  PvdA  and ChristianUnion  On 20 February 2010  the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in Uruzgan  Afghanistan  44 Snap elections were held on 9 June 2010  with devastating results for the previously largest party  the CDA  which lost about half of its seats  resulting in 21 seats  The VVD became the largest party with 31 seats  closely followed by the PvdA with 30 seats  The big winner of the 2010 elections was Geert Wilders whose PVV more than doubled in number of seats  45 Negotiation talks for a new government have resulted in a VVD led minority government in coalition with CDA as of 14 October 2010  This minority government is supported by PVV  46   edit  Administrative divisions Main articles  Provinces of the Netherlands  Municipalities of the Netherlands  Water

early 20th century  The Dutch East Indies  which later formed modern day Indonesia  was one of the most valuable European colonies in the world and the most important one for the Netherlands  91  Over 350 years of mutual heritage has left a significant cultural mark on the Netherlands  In The Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century  the Netherlands urbanised considerably  mostly financed by corporate revenue from the Asian trade monopolies  Social status was based on merchants  income  which reduced feudalism and considerably changed the dynamics of Dutch society  When the Dutch Royal Family was established in 1815  much of its wealth came from Colonial trade  92  Universities such as the Royal Leiden University founded in the 16th century have developed into leading knowledge centres about
