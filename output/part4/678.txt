known as the Ellice Islands  2  is a Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean  midway between Hawaii and Australia  It comprises four reef islands and five true atolls spread out from 6  to 10  south  3  Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati  Nauru  Samoa and Fiji  Its population of 10 544 makes it the third least populous sovereign state in the world  with only Vatican City and Nauru having fewer inhabitants  In terms of physical land size  at just 26 square kilometres  10 sq mi  Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world  larger only than the Vatican City at 0 44 km2  0 17 sq mi   Monaco at 1 98 km2  0 76 sq mi  and Nauru at 21 km2  8 1 sq mi   The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesian people  In 1568 Spanish navigator  lvaro de Menda a sailed through the islands and is understood to have sighted Nui during his expedition in search of Terra Australis  In 1819 the island of Funafuti was named Ellice s Island  the name Ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay  1812 1876   4  The islands came under Britain s sphere of influence in the late 19th century  when the Ellice Islands were declared a British protectorate by Captain Gibson  R  N  of HMS Cura ao between 9th and 16 October 1892  The Ellice Islands were administered as British protectorate by a Resident Commissioner from 1892 to 1916 as part of the British Western Pacific Territories  BWPT   and later as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony from 1916 to 1974  In 1974  the Ellice Islanders voted for separate British dependency status  As a consequence Tuvalu separated from the Gilbert Islands which became Kiribati  Tuvalu became fully independent within the Commonwealth on October 1  1978  On September 5  2000  Tuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations  Contents 1 History 1 1 Trading firms and traders 1 2 Scientific expeditions and travellers 2 Politics 3 Defence and law enforcement 4

Tuvaluan man in traditional costume drawn by Alfred Agate in 1841 during the United States Exploring Expedition  The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians so that the origins of the people of Tuvalu is addressed in the theories regarding the spread of humans out of Southeast Asia  from Taiwan  via Melanesia and across the Pacific islands to create Polynesia  During pre European contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the nearer islands including Tonga and Samoa  5  Eight of the nine islands of Tuvalu were inhabited  thus the name  Tuvalu  means  eight standing together  in Tuvaluan  Possible evidence of fire in the Caves of Nanumanga may indicate human occupation for thousands of years  The stories as to the ancestors of the Tuvaluans vary from island to island  On Funafuti and Vaitupu the founding ancestor is described as being from Samoa  6  7  whereas on Nanumea the founding ancestor is described as being from Tonga  6  Tuvalu was first sighted by Europeans in 1568 with the voyage of  lvaro de Menda a de Neira from Spain who is understood to have sighted the island of Nui  which he named Isla de Jesus  Island of Jesus  but was unable to land  Keith S  Chambers and Doug Munro  1980  identify Niutao as the island that Francisco Antonio Mourelle named on May 5  1781 thus solving what Europeans had called The Mystery of Gran Cocal  8  9  Mourelle s map and journal named the island El Gran Cocal   The Great Coconut Plantation    however  the latitude and longitude was uncertain  9  The next European to visit was Arent Schuyler de Peyster  of York  captain of the armed brigantine or privateer Rebecca  sailing under British colours  10  which passed through the southern Tuvalu waters in May 1819  de Peyster sighted Nukufetau and Funafuti  which he named Ellice s Island after an English Politician  Edward Ellice  the Member of Parliament for Coventry and the owner of the Rebecca s cargo  9  In 1820 the Russian explorer Mikhail Lazarev visited Nukufetau as commander of the Mirny  9  Following 1819 whalers were roving the Pacific though visiting Tuvalu only infrequently because of the difficulties of landing ships on the atolls  No settlements were established by the whalers  9  Peruvian slave raiders   blackbirders   seeking workers to mine the guano deposits on the Chincha Islands in Peru  combed the Pacific between 1862 and 1865  including the southern islands of Tuvalu  11  The Rev  A  W  Murray  12  the earliest European missionary in Tuvalu  reported that in 1863 about 180 people 13  were taken from Funafuti and about 200 were taken from Nukulaelae 14  as there were fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae  15  16  Christianity first came to Tuvalu in 1861 when Elekana  a deacon of a Congregational church in Manihiki  Cook Islands became caught in a storm and drifted for 8 weeks before landing at Nukulaelae  9  Elekana began proselytizing Christianity  He was trained in a London Missionary Society school in Samoa before beginning his work in establishing the Church of Tuvalu  9  In 1865 the Rev  A  W  Murray of the London Missionary Society   a Protestant congregationalist missionary society   arrived as the first European missionary where he too proselytized among the inhabitants of Tuvalu  By 1878 the Church of Tuvalu was well established with preachers on each island  9  A man from the Nukufetau atoll  drawn by Alfred Agate 1841   edit  Trading firms and traders Trading companies became active in Tuvalu in the mid nineteenth century  the trading companies engaged palagi traders who lived on the islands  Some islands would have competing traders while dryer islands might only have a single trader  17  In 1892  Captain Davis of the HMS Royalist  reported on trading activities and traders on each of the islands visited  18  Captain Davis identified the following traders in the Ellice Group  Edmund Duffy  Nanumea   Jack Buckland  Niutao   Harry Nitz  Vaitupu   John  also known as Jack  O Brien  Funafuti   Alfred Restieaux and Fenisot  Nukufetau   and Martin Kleis  Nui   19  During this time  the greatest number of palagi traders lived on the atolls  acting as agents for the trading companies  17  In the later 1890s and into first decade of the 20th century  structural changes occurred in the operation of the Pacific trading companies  trading companies moved from a practice of having traders resident on each island to instead becoming a business operation where the supercargo  the cargo manager of a trading ship  would deal directly with the islanders when a ship visited an island  From 1900  the numbers of palagi traders in Tuvalu declined with the last of the palagi traders being Fred Whibley on Niutao and Alfred Restieaux on Nukufetau  By 1909 there were no more resident palagi traders representing the trading companies  20  although both Fred Whibley and Alfred Restieaux 21  remained in the islands until their deaths   edit  Scientific expeditions and travellers Woman on Funafuti  Harry Clifford Fassett  1900  The United States Exploring Expedition under Charles Wilkes visited Funafuti  Nukufetau and Vaitupu in 1841  22  During this expedition  on Tuvalu  Alfred Thomas Agate  engraver and illustrator  recorded the dress and tattoo patterns of the men of Nukufetau  23  In 1890  Robert Louis Stevenson  his wife Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson and her son Lloyd Osbourne sailed on the Janet Nicoll  a trading steamer owned by Henderson and Macfarlane of Auckland  New Zealand  which operated between Sydney  Auckland and into the central Pacific  24  The Janet Nicoll visited Tuvalu  25  while Fanny records that they made landfall at Funafuti and Niutao  Jane Resture suggests that it was more likely Nukufetau  26  An account of this voyage was written by Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson and published under the title The Cruise of the Janet Nichol  27  together with photographs taken by Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne  In 1894  Count Rudolph Festetics de Tolna  his wife Eila  n e Haggin  28  and her daughter Blanche Haggin visited Funafuti aboard the yacht Le Tolna  29 Le Tolna spent several days at Funafuti with the Count photographing men and woman on Funafuti  30  The boreholes on Funafuti  at the site now called David s Drill  are the result of drilling conducted by the Royal Society of London for the purpose of investigating the formation of coral reefs to determine whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral of Pacific atolls  This investigation followed the work on the structure and distribution of coral reefs conducted by Charles Darwin in the Pacific  Drilling occurred in 1896  1897 and 1911  Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney lead the expeditions in 1896  amp  1897  31  Photographers on these trips recorded people  communities and scenes at Funafuti  32  Harry Clifford Fassett  captain s clerk and photographer  recorded people  communities and scenes at Funafuti during a visit of USFC Albatross when the U S  Fish Commission was investigating the formation of coral reefs on Pacific atolls in 1900  33   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Tuvalu Tuvalu is a Parliamentary Democracy and Commonwealth realm with Queen Elizabeth II serving as the country s head of state and bearing the title Queen of Tuvalu  Since the Queen does not reside in the islands  she is represented in Tuvalu by a Governor General appointed by the Queen upon the advice of the country s elected Prime Minister  The local unicameral Parliament  or Fale I Fono  has 15 members and is elected every four years  Its members select a Prime Minister who is the head of government  The Cabinet is appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister  In addition  each island has its own high chief  or ulu aliki  and several sub chiefs  alikis  and elders  The elders form together an island council of elders or te sina o fenua  literally  grey hairs of the land    In the past  another caste  one of the priests  tofuga   was also amongst the decision makers  The sina o fenua  aliki and ulu aliki exercise informal authority at the local level  Ulu aliki are always chosen based on ancestry  Their powers are now shared with the pule o kaupule  elected village presidents  one on each atoll   34  There are no formal political parties and election campaigns are largely based on personal family ties and reputations  The highest court in Tuvalu is the High

in Johannesburg  South Africa and in other international fora  is promoting concern about global warming and the possible sea level rising  Tuvalu advocates ratification and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol  In December 2009 the islands stalled talks on climate change at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen  fearing some other developing countries were not committing fully to binding deals on a reduction in carbon emissions  Their chief negotiator stated   Tuvalu is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change and our future rests on the outcome of this meeting   37  Tuvalu participates in the operations of the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission  SOPAC  and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Program  SPREC   38  Tuvalu is party to a treaty of friendship with the United States  signed soon after independence and ratified by the U S  Senate in 1983  under which the United States renounced prior territorial

agreement expires on June 14  2013  41  Tuvalu is also a member of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement which addresses the management of tuna purse seine fishing in the tropical western Pacific  42   edit  Geography and environment A beach at Funafuti atoll  Main article  Geography of Tuvalu Tuvalu consists of three reef islands and six true atolls  Its small  scattered group of atolls have poor soil and a total land area of only about 26 square kilometres  less than 10 sq  mi  making it the fourth smallest country in the world  The islets that form the atolls are very low lying  Nanumanga  Niutao  Niulakita are reef islands and the six true atolls are Funafuti  Nanumea  Nui  Nukufetau  Nukulaelae and Vaitupu  Funafuti is the largest atoll of the nine low reef islands and atolls that form the Tuvalu volcanic island chain  It comprises numerous islets around a central lagoon that is approximately 25 1 kilometres  15 6 miles   N S  by 18 4 kilometres  11 4 miles   W E   centred on 179 7 E and 8 30 S  On the atolls  an annular reef rim surrounds the lagoon with several natural reef channels  43  The eastern shoreline of Funafuti Lagoon was modified during World War II when the airfield  what is now Funafuti International Airport  was constructed  Several piers were also constructed  beach areas were filled and deep water access channels were excavated  These alterations to the reef and shoreline resulted in changes to wave patterns with less sand accumulating to form the beaches as compared to former times and the shoreline now exposed to wave action  Several attempts to stabilize the shoreline have not achieved the desired effect  44  The reefs at Funafuti have suffered damage  with 80 per cent of the coral becoming bleached as a consequence of the increase in ocean temperatures and acidification from increased levels of carbon dioxide  45  A reef restoration project has investigated reef restoration techniques  46  and researchers from Japan have investigated rebuilding the coral reefs through the introduction of foraminifer  47  The highest elevation is 4 6 metres  15 ft  above sea level on Niulakita  48  which gives Tuvalu the second lowest maximum elevation of any country  after the Maldives   However  the highest elevations are typically in narrow storm dunes on the ocean side of the islands which are prone to over topping in tropical cyclones  as occurred with Tropical Cyclone Bebe  49  50  Because of the low elevation  the islands that make up this nation are threatened by current and future sea level rise  51  Additionally  Tuvalu is annually affected by king tide events which peak towards the end of the austral summer  and raise the sea level higher than a normal high tide  52  As a result of historical sea level rise  the king tide events lead to flooding of low lying areas  which is compounded when sea levels are further raised by La Ni a effects or local storms and waves  In the future  sea level rise may threaten to submerge the nation entirely as it is estimated that a sea level rise of 20 40 centimetres  8 16 inches  in the next 100 years could make Tuvalu uninhabitable  53  54  A wharf and beach at Funafuti atoll Tuvalu experiences westerly gales and heavy rain from October to March   the period that is known as Tau o lalo  with tropical temperatures moderated by easterly winds from April to November  Drinking water is mainly obtained from rainwater collected on roofs and stored in tanks  These systems are often poorly maintained  resulting in a lack of water  55  Aid programmes of Australia and the European Union have been directed to improving the storage capacity on Funafuti and in the outer islands  56  The rising population has resulted in an increased demand on fish stocks  which are under stress  45  although the creation of the Funafuti Conservation Area has provided a fishing exclusion area to help sustain the fish population across the Funafuti lagoon  Population pressure on the resources of Funafuti and inadequate sanitation systems have resulted in pollution  51  57  The Waste Operations and Services Act of 2009 provides the legal framework for waste management and pollution control projects funded by the European Union directed at organic waste composting in eco sanitation systems  58  Plastic waste is also a problem as much imported food and other commodities are supplied in plastic containers or packaging  When the World War II airfield at Funafuti was constructed  the coral base of the atoll was used as fill to create the runway  The resulting borrow pits impacted the water aquifer  At these pits  the sea water can be seen bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools with each high tide  59  60  61   edit  Tourism See also  Funafuti Conservation Area and Public holidays in Tuvalu The main island of Funafuti is the focus of travelers since the only airport in Tuvalu is the Funafuti International Airport and the island has hotel facilities  62 Ecotourism is a motivation of travelers to Tuvalu  The Funafuti Conservation Area consists of 33 square kilometers of ocean  reef  lagoon  channel and six uninhabited islets  63  The outer atolls can be visited on the two passenger cargo ships  Nivaga II and Manu Folau  which provide round trip visits to the outer islands every three or four weeks  64  There are no tourist accommodations on the outer atolls   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Tuvalu From 1996 to 2002  Tuvalu was one of the best performing Pacific Island economies and achieved an average real gross domestic product  GDP  growth rate of 5 6 per cent per annum  Since 2002 economic growth has slowed with GDP of 1 5  in 2008  Tuvalu was exposed to rapid rises in world prices of fuel and food in 2008 with the level of inflation peaking at 13 4   65  The International Monetary Fund 2010 Report on Tuvalu estimates that Tuvalu experienced zero growth in its 2010 GDP  after the economy contracted by about 2  in 2009  66  Public sector workers make up about two thirds of those formaly employed  Approximately 15  of adult males work as seamen on foreign flagged merchant ships  Tuvaluans are otherwise involved in traditional subsistence agriculture and fishing  Tuvalu generates income from the Tuvalu Trust Fund  the commercialisation of the   tv  top layer domain  fishing licences  the sale of stamps and coins  remittances from Tuvaluans living in Australia and New Zealand  and remittances from Tuvaluan sailors employed on overseas ships  67  68  In 1998  Tuvalu began deriving revenue from the use of its area code for  900  lines and from the commercialisation of its   tv  Internet domain name  which is now managed by Verisign  69  The Tuvalu Trust Fund was established in 1987 by the United Kingdom  Australia and New Zealand  67  The value of the Tuvalu Trust Fund is approximately  100 million  65  66  70  Australia and New Zealand continue to contribute capital to the Tuvalu Trust Fund and provide other forms of development assistance  67  68  The US government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu  with 1999 payments from the South Pacific Tuna Treaty  SPTT  at about  9 million  which is expected to rise annually  The SPTT entered into force in 1988 with the current SPTT agreement which expires June 14  2013  41  Financial support to Tuvalu is also provided by Japan  South Korea and the European Union  71  The United Nations designates Tuvalu as a  Least Developed Country  because of its limited potential for economic development  absence of exploitable resources and its small size and vulnerability to external economic and environmental shocks  72  Due to the country s remoteness  tourism does not provide much income  a thousand tourists are estimated to visit Tuvalu annually  73   edit  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Tuvalu The country s population has more than doubled since 1980 with a growth rate of 0

concerned about the effects of rising sea levels for some years  91  92  Whether there are measurable changes in the sea level relative to the islands of Tuvalu is a contentious issue  93  There were problems associated with the pre 1993 sea level records from Funafuti which resulted in improvements in the recording technology to provide more reliable data for analysis  94  The degree of uncertainty as to estimates of sea level change relative to the islands of Tuvalu is reflected in the conclusions made in 2002 from the available data  94  The 2011 report of the Pacific Climate Change Science Program published by the Australian Government  95  concludes   The sea level rise near Tuvalu measured by satellite altimeters since 1993 is about 5 mm per year   96  Observable transformations over the last ten to fifteen years show Tuvaluans that there have been changes to the sea levels  These include sea water bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools at high tide and the flooding of low lying areas including the airport during spring tides and king tides  60  61  97  As low lying islands lacking a surrounding shallow shelf  the communities of Tuvalu are especially susceptible to changes in sea levela and undissipated storms  98  It is estimated that a sea level rise of 20 40 centimetres  8 16 inches  in the next 100 years could make Tuvalu uninhabitable  53  54  The 2011 report of Pacific Climate Change Science Program of Australia concludes  in relation to Tuvalu  that over the course of the 21st century    Surface air temperatures and sea surface temperatures are projected to continually increase  very high confidence   96    Annual and seasonal mean rainfalls are projected to increase  high confidence   96    The intensity and frequency of extreme heat days are projected to increase  very high confidence   96    The intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall days are projected to increase  high confidence   96    The incidence of drought is projected to decrease  moderate confidence   96    Tropical cyclone numbers are projected to decline in the south east Pacific Ocean basin  0 40 S  170 E 130 W   moderate confidence   96    Ocean acidification is projected to continue  very high confidence   96    Mean sea level rise is projected to continue  very high confidence   96  Ocean side of Funafuti atoll showing the storm dunes  the highest point on the atoll  The South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission  SOPAC  suggests that  while Tuvalu is vulnerable to climate change  environmental problems such as population growth and poor coastal management also affect sustainable development  SOPAC ranks the country as extremely vulnerable using the Environmental Vulnerability Index  99  While some commentators have called for the relocation of Tuvalu s population to Australia  New Zealand or Kioa in Fiji  the former Prime Minister Maatia Toafa said his government did not regard rising sea levels as such a threat that the entire population would need to be evacuated  100  101  In spite of persistent Internet rumours that New Zealand has agreed to accept an annual quota of 75 evacuees  the annual quota of 75 Tuvaluans granted work permits under the Pacific Access Category  announced in 2001  is not related to environmental concerns  75  Employment opportunities and family reunification has been the primary motivation of Tuvaluans who obtain New Zealand work permits under the Pacific Access Category  92  Tuvalu experiences the effects of El Ni o and La Ni a caused by changes in ocean temperatures in the equatorial and central Pacific  El Ni o effects increase the chances of tropical storms and cyclones  while those of La Ni a increase the chances of drought  102  Typically the islands of Tuvalu receive between 200mm to 400mm of rainfall per month  However  in 2011 a weak La Ni a effect caused a drought by cooling the surface of the sea around Tuvalu  A state of emergency was declared on September 28  2011  103  with rationing of fresh water on the islands of Funafuti and Nukulaelae  104  105  106  Households on Funafuti and Nukulaelae are restricted to two buckets of fresh water per day  40 litres   107  108  The governments of Australia and New Zealand have responded to the fresh water crisis by supplying temporary desalination plants  109  110  111  and assisting in the repair of the existing desalination unit that was donated by Japan in 2006  112  In response to the 2011 drought  Japan has funded the purchase of a 100 m  d desalination plant and two portable 10 m  d plants as part of its Pacific Environment Community  PEC  program  113  114  Aid programs from the European Union 56  58  and Australia also provide water tanks as part of the longer term solution for the storage of available fresh water  115  See also  2011 Tuvalu drought and Renewable energy in Tuvalu  edit  See also Geography portal Oceania portal Commonwealth
