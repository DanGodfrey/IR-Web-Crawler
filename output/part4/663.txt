Main article  History of the Americas Settlement For more details on theories of Paleo Indian migration  see Models of migration to the New World  The specifics of Paleo Indian migration to and throughout the Americas  including the exact dates and routes traveled  are subject to ongoing research and discussion  6  The traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the Beringia land bridge between eastern Siberia and present day Alaska around 40 000 17 000 years ago  7  when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the Quaternary glaciation  6  8  These people are believed to have followed herds of now extinct pleistocene megafauna along ice free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets  9  Another route proposed is that  either on foot or using primitive boats  they migrated down the Pacific Northwest coast to South America  10  Evidence of the latter would since have been covered by a sea level rise of hundreds of meters following the last ice age  11  Archaeologists contend that Paleo Indians migration out of Beringia  eastern Alaska   ranges somewhere between 40 000 and 16 500 years ago  12  13  14  The few agreements achieved to date are the origin from Central Asia  with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the last glacial period  or more specifically what is known as the late glacial maximum  around 16 000 13 000 years before present  14  15  The Inuit migrated into the Arctic section of North America in another wave of migration  arriving around 1000 CE  16  Around the same time as the Inuit migrated into North America  Viking settlers began arriving in Greenland in 982 and Vinland shortly thereafter  establishing a settlement at L Anse aux Meadows  near the northernmost tip of Newfoundland  17  The Viking settlers quickly abandoned Vinland  and disappeared from Greenland by 1500  18  Pre Columbian era Main article  Pre Columbian era Mississippian site in Arkansas  Parkin Site  circa 1539  Illustration by Herb Roe  The pre Columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history and prehistory of the Americas before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continents  spanning the time of the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic to European colonization during the Early Modern period   Pre Columbian  is used especially often in the context of the great indigenous civilizations of the Americas  such as those of Mesoamerica  the Olmec  the Toltec  the Teotihuacano  the Zapotec  the Mixtec  the Aztec  and the Maya  and the Andes  Inca  Moche  Muisca  Ca aris   Many pre Columbian civilizations established characteristics and hallmarks which included permanent or urban settlements  agriculture  civic and monumental architecture  and complex societal hierarchies  Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European arrivals  c  late 15th early 16th centuries   and are known only through archaeological investigations  Others were contemporary with this period  and are also known from historical accounts of the time  A few  such as the Maya  had their own written records  However  most Europeans of the time viewed such texts as pagan  and much was destroyed in Christian pyres  Only a few hidden documents remain today  leaving modern historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge  19  According to both indigenous American and European accounts and documents  American civilizations at the time of European encounter possessed many impressive accomplishments  For instance  the Aztecs built one of the most impressive cities in the world  Tenochtitlan  the ancient site of Mexico City  with an estimated population of 200 000  American civilizations also displayed impressive accomplishments in astronomy and mathematics  20  European colonization Main article  European colonization of the Americas Large scale European colonization of the Americas began shortly after the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492  The first Spanish settlement in the Americas was La Isabela in northern Hispaniola  This town was abandoned shortly after in favor of Santo Domingo de Guzm n  founded in 1496  the oldest American city of European foundation  This was the base from which the Spanish monarchy administered its new colonies and their expansion  On the continent  Panama City on the Pacific coast of Central America  founded on 5 August 1519  played an important role  being the base for the Spanish conquest of South America  According to the anthropologist R  Thornton  the spread of new diseases brought by Europeans and Africans killed many of the inhabitants of North America and South America  21  22  with a general population crash of Native Americans occurring in the mid 16th century  often well ahead of European contact  23  Native peoples and European colonizers came into widespread conflict  resulting in what David Stannard has called a genocide of the indigenous populations  24  Early European immigrants were often part of state sponsored attempts to found colonies in the Americas  Migration continued as people moved to the Americas fleeing religious persecution or seeking economic opportunities  Millions of individuals were forcibly transported to the Americas as slaves  prisoners or indentured servants  Etymology and naming World map of Waldseem ller  which first named America  in the map over Paraguay   Germany  1507 The earliest known use of the name America for this landmass dates from April 25  1507  where it was used for what is now known as South America  It first appears on a small globe map with twelve time zones  together with the largest wall map made to date  both created by the German cartographer Martin Waldseem ller in Saint Di  des Vosges in France  These were the first maps to show the Americas as a land mass separate from Asia  An accompanying book  Cosmographiae Introductio  anonymous but apparently written by Waldseem ller s collaborator Matthias Ringmann  25  states   I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part  that is  the South American mainland   after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence  Amerigen  that is  the Land of Americus  or America  since both Europa and Asia got their names from women   Americus Vespucius is the Latinized version of the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci s name  and America is the feminine form of Americus  Amerigen is explained as Amerigo plus gen  the accusative case of the Greek word for  earth   and meaning  land of Amerigo   25   See etymology   Amerigo itself is an Italian form of the medieval Latin Emericus  see also Saint Emeric of Hungary   which through the German form Heinrich  in English  Henry  derived from the Germanic name Haimirich  26  Vespucci was apparently unaware of the use of his name to refer to the new landmass  as Waldseem ller s maps did not reach Spain until a few years after his death  25  Ringmann may have been misled into crediting Vespucci by the widely published Soderini Letter  a sensationalized version of one of Vespucci s actual letters reporting on the mapping of the South American coast  which glamorized his discoveries and implied that he had recognized that South America was a continent separate from Asia  in fact  it is not known what Vespucci believed on this count  and he may have died believing what Columbus had  that they had reached the East Indies in Asia rather than a new continent  27  Spain officially refused to accept the name America for two centuries  saying that Columbus should get credit  and Waldseem ller s later maps  after he had ceased collaboration with Ringmann  did not include it  however  usage was established when Gerardus Mercator applied the name to the entire New World in his 1538 world map  Acceptance may have been aided by the  natural poetic counterpart  that the name America made with Asia  Africa  and Europa  25  Map of America by Jonghe  c  1770 Geology South America broke off from the west of the supercontinent Gondwanaland around 135 million years ago  forming its own continent  28  Around 15 million years ago  the collision of the Caribbean Plate and the Pacific Plate resulted in the emergence of a series of volcanoes along the border that created a number of islands  The gaps in the archipelago of Central America filled in with material eroded off North America and South America  plus new land created by continued volcanism  By 3 million years ago  the continents of North America and South America were linked by the Isthmus of Panama  thereby forming the single landmass of the Americas  29  Geography Further information  Geography of North America and Geography of South America The northernmost point of the Americas is Kaffeklubben Island  which is the most northerly point of land on Earth  30  The southernmost point is the islands of Southern Thule  although they are sometimes considered part of Antarctica  31  The mainland of the Americas is the world s longest north to south landmass  The distance between its two polar extremities  the Boothia Peninsula in northern Canada and Cape Froward in Chilean Patagonia  is roughly 14 000 km  8 700 mi   32  The mainland s most westerly point is the end of the Seward Peninsula in Alaska  Attu Island  further off the Alaskan coast to the west  is considered the westernmost point of the Americas  Ponta do Seixas in northeastern Brazil forms the easternmost extremity of the mainland  32  while Nordostrundingen  in Greenland  is the most eastely point of the continental shelf  Topography Aconcagua  the highest peak in the Americas The western geography of the Americas is dominated by the American cordillera  with the Andes running along the west coast of South America 33  and the Rocky Mountains and other North American Cordillera ranges running along the western side of North America  34  The 2300 km long  1429 mile long  Appalachian Mountains run along the east coast of North America from Alabama to Newfoundland  35  North of the Appalachians  the Arctic Cordillera runs along the eastern coast of Canada  36  The ranges with the highest peaks are the Andes and Rocky Mountain ranges  While high peaks exists in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range  on average there are not as many reaching a height greater than fourteen thousand feet  In North America  the largest amount of fourteeners occur in the United States and more specifically in the U S  state of Colorado  The highest peaks in the Americas are located in the Andes with Aconcagua of Argentina being the highest  in North America Denali in the U S  state of Alaska is the tallest  Between its coastal mountain ranges  North America has vast flat areas  The Interior Plains spread over much of the continent with low relief  37  The Canadian Shield covers almost 5 million km  of North America and is generally quite flat  38  Similarly  the north east of South America is covered by the flat Amazon Basin  39  The Brazilian Highlands on the east coast are fairly smooth but show some variations in landform  while further south the Gran Chaco and Pampas are broad lowlands  40  Hydrology Mississippi River Delta Hurricane Katrina With coastal mountains and interior plains  the Americas have several large river basins that drain the continents  The largest river basin in North America is that of the Mississippi  covering the second largest watershed on the planet  41  The Mississippi Missouri river system drains most of 31 states of the U S   most of the Great Plains  and large areas between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains  This river is the fourth longest in the world and tenth most powerful in the world  In North America  to the east of the Appalachian Mountains  there are no major rivers but rather a series of rivers and streams that flow east with their terminus in the Atlantic Ocean  these rivers included the Savannah River  A similar instance arises with central Canadian rivers that drain into Hudson Bay  the largest being the Churchill River  On the west coast of North America  the main rivers are the Colorado River  Columbia River  Yukon River  and Sacramento River  The Colorado River drains much of the Southern Rockies and parts of the Great Basin and Range Province  The river flows approximately 1 450 miles  2 330 km  into the Gulf of California  42  during which over time it has carved out natural phenomena such as the Grand Canyon and created phenomena such as the Salton Sea  The Columbia is a large river  1 243 miles  2 000 km  long  in central western North America and is the most powerful river on the West Coast of the Americas  In the far northwest of North America  the Yukon drains much of the Alaskan peninsula and flows 1 980 miles  3 190 km  43  from parts of Yukon and the Northwest Territory to the Pacific  Draining to the Arctic Ocean in North America  the Mackenzie River drains waters from the great lakes of Canada  This river is the largest in Canada and drains 1 805 200 square kilometres  697 000 sq mi   44  The largest river basin in South America is that of the Amazon  which has the highest volume flow of any river on Earth  45  The second largest watershed of South America is that of the Paran  River  which covers about 2 5 million km   46  Climate The climate of the Americas varies significantly from region to region  Tropical rainforest climate occurs in the latitudes of the Amazon  American Cloud forests  Florida and Darien Gap  In the Rocky Mountains and Andes  a similar climate is observed  Often the higher altitudes of these mountains are snow capped  Southeastern North America is well known for its occurrence of tornadoes and hurricanes  of which the vast majority of tornadoes occur in the United States  Tornado Alley  47  Often parts of the Caribbean are exposed to the violent effects of hurricanes  These weather systems are formed by the collision of dry  cool air from Canada and wet  warm air from the Atlantic  Demography Population Further information  List of sovereign states and dependent territories in the Americas by population The total population of the Americas is about 859 000 000 people and is divided as follows  citation needed  North America  2001 with 495 million and in 2002 with 501 million  includes Central America and the Caribbean  South America  2001 with 352

hold titles for being the largest population area based on the three main demographic concepts  48  Main article  City proper The locality with legally fixed boundaries and an administratively recognized urban status that is usually characterized by some form of local government  49  50  51  52  53  Main article  Metropolitan area Unlike an urban area  a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area  but also satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio economically connected to the urban core city  typically by employment ties through commuting  with the urban core city being the primary labor market  Main article  Urban area An urban area is characterized by higher population density and vast human features in comparison to areas surrounding it  Urban areas may be cities  towns or conurbations  but the term is not commonly extended to rural settlements such as villages and hamlets  Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization and do not include large swaths or rural land  as do metropolitan areas  In accordance with these definitions  the three largest population centers in the Americas are  Mexico City  anchor to the

in completely new languages  such as Papiamento  which is a combination of Portuguese  Spanish  Dutch  representing the respective colonizers   native Arawak  various African languages  and  more recently English  Portu ol  a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish  is spoken in the border regions of Brazil and neighboring Spanish speaking countries  76  More specifically  Riverense Portu ol is spoken by around 100 000 people in the border regions of Brazil and Uruguay  Due to immigration  there are many communities where other languages are spoken from all parts of the world especially in the United States  Brazil  Argentina and Canada  four very important destinations for immigrants  and half of the population of Uruguay is thought to be of Italian descent  Terminology Subdivisions of

hemispherical sense remain  or are translated from other languages as such  as in the names of international organizations  77  For instance  the Association of National Olympic Committees  ANOC  in Paris maintains a single continental association for  America   represented by one of the five Olympic rings  78  Speakers of English in the United States of America generally refer to the landmasses of North America and South America as the Western Hemisphere  the New World  or the Americas  to U S  citizens as Americans and to the United States as America  62  79  This sense of America has been primary in English since the 19th century  though not without some ambiguities or uncertainties  5  Exclusive use in English of this sense has caused offense to some from Canada or Latin America 80  who avoid this usage  preferring constructed terms in their languages derived from  United States  or even  North America   81  82  83  In Canada  its southern neighbor is often referred to as  the United States    the U S A    or  informally   the States   while citizens are generally referred to as Americans  82  English dictionaries and compendiums differ regarding usage and rendition  84  85

November 2010  Main article  American  word  English usage People who are not connected with the United States rarely call themselves American  but the word is sometimes used by Latin Americans when they are speaking English because they also consider themselves American  and feel that using the term solely for the United States misappropriates it  87  When using the word as a demonym  the English speaking world uses American primarily to refer to a citizen or national of the United States of America  For instance  Canadians abroad typically resent being referred to as Americans  82  but some have protested the use of American as a national demonym  88  Spanish usage The Spanish American colonies at their maximum extent  after the Peace of Paris  1783  In Spanish  Am rica is the name of a single continent composed of the subcontinents of Sudam rica and Norteam rica  the land bridge of Centroam rica  and the islands of the Antillas  Americano a in Spanish refers to a person from Am rica in a similar way that europeo or europea refers to a person from Europa  The terms sudamericano a  centroamericano a  antillano a and norteamericano a can be used to more specifically refer to the location where a person may live  Citizens of the United States of America are normally referred to by the term estadounidense  rough literal translation   United Statesian   instead of americano or americana  and the country s name itself is often translated as Estados Unidos de Norteam rica  United States of North America   Also  the term norteamericano  North American  may refer to a citizen of the United States  This term is primarily used to refer to citizens of the United States  rarely those of other North American countries  89  Portuguese usage In Portuguese  the word americano refers to the whole of the Americas  But  in Brazil and Portugal  it is widely used to refer to the citizens of the United States  The least ambiguous terms  estadunidense  used in Brazil  something like  United Statesian  or  estadounidense  in Spanish   and  ianque  the Portuguese version of  Yankee  are rarely used  Am rica  however  is rarely used as synonym to the country  and almost never in print and in more formal environments  where the country is called either Estados Unidos da Am rica  i e  United States of America  or simply Estados Unidos  i e  United States   There is some difference between the usage of these words in Portugal and in Brazil  with the Portuguese being more prone to apply the term Am rica to the country  French usage In French  as in English  the word am ricain can be confusing as it can be used to refer either to the United States  or to the American continents  The noun Am rique sometimes refers to the whole as one continent  and sometimes two continents  southern and northern  the United States is generally referred to as les  tats Unis d Am rique  les  tats Unis  or les USA  In Qu bec  the United States are sometimes called les  tats or even simply les states in daily informal conversation  However  the use of Am rique to refer to the United States does still have some currency in France  The adjective am ricain is most often used for things relating to the United States  however  it may also be used for things relating to the American continents  Books by United States authors translated from English are often described as  traduit de l am ricain   Things relating to the United States can be referred to without ambiguity by the words  tats unien   tasunien  or  tatsunien  although this usage is rare  Dutch usage In Dutch  the word Amerika mostly refers to the United States  Although the United States is equally often referred to as de Verenigde Staten or de VS  Amerika relatively rarely refers to the Americas  but it is the only commonly used Dutch word for the Americas  This often leads to ambiguity  and to stress that something concerns the Americas as a whole  Dutch uses a combination  namely Noord  en Zuid Amerika  North and South America   Latin America is generally referred to as Latijns Amerika or  less frequently  Midden Amerika  Central America   The adjective Amerikaans is most often used for things or people relating to the United States  There are no alternative words to distinguish between things relating to the United States or to the Americas  Dutch uses the local alternative for things relating to elsewhere in the Americas  such as Argentijns for Argentine  etc  Russian usage In the 19th century in Russia the word  America  was used for a traditional continent such as Europe and Asia  In the 20th century these traditional continents are known as  parts of the world   Now the term  continent  means any of six large continuous landmasses  Eurasia  Africa  North America  South America  Antarctica  and Australia   Now the word Ameri a refers to the United States more often than to America as a  part of the world   There is no term equivalent to  Americas  in Russian
