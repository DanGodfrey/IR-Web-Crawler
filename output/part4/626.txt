the Apollo 11 mission  A similar flag was planted on each of the five subsequent successful Moon landing missions  The modern meaning of the flag was forged in December 1860 when Major Robert Anderson  acting without orders  moved the US garrison from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter  in Charleston Harbor  in defiance of the power of the new Confederate States of America  Adam Goodheart argues this was the opening move of the Civil War  and the flag was used throughout the North to symbolize American nationalism and rejection of secessionism  Before that day  the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory  flown from forts  embassies  and ships  and displayed on special occasions like the Fourth of July  But in the weeks after Major Anderson s surprising stand  it became something different  Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flew   as it does today  and especially as it did after the September 11 attacks in 2001   from houses  from storefronts  from churches  above the village greens and college quads  For the first time American flags were mass produced rather than individually stitched and even so  manufacturers could not keep up with demand  As the long winter of 1861 turned into spring  that old flag meant something new  The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing  strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for  and many thousands die for  3  The flag of the United States is one of the nation s most widely recognized symbols  Within the United States  flags are frequently displayed not only on public buildings but on private residences  The flag is a common motif on decals for car windows  and clothing ornaments such as badges and lapel pins  Throughout the world the flag has been used in public discourse to refer to the United States  not only as a nation  state  government  and set of policies  but also as a set of ideals  The flag has become a powerful symbol of Americanism  and is proudly flown on many occasions  with giant outdoor flags used by retail outlets to draw customers  Desecration of the flag is considered a public outrage  but remains protected as freedom of speech  In worldwide comparison  Testi  2010  notes that the United States is not unique in adoring its banner  for in Scandinavian countries their flags are also  beloved  domesticated  commercialized and sacralized objects  4   edit  Design  edit  Specifications The basic design of the current flag is specified by 4 U S C    1  4 U S C    2 outlines the addition of new stars to

colors to be used in the flag are specified with reference to the CAUS Standard Color Reference of America  10th edition  Specifically  the colors are  White    Old Glory Red   and  Old Glory Blue   8  The CIE coordinates for the colors of the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card were formally specified in JOSA in 1946  9  These colors form the standard for cloth  and there is no perfect way to convert them to RGB for display on screen or CMYK for printing  The  relative  coordinates in the following table were found by scaling the luminous reflectance relative to the flag s  white

colors are often used for mass market flags  printed reproductions  and other products intended to evoke flag colors  The practice of using more saturated colors than the official cloth is not new  As Taylor  Knoche  and Granville wrote in 1950   The color of the official wool bunting  of the blue field  is a very dark blue  but printed reproductions of the flag  as well as merchandise supposed to match the flag  present the color as a deep blue much brighter than the official wool   11  Sometimes  Pantone Matching System  PMS  approximations to the flag colors are used  One set was given on the website of the U S  embassy in London as early as 1998  the website of the U S  embassy in Stockholm claimed in 2001 that those had been suggested by Pantone  and that the U S  Government Printing Office preferred a different set  A third red was suggested by a California Military Department document in 2002  12  In 2001  the Texas legislature specified that the colors of the Texas flag should

When Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for statehood in the 1950s  more than 1 500 designs were spontaneously submitted to President Dwight D  Eisenhower  Although some of them were 49 star versions  the vast majority were 50 star proposals  At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50 star flag  15  At the time  credit was given by the executive department to the United States Army Institute of Heraldry for the design  Of these proposals  one created by 17 year old Robert G  Heft in 1958 as a school project has received the most publicity  His mother was a seamstress  but refused to do any of the work for him  He originally received a B  for the project  After discussing the grade with his teacher  it was agreed  somewhat jokingly  that if the flag was accepted by Congress  the grade would be reconsidered  Heft s flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the union in 1959  16  Both the 49  and 50 star flags were each flown for the first time ever at Fort McHenry on the Fourth of July one year apart  1959 and 1960 respectively  17   edit  Decoration Traditionally  the flag may be decorated with golden fringe surrounding the perimeter of the flag as long as it does not deface the flag proper  Ceremonial displays of the flag  such as those in parades or on indoor posts  often use fringe to enhance the beauty of the flag  The first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835  and the Army used it officially in 1895  No specific law governs the legality of fringe  but a 1925 opinion of the attorney general addresses the use of fringe  and the number of stars      is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy     as quoted from footnote in previous volumes of Title 4 of the United States Code law books and is a source for claims that such a flag is a military ensign not civilian  However  according to the Army Institute of Heraldry  which has official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered  there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe  18  Several federal courts have upheld this conclusion  19  20  Traditionally  the Army and Air Force use a fringed National Color for parade  color guard and indoor display  while the Sea Services  Navy  Marine Corps and Coast Guard  use a fringeless National Color for all uses   edit  Display and use A boy holds an American flag during the 2009 National Memorial Day Concert in Washington  D C  The flag is customarily flown all year round at most public buildings  and it is not unusual to find private houses flying full size flags  Some private use is year round  but becomes widespread on civic holidays like Memorial Day  Veterans Day  Presidents  Day  Flag Day  and on Independence Day  On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U S  war veterans  Also on Memorial Day it is common to fly the flag at half staff  until noon  in remembrance of those who lost their lives fighting in U S  wars   edit  Flag etiquette Main article  United States Flag Code Proper vertical display The United States Flag Code outlines certain guidelines for the use  display  and disposal of the flag  For example  the flag should never be dipped to any person or thing  unless it is the ensign responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation  This tradition may come from the 1908 Summer Olympics in London  where countries were asked to dip their flag to King Edward VII  the American flag bearer did not  Team captain Martin Sheridan is famously quoted as saying  this flag dips to no earthly king   though the true provenance of this quotation is unclear  21  22  Tattered and improperly displayed flag at Spokane Valley Police Headquarters  Spokane  Washington The flag should never be allowed to touch the ground and  if flown at night  must be illuminated  If the edges become tattered through wear  the flag should be repaired or replaced  When a flag is so tattered that it can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States  it should be destroyed in a dignified manner  preferably by burning  The American Legion and other organizations regularly conduct flag retirement ceremonies  often on Flag Day  June 14  It is a common myth that if a flag touches the ground or becomes soiled  it must be burned as well  While a flag that is currently touching the ground and a soiled flag are unfit for display  neither situation is permanent and thus the flag does not need to be burned if the unfit situation is remedied  23  Significantly  the Flag Code prohibits using the flag  for any advertising purpose  and also states that the flag  should not be embroidered  printed  or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions  handkerchiefs  napkins  boxes  or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use   24  Both of these codes are generally ignored  almost always without comment  One of the most commonly ignored and misunderstood aspects of the Flag Code is section 8   The flag should never be used as wearing apparel  bedding  or drapery   Section 3 of the Flag Code  25  defines a flag for the purposes of the code  Contrary to popular belief  the U S  Flag Code does permit the use of flag design in fashion etcetera  provided that such a design was not formed using the actual design of the flag  The wearing of any article of clothing representing the flag is allowed  however  the flag itself is not  Although the Flag Code is U S  federal law  it is only binding on government institutions displaying the flag  there is no penalty for a private citizen or group failing to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforced indeed  punitive enforcement would conflict with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech  26  Passage of the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment would overrule legal precedent that has been established   edit  Display on vehicles When the flag is affixed to the side of a vehicle  land  sea or air   it should be oriented so that the union is towards the front  as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward  Therefore  U S  flag decals on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be  reversed   with the union to the observer s right instead of left as more commonly seen  The flag has been displayed on every US spacecraft designed for manned flight  including Mercury  Gemini  Apollo Command Service Module  Apollo Lunar Module  and the Space Shuttle  The flag also appeared on the S IC first stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle used for Apollo  But since Mercury  Gemini and Apollo were launched and landed vertically and were not capable of horizontal atmospheric flight like an airplane  the  streaming  convention was not followed and these flags were oriented with the stripes running horizontally  perpendicular to the direction of flight   edit  Display on uniforms The crew of Apollo 1 wore their flags on the right shoulder  unlike all other US astronaut flight crews Flag of the United States on American astronaut Neil Armstrong s space suit On U S  military uniforms  flag patches are worn on the right shoulder  following the vehicle convention with the union toward the front  This rule dates back to the Army s early history  when both mounted cavalry and infantry units would designate a standard bearer  who carried the Colors into battle  As he charged  his forward motion caused the flag to stream back  Since the Stars and Stripes are mounted with the canton closest to the pole  that section stayed to the right  while the stripes flew to the left  27  Other organizations that wear flag patches on their uniforms can have the flag facing in either direction  The uniform of the Boy Scouts of America  for example  has the stripes facing front  the reverse of the military style  Law enforcement officers often wear a small flag patch  either on a shoulder  or above a shirt pocket  Every US astronaut since the crew of Gemini 4 has worn the flag on the left shoulder of his or her space suit  with the exception of the crew of Apollo 1  whose flags were worn on the right shoulder  In this case  the streaming convention  canton on the right  was not observed   edit  Postage stamps Flags depicted on U S  postage stamp issues The flag did not appear on U S  postal stamp issues until the Battle of White Plains Issue was released in 1926  depicting the flag with a circle of 13 stars  The 48 star flag first appeared on the General Casimir Pulaski issue of 1931 however the depiction there is noticeable at best clarification needed   The first U S  postage stamp to feature the flag as the sole subject was issued July 4  1957  pictured  top   28   edit  Places of continuous display By presidential proclamation  acts of Congress  and custom  U S  flags are displayed continuously at

edit  Display at half staff The flag is displayed at half staff  half mast in naval usage  as a sign of respect or mourning  Nationwide  this action is proclaimed by the president  state wide or territory wide  the proclamation is made by the governor  In addition  there is no prohibition against municipal governments  private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half staff as a local sign of respect and mourning  However  many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices  President Dwight D  Eisenhower issued the first proclamation on March 1  1954  standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half staff from all federal buildings  grounds  and naval vessels  other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued  However  they are only guidelines to all other entities  typically followed at state and local government facilities  and encouraged of private businesses and citizens  To properly fly the flag at half staff  one should first briefly hoist it top of the staff  then lower it to the half staff position  halfway between the top and bottom of the staff  Similarly  when the flag is to be lowered from half staff  it should be first briefly hoisted to the top of the staff  42  Only state governors can decide to lower the flag to half staff  according to US Code  Federal guidelines state the flag should be flown at half staff at the following dates times  May 15   Peace Officers Memorial Day  unless it is the third Saturday in May  Armed Forces Day  full staff all day 43  Last Monday in May   Memorial Day  until noon  July 27   Korean War Veterans Day  expired 2003

Representatives  Also for federal facilities within a state or territory  for the governor  On the day after the death   Senators  members of Congress  territorial delegates or the resident commissioner of the commonwealth of Puerto Rico Further  the flag is always flown at half staff at three locations in the United States  These locations are The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier  Arlington Cemetery  and the Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor  50   edit  Folding for storage Folding the U S  flag Though not part of the official Flag Code  according to military custom  flags should be folded into a triangular shape when not in use  To properly fold the flag  Begin by holding it waist high with another person so that its surface is parallel to the ground  Fold the lower half of the stripe section lengthwise over the field of stars  holding the bottom and top edges securely  Fold the flag again lengthwise with the blue field on the outside  Make a rectangular fold then a triangular fold by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open top edge of the flag  starting the fold from the left side over to the right  Turn the outer end point inward  parallel to the open edge  to form a second triangle  The triangular folding is continued until the entire length of the flag is folded in this manner  usually thirteen triangular folds  as shown at right   On the final fold  any remnant that does not neatly fold into a triangle  or in the case of exactly even folds  the last triangle  is tucked into the previous fold  When the flag is completely folded  only a triangular blue field of stars should be visible   edit  Religious themes Some people believe that each fold of the flag also carries a symbolic meaning  but there is no authority for their belief  51  A religiously inspired ceremony was taught to soldiers but after protests at the overt religious themes  the Pentagon withdrew it  52  The American Legion  a private organization of veterans  has made its own religious interpretation  Fold Meaning Fold One Life on Earth 51  53  54  Fold Two Eternal Life 51  53  54  Fold Three The veteran who gave a portion of his life for the defense of the United States 51  53  54  Fold Four Humanity s Weaker Nature and the American s reliance on God during both peacetime and wartime 51  53  54  Fold Five Tribute to our Country 51  53  54  Fold Six The state of the American s heart 51  53  54  Fold Seven The United States Armed Forces 51  53  54  Fold Eight Tribute to the one who entered into the valley of the shadow of death  that humanity might see the light of day 51  53  54  Fold Nine A tribute to Motherhood 51  53  54  Fold Ten A tribute to Fatherhood 51  53  54  Fold Eleven The eleventh fold  in the eyes of a Jewish citizen  represents the lower portion of the seal of King David and King Solomon  and glorifies  in their eyes  the God of Abraham  Isaac  and Jacob  51  53  54  Fold Twelve The twelfth fold  in the eyes of a Christian citizen  represents an emblem of eternity and glorifies  in their eyes  God the Father  the Son  and the Holy Ghost  51  53  54  When the flag is completely folded  the stars point upwards  which remind the American of his national motto   In God We Trust   51  53  54  After the flag is completely folded and tucked in  it takes on the appearance of a bicorne  reminding the American of the soldiers who served under General George Washington  and the sailors and Marines who served under Captain John Paul Jones  who were followed by their comrades and shipmates in the Armed Forces of the United States  51  53  54   edit  Use in funerals A flag prepared for presentation to the next of kin Traditionally  the flag of the United States plays a role in military funerals  55  and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants  such as law enforcement officers  fire fighters  and Presidents of the United States   A burial flag is draped over the deceased s casket as a pall during services  Just prior to the casket being lowered into the ground  the flag is ceremonially folded and presented to the deceased s next of kin as a token of respect  56  If the soldier was enlisted during wartime  and given an Honor Guard at the funeral ceremony  cartridges from the gun salute are gathered and placed into the folded flag   edit  History See also  Timeline of the flag of the United States The design of the flag has been modified 26 times officially  since 1777  The 48 star flag was in effect for 47 years until the 49 star version became official on July 4  1959  The 50 star flag was ordered by President Eisenhower on August 21  1959  57   edit  First flag The Continental Colors  aka Grand Union Flag  At the time of the Declaration of Independence  the Continental Congress would not legally adopt flags with  stars  white in a blue field  for another year  The flag contemporaneously known as  the Continental Colors  has historically been referred to as the first national flag  58  The Continental Navy raised the Colors as the ensign of the fledgling nation in the American War for Independence   likely with the expedient of transforming their previous British red ensigns by adding white stripes   and would use this flag until 1777  when it would form the basis for the subsequent de jure designs  58  59  The name  Grand Union  was first applied to the Continental Colors by George Preble in his 1872 history of the American flag  59  Flag of the British East India Company  1707 1801 The flag closely resembles the British East India Company flag of the era  and Sir Charles Fawcett argued in 1937 that the Company flag inspired the design  60  Both flags could have been easily constructed by adding white stripes to a British Red Ensign  the maritime flag used throughout the British Empire  However  an East India Company flag could have from 9 to 13 stripes  and was not allowed to be flown outside the Indian Ocean  61  Coat of arms of George Washington Another theory holds that the red and white stripe and later  stars and stripes motif of the flag may have been based on the Washington family coat of arms  first used to identify the family in the twelfth century  when one of George Washington s ancestors took possession of Washington Old Hall  then in County Durham  now part of Sunderland   north east England  which consisted of a shield  argent  two bars gules  above  three mullets gules   a white shield with two red bars below three red stars   62  Another theory is based on the family coat of arms of Richard Amerike   According to the American Flag Research Center in Massachusetts the heraldic origin of the American flag is not positively known  archives in the British Library confirm that the Stars and Stripes was the coat of arms of the Ap Merike family   and that they pre date Washington s connection with the continent by 300 years   63  In any case  both the stripes  barry  and the stars  mullets  have precedents in classical heraldry  Mullets were comparatively rare in early modern heraldry  but an example of mullets representing territorial divisions predating the US flag are those in the coat of arms of Valais of 1618  where seven mullets stood for seven districts   edit  The Flag Resolution of 1777 On June 14  1777  the Marine Committee of the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag Resolution which stated   Resolved  that the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes  alternate red and white  that the union be thirteen stars  white in a blue field  representing a new Constellation   64 Flag Day is now observed on June 14 of each year  A false tradition holds that the new flag was first hoisted in June 1777 by the Continental Army at the Middlebrook encampment  65  13 star flag 13 star  Betsy Ross  variant The 1777 resolution was most probably meant to define a naval ensign  In the late 18th century  the notion of national flag did not yet exist  or was only nascent  The flag resolution appears between other resolutions from the Marine Committee  On May 10  1779  Secretary of the Board of War Richard Peters expressed concern  it is not yet settled what is the Standard of the United States   66  The Flag Resolution did not specify any particular arrangement  number of points  nor orientation for the stars  One famous arrangement features 13 outwardly oriented five pointed stars arranged in a circle  the so called Betsy Ross flag  Although the Betsy Ross legend is controversial  the design is among the earliest 13 star flags  Popular designs at the time were varied and most were individually crafted rather than mass produced  Examples of 13 star arrangements can be found on other flags attributed to Francis Hopkinson  the Cowpens flag  and the Brandywine flag  Given the scant archaeological and written evidence  it is unknown if one design was the most popular during the period  citation needed  Despite the 1777 resolution  a number of flags only loosely based on the prescribed design were used in the early years of American independence  One example may have been the Guilford Court House Flag  traditionally believed to have been carried by the American troops at the Battle of Guilford Court House in 1781  67  The origin of the stars and stripes design is inadequately documented  The apocryphal story credits Betsy Ross for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch handed to her by George Washington  No evidence for this exists  indeed  nearly a century had passed before Ross  grandson  William Canby  first publicly suggested it  68  Another woman  Rebecca Young  has also been credited as having made the first flag by later generations of her family  Young s daughter was Mary Pickersgill  who made the Star Spangled Banner Flag  69  70  It is likely that Francis Hopkinson of New Jersey  a signer of the Declaration of Independence  designed the 1777 flag while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board s Middle Department  sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777  This contradicts the Betsy Ross legend  which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776  64  71  Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime  when he sent a bill to Congress for his work  He asked for a  Quarter Cask of the Public Wine  as payment initially  The payment was not made  however  because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress  and he was not the only person to have contributed to the design  72   edit  Later flag acts 15 star  15 stripe Star Spangled Banner Flag 48 star flag  is the second longest in use  1912 1959   See also  Flag Acts  U S   In 1795  the number of stars and stripes was increased from 13 to 15  to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky as states of the union   For a time the flag was not changed when subsequent states were admitted  probably because it was thought that this would cause too much clutter  It was the 15 star  15 stripe flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write  Defense of Fort McHenry   later known as  The Star Spangled Banner   now the national anthem  Oil painting depicting the 39 historical U S  flags On April 4  1818  a plan was passed by Congress at the suggestion of U S  Naval Captain Samuel C  Reid 73  in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars  with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted  but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to honor the original colonies  The act specified that new flag designs should become official on the first July 4  Independence Day  following admission of one or more new states  The most recent change  from 49 stars to 50  occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen  after Hawaii gained statehood in August 1959  Before that  the admission of Alaska in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short lived 49 star flag  74  Prior to the adoption of the 48 star flag in 1912  there was no official arrangement of the stars in the canton  although the Army and Navy used standardized designs  Throughout the 19th century there were a plethora of star patterns  rectangular and circular  some quite striking  As of July 4  2007  the 50 star flag became the longest rendition in use   edit  The  Flower Flag  arrives in Asia The U S  flag was brought to the city of Canton  Gu ngzh u  in China in 1785 by the merchant ship Empress of China  which carried a cargo of ginseng  75  There it gained the designation  Flower Flag   Chinese      pinyin  hu q   Cantonese Yale  f ke    76  According to author and U S  Naval officer George H  Preble  When the thirteen stripes and stars first appeared at Canton much curiosity was excited among the people  News was circulated that a strange ship had arrived from the farther end of the world  bearing a flag as beautiful as a flower  Everybody went to see the Fah kay cheun        or flower flag ship  This name at once established itself in the language  and America is now called Fah kay gawk  Chinese       pinyin  Hu q gu   Cantonese Yale  F ke gwok   the flower flag country  and an American  Fah kay gawk yun         flower flag country man    a more complimentary designation than that of red headed barbarian  the name first bestowed on the Dutch  75  In the above quote  the Chinese words are written phonetically based on spoken Cantonese  The names given were common usage in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  77  Other Asian nations have equivalent terms for America  for example Vietnamese  Hoa K    Flower Flag    Chinese nowadays refer to the United States as simplified Chinese      traditional Chinese      pinyin  M igu   M i is short for M il ji n  a Chinese pronunciation of  America   and  gu   means  country   so this name is unrelated to the flag  However  the  flower flag  terminology persists in some places today  for example  American Ginseng is called simplified Chinese       traditional Chinese       literally  flower flag ginseng  in Chinese  The U S  flag took its first trip around the world in 1787 90 on board the Columbia  76 William Driver  who coined the phrase Old Glory  took the U S  flag around the world in 1831 32  76  The flag attracted the notice of Japanese when an oversized version was carried to Yokohama by the steamer Great Republic as part of a round the world journey in 1871  78   edit  Historical
