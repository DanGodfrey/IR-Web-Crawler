reintroducing the more mischievous and adventurous sides of his personality  starting with the video game Epic Mickey  4  Contents 1 Origin 2 Design 3 Animation history 3 1 Debut  1928  3 2 Black and

earliest known drawings of the character  From the collection of The Walt Disney Family Museum  I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing   that it was all started by a mouse    Walt Disney  Disneyland  October 27  1954 Mickey Mouse was created as a replacement for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit  an earlier cartoon character created by the Disney studio for Charles Mintz of Universal Studios  5  In the spring of 1928  with the series going strong  Disney asked Mintz for an increase in the budget  But Mintz instead demanded that Walt take a 20 percent budget cut  and as leverage  he reminded Disney that Universal owned the character  and revealed that he had already signed most of Disney s current employees to his new contract  Mintz owned Oswald and thought he had Disney over a barrel  Angrily  Disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final Oswald cartoons he contractually owed Mintz  Disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff  but determined to restart from scratch  The new Disney Studio initially consisted of animator Ub Iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist  Les Clark  who together with Wilfred Jackson were among the few who remained loyal to Walt  One lesson Disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company  In the spring of 1928  Disney asked Ub Iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas  Iwerks tried sketches of various animals  such as dogs and cats  but none of these appealed to Disney  A female cow and male horse were also rejected  They would later turn up as Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar   A male frog  also rejected  would later show up in Iwerks  own Flip the Frog series   3  Walt Disney got the inspiration for Mickey Mouse from his old pet mouse he used to have on his farm  In 1925  Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney  These inspired Ub Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney  3   Mortimer Mouse  had been Disney s original name for the character before his wife  Lillian  convinced him to change it  and ultimately Mickey Mouse came to be  6  7  Actor Mickey Rooney has claimed that  during his Mickey McGuire days  he met cartoonist Walt Disney at the Warner Brothers studio  and that Disney was inspired to name Mickey Mouse after him  8  Design Ub Iwerks designed Mickey s body out of circles in order to make the character simple to animate  Disney employees John Hench and Marc Davis believed that this design was part of Mickey s success   it made him more dynamic and appealing to audiences  Mickey s circular design is most noticeable in his ears  which in traditional animation  always appear circular no matter which way Mickey faces  This made Mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark  Even today  the symbol is often used by the Disney Company to represent Mickey  see Hidden Mickey   This later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a three dimensional Mickey  In animation in the 1940s Mickey s ears were animated in perspective  Animator Fred Moore would later redesign Mickey s body away from its circular design to a pear shape design  Colleague Ward Kimball praised Moore for being the first animator to break from Mickey s  rubber hose  round circle  design  Although Moore himself was nervous at first about changing Mickey  Walt Disney liked the new design and told Moore  that s the way I want Mickey to be drawn from now on   Each of Mickey s hands has only three fingers and a thumb  Disney said that this was both an artistic and financial decision  explaining  Artistically five digits are too many for a mouse  His hand would look like a bunch of bananas  Financially  not having an extra finger in each of 45 000 drawings that make up a six and one half minute short has saved the Studio millions   In the film The Opry House  1929   Mickey was given his white gloves which were a simple way of contrasting his naturally black hands against his black body  Mickey s eyes  as drawn in Plane Crazy and The Gallopin  Gaucho  were large and white and defined by black outlines  In Steamboat Willie the black outlines were removed  although the upper edges still contrasted with his head  Mickey s eyes were later re imagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were his pupils  while what were the upper edges of his eyes became a hairline  This is evident only when Mickey blinks  Fred Moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave his face a Caucasian skin tone instead of plain white  This new Mickey first appeared in 1938 on the cover of a party program  and in animation the following year with the release of The Pointer  9  Mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in The Simple Things  1953  and in the comic strip  although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances  Besides Mickey s gloves and shoes  he typically wears only a pair of shorts with two large buttons in the front  Although the animated Mickey was seen only in black and white for over seven years  10  print images confirmed that the shorts were red  When Mickey is not wearing his red shorts  he is often still wearing red clothing  This includes a red bandmaster coat  The Band Concert  The Mickey Mouse Club   red overalls  Clock Cleaners  Boat Builders   a red cloak  Fantasia  Fun and Fancy Free   a red coat  Squatter s Rights  Mickey s Christmas Carol   and a red shirt  Mickey Down Under  The Simple Things   Animation history See also  Mickey Mouse film series Debut  1928  Mickey Mouse in Steamboat Willie  1928  Disney had Ub Iwerks secretly begin animating a new cartoon while still under contract with Universal  The cartoon was co directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks  Iwerks was the main animator for the short  and reportedly spent six weeks working on it  In fact  Iwerks was the main animator for every Disney short released in 1928 and 1929  Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising also assisted Disney during those years  They had already signed their contracts with Charles Mintz  but he was still in the process of forming his new studio and so for the time being they were still employed by Disney  This short would be the last they animated under this somewhat awkward situation  11  Mickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short Plane Crazy  on May 15  1928  but it failed to impress the audience and to add insult to injury  Walt could not find a distributor  Though understandably disappointed  Walt went on to produce a second Mickey short   The Gallopin  Gaucho  which was also not released for lack of a distributor  Steamboat Willie was first released on November 18  1928 in New York  It was co directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks  Iwerks again served as the head animator  assisted by Johnny Cannon  Les Clark  Wilfred Jackson and Dick Lundy  This short was intended as a parody of Buster Keaton s Steamboat Bill Jr   first released on May 12 of the same year  Although it was the third Mickey cartoon produced  it was the first to find a distributor  and thus is considered by The Disney Company as Mickey s debut  Willie featured changes to Mickey s appearance  in particular  simplifying his eyes to large dots  that established his look for later cartoons and in numerous Walt Disney films  The cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the action  Fleischer Studios  headed by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer  had already released a number of sound cartoons using the DeForest system in the mid 1920s  However  these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film  For Willie  Disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat  This precise timing is apparent during the  Turkey in the Straw  sequence  when Mickey s actions exactly match the accompanying instruments  Animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the film s original music  This role has been variously attributed to Wilfred Jackson  Carl Stalling and Bert Lewis  but identification remains uncertain  Walt Disney himself was voice actor for both Mickey and Minnie  and would remain the source of Mickey s voice through 1946 for theatrical cartoons  Jimmy MacDonald took over the role in 1946  but Walt provided Mickey s voice again from 1955 to 1959 for the Mickey Mouse Club television series on ABC  The script had Mickey serving aboard Steamboat Willie under Captain Pete  At first he is seen piloting the steamboat while whistling  Then Pete arrives to take over piloting and angrily throws him out of the boat s bridge  They soon have to stop for cargo to be transferred on board  Almost as soon as they leave  Minnie arrives  She was apparently supposed to be their only passenger but was late to board  Mickey manages to pick her up from the river shore  Minnie accidentally drops her sheet music for the popular folk song  Turkey in the Straw   A goat which was among the animals transported on the steamboat proceeds to eat the sheet music  Consequently Mickey and Minnie use its tail to turn it into a phonograph which is playing the tune  Through the rest of the short  Mickey uses various other animals as musical instruments  Captain Pete is eventually disturbed by all this noise and places Mickey back to work  Mickey is reduced to peeling potatoes for the rest of the trip  A parrot attempts to make fun of him but is then thrown to the river by Mickey  This served as the final scene of this short  Audiences at the time of Steamboat Willie s release were reportedly impressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes  Sound films or  talkies  were still considered innovative  The first feature length movie with dialogue sequences  The Jazz Singer starring Al Jolson  was released on October 6  1927  Within a year of its success  most United States movie theaters had installed sound film equipment  Walt Disney apparently intended to take advantage of this new trend and  arguably  managed to succeed  Most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to Disney  As a result Mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time  Walt Disney soon worked on adding sound to both Plane Crazy and The Gallopin  Gaucho  which had originally been silent releases  and their new release added to Mickey s success and popularity  A fourth Mickey short  The Barn Dance  was also put into production  however  Mickey does not actually speak until The Karnival Kid in 1929 when his first spoken words were  Hot dogs  Hot dogs   After Steamboat Willie was released  Mickey became a close competitor to Felix the Cat  and his popularity would grow as he was continuously featured in sound cartoons  By 1929  Felix would lose popularity among theater audiences  and Pat Sullivan decided to produce all future Felix cartoons in sound as a result  12  Unfortunately  audiences did not respond well to Felix s transition to sound and by 1930  Felix had faded from the screen  13  Black and white films  1929 1935   Minnie s Yoo Hoo  Song written by Carl Stalling used as the theme for many of Mickey s black and white films Problems listening to this file  See media help  Minnie and Mickey in Building a Building  1933  In Mickey s early films he was often characterized not as a hero  but as an ineffective young suitor to Minnie Mouse  In his sadness over his failures  Mickey appears unusually emotional and vulnerable  It has been commented who   however  that this only serves to add to the audience s empathy for the character  The Barn Dance  March 14  1929  was the first time in which Mickey is turned down by Minnie in favor of Pete  The Opry House  March 28  1929  was the first time in which Mickey wore his white gloves  Mickey wears them in almost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed suit  Supposedly one reason for adding the white gloves was to allow audiences to distinguish the characters  hands when they appeared against their bodies  as both were black  The three lines on the back of Mickey s gloves represent darts in the gloves  fabric extending from between the digits of the hand  typical of glove design of the era  When the Cat s Away  April 18  1929   essentially a remake of the Alice Comedy   Alice Rattled by Rats   was an unusual appearance for Mickey  Although Mickey and Minne still maintained their anthropomorphic characteristics  they were depicted as the size of regular mice and living with a community many other mice as pests in a home  Mickey and Minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their own setting  In appearances with real humans  Mickey has been shown to be about two to three feet high  14  The next Mickey short was also unusual  The Barnyard Battle  April 25  1929  was the only film to depict Mickey as a soldier and also the first to place him in combat  The Karnival Kid  1929  was the first time Mickey spoke  Before this he had only whistled  laughed  and grunted  His first words were  Hot dogs  Hot dogs   said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival  Mickey s Follies  1929  introduced the song  Minnie s Yoo Hoo  which would become the theme song for Mickey Mouse films for the next several years  The  Minnie s Yoo Hoo  song sequence was also later reused with different background animation as its own special short shown only at the commencement of 1930s theater based Mickey Mouse Clubs  15  16  Mickey s dog Pluto first appeared as Mickey s pet in The Moose Hunt  1931  after previously appearing as Minnie s dog  Rover  in The Picnic  1930   Cactus Kid  April 11  1930  was the last film to be animated by Ub Iwerks at Disney  Shortly before the release of the film  Iwerks left to start his own studio  bankrolled by Disney s then distributor Pat Powers  Powers and Disney had a falling out over money due Disney from the distribution deal  It was in response to losing the right to distribute Disney s cartoons that Powers made the deal with Iwerks  who had long harbored a desire to head his own studio  The departure is considered a turning point in Mickey s career  as well as that of Walt Disney  Walt lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since 1919  Mickey lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction and or animation of several of the shorts released till this point  Advertising for the early Mickey Mouse cartoons credited them as  A Walt Disney Comic  drawn by Ub Iwerks   Later Disney Company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit Walt Disney alone  Disney and his remaining staff continued the production of the Mickey series  and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace Iwerks  As the Great Depression progressed and Felix the Cat faded from the movie screen  Mickey s popularity would rise  and by 1932 the Mickey Mouse Club would have one million members  17  At the 5th Academy Awards in 1932  Mickey received his first Academy Award nomination  received for Mickey s Orphans  1931   Walt Disney also received an honorary Academy Award for the creation of Mickey Mouse  Despite being eclipsed by the Silly Symphonies short The Three Little Pigs in 1933  Mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too  until 1935  when polls showed that Popeye the Sailor was more popular than Mickey  18  19  20  By 1934  Mickey merchandise had earned  600 000 00 a year  21  In 1935  Disney began to phase out the Mickey Mouse Clubs  due to administration problems  22  About this time  story artists at Disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for Mickey  As he had developed into a role model for children  they were limited in the types of gags they could make  This led to Mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing for more emphasis on other characters  In Orphan s Benefit  August 11  1934  Mickey first appeared with Donald Duck who had been introduced earlier that year in the Silly Symphonies series  The tempestuous duck would provide Disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in Mickey s cartoons  Color films  1935 1953  Mickey in The Band Concert  1935  Mickey first appeared animated in color in Parade of the Award Nominees in 1932  however the film strip was created for the 5th Academy Awards ceremony and was not released to the public  Mickey s official first color film came in 1935 with The Band Concert  The Technicolor film process was used in the film production  Here Mickey conducted the William Tell Overture  but the band is swept up by a tornado  It is said that conductor Arturo Toscanini so loved this short that  upon first seeing it  he asked the projectionist to run it again  In 1994   The Band Concert  was voted the third greatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals  By colorizing and partially redesigning Mickey  Walt would put Mickey back on top once again  and Mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal  23  Also in 1935  Walt would receive a special award from the League of Nations for creating Mickey  However  by 1938  the more manic Donald Duck would surpass the passive Mickey  resulting in a redesign of the mouse  24  the redesign between 1938 and 1940 put Mickey at the peak of his popularity  23  The second half of the 1930s saw the character Goofy reintroduced as a series regular  Together  Mickey  Donald Duck  and Goofy would go on several adventures together  Several of the films by the comic trio are some of Mickey s most critically acclaimed films including Mickey s Fire Brigade  1935   Moose Hunters  1937   Clock Cleaners  1937   Lonesome Ghosts  1937   Boat Builders  1938   and Mickey s Trailer  1938   Also during this era  Mickey would star in Brave Little Tailor  1938   an adaptation of The Valiant Little Tailor  which was nominated for an Academy Award  Mickey was redesigned by animator Fred Moore which was first seen in The Pointer in 1939  Instead of having solid black eyes  Mickey was given white eyes with pupils  a Caucasian skin colored face  and a pear shaped body  In the 40 s  he changed once more in  The Little Whirlwind   where he used his trademark pants for the last time in decades  lost his tail  got more realistic ears that changed with perspective and a different body anatomy  But this change would only last for a short period of time before returning to the one in  The Pointer   with the exception of his pants  In his final theatrical cartoons in the 50 s  he was given eyebrows  which were removed in the more recent cartoons  Mickey in Fantasia  1940  In 1940 Mickey appeared in his first feature length film  Fantasia  His screen role as The Sorcerer s Apprentice  set to the symphonic poem of the same name by Paul Dukas  is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of Mickey s most iconic roles  The segment features no dialogue at all  only the music  The apprentice  Mickey   not willing to do his chores  puts on the sorcerer s magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom  which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore filling up a deep well using two buckets of water  When the well eventually overflows  Mickey finds himself unable to control the broom  leading to a near flood  After the segment ends  Mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with Leopold Stokowski  who conducts all the music heard in Fantasia  Mickey as often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerer s hat in merchandising  It was also featured into the climax of Fantasmic   an attraction at the Disney theme parks  After 1940  Mickey s popularity would decline until his 1955 re emergence as a daily children s television personality  25  Despite this  the character continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until 1943  winning his only competitive Academy Award with canine companion Pluto for a short subject  Lend a Paw  and again from 1946 to 1952  The last regular installment of the Mickey Mouse film series came in 1953 with The Simple Things in which Mickey and Pluto go fishing and are pestered by a flock of seagulls  Television and later films Mickey in Disney s House of Mouse  2001 2003  In the 1950s  Mickey became more known for his appearances on television  particularly with the Mickey Mouse Club  Many of his theatrical cartoon shorts were rereleased on television series such as Ink  amp  Paint Club  various forms of the Walt Disney anthology television series  and on home video  Mickey returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with Mickey s Christmas Carol  an adaptation of Charles Dickens  A Christmas Carol in which Mickey played Bob Cratchit  This was followed up in 1990 with The Prince and the Pauper  Throughout the decades  Mickey Mouse competed with Warner Bros   Bugs Bunny for animated popularity  But in 1988  in a historic moment in motion picture history  the two rivals finally shared screen time in the Robert Zemeckis Disney Amblin film Who Framed Roger Rabbit  Disney and Warner signed an agreement stating that each character had exactly the same amount of screen time  right down to the frame  Similar to his animated inclusion into a live action film on Roger Rabbit  Mickey made a featured cameo appearance in the 1990 television special The Muppets at Walt Disney World where he met Kermit the Frog  The two are established in the story as having been old friends  The Muppets have otherwise spoofed and referenced Mickey over a dozen times since the 1970s  Eventually  The Muppets were purchased by the Walt Disney Company in 2004  Mickey appeared on several animated logos for Walt Disney Home Entertainment  starting with the  Neon Mickey  logo and then to the  Sorcerer Mickey  logos used for regular and Classics release titles  His most recent theatrical cartoon short was 1995 s short Runaway Brain  while in 1999 2004  he appeared in made for video features  like Mickey s Once Upon a Christmas  Mickey  Donald  Goofy  The Three Musketeers  and the computer animated Mickey s Twice Upon a Christmas  Many television programs have centered around Mickey  such as the recent ABC shows Mickey Mouse Works  1999 2000   Disney s House of Mouse  2001 2003  and the Disney Channel s Mickey Mouse Clubhouse  2006 present   Prior to all these  Mickey was also featured as an unseen character in the Bonkers episode  You Oughta Be In Toons   Mickey has recently been announced to star in two films  One is being based on the Magic Kingdom theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort  while the other is a film idea pitched by Walt Disney Animation Studios veteran Burny Mattinson centering around Mickey  Donald and Goofy  26  Voices Walt Disney  the co creator of Mickey Mouse and founder of the Walt Disney Company  was the original voice of Mickey A large part of Mickey s screen persona is his famously shy  falsetto voice  From his first speaking role in The Karnival Kid onward  Mickey was voiced by Walt Disney himself  a task in which Disney took great personal pride   Carl Stalling and Clarence Nash allegedly did some uncredited ADR for Mickey in a few early shorts as well   However  by 1946  Disney was becoming too busy with running the studio to do regular voice work which means he could not do Mickey s voice anymore  and as it is speculated his cigarette habit had damaged his voice over the years   and during the recording of the Mickey and the Beanstalk section of Fun and Fancy Free  Mickey s voice was handed over to veteran Disney musician and actor Jimmy MacDonald   Both Disney s and MacDonald s voices can be heard on the final soundtrack   MacDonald voiced Mickey in the remainder of the theatrical shorts  and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in the mid 1970s  although Walt voiced Mickey again for the introductions of the original 1954 1959 The Mickey Mouse Club TV series and the  Fourth Anniversary Show  episode of the Disneyland TV series aired on September 11  1958  1983 s Mickey s Christmas Carol marked the theatrical debut of the late Wayne Allwine as Mickey Mouse  who was the voice of Mickey until his death in 2009  27  Allwine once recounted something MacDonald had told him about voicing Mickey   The main piece of advice that Jim gave me about Mickey helped me keep things in perspective  He said   Just remember kid  you re only filling in for the boss   And that s the way he treated doing Mickey for years and years  From Walt  and now from Jimmy   28  Allwine was  incidentally  married to Russi Taylor  the current voice of Minnie Mouse  Les Perkins did the voice of Mickey in the TV special Down and Out with Donald Duck released in 1987  Bret Iwan  a former Hallmark greeting card artist  is the current voice of Mickey  His early recordings in 2009 included work for the Disney Cruise Line  Mickey toys  Theme Parks  and also the Disney on Ice  Celebrations  ice show  29  His first video game voice over of Mickey Mouse can be found on Kingdom Hearts  Birth by Sleep  a video game for PlayStation Portable  He has also voiced the character in the next games for the Kingdom Hearts series  Bret also does the vocal effects of Mickey in Epic Mickey  Mickey in comics Main article  Mickey Mouse and Friends  comic book  Mickey and Horace Horsecollar from the Mickey Mouse daily strip  created by Floyd Gottfredson and published December 1932 Mickey first appeared in comics after he had appeared in 15 commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public  Walt Disney was approached by King Features Syndicate with the offer to license Mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip  Walt accepted and Mickey made his first comic strip appearance on January 13  1930  The comical plot was credited to Walt Disney himself  art to Ub Iwerks and inking to Win Smith  The first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of  Plane Crazy   Minnie soon became the first addition to the cast  The strips first released between January 13  1930 and March 31  1930 has been occasionally reprinted in comic book form under the collective title  Lost on a Desert Island   Animation historian Jim Korkis notes  After the eighteenth strip  Iwerks left and his inker  Win Smith  continued drawing the gag a day format     30  In early 1930  after Iwerks  departure  Walt was at first content to continue scripting the Mickey Mouse comic strip  assigning the art to Win Smith  However  Walt s focus had always been in animation and Smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well  Smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script  draw  and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation  Walt proceeded to search for a replacement among the remaining staff of the Studio  For unknown reasons he selected Floyd Gottfredson  a recently hired employee  At the time Floyd was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment  Walt had to assure Floyd that the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation  Floyd accepted and ended up holding this  temporary  assignment from May 5  1930  to November 15  1975  Walt Disney s last script for the strip appeared May 17  1930  30  Gottfredson s first task was to finish the storyline Disney had started on April 1  1930  The storyline was completed on September 20  1930 and later reprinted in comic book form as Mickey Mouse in Death Valley  This early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included Mickey and Minnie  Among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were Clarabelle Cow  Horace Horsecollar and Black Pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer Sylvester Shyster and Minnie s uncle Mortimer Mouse  The Death Valley narrative was followed by Mr  Slicker and the Egg Robbers  first printed between September 22 and December 26  1930  which introduced Marcus Mouse and his wife as Minnie s parents  Starting with these two early comic strip stories  Mickey s versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other  While Disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy  the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure  This adventurous version of Mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the 20th and into the 21st century  Floyd Gottfredson left his mark with stories such as Mickey Mouse Joins the Foreign Legion  1936  and The Gleam  1942   He also created the Phantom Blot  Eega Beeva  Morty and Ferdie  Captain Churchmouse  and Butch  Besides Gottfredson artists for the strip over the years included Roman Arambula  Rick Hoover  Manuel Gonzales  Carson Van Osten  Jim Engel  Bill Wright  Ted Thwailes and Daan Jippes  writers included Ted Osborne  Merrill De Maris  Bill Walsh  Dick Shaw  Roy Williams  Del Connell  and Floyd Norman  The next artist to leave his mark on the character was Paul Murry in Dell Comics  His first Mickey tale appeared in 1950 but Mickey did not become a speciality until Murry s first serial for Walt Disney s Comics and Stories in 1953   The Last Resort    In the same period Romano Scarpa in Italy for the magazine Topolino began to revitalize Mickey in stories that brought back the Phantom Blot and Eega Beeva along with new creations such as the Atomo Bleep Bleep  While the stories at Western Publishing during the Silver Age emphasized Mickey as a detective in the style of Sherlock Holmes  in the modern era several editors and creators have consciously undertaken to depict a more vigorous Mickey in the mold of the classic Gottfredson adventures  This reinnasance has been spearheaded by Byron Erickson  David Gerstein  Noel Van Horn  Michael T  Gilbert and Cesar Ferioli  In Europe  Mickey Mouse became the main attraction of a number of comics magazines  the most famous being Topolino in Italy from 1932 on  Le Journal de Mickey in France from 1934 on  Don Miki in Spain and the Greek Miky Maous  Mickey was the main character for the series MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine  published in Italy from 1999 to 2001  In 1958 Mickey Mouse was introduced to the Arab world through another comic book called  Sameer   Mickey Mouse became so popular in Egypt that he got a comic book with his name  the comic is actually an Arabic counterpart of Donald Duck comics but with Mickey s name instead  Mickey s comics in Egypt are licensed by Disney and were published since 1959 by  Dar Al Hilal  and they were a big hit  but unfortunately Dar Al Hilal stopped the publication in 2003 because of problems with Disney  luckily the comics were re released by  Nahdat Masr  in 2004 and the first issues were sold out in less than 8 hours  31  Merchandising A 1933 Ingersoll Mickey Mouse wrist watch Since his early years Mickey Mouse has been licensed by Disney to

Mickey Mouse character is only copyrighted  In fact  the character  like all major Disney characters  is also trademarked  which lasts in perpetuity as long as it continues to be used commercially by its owner  So  whether or not a particular Disney cartoon goes into the public domain  the characters themselves may not be used as trademarks without authorization  However  within the United States  European Union and some other jurisdictions  the Copyright Term Extension Act  sometimes called the  Mickey Mouse Protection Act  because of extensive lobbying by the Disney corporation  and similar legislation has ensured that works such as the early Mickey Mouse cartoons will remain under copyright until at least 2023  However  some copyright scholars argue that Disney s copyright on the

first issue  cartoonist Dan O Neill depicted Mickey and Minnie Mouse engaging in explicit sexual behavior and consuming drugs  As O Neill explained   The air pirates were   some sort of bizarre concept to steal the air  pirate the air  steal the media   Since we were cartoonists  the logical thing was Disney   59  Rather than change the appearance or name of the character  which O Neill felt would dilute the parody  the mouse depicted in Air Pirates Funnies looks like and is named  Mickey Mouse   Disney sued for copyright infringement  and after a series of appeals  O Neill eventually lost and was ordered to pay Disney  1 9 million  The outcome of the case remains controversial amongst free speech advocates  New York Law School professor Edward Samuels said    The Air Pirates  set parody back twenty years   60  Censorship In 1930  The German Board of Film Censors prohibited showing a Mickey Mouse film because they felt the kepi wearing mouse negatively portrayed the Germans and
