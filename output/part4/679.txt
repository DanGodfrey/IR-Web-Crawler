Rapa Nui  Spanish  Isla de Pascua  is a Polynesian island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean  at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian triangle  A special territory of Chile that was annexed in 1888  Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues  called moai  created by the early Rapanui people  It is a World Heritage Site  as determined by UNESCO  with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park  In recent times the island has served as a warning of the cultural and environmental dangers of overexploitation  Ethnographers and archaeologists also blame diseases carried by European colonizers and slave raiding of the 1860s for devastating the local peoples  3  Easter Island is claimed to be the most remote inhabited island in the world  4  Contents 1

the islands in between Orthographic projection centered on Easter Island The name  Easter Island  was given by the island s first recorded European visitor  the Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen  who encountered it on Easter Sunday 1722  while searching for Davis or David s island  Roggeveen named it Paasch Eyland  18th century Dutch for  Easter Island    5  The island s official Spanish name  Isla de Pascua  also means  Easter Island   The current Polynesian name of the island  Rapa Nui   Big Rapa   was coined after the slave raids of the early 1860s  and refers to the island s topographic resemblance to the island of Rapa in the Bass Islands of the Austral Islands group  6  However Thor Heyerdahl argued that Rapa was the original name of Easter Island  and that Rapa Iti was named by refugees from there  7  The phrase Te pito o te henua has been said to be the original name of the island since Alphonse Pinart gave it the romantic translation  the Navel of the World  in his Voyage   l  le de P ques  published in 1877  However  there are two words pronounced pito in Rapa Nui  one meaning  navel  and one  end   and the phrase can thus also mean  land s end   This was apparently its actual meaning  Churchill  1912  inquired about the phrase as was told that there were three te pito o te henua  these being the three capes  land s ends  of the island  He was unable to elicit a Polynesian name for the island itself  and concluded that there may not have been one  8  According to Barthel  1974   oral tradition has it that the island was first named Te pito o te kainga a Hau Maka  The little piece of land of Hau Maka   9  Another name  Mata ki te rangi  means  Eyes looking to the sky   citation needed  Location and physical geography Easter Island is one of the world s most isolated inhabited islands  Its closest inhabited neighbour is Pitcairn Island  2 075 km  1 289 mi  to the west  with fewer than 100 inhabitants  Easter Island s latitude is similar to that of Caldera  Chile  and it lies 3 510 km  2 180 mi  west of continental Chile at its nearest point  between Lota and Lebu in the Biob o Region   Isla Salas y G mez  415 km  258 mi  to the east  is closer but is uninhabited  The island is about 24 6 km  15 3 mi  long by 12 3 km  7 6 mi  at its widest point  its overall shape is triangular  It has an area of 163 6 square kilometres  63 2 sq mi   and a maximum altitude of 507 meters  1 663 ft   There are three Rano  freshwater crater lakes   at Rano Kau  Rano Raraku and Rano Aroi  near the summit of Terevaka  but no permanent streams or rivers  Geology Easter Island is a volcanic high island  consisting mainly of three extinct coalesced volcanoes  Terevaka  altitude 507 metres  forms the bulk of the island  while two other volcanoes  Poike and Rano Kau  form the eastern and southern headlands and give the island its roughly triangular shape  Lesser cones and other volcanic features include the crater Rano Raraku  the cinder cone Puna Pau and many volcanic caves including lava tubes  10  Poike used to be a separate island until volcanic material from Terevaka united it to the larger whole  The island is dominated by hawaiite and basalt flows which are rich in iron and show affinity with igneous rocks found in the Gal pagos Islands  11  Easter Island and surrounding islets such as Motu Nui and Motu Iti form the summit of a large volcanic mountain rising over 2 000 metres  6 600 ft  from the sea bed  The mountain is part of the Sala y G mez Ridge  a  mostly submarine  mountain range with dozens of seamounts  The range begins with Pukao and next Moai  two seamounts to the west of Easter Island  and extends 2 700 km  1 700 mi  east to the Nazca Ridge  12  The ridge was formed by the Nazca Plate floating over the Easter hotspot  13  The movement of Nazca and formerly the Farallon Plate over the hotspot has created a long underwater ridge  the Nazca Ridge  whose eastern end is being subducted under Peru  Only at Easter Island  its surrounding islets and Sala y G mez does the Sala y G mez Ridge form dry land  Pukao  Moai and Easter Island were formed in the last 750 000 years and are the ridge s youngest islands  The most recent eruption was a little over 100 000 years ago  In the first half of the 20th century  steam reportedly came out of the Rano Kau crater wall  This was photographed by the island s manager  Mr Edmunds  14  According to geologists the last volcanic activity on the island occurred 10 000 years ago  An alternative explanation for the islands is the activity of the Easter Fracture Zone  Climate and weather See also  Climate of Chile The climate of Easter Island is subtropical maritime  The lowest temperatures are recorded in July and August  18  C or 64  F  and the highest in February  maximum temperature 28  C or 82  F 15    the summer season in the southern hemisphere  Winters are relatively mild  The rainiest month is April  though the island experiences year round rainfall  16  Easter Island s isolated location exposes it to winds which help to keep the temperature fairly cool  Precipitation averages 1 118 millimetres or 44 inches per year  Occasionally  heavy rainfall and rainstorms strike the island  These occur mostly in the winter months  June August   Since it is close to the South Pacific High and outside the range of the ITCZ  cyclones and hurricanes

the Caribbean Inscription history Inscription 1995  19th Session    Name as inscribed on World Heritage List    Region as classified by UNESCO Main article  History of Easter Island The history of Easter Island is rich and controversial  Its inhabitants have endured famines  epidemics  civil war  slave raids  colonialism  and near deforestation  its population declined precipitously more than once  Ahu Tongariki near Rano Raraku  a 15 moai ahu excavated and restored in the 1990s Estimated dates of initial settlement of Easter Island have ranged from 300 to 1200 CE  approximately coinciding with the arrival of the first settlers in Hawaii  Rectifications in radiocarbon dating have changed almost all of the previously posited early settlement dates in Polynesia  Rapa Nui has more recently been considered to have been settled in the narrower range of 700 to 1100 CE  An ongoing study by archaeologists Terry Hunt and Carl Lipo suggests a still later date   Radiocarbon dates for the earliest stratigraphic layers at Anakena  Easter Island  and analysis of previous radiocarbon dates imply that the island was colonized late  about 1200 CE  Significant ecological impacts and major cultural investments in monumental architecture and statuary thus began soon after initial settlement   19  20  According to oral tradition  the first settlement was at Anakena  Jared Diamond notes that the Caleta Anakena landing point provides the best shelter from prevailing swells  as well as a sandy beach for canoe landings and launchings  so it seems likely to have been an early place of settlement  21  However  this hypothesis contradicts radiocarbon dating  according to which other sites preceded Anakena by many years  especially the Tahai  whose radiocarbon dates precede Anakena s by several centuries  The island was most likely populated by Polynesians who navigated in canoes or catamarans from the Gambier Islands  Mangareva  2 600 km  1 600 mi  away  or the Marquesas Islands  3 200 km  2 000 mi  away  When James Cook visited the island  one of his crew members  a Polynesian from Bora Bora  was able to communicate with the Rapa Nui  The language most similar to Rapa Nui is Mangarevan with an 80  similarity in vocabulary  In 1999  a voyage with reconstructed Polynesian boats was able to reach Easter Island from Mangareva in 19 days  22  According to oral traditions recorded by missionaries in the 1860s  the island originally had a strong class system  with an ariki  high chief  wielding great power over nine other clans and their respective chiefs  The high chief was the eldest descendent through first born lines of the island s legendary founder  Hotu Matu a  The most visible element in the culture was the production of massive statues called moai that represented deified ancestors  It was believed that the living had a symbiotic relationship with the dead where the dead provided everything that the living needed  health  fertility of land and animals  fortune etc   and the living through offerings provided the dead with a better place in the spirit world  Most settlements were located on the coast and moai were erected along the coastline  watching over their descendants in the settlements before them  with their backs toward the spirit world in the sea  Diamond suggested that cannibalism took place on Easter Island after the construction of the Moai contributed to environmental degradation when extreme deforestation destabilized an already precarious ecosystem  23  Archeological record shows that  by the time of the initial settlement  the island was home to many species of trees  including at least three species which grew up to 50 feet or more  Paschalococos   possibly the largest palm trees in the world at the time  Alphitonia zizyphoides  and Elaeocarpus rarotongensis  as well as at least six species of native land birds  Barbara A  West wrote   Sometime before the arrival of Europeans on Easter Island  the Rapanui experienced a tremendous upheaval in their social system brought about by a change in their island s ecology    By the time of European arrival in 1722  the island s population had dropped to 2 000   3 000 from a high of approximately 15 000 just a century earlier    24  By that time  21 species of trees and all species of land birds went extinct through some combination of overharvesting overhunting  rat predation  and climate change  the island was largely deforested  and it did not have any trees more than 10 feet tall  Loss of large trees meant that residents were no longer able to build seaworthy vessels  significantly diminishing their fishing abilities  This was further exacerbated by the loss of land birds and the collapse in seabird populations  By the 18th century  residents of the island were largely sustained by farming  with domestic chickens as the primary source of protein  25  As the island became overpopulated and resources diminished  warriors known as matatoa gained more power and the Ancestor Cult ended  making way for the Bird Man Cult  Beverly Haun wrote   The concept of mana  power  invested in hereditary leaders was recast into the person of the birdman  apparently beginning circa 1540  and coinciding with the final vestiges of the moai period   26  This cult maintained that  although the ancestors still provided for their descendants  the medium through which the living could contact the dead was no longer statues  but human beings chosen through a competition  The god responsible for creating humans  Makemake  played an important role in this process  Katherine Routledge  who systematically collected the island s traditions in her 1919 expedition  27  showed that the competitions for Bird Man  Rapanui  tangata manu  started around 1760  after the arrival of the first Europeans  and ended in 1878  with the construction of the first church by Roman Catholic missionaries who formally arrived in 1864  Petroglyphs representing Bird Men on Easter Island are exactly the same as some in Hawaii  indicating that this concept was probably brought by the original settlers  only the competition itself was unique to Easter Island  European accounts from 1722 and 1770 mention standing statues  but Cook s 1774 expedition noted that several moai were lying face down  having been toppled in war  Motu Nui islet  part of the Birdman Cult ceremony According to Diamond and Heyerdahl s version of the island s history  the huri mo ai  statue toppling  continued into the 1830s as a part of fierce internal wars  By 1838 the only standing moai were on the slopes of Rano Raraku  in Hoa Hakananai a in Orongo  and Ariki Paro in Ahu Te Pito Kura  There is little archaeological evidence of pre European societal collapse  Bone pathology and osteometric data from islanders of that period clearly suggest few fatalities can be attributed directly to violence  28  citation needed  The first recorded European contact with the island was on April 5  Easter Sunday   1722  when Dutch navigator Jacob Roggeveen visited the island for a week and estimated a population of 2 000 to 3 000 inhabitants  The number may have been greater  since some may have been frightened into hiding by a misunderstanding that led Roggeveen s men to fire on the natives  killing more than a dozen and wounding several more  The next foreign visitors  on November 15  1770  were two Spanish ships  San Lorenzo and Santa Rosalia  The Spanish reported the island as largely uncultivated  whose seashore was lined with stone statues  Four years later  in 1774  British explorer James Cook visited Easter Island  he reported that some statues had fallen over  The British ship HMS Blossom arrived in 1825 and reported seeing no standing statues  Easter Island was approached many times during the 19th century  but by then the islanders had become openly hostile to any attempt to land  and very little new information was reported before the 1860s  A series of devastating events killed or removed most of the population in the 1860s  In December 1862  Peruvian slave raiders struck  Violent abductions continued for several months  eventually capturing around 1 500 men and women  half of the island s population  29  Among those captured were the island s paramount chief  his heir  and those who knew how to read and write the rongorongo script  the only Polynesian script to have been found to date  When the slave raiders were forced to repatriate the people they had kidnapped  they disembarked carriers of smallpox together with a few survivors on each of the islands  This created devastating epidemics from Easter Island to the Marquesas islands  Easter Island s population was reduced to the point where some of the dead were not even buried  Tuberculosis  introduced by whalers in the mid 19th century  had already killed several islanders when the first Christian missionary  Eug ne Eyraud  died from this disease in 1867  About a quarter of the island s population succumbed along with him  In the following years  the managers of the sheep ranch and the missionaries started buying the newly available lands of the deceased  and this led to great confrontations between natives and settlers   Queen Mother  Koreto with her daughters  Queen  Caroline and Harriette in 1877 Jean Baptiste Dutrou Bornier bought up all of the island apart from the missionaries  area around Hanga Roa and moved a couple of hundred Rapanui to Tahiti to work for his backers  In 1871 the missionaries  having fallen out with Dutrou Bornier  evacuated all but 171 Rapanui to the Gambier islands  30  Those who remained were mostly older men  Six years later  only 111 people lived on Easter Island  and only 36 of them had any offspring  31  From that point on the island s population slowly recovered  But with over 97  of the population dead or gone in less than a decade  much of the island s cultural knowledge had been lost  Alexander Salmon  Jr   a son of an English Jewish merchant and P mare dynasty princess  eventually worked to repatriate workers from his inherited copra plantation  He eventaully bought up all lands on the island with the exception of the mission  and was its sole employer  He worked to develop tourism on the island  and was the principal informant for the British and German archaeological expeditions for the island  He sent several pieces of genuine Rongorongo to his niece s husband  the German consul in Valpara so  Chile  Salmon sold the Brander Easter Island holdings to the Chilean government in 1888 January 2 and signed as a witness to the cession of the island  He returned to Tahiti in December of that year  He effectively ruled the island from 1878 until his cession to Chile in 1888  Easter Island was annexed by Chile on September 9  1888  by Policarpo Toro  by means of the  Treaty of Annexation of the Island   Tratado de Anexi n de la isla   Toro  then representing the government of Chile signed with Atamu Tekena  designated  King  by the Chilean government after the paramount chief and his heir had died  The validity of this treaty is still contested by some Rapanui  Officially  Chile purchased the nearly all encompassing Mason Brander sheep ranch  comprised from lands purchased from the descendants of Rapanui who died during the epidemics  and then claimed sovereignty over the island  Until the 1960s the surviving Rapanui were confined to Hanga Roa  The rest of the island was rented to the Williamson Balfour Company as a sheep farm until 1953  32  The island was then managed by the Chilean Navy until 1966  at which point the island was reopened in its entirety  In 1966 the Rapanui were given Chilean citizenship  33  21st century On 30 July 2007  a constitutional reform gave Easter Island and the Juan Fern ndez Islands  also known as Robinson Crusoe Island  the status of  special territories  of Chile  Pending the enactment of a special charter  the island continued to be governed as a province of the V Region of Valpara so  34  A total solar eclipse visible from Easter Island occurred for the first time in over 1300 years on July 11  2010  at 18 15 15  35  Indigenous rights movement Starting in August 2010  members of the indigenous Hitorangi clan occupied the Hangaroa Eco Village and Spa  36  The occupiers allege that the hotel was bought from the Pinochet government  in violation of a Chilean agreement with the indigenous Rapa Nui  in the 1990s  37  The occupiers say their ancestors had been cheated into giving up the land  38  According to a BBC report  on December 3  2010  at least 25 people were injured when Chilean police using pellet guns attempted to evict from these buildings a group of Rapa Nui who had claimed that the land the buildings stood on had been illegally taken from their ancestors  39  In January 2011  the UN s Special Rapporteur on Indigenous People  James Anaya  expressed concern about the treatment of the indigenous Rapa Nui by the Chilean government  urging Chile to  make every effort to conduct a dialogue in good faith with representatives of the Rapa Nui people to solve  as soon as possible the real underlying problems that explain the current situation   36  The incident ended in February 2011  when up to 50 armed police broke into the hotel to remove the final five occupiers  They were arrested by the government and no injuries were reported  36  Ecology View of Easter Island from space  2001  The Poike peninsula is on the right  Easter Island  together with its closest neighbor  the tiny island of Isla Sala y G mez 415 kilometers  258 mi  further east  is recognized by ecologists as a distinct ecoregion  the Rapa Nui subtropical broadleaf forests  The original subtropical moist broadleaf forests are now gone  but paleobotanical studies of fossil pollen and tree moulds left by lava flows indicate that the island was formerly forested  with a range of trees  shrubs  ferns  and grasses  A large extinct palm  Paschalococos disperta  related to the Chilean wine palm  Jubaea chilensis   was one of the dominant trees as attested by fossil evidence  Like its Chilean counterpart it probably took close to 100 years to reach adult height  The Polynesian rat  which the original settlers brought with them  played a very important role in the disappearance of the Rapanui palm  Rat teeth marks can be observed in 99  of the nuts found preserved in caves or excavated in different sites  indicating that the Polynesian rat impeded the palm s reproduction  That  and the clearance of the palms to make the settlements  led to their extinction almost 350 years ago  40  The toromiro tree  Sophora toromiro  was prehistorically present on Easter Island  but is now extinct in the wild  However the Royal Botanic Gardens  Kew and the G teborg Botanical Garden are jointly leading a scientific program to reintroduce the toromiro to Easter Island  With the palm and the toromiro virtually gone  there was considerably less rainfall as a result of less condensation  After the island was used to feed thousands of sheep for almost a century  by the mid 1900s the island was mostly covered in grassland with nga atu or bulrush  Schoenoplectus californicus tatora  in the crater lakes of Rano Raraku and Rano Kau  The presence of these reeds  which are called totora in the Andes  was used to support the argument of a South American origin of the statue builders  but pollen analysis of lake sediments shows these reeds have grown on the island for over 30 000 years  citation needed  Before the arrival of humans  Easter Island had vast seabird colonies containing probably over 30 resident species  perhaps the world s richest  41  Such colonies are no longer found on the main island  Fossil evidence indicates five species of landbirds  two rails  two parrots and a heron   all of which have become extinct  42  The immunosuppressant drug sirolimus was first discovered in the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus in a soil sample from Easter Island  The drug is also known as rapamycin  after Rapa Nui  43  It is now being studied for extending longevity in mice  44    The template below  Wide image  is being considered for merging  See templates for discussion to help reach a consensus    Panorama of Anakena beach  Easter Island  The moai pictured here was the first to be raised back into place on its ahu in 1955 by islanders using the ancient method  Trees are sparse  rarely forming natural groves  and it has been argued whether native Easter Islanders deforested the island in the process of erecting their statues  45  and in providing sustenance for an overpopulated island  citation needed Experimental archaeology demonstrated that some statues certainly could have been placed on  Y  shaped wooden frames called miro manga erua and then pulled to their final destinations on ceremonial sites  45  Other theories involve the use of  ladders   parallel wooden rails  over which the statues could have been dragged  46  Rapanui traditions metaphorically refer to spiritual power  mana  as the means by which the moai were  walked  from the quarry  Given the island s southern latitude  the climatic effects of the Little Ice Age  about 1650 to 1850  may have exacerbated deforestation  although this remains speculative  45  Many researchers 47  point to the climatic downtrend caused by the Little Ice Age as a contributing factor to resource stress and to the palm tree s disappearance  Experts  however  do not agree on when exactly the island s palms became extinct  Jared Diamond dismisses past climate change as a dominant cause of the island s deforestation in his book Collapse which assesses the collapse of the ancient Easter Islanders  Influenced by Heyerdahl s romantic interpretation of Easter s history  as he acknowledges in chapter 2 of Collapse   Diamond insists that the disappearance of the island s trees seems to coincide with a decline of its civilization around the 17th and 18th centuries  He notes that they stopped making statues at that time and started destroying the ahu  But the link is weakened because the Bird Man cult continued to thrive and survived the great impact caused by the arrival of explorers  whalers  sandalwood traders  and slave raiders  Midden contents show a sudden drop in quantities of fish and bird bones as the islanders lost the means to construct fishing vessels and the birds lost their nesting sites  Soil erosion because of lack of trees is apparent in some places  Sediment samples document that up to half of the native plants had become extinct and that the vegetation of the island drastically altered  Polynesians were primarily farmers  not fishermen  and their diet consisted mainly of cultivated staples such as taro root  sweet potato  yams  cassava  and bananas  Chickens were more important protein sources than fish  Cannibalism occurred on all Polynesian islands in times of both plenty and famine  Its presence on Easter Island  based on human remains associated with cooking sites  especially in caves  is not definitive evidence for the collapse of civilization  citation needed  View toward the interior of the island Benny Peiser 3  noted evidence of self sufficiency when Europeans first arrived  The island still had smaller trees  mainly toromiro  which became extinct in the 20th century probably because of slow growth and changes in the island s ecosystem  Cornelis Bouman  Jakob Roggeveen s captain  stated in his logbook       of yams  bananas and small coconut palms we saw little and no other trees or crops   According to Carl Friedrich Behrens  Roggeveen s officer   The natives presented palm branches as peace offerings   According to ethnographer Alfred M traux  the most common type of house was called  hare paenga   and is known today as  boat house   because the roof resembled an overturned boat  The foundations of the houses were made of buried basalt slabs with holes for wooden beams to connect with each other throughout the width of the house  These were then covered with a layer of totora reed  followed by a layer of woven sugarcane leaves  and lastly a layer of woven grass  There were reports by European visitors who said they had seen  boles of large palm trees   citation needed  Peiser claims that these reports indicate that large trees existed at that time  which is perhaps contradicted by the Bouman quote above  Plantations were often located further inland  next to foothills  inside open ceiling lava tubes  and in other places protected from the strong salt winds and salt spray affecting areas closer to the coast  It is possible many of the Europeans did not venture inland  The statue quarry  only one kilometre from the coast with an impressive cliff 100 m  330 ft  high  was not explored by Europeans until well into the 19th century  Easter Island has suffered from heavy soil erosion in recent centuries  perhaps aggravated by agriculture and massive deforestation  This process seems to have been gradual and may have been aggravated by sheep farming throughout most of the 20th century  Jakob Roggeveen reported that Easter Island was exceptionally fertile   Fowls are the only animals they keep  They cultivate bananas  sugar cane  and above all sweet potatoes   In 1786 Jean Fran ois de La P rouse visited Easter Island and his gardener declared that  three days  work a year  would be enough to support the population  Rollin  a major in the P rouse expedition  wrote   Instead of meeting with men exhausted by famine    I found  on the contrary  a considerable population  with more beauty and grace than I afterwards met in any other island  and a soil  which  with very little labor  furnished excellent provisions  and in an abundance more than sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants   48  According to Diamond  the oral traditions  the veracity of which has been questioned by Routledge  Lavachery  M traux  Peiser and others  of the current islanders seem obsessed with cannibalism  which he offers as evidence supporting a rapid collapse  For example  he states  to severely insult an enemy one would say   The flesh of your mother sticks between my teeth   This  Diamond asserts  means the food supply of the people ultimately ran out  49  Cannibalism  however  was widespread across Polynesian cultures  50  Human bones have not been found in earth ovens other than those behind the religious platforms  indicating that cannibalism in Easter Island was a ritualistic practice  Contemporary ethnographic research has proven there is scarcely any tangible evidence for widespread cannibalism anywhere and at any time on the Island  51  The first scientific exploration of Easter Island  1914  recorded that the indigenous population strongly rejected allegations that they or their ancestors had been cannibals  27  Culture Birdmen  Tangata manu  paintings in the so called  Cave of the Men Eatresses  Mythology Main article  Rapa Nui mythology The most important myths are  Tangata manu  the Birdman cult which was practiced until the 1860s  Makemake  an important god  Aku aku  the guardians of the sacred family caves  Moai kava kava a ghost man of the Hanau epe  long ears   Hekai ite umu pare haonga takapu Hanau epe kai noruego  the sacred chant to appease the aku aku before entering a family cave  Stone work The Rapa Nui people had a Stone Age civilization and made extensive use of several different types of local stone  Basalt  a hard  dense stone used for toki and at least one of the moai  Obsidian  a volcanic glass with sharp edges used for sharp edged implements such as Mataa and also for the black pupils of the eyes of the moai  Red scoria from Puna Pau  a very light red stone used for the pukao and a few moai  Tuff from Rano Raraku  a much more easily worked rock than basalt  and was used for most of the moai  Moai  statues  Main article  Moai The large stone statues  or moai  for which Easter Island is world famous  were carved from 1100 1680 CE  rectified radio carbon dates   citation needed  A total of 887 monolithic stone statues have been inventoried on the island and in museum collections so far  52  Although often identified as  Easter Island heads   the statues are actually torsos  with most of them ending at the top of the thighs  although a small number of them are complete  with the figures kneeling on bent knees with their hands over their stomachs  53  54  Some upright moai have become buried up to their necks by shifting soils  Almost all  95   moai were carved out of distinctive  compressed  easily worked solidified volcanic ash or tuff found at a single site inside the extinct volcano Rano Raraku  The native islanders who carved them used only stone hand chisels  mainly basalt toki  which lie in place all over the quarry  The stone chisels were sharpened by chipping off a new edge when dulled  The volcanic stone was first wetted to soften it before sculpting began  then again periodically during the process  While many teams worked on different statues at the same time  a single moai took a team of five or six men approximately one year to complete  Each statue represented the deceased head of a lineage  Tukuturi  an unusual bearded kneeling moai Two ahu at Hanga Roa  In foreground Ahu Ko Te Riku  with a pukao on its head   In the mid ground is a side view of an ahu with five moai showing retaining wall  platform  ramp and pavement  Ahu Akivi  one of the few inland ahu  with the only moai facing the ocean Only a quarter of the statues were installed  while nearly half remained in the quarry at Rano Raraku and the rest sat elsewhere  probably on their way to final locations  The largest moai ever raised on a platform is known as  Paro   It weighs 82 tons and 9 8 m  32 15 ft  long  55  Several other statues of similar weight were transported to several ahu on the North and South coasts  It is not yet known how they transported the statues  Possibilities include employing a miro manga erua  a Y shaped sledge with cross pieces  pulled with ropes made from the tough bark of the hau hau tree  56  and tied around the statue s neck  Anywhere from 180 to 250 men were required for pulling  depending on the size of the moai  Some 50 of the statues were re erected in modern times  One of the first was on Ahu Ature Huke in Anakena beach in 1958  It was raised using traditional methods during a Heyerdahl expedition  In 2011  a large Moai statue was excavated from the ground  suggesting that the statues are much older and larger than previously thought  57  Ahu Six of the fifteen moai at Ahu Tongariki Ahu are stone platforms  Varying greatly in layout  many were reworked during or after the huri mo ai or statue toppling era  many became ossuaries  one was dynamited open  and Ahu Tongariki was swept inland by a tsunami  Of the 313 known ahu  125 carried moai usually just one  probably because of the shortness of the moai period and transportation difficulties  Ahu Tongariki  one kilometer from Rano Raraku  had the most and tallest moai  15 in total  Other notable ahu with moai are Ahu Akivi  restored in 1960 by William Mulloy  Nau Nau at Anakena and Tahai  Some moai may have been made from wood and were lost  The classic elements of ahu design are  A retaining rear wall several feet high  usually facing the sea A front wall made of rectangular basalt slabs called paenga A facia made of red scoria that went over the front wall  platforms built after 1300  A sloping ramp in the inland part of the platform  extending outward like wings A pavement of even sized  round water worn stones called poro An alignment of stones before the ramp A paved plaza before the ahu  This was called marae Inside the ahu was a fill of rubble  On top of many ahu would have been  Moai on squareish  pedestals  looking inland  the ramp with the poro before them  Pukao or Hau Hiti Rau on the moai heads  platforms built after 1300   When a ceremony took place   eyes  were placed on the Statues  The whites of the eyes were made of coral  the iris was made of obsidian or red scoria  Ahu evolved from the traditional Polynesian marae  In this context ahu referred to a small structure sometimes covered with a thatched roof where sacred objects  including statues  were stored  The ahu were usually adjacent to the marae or main central court where ceremonies took place  though on Easter Island ahu and moai evolved to much greater size  There the marae is the unpaved plaza before the ahu  The biggest ahu is 220 meters  720 ft  and holds 15 statues  some of which are 9 meters  30 ft  high  The filling of an ahu was sourced locally  apart from broken  old moai  fragments of which have also been used in the fill   58  Individual stones are mostly far smaller than the moai  so less work was needed to transport the raw material  but artificially leveling the terrain for the plaza and filling the ahu was laborious  Ahu are found mostly on the coast  where they are distributed fairly evenly except on the western slopes of Mount Terevaka and the Rano Kau and Poike 59  headlands  These are the three areas with the least low lying coastal land  and apart from Poike the furthest areas from Rano Raraku  One ahu with several moai was recorded on the cliffs at Rano Kau in the 1880s  but had fallen to the beach before the Routledge expedition  27  A Hare Moa  a Chicken House  image cut from a laser scan collected by nonprofit CyArk Stone walls One of the highest quality examples of Easter Island stone masonry is the rear wall of the ahu at Vinapu  Made without mortar by shaping hard basalt rocks of up to seven tons to match each other exactly  it has a superficial similarity to some Inca stone walls in South America  60  Stone houses Two types of houses are known from the past  hare paenga  a house with an elliptical foundation  made with basalt slabs and covered with a thatched roof that resembled an overturned boat  and hare oka  a round stone structure  Related stone structures called Tupa look very similar to the hare oka  except that the Tupa were inhabited by astronomer priests and located near the coast  where the movements of the stars could be easily observed  Settlements also contain hare moa   chicken house    oblong stone structures that were used to house chickens  The houses at the ceremonial village of Orongo are unique in that they are shaped like hare paenga but are made entirely of flat basalt slabs found inside Rano Kao crater  The entrances to all the houses are very low  and entry requires crawling  In early times the people of Rapa Nui reportedly set the dead out to sea in small funerary canoes  as did their Polynesian counterparts in other islands  They later started burying people in secret caves in order to save the bones from desecration by enemies  During the turmoil of the late 18th century  the islanders seem to have started to bury their dead in the space between the belly of a fallen moai and the front wall of the structure  During the time of the epidemics they made mass graves that were semi pyramidal stone structures  Petroglyphs Petroglyphs are pictures carved into rock  and Easter Island has one of the richest collections in all Polynesia  Around 1 000 sites with more than 4 000 petroglyphs are catalogued  Designs and images were carved out of rock for a variety of reasons  to create totems  to mark territory or to memorialize a person or event  There are distinct variations around the island in terms of the frequency of particular themes among petroglyphs  with a concentration of Birdmen at Orongo  Other subjects include sea turtles  Komari  vulvas  and Makemake  the chief god of the Tangata manu or Birdman cult  61  Petroglyphs are also common in the Marquesas islands  Makemake with two birdmen  carved from red scoria Fish petroglyph found near Ahu Tongariki Caves The island and neighboring Motu Nui are riddled with caves  many of which show signs of past human use for planting and as fortifications  including narrowed entrances and crawl spaces with ambush points  Many caves feature in the myths and legends of the Rapa Nui  Sample of rongorongo Rongorongo Main article  Rongorongo Easter Island once had an apparent script called rongorongo  Glyphs include pictographic and geometric shapes  the texts were incised in wood in reverse boustrophedon direction  It was first reported by a French missionary  Eug ne Eyraud  in 1864  At that time  several islanders said they could understand the writing  but according to tradition  only ruling families and priests were ever literate  and none survived the slave raids and subsequent epidemics  Despite numerous attempts  the surviving texts have not been deciphered  and without decipherment it is not certain that they are actually writing  Part of the problem is the small amount that has survived  only two dozen texts  none of which remain on the island  There are also only a couple similarities with the petroglyphs on the island  62  Wood carving Skeletal statuette Atypical tubby statuette Wood was scarce on Easter Island during the 18th and 19th centuries  but a number of highly detailed and distinctive carvings have found their way to the world s museums  Particular forms include  63  Reimiro  a gorget or breast ornament of crescent shape with a head at one or both tips  64  The same design appears on the flag of Rapa Nui  Two Rei Miru at the British Museum are inscribed with Rongorongo  Moko Miro  a man with a lizard head Moai kavakava  grotesque and highly detailed human figures carved from Toromiro pine  representing ancestors  The earlier figures are rare and generally depict a male figure with an emaciated body and a goatee  The figures  ribs and vertebrae are exposed and many examples show carved glyphs on various parts of the body but more specifically  on the top of the head  The female figures  rarer than the males  depict the body as flat and often with the female s hand lying across the body  The figures  although some were quite large  were worn as ornamental pieces around a tribesman s neck  The more figures worn  the more important the man  The figures have a shiny patina developed from constant handling and contact with human skin  citation needed  Ao  a large dancing paddle 21st century culture The Rapanui sponsor an annual festival  the Tapati  held since 1975 around the beginning of February to celebrate Rapanui culture  The islanders also maintain a national football team and three discos in the town of Hanga Roa  Other cultural activities include a musical tradition that combines South American and Polynesian influences and woodcarving  Demography Further information  Europeans in Oceania Polynesian dancing with feather costumes is on the tourist itinerary  2002 census Population at the 2002 census was 3 791  65  60  were Rapanui  Chileans of European or mixed European and Amerindian descent were 39  of the population  and the remaining 1  were Native Americans from mainland Chile  66  Population density on Easter Island is only 23 inhabitants per square kilometre  60  sq mi   Demographic history The 1982 population was 1 936  The increase in population in the last census was partly caused by the arrival of people of European or mixed European and Native American descent from the Chilean mainland  However  most married a Rapanui partner  Around 70  of the population were natives  Estimates of the pre European population range from 7 17 000  Easter Island s all time low of 111 inhabitants was reported in 1877  Out of these 111 Rapanui  only 36 had descendants  but all of today s Rapanui claim descent from those 36  Administration and legal status Hanga Roa town hall Easter Island shares with Juan Fern ndez Islands the sui generis constitutional status of  special territory  of Chile  granted in 2007
