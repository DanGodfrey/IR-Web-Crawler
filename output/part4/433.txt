also referred to as  Rockville    In this fantasy version of the past  dinosaurs  saber toothed tigers  woolly mammoths  and other long extinct animals co exist with cavemen  Like their mid 20th century peers  these cavemen listen to records  live in split level homes  and eat out at restaurants  yet their technology is made entirely from pre industrial materials and largely powered through the use of various animals  For example  the cars are made out of stone  wood  and animal skins  and powered by the passengers  feet  as in the theme song   Through the courtesy of Fred s two feet     edit  Technology Often the  prehistoric  analogue to a modern machine uses an animal  8  For example  when a character takes photographs with an instant camera  inside of the camera box  a bird carves the picture on a stone tablet with its bill  In a running gag  the animal powering such technology would frequently break the fourth wall  look directly into the camera at the audience and offer a mild complaint about their job  Other commonly seen gadgets in the series include a baby woolly mammoth used as a vacuum cleaner  an adult woolly mammoth acting as a shower by spraying water with its trunk  elevators raised and lowered by ropes around brontosauruses  necks   automatic  windows powered by monkeys on the outside  birds acting as  car horns   sounded by the driver pulling on their tails or squeezing their bodies  an  electric  razor made from a clam shell  vibrating from a honey bee inside  a washing machine shown by a pelican with a beakful of soapy water  and a woodpecker whose beak is used to play a gramophone record  In most cases   The Man of a Thousand Voices   Mel Blanc  contributed the animals  gag lines  often lowering his voice one to two full octaves  far below the range he used to voice the character of Barney Rubble  In the case of the Flintstones  cuckoo clocks  which varied from mechanical toys to live birds announcing the time  when the hour approached 12 00  the bird inside the clock  cuckooing  usually just ran out of steam and gave up vocally  physically  or both   edit   Stone age  names The Stone Age setting allowed for gags and word plays involving rocks and minerals  For example  San Antonio becomes  Sand and Stony o   the country to the south of Bedrock s land is called  Mexirock   Travel to  Hollyrock   a parody of Hollywood  usually involves an  airplane  flight   the  plane   in this case  is often shown as a giant pterosaur  with the fuselage strapped to its back  The last names  Flintstone  and  Rubble   as well as other common Bedrock surnames such as  Shale  and  Quartz   are in line with these puns  So are the names of Bedrock s celebrities   Cary Granite   Cary Grant    Stony Curtis   Tony Curtis    Ed

very similar to The Flintstones  The voice of Barney Rubble was provided by voice actor Mel Blanc  though five episodes during the second season  the 1st  2nd  5th  6th  and 9th  employed Hanna Barbera regular Daws Butler while Blanc was incapacitated by a near fatal car accident  Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected  by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc s bedside  It should be noted  however  Blanc s portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident  In the earliest episodes  Blanc had used a much higher pitch  After his recovery from the accident  Blanc used a deeper voice  Additional similarities with The Honeymooners included the fact that Reed based Fred s voice upon Jackie Gleason s interpretation of Ralph Kramden  while Blanc  after a season of using a nasal  high pitched voice for Barney  eventually adopted a style of voice similar to that used by Art Carney in his portrayal of Ed Norton  The first time the Art Carney like voice was used was for a few seconds in  The Prowler   the third episode produced   In a 1986 Playboy interview  Jackie Gleason said Alan Reed had done voice overs for Gleason in his early movies  and he  Gleason  considered suing Hanna Barbera for copying The Honeymooners but decided to let it pass  10  According to Henry Corden  who took over as the voice of Fred Flintstone after Alan Reed died  and was a friend of Gleason s   Jackie s lawyers told him he could probably have The Flintstones pulled right off the air  But they also told him   Do you want to be known as the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air  The guy who took away a show so many kids love  and so many parents love  too   11  Henry Corden handled the voice responsibilities of Fred after Reed s death in 1977  Corden had previously provided Fred s singing voice in The Man Called Flintstone and later on Flintstones children s records  Since 2000  Jeff Bergman  James Arnold Taylor  and Scott Innes  performing Fred and Barney for Toshiba Commercials  have performed the voice of Fred  Since Mel Blanc s death in 1989  Barney has been voiced by both Frank Welker and Kevin Michael Richardson  Various additional character voices were created by Hal Smith  Allan Melvin  Janet Waldo  Daws Butler  and Howard Morris  among others   edit  Voice cast

first two seasons was called  Rise and Shine   a lively instrumental underscore accompanying Fred on his drive home from work  The tune resembled  The Bugs Bunny Overture  This Is It     the theme song of The Bugs Bunny Show  also airing on ABC at the time  and may have been the reason the theme was changed in the third season  12  Starting in Season 3  Episode 3   Barney the Invisible    the opening and closing credits theme was the familiar vocal   Meet the Flintstones   The melody is derived from part of the  B  section of Beethoven s Piano Sonata No  17 Movement 2  composed in 1801 02  13  The  Meet the Flintstones  opening was later added to the first two seasons for syndication  The musical underscores were credited to Hoyt Curtin for the show s first five seasons  Ted Nichols took over in 1965 for the final season  12  During the show s final season   Open Up Your Heart  And Let the Sunshine In    performed by Pebbles and Bamm Bamm  in a clip from that season s first episode  was used as alternate close music  A PRS for Music survey revealed that the  Meet the Flintstones  theme tune was the most recognised children s  TV theme tune amongst UK adults  14   edit  Production history Model of the Flintstones  car at the 2008 New York International Auto Show  The idea of The Flintstones started after Hanna Barbera produced The Huckleberry Hound Show and The Quick Draw McGraw Show  Although these programs were successful they did not have the same wide audience appeal as their previous theatrical cartoon series Tom and Jerry  Tom and Jerry entertained both children and the adults that accompanied them  However since children didn t need their parents supervision to watch television Hanna Barbera s output became labeled  kids only   Barbera and Hanna wanted to recapture the adult audience by creating the most popular form television genre that appealed to both adults and children  the situation comedy  15  Another influence is rooted in Hanna Barbera s tenure at MGM  where they were in a friendly competition with fellow cartoon director Tex Avery  In 1955  Avery directed a cartoon entitled  The First Bad Man   narrated by cowboy legend Tex Ritter   The cartoon concerned the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone age Dallas  Many of the visual jokes pre dated similar ones used by Hanna Barbera in the Flintstones series  many years later  Many students of American animation point to this cartoon as a progenitive seed  along with  The Honeymooners   of the Flintstones  The show imitated and spoofed The Honeymooners  16 William Hanna admitted that  At that time  The Honeymooners was the most popular show on the air  and for my bill  it was the funniest show on the air  The characters  I thought  were terrific  Now  that influenced greatly what we did with The Flintstones     The Honeymooners was there  and we used that as a kind of basis for the concept   citation needed  However  Joseph Barbera disavowed these claims in a separate interview  stating that   I don t remember mentioning The Honeymooners when I sold the show  But if people want to compare The Flintstones to The Honeymooners  then great  It s a total compliment  The Honeymooners was one of the greatest shows ever written   17  Before settling on the stone age Barbera and Hanna experimented with hillbillies  Ancient Rome  Pilgrims  and American Indians as the settings for the two families  18  Originally  the series was to have been titled The Flagstones  and a brief demonstration film was created to sell the idea of a  modern stone age family  to sponsors and the network  19  3 When the series itself was commissioned  the title was changed  possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons  characters in the comic strip Hi and Lois  After spending a brief period in development as The Gladstones  Gladstone being a Los Angeles telephone exchange at the time   20  Hanna Barbera settled upon The Flintstones  Aside from the animation and fantasy setting  the show s scripts and format are typical of 1950s and 1960s American situation comedies  with the usual family issues resolved with a laugh at the end of each episode  as well as the inclusion of a laugh track  During the developmental stages  Hanna Barbera created the Flintstone family consisting of Fred  Wilma  and their son  Fred Jr  However  when the series went into production  the idea of the Flintstones having a child from the start was discarded  with Fred and Wilma starting out as a childless couple  some early Flintstones merchandise  such as a 1961 Little Golden Book  included Fred Jr   before it was decided on his removal  21  Although most Flintstones episodes are stand alone storylines  the series did have a few story arcs  The most notable example was a series of episodes surrounding the birth of Pebbles  Beginning with the episode  The Surprise   aired midway through the third season  1 25 63   in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred  the arc continued through the trials and tribulations leading up to Pebbles  birth in the episode  Dress Rehearsal   2 22 63   and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to the world of parenthood  In Australia  the Nine Network ran a  Name the Flintstones  baby  competition during the  pregnancy  episodes   few Australian viewers were expected to have a USA connection giving them information about past  Flintstone  shows  A postscript to the arc occurred in the third episode of the fourth season  in which the Rubbles  depressed over being unable to have children of their own  making The Flintstones the first animated series in history to address the issue of infertility  though subtly   adopt Bamm Bamm  The 100th episode made  but the 90th to air   Little Bamm Bamm  10 3 63   established how Bamm Bamm was adopted  About nine episodes were made before it  but shown after  which explains why Bamm Bamm would not be seen again until episode 101  Daddies Anonymous  Bamm Bamm was in a teaser on episode 98  Kleptomaniac Pebbles   Another story arc  occurring in the final season  centered on Fred and Barney s dealings with The Great Gazoo  voiced by Harvey Korman   Fred and Wilma advertising Winston Cigarettes during the closing credits  The series was initially aimed at adult audiences  which was reflected in the comedy writing  which  as noted  resembled the average primetime sitcoms of the era  Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from the world of live action  including two of Jackie Gleason s writers  Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka  as well as relative newcomer Joanna Lee  while still using traditional animation story men  like Warren Foster and Tony Benedict   The first two seasons were co sponsored by Winston cigarettes and the characters appeared in several black and white television commercials for Winston  dictated by the custom  at that time  that the star s  of a TV series often  pitched  their sponsor s product in an  integrated commercial  at the end of the episode   22  During the third season  the season in which Pebbles was born   Welch s  grape juice and grape jellies  became the primary sponsor  and the overall tone and writing of the series became more family friendly  Integrated commercials for Welch s products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect  and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch s unique process for making the jelly  compared to the competition  Best Foods  makers of Skippy peanut butter  was the alternate sponsor  The Flintstones was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex  Fred and Wilma  Barney and Betty  sleeping together in one bed  although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds  For comparison  the first live action depiction of this in American TV history was in television s first ever sitcom  1947 s Mary Kay and Johnny  23  The show contained a laugh track  common to most other sitcoms of the period  In the mid 1990s  when Turner Networks remastered the episodes  the original laugh track was removed  Currently  the shows airing on Boomerang and the DVD releases have the original laugh track restored to most episodes  a number of episodes from Seasons 1 and 2 still lack them   Some episodes  however  have a newer laugh track dubbed in  apparently replacing the old one  Because of this practice  the only episode to originally air without a laugh track   Sheriff For a Day  in 1965  now has one  The Flintstones also became the first primetime animated series to last more than two seasons  24  this record wasn t surpassed by another primetime animated TV series until the third season of The Simpsons in 1992  24   edit  Reception The night after The Flintstones premiered  Variety called it  A Pen and Ink Disaster   25  However  the negative reviews were short lived and The Flintstones soon became one of the most popular and well loved shows of all time  In 1961  The Flintstones became the first animated series to be nominated for an Outstanding Comedy Series Primetime Emmy Award  but lost out to The Jack Benny Show  In January 2009  IGN named The Flintstones as the ninth best in its  Top 100 Animated TV Shows   26   edit  Nielsen ratings The show was a top 30 hit for its first three seasons according to ClassicTVHits com 1960 1961   18  24 3

cafeteria The Flintstones in Agia Napa  Cyprus As noted above  for the first two seasons  the series had strong ties to a sponsor  Winston cigarettes  with the characters shown smoking the product during commercial breaks  This approach was not unusual for television at that time  either with tobacco or any other product  In one memorable advertisement  Fred and Barney relaxed while their wives did housework  smoking Winstons and reciting Winston s jingle   Winston tastes good like a cigarette should   30  In 1962  Winston pulled their sponsorship from the show when Wilma became pregnant  citation needed  beginning in the fall of 1963  the main sponsor was Welch s Grape Juice  By no small coincidence  Pebbles  favorite drink was Grape Juice  Welch s advertised their product with animated commercials featuring the cartoon cast and they were often pictured in print ads and on grape juice containers  In the actual scenes of a few episodes  Pebbles is given grape juice as a treat  although  in those scenes  Welch s is not mentioned by name  Miles Laboratories  now part of Bayer Corporation  and their One A Day vitamin brand was the alternate sponsor of the original Flintstones series during its first two seasons  and in the late 1960s  Miles introduced Flintstones Chewable Vitamins  fruit flavored multivitamin tablets for children in the shape of the Flintstones characters  which are sold to this day  31  The characters from the series were used in a 1966 industrial film designed to promote the 1967 beer advertising campaign for Anheuser Busch s Busch Beer  This film was released to the Anheuser Busch distributors  and it was not seen by the general public until years later when bootleg copies began to circulate  32  In 1982 satirist Tom Chalkley  using the alias  Bruce Springstone   did a parody of the intro theme titled  Bedrock Rap Meet the Flintstones   The cover of the album listed  Live at Bedrock   Sounding like Bruce Springsteen  Tom did a talking intro describing himself as a kid  flipping dino burgers  and watching a worker  Fred   coming home to his stone hut  at night shouting  Wilma  I m home honey  Wilma    then launching into a Springsteen esque version of the intro theme from the show  complete with saxophone solo at the end  33  The series spawned the Post Foods brands of Pebbles cereals  Fruity Pebbles and Cocoa Pebbles  and the discontinued Dino Pebbles  later revived as  Marshmallow Mania Pebbles   and then to  Marshmallow Pebbles    In the 1985 documentary feature Bring on the Night  Sting and his band sing  Meet the Flintstones  during a recording session  34   Weird Al  Yankovic paid homage to the Flintstones in his song  Bedrock Anthem   a combined parody of  Under the Bridge  and  Give it Away   both by the Red Hot Chili Peppers  that even featured Flintstones voices and sound effects  It also was rereleased on the soundtrack album of the 1994 live action film  The Screaming Blue Messiahs had a song called  I Wanna Be a Flintstone  on their album Bikini Red  It was later rereleased on the soundtrack album of the 1994 live action film The Flintstones  The Simpsons have referenced The Flintstones in several episodes  In the episode Homer s Night Out  Homer s local convenience store clerk  Apu remarks  You look familiar  sir  Are you on the television or something   to which Homer replies  Sorry buddy  you ve got me confused with Fred Flintstone   35  During the opening credits of the episode Kamp Krusty  the Simpson family arrive home to find the Flintstone family already sitting on their couch  36  The beginning of the episode Marge vs  the Monorail is an homage to the The Flintsones opening sequence  Homer leaves work much in the same way Fred Flinstone does  singing to the tune of The Flintsones theme   Simpson  Homer Simpson   he s the greatest guy in history   from the town of Springfield   he s about to hit a chestnut tree  at which point he screams and crashes his car into a tree  37  In Lady Bouvier s Lover  Homer s boss  Mr  Burns appears at the family s house and says  Why  it s Fred Flintstone  referring to Homer  and his lovely wife  Wilma   Marge  Oh  and this must be little Pebbles   Maggie  Mind if I come in  I brought chocolates   Homer responds by saying  Yabba dabba doo   38  In Rome old and Juli eh  to save on gas  Homer  Flintstones  the car  imitating Fred Flintstone by putting his feet through the car floor and running on the road  yet with much less efficiency  Again  he says  Yabba dabba doo   39  In Little Orphan Millie  Homer sings a song about his wife which contains the line  She s the Wilma to my Fred   40  An episode of BBC sci fi comedy series Red Dwarf sees Lister and the Cat discussing  and agreeing that they find both Wilma and Betty attractive  before realizing that the discussion is pointless     She ll never leave Fred and we know it   In 2008  Warner Bros  Theater Ventures announced that Jeff Marx  Jake Anthony and Marco Pennette would collaborate on a stage musical version of The Flintstones  with the plot putting a contemporary spin on the characters  41  The proposed production stalled during negotiations  Fred Flintstone s exclamation  Yabba Dabba Doo    shouted in the opening credits as well as any time Fred became happy or excited  is widely known and repeated  In the Young Money song BedRock
