Census numbered 1 172 790  3 8  of the country s total population  4  the majority of the population is made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants  After the initial period of French and then British colonization  different waves  or peaks  of immigration and settlement of non aboriginal peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continues today  Elements of Aboriginal  French  British and more recent immigrant customs  languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada and thus a Canadian identity  Canada has also been strongly influenced by that of its linguistic  geographic and economic neighbour  the United States  Canadian independence grew incrementally over the course of many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867  World War I and World War II in particular gave rise to a desire amongst Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship  This was established with the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 that took effect on January 1  1947  Canadians retained their status as British subjects until the new Citizenship Act

Approximately 41  of current Canadians are first or second generation immigrants  7  meaning one out of every five Canadians currently living in Canada was not born in the country  8 Statistics Canada projects that  by 2031  nearly one half of Canadians above the age of 15 will be foreign born or have one foreign born parent  9   edit  Immigration Main article  immigration to Canada The French originally settled New France in present day Quebec  during the early part of the 17th century  10  They also settled the Acadian peninsula alongside a smaller number of other European merchants  who collectively became the Acadians  11  During the 18th and 19th century  immigration westward  to the area known as Rupert s Land  was carried out by French settlers  Coureur des bois  working for the North West Company  and by British  English and Scottish  settlers representing the Hudson s Bay Company  12  This led to the creation of the M tis  an ethnic group of mixed European and First Nations parentage  13  The British conquest of New France was proceeded by small number of Germans and Swedes who settled alongside the Scottish in Port Royal  Nova Scotia  while some Irish immigrated to the Colony of Newfoundland  14  In the wake of the 1775 invasion of Canada by the newly formed Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War  approximately 60 000 United Empire Loyalist fled to British North America  a large portion of whom migrated to New Brunswick  15  After the War of 1812  British  included British army regulars   Scottish and Irish immigration was encouraged throughout Rupert s Land  Upper Canada and Lower Canada  16  Between 1815 and 1850 some 800 000 immigrants came to the colonies of British North America  mainly from the British Isles as part of the great migration of Canada  17  These included some Gaelic speaking Highland Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances to Nova Scotia  18  The Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s significantly increased the pace of Irish immigration to Prince Edward Island and the Province of Canada  with over 35 000 distressed individuals landing in Toronto in 1847 and 1848  19  20  Beginning in late 1850s  Chinese immigrants into the Colony of Vancouver Island and Colony of British Columbia peaked with the onset of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush  21  The Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 eventually placed a head tax on all Chinese immigrants  in hopes of discouraging Chinese immigration after completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway  22  The population of Canada has consistently risen  doubling approximately every 40 years  since the establishment of the Canadian Confederation in 1867  23  From the mid to late 19th century Canada had a policy of assisting immigrants from Europe  including an estimated 100 000 unwanted  Home Children  from Britain  24 Block settlement communities were established throughout western Canada between the late 19th and early 20th centuries  Some were planned and other were spontaneously created by the settlers themselves  25  Canada was now receiving a large amount of European immigrants predominately Italians  Germans  Scandinavians  Dutch and Ukrainians  26    100 000     50 000   99 999   20 000   49 999   10 000   19 999 Legislative restrictions on immigration  such as the Continuous journey regulation and Chinese Immigration Act  that had favoured British and other European immigrants were amended in the 1960s  opening the doors to immigrants from all parts of the world  27  While the 1950s had still seen high levels of immigration by Europeans  by the 1970s immigrants increasingly were Chinese  Indian  Vietnamese  Jamaican and Haitian  28  During the late 1960s and early 1970s  Canada received many American Vietnam War draft dissenters  29  Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s Canada s growing Pacific trade brought with it a large influx of South Asians  that tended to settle in British Columbia  30  In 2009  Canada received 252 179  permanent residents    the top ten source countries were China  29 049   the Philippines  27 277   India  26 122   the United States  9 723   the United Kingdom  9 566   France  7 300   Pakistan  6 214   Iran  6 065   South Korea  5 864   and Morocco  5 222   31  These countries were followed closely by Algeria  4 785   United Arab Emirates  4 640   and Iraq  4 567  with Sri Lanka  Colombia  and Germany each contributing over 4 000 individuals  31  Immigrants of all backgrounds tend to settle in the major urban centres  32  33  The majority of illegal immigrants come from the southern provinces of the People s Republic of China  with Asia as a whole  Eastern Europe  Caribbean  Africa and the Middle East all contributing to the illegal population  34  Estimates of illegal immigrants range between 35 000 and 120 000  35  A 2008 report by the Auditor General of Canada Sheila Fraser  stated that Canada has lost track of approximately 41 000 illegal immigrants whose visas have expired  36   edit  Citizenship Main article  Canadian nationality law Members of the first official Canadian Citizenship ceremony held at the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa  3 January 1947 Canadian citizenship is typically obtained by birth in Canada  birth abroad when at least one parent is a Canadian citizen and was born in Canada  or by adoption abroad by at least one Canadian citizen  37  It can also be granted to a permanent resident who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements  37  Canada established its own nationality law in 1946 with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act  which took effect on January 1  1947  38  The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act  was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 2001 as Bill C 11  which replaced the Immigration Act of 1976 as the primary federal legislation regulating immigration  39  Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship  Canada s naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the Immigration Act of 1910  40  According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada there are three main classifications for immigrants  Family class  closely related persons of Canadian residents   Economic class  admitted on the basis of a point system that account for age  health and labour market skills required for cost effectively inducting the immigrants into Canada s labour market  and Refugee class  those seeking protection by applying to remain in the country by way of the Canadian immigration and refugee law   41  In 2008  there were 65 567 immigrants in the family class  21 860 refugees  and 149 072 economic immigrants amongst the 247 243 total immigrants to the country  7  Canada resettles over one in 10 of the world s refugees 42  and has one of the highest per capita immigration rates in the world  43  The majority of Canadian citizens live in Canada  however  there are approximately 2 800 000 Canadians abroad as of November 1  2009  44  This represents about 7 5  of the total Canadian population  Of those abroad the United States  Hong Kong  the United Kingdom  Taiwan  China  and Lebanon have the largest Canadian diaspora  Canadians in United States are the greatest single expatriate community at over 1 million in 2009  representing 35 8  of all Canadians abroad  45  Under current Canadian law  Canada does not restrict dual citizenship but Passport Canada encourages its citizens to travel abroad on their Canadian passport  so they can access Canadian consular services  46   edit  Ethnic ancestry Main article  Ethnic origins of people in Canada Canada has thirty four ethnic groups with at least one hundred thousand members each  of which eleven have over 1 000 000 people and numerous others are represented in smaller amounts  Note 2  According to the 2006 census  the largest self reported ethnic origin is Canadian  32    Note 3  followed by English  21    French  15 8    Scottish  15 1    Irish  13 9    German  10 2    Italian  4 6    Chinese  4 3    North American Indian  4 0    Note 4 Ukrainian  3 9    and Dutch  Netherlands   3 3    47  In the 2006 census  over five million Canadians identified themselves as a member of a visible minority  Together  they make up 16 2  of the total population  most numerous among these are South Asian  4 0    Black  2 5    and Filipino  1

bicultural identity showing a flag combining symbols of Britain  France and Canada    Title   The next favor   A flag to suit the minority    Canada s culture  like that of most any country in the world  is a product of its language s   religion s   political and legal system s   Being a settler nation  Canada has been shaped by waves of migration that have combined to form a unique blend of art  cuisine  literature  humour and music  49  Today  Canada has a diverse makeup of nationalities and constitutional protection for policies that promote multiculturalism rather than cultural assimilation or a single national myth  50  In Quebec  cultural identity is strong  and many French speaking commentators speak of a Quebec culture as distinguished from English Canadian culture  51  However as a whole Canada is a cultural mosaic a collection of several regional  aboriginal  and ethnic subcultures  52  53  Canadian society is often depicted as being  very progressive  diverse  and multicultural   54  Canadian Government policies such as  publicly funded health care  higher and more progressive taxation  outlawing capital punishment  strong efforts to eliminate poverty  an emphasis on multiculturalism  imposing strict gun control  leniency in regard to drug use and most recently legalizing same sex marriage   are social indicators of how Canada s political and cultural evolution differ from that of the United States  55 American media and entertainment are popular  if not dominant  in English Canada  conversely  many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the United States and worldwide  56  The Government of Canada has also influenced culture with programs  laws and institutions  It has created  crown corporations  to promote Canadian culture through media and has also tried to protect Canadian culture by setting legal minimums on Canadian content  57  Monument to Multiculturalism by Francesco Pirelli in Toronto  Four identical sculptures are located in Buffalo City  Changchun  Sarajevo and Sydney  Canadian culture has historically been influenced by Aboriginal  French and British cultures and traditions  Most of Canada s territory was inhabited and developed later than other European colonies in the Americas  with the result that themes and symbols of pioneers  trappers  and traders were important in the early development of the Canadian identity  58  First Nations played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada  particularly for their role in assisting exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade  59  The British conquest of New France in the mid 1700s brought a large Francophone population under British Imperial rule  creating a need for compromise and accommodation  60  The new British rulers left alone much of the religious  political  and social culture of the French speaking habitants  guaranteeing the right of the Canadiens to practise the Catholic faith and to the use of French civil law  now Quebec law  through the Quebec Act of 1774  61  The Constitution Act of 1867 was designed to meet the growing calls of Canadians for autonomy from British rule  while avoiding the overly strong decentralization that contributed to the Civil War in the United States  62  The compromises made by the Fathers of Confederation set Canadians on a path to bilingualism  and this in turn contributed to an acceptance of diversity that later led to both multiculturalism and the recognition of Aboriginal contributions to Canadian society  63  64  The Canadian Forces and overall civilian participation in the First World War and Second World War helped to foster Canadian nationalism  65  66  67  however in 1917 and 1944 conscription crisis s caused a considerable rift along ethnic lines between Anglophones and Francophones  68  As a result of the First and Second World Wars  the Government of Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority  69  With the gradual loosening of political ties to the United Kingdom and the modernization of Canadian immigration policies  in the 20th century immigrants with African  Caribbean and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture  70  The multiple origins immigration pattern continues today with the arrival of large numbers of immigrants from non British or French backgrounds  71  Multiculturalism in Canada was adopted as the official policy of the government during the premiership of Pierre Elliot Trudeau in the 1970s and 1980s  72  The Canadian government has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration  73  Multiculturalism is administered by the Department of Canadian Heritage and reflected in the law through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act 74  and section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  75  In parts of Canada  especially the major urban areas  multiculturalism itself is the cultural norm and diversity is a force that unites the community  76  77   edit  Religion Main article  Religion in Canada Canada as a nation is religiously diverse  encompassing a wide range of groups  beliefs and customs  78  The preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms references  God   and the monarch carries the title of  Defender of the Faith   79  However Canada has no official religion and support for religious pluralism  Freedom of religion in Canada  is an important part of Canada s political culture  80  81  With Christianity on the decline  having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life  82  it has been recently suggested that Canada has come to enter a post Christian period in a secular state  where the practice of religion has  moved to the margins of public life   with irreligion in Canada on the rise  83  Top self identified religious affiliations as of 2001  84  The 2001 Canadian census reported that 77 1  of Canadians identify as being Christians  of this  Catholics make up the largest group  43 6    85  86  The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada  9 5    followed by the Anglicans  6 8    Baptists  2 4    Lutherans  2    and other Christians  4 4    86  About 16 5  of Canadians declare no religious affiliation  including agnostics  atheists  humanists  and other groups  The remaining 6 3  are affiliated with non Christian religions  the largest of which is Islam  2 0    followed by Judaism  1 1    85  86  Before the arrival of Europeans  First Nations followed a wide array of mostly animistic religions  87  During the colonial period  the French settled along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River  specifically Latin rite Roman Catholics  including a number of Jesuits dedicated to converting Aboriginals  an effort that eventually proved successful  88  The first large Protestant communities were formed in the Maritimes after the British conquest of New France  followed by American Protestant settlers displaced by the American Revolution  89  The late nineteenth century saw the beginning of a large shift in Canadian immigration patterns  Large numbers of Irish and Southern Europeans immigrants were creating new Roman Catholic communities in English Canada  90  The settlement of the west brought significant Eastern Orthodox immigrants from Eastern Europe and Mormon and Pentecostal immigrants from the United States  91  The earliest documentation of Jews in Canada are the 1754 British Army records from the French and Indian War  92  In 1760  General Jeffrey Amherst  1st Baron Amherst attacked and won Montreal for the British  In his regiment there were several Jews  including four among his officer corps  most notably Lieutenant Aaron Hart who is considered the father of Canadian Jewry  92  The Islamic  Sikhism and Buddhism communities although small  are as old as the nation itself  The 1871 Canadian Census  first  Canadian  national census  indicated thirteen Muslims among the populace  93  with approximately 5000 Sikh by 1908  94  The first Canadian mosque was constructed in Edmonton in 1938  when there were approximately 700 Muslims in Canada  95  Buddhism first arrived in Canada when Japanese immigrated during the late 19th century  96  The first Japanese Buddhist temple in Canada was built in Vancouver in 1905  97  The influx of immigrants in the late 20th century with Sri Lankan  Japanese  Indian and Southeast Asian customs  has contributed to the recent expansion of the Sikhism and Buddhist communities  98   edit  Languages Main article  Languages of Canada Approximately 98  of Canadians can speak English and or French  99   English   57 8    English and French  Bilingual    17 4    French   22 1    Sparsely populated area    lt  0 4 persons per km2  A multitude of languages are used by Canadians  with English and French  the official languages  being the mother tongues of 59 7  and 23 2  of the population respectively  99  Approximately twenty percent or over six million people in Canada list a non official language as their mother tongue  100  Some of the most common first languages include  Chinese  3 1    Italian  1 4    German  1 2    Spanish  1 2    Punjabi  1 1    Tagalog  0 9    Tamil  0 8    Gujarati  0 6    101  Less than one percent of Canadians  just over 250 000 individuals  can speak an aboriginal language  About half this number  129 865  reported using an aboriginal language on a daily basis  102  English and French are recognized by the Constitution of Canada as official languages  103  Thus all federal government laws are enacted in both English and French with government services available in both languages  103  Two of Canada s territories give official status to indigenous languages  In Nunavut  Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French  and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government  104  In the Northwest Territories  the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages  Chipewyan  Cree  English  French  Gwich in  Inuinnaqtun  Inuktitut  Inuvialuktun  North Slavey  South Slavey and T  ch   105 Multicultural media offers specialty television channels  newspapers and other publications in many minority languages  that are widely accessible across the county  106  In Canada as elsewhere in the world of European colonization  the frontier of European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place  as cultures using different languages met and interacted  The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade and  in some cases  intermarriage led to the development of hybrid languages  107  Languages like Michif  Chinook Jargon and Bungi creole tended to be highly localized and were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language  108   edit  See also Canada portal Book
