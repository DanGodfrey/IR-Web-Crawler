crossover  short  crossover  is the placement of two or more otherwise discrete fictional characters  settings  or universes into the context of a single story  They can arise from legal agreements between the relevant copyright holders  unauthorized efforts by fans  or even amid common corporate ownership  Crossprogramming is a term used in broadcast programming  Contents 1 Official crossovers

often occur in an official capacity if order for the property rights holders to reap the financial reward of combining two or more popular  established properties  In other cases  the crossover can serve to introduce a new concept that derives from an older one  Crossovers generally occur between properties owned by a single holder  but they can more rarely involve properties from different holders  provided that the inherent legal obstacles can be overcome  They may also involve using characters that have passed into the public domain with those that currently enjoy copyright protection  A crossover story may try to explain its own reason for the crossover  such as  they live next door   one example being the casts from Golden Girls and Empty Nest  or  a dimensional rift brought them together   a common explanation for science fiction properties that have different owners   Some crossovers are not explained at all  Others are absurd or simply impossible within the fictional setting  and have to be ignored by the series  respective continuities  Still others intentionally make the relations between two or more fictional universes confusing  as with The Simpsons and Futurama  where each show is fiction in the other  Others can be from the same company  making it legal  Examples of this are Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts which are both from Square Enix  and CSI NY and Miami   edit  Comics Archie Meets the Punisher  August 1994   The Marvel version  with identical content but a different cover  was titled The Punisher Meets Archie  Cover art by Goldberg  amp  Henry Scarpelli  Crossovers of multiple characters owned by one company or published by one publisher  have been used to set an established continuity  where characters can frequently meet within one setting  This is especially true of comic book publishers  as different characters in various Marvel  DC or Valiant comic books frequently interact with one another since they live in the same  universe   For example  in the Marvel Comics universe  Spider Man has frequent dealings with another Marvel hero  Daredevil  just as in the DC Comics Universe  Batman and Superman frequently collaborate  In comic book terminology  these  guest star  roles are common enough that they are not considered crossovers  A crossover in comic book terms only occurs when a story spans more than one title  This has led to  crossover events   in which major occurrences are shown as affecting  almost  all the stories in the shared universe  The earliest crossover event was Gardner Fox s Zatanna s Search  which took place in Hawkman  4  October November 1964   Detective Comics  336  February 1965   The Atom  19  June July 1965   Green Lantern  42  January 1966   Detective Comics  355  September 1966   and Justice League of America  51  February 1967   This story dealt with Zatanna attempting to reconnect with her father  Zatara  and seeking the aid of Hawkman  Batman  Robin  The Atom  Green Lantern  and Elongated Man along the way  The first major crossover event was spearheaded by the Marvel Editor in Chief at the time  Jim Shooter  As a way to further toy sales he devised the Secret Wars crossover which brought all the major Marvel heroes into a twelve issue mini series to battle a common threat  After the threat was dealt with they all returned to their regular titles  This Secret Wars was hailed as both a critical and commercial success largely because the events of the crossover had lasting effects on the characters  such as the introduction of Spider Man s black suit which would later become the villain Venom   Jim Shooter later perfected his crossover at Valiant Comics with the Unity event  Unity brought all the Valiant characters together to defeat Mothergod but was told within the existing Valiant Comics titles  and two bookend special issues   Readers were not obliged to buy all 18 chapters as the story was coherent when reading just one title  but far more layered when all were read  Like Secret Wars  the Unity crossover had lasting effects on the Valiant universe most notably the introduction of Turok  the birth of Magnus Robot Fighter and the death of a major Valiant hero  The Aliens Versus Predator franchise was a success that continued into many games and two movies and even an Aliens Versus Predator Versus The Terminator  The Simpsons and Futurama had two crossover mini series in which the Futurama characters become trapped in a Simpson comic book and then upon escaping cause characters from The Simpsons  as well as many other literary characters  to be brought into the Futurama universe  this being the only way  according to editor Bill Morrison   in which fictional characters  could  interact with  real  ones   Archie Comics once released a crossover between Sonic the Hedgehog and Sabrina the Teenage Witch  in which Enchantra  an enemy of Sabrina  brought Sonic to Sabrina s hometown from Mobius and brainwashed him into fighting Sabrina herself  The Comic strip Betty Boop and Felix is a crossover with Betty Boop and Felix the Cat  The comic crossovers from Raj Comics are very famous in India  where the super heroes are crossovered due to a common enemy  most of the crossovers has occurred between Nagraj and Super Commando Dhruva however there are crossovers like Kohram where all the heroes in Raj Universe meet to finish Haru an extremely powerful enemy  Also the series  Nagayan   entire series of 8 comics  had crossover of Nagraj and Super Commando Dhruva  In Marvel Transformers Comics there was an issue where Spider Man co operated with the Transformers  In Secret Wars II  a character from a Transformers story makes a cameo  There was also multiple comic series where G I  Joe and Transformers characters met   edit  Webcomics Webcomics creators sometimes produce crossovers  one of the first was a two week sequence between Christopher Baldwin s Bruno and Peter Zale s Helen  Sweetheart of the Internet in 1998  1   edit  Webshows Angry Video Game Nerd  James Rolfe  and Nostalgia Critic  Doug Walker  had a Vs  crossover with each other  Board James  AVGN  makes a cameo in Doug Walker s Kickassia  Most of the reviewers of TGWTG all team up to find A gauntlet in Suburban Knights  edit  Animation Cartoon crossovers are not uncommon  and most of them   like comics or live action TV shows   will often feature characters owned by the same company or network  One example is Cartoon Network s The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door  It features 4 crossovers   Ed  Edd n Eddy  Codename  Kids Next Door  The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy  and one phrase of Scooby Doo  which are all licensed Cartoon Network series The cast of Ben 10  Ultimate Alien and Generator Rex will team up in Ben 10 Generator Rex  Heroes United  Most of the last episodes of the Lilo  amp  Stitch  The Series  a spinoff of the movie of the same name  had crossovers with various other Disney cartoons  including The Proud Family  Kim Possible  Recess and American Dragon Jake Long  although one might count them as mere cameos  as each plotline took place exclusively in Lilo s hometown in Hawaii  The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour trilogy is another example  as Jimmy Neutron and Timmy Turner switch universes  Another crossover is Rugrats Go Wild when the Rugrats are stranded on an island where The Wild Thornberrys were at the time  During the 1970s and 1980s  crossovers were particularly common among the Hanna Barbera properties  Some of the earliest examples happened on The New Scooby Doo Movies  which featured appearances by characters from Harlem Globetrotters  Josie and the Pussycats  Jeannie  Speed Buggy  and Batman and Robin  as well as The Addams Family and a year prior to having their own H B series   Later  the Hanna Barbera Superstars 10 set of  movies  involved several crossovers  including such combinations as The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones  This was taken to an extreme in the 1977 79 series Laff A Lympics  which was essentially a gathering of the most popular H B characters  at that time  for a regular series  Another example of a crossover in the 1980s was the Transformers episode  Only Human  which featured characters from the G I  Joe universe  However  not all crossovers are necessarily composed of characters under common ownership  Two of the most notable cartoon crossovers consisted of characters from different companies  Disney s famous movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit  a landmark in animation  had characters from various companies  most notably Disney and Warner Bros  Daffy Duck and Donald Duck made a simultaneous appearance in one scene  in which the two of them exchanged blows during a piano duet  Later in the movie  Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny were shown parachuting together  to keep things from getting too iffy legally  Mickey and Bugs  lines were written so that each of them said exactly the same number of words in the movie   citation needed  The film also includes cameos of characters from MGM  e g  Droopy   And of course  the end of the movie features all the cartoons from all of the animation companies joining together in song  to be concluded by Porky Pig uttering  or  rather  stuttering  his famous  That s All  Folks   line as Tinker Bell ends the scene with a magical fade out  Another cartoon crossover would occur in 1990  Cartoon All Stars to the Rescue  This cartoon featured popular characters from children s Saturday morning cartoons  banding together to promote an anti drug message  ABC  CBS  Fox  and NBC aired this half hour special one Saturday morning with characters from all their networks  including Huey  Dewey  and Louie  from Disney s DuckTales   Winnie the Pooh  Tigger  Slimer  from The Real Ghostbusters and Extreme Ghostbusters   Michelangelo  from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles   Bugs Bunny  Daffy Duck  Alvin and the Chipmunks  The Smurfs  ALF  from his short lived cartoon spinoff   Garfield  and the trio of Baby Kermit  Baby Piggy  and Baby Gonzo  from Jim Henson s Muppet Babies   Animation companies granted unlimited  royalty free use of their cartoon characters for this project  a feat that has been unequalled before or since then  This cartoon was also introduced by then President George H  W  Bush and Barbara Bush  and would be distributed to schools and video stores free of charge nationwide  Manga artist Leiji Matsumoto has been known to crossoveer the characters of his various stories and characters such as Captain Harlock  Galaxy Express 999  and Queen Millenia  all of which were originally written as separate self contained stories  Harlock and 999 crossovers in the Galaxy Express 999 movies with the exception of two very different versions of Queen Emeraldas in each of the respective anime series  Also in the Maetel Legend  Queen Promethium is revealed to be having been the Yukino Yaoi  protagonist from Queen Millenia  Matsumoto has also created various crossovers with Space Battleship Yamato  an anime on which he served as director  although the rights to Yamato is actually owned by Yoshinobu Nishizaki  Turtles Forever is another example of a crossover  The storyline involves the modern day  2003 cartoon  ninja turtles  the 1980s cartoon turtles and eventually the original Mirage Studios Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle counterparts  The adult parody oriented series Drawn Together features many crossovers  while some are regular cameos  such as Peter and Lois Griffin from Family Guy  others involve a personality twist  such as the homicidal version of Bambi from the eponymous film or the gay version of Elmer Fudd from the Looney Tunes franchise   edit  Video games Main article  Fictional crossovers in video games Bandai made the very first crossover video game featuring Weekly Sh nen Jump Characters called Famicom Jump  Hero Retsuden for the Famicom in 1988  During the same year  Konami released a platform game featuring all Konami characters including  Simon Belmont from Castlevania  amp  Mikey from the Warner Bros  Movie The Goonies Konami Wai Wai World for the Famicom  The King of Fighters  Marvel vs  Capcom  and many other franchises from third party developers such as Capcom and SNK bring these licenses together  The 2 5D fighting game series  Super Smash Bros   brings Nintendo characters together for a massive fight  The third game in the series  Super Smash Bros  Brawl introduces the first non Nintendo characters with the inclusion of Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog  of Konami s Metal Gear series and Sega s Sonic the Hedgehog series respectively  Namco x Capcom  however  is a fighting role playing video game from Monolith Soft featuring characters from the Capcom and Namco universe  Also  the new creation from Koei  Warriors Orochi crosses characters from both the Samurai Warriors series and the Dynasty Warriors series  The Namco developed Soul series  particularly Soulcalibur II  Soulcalibur IV  and Soulcalibur Legends feature characters from outside of Namco s titles  Link from Nintendo s The Legend of Zelda series  Necrid  Heihachi Mishima from Tekken  and Todd McFarlane s Spawn   the Star Wars  Darth Vader  Yoda  and Starkiller   and Lloyd Irving  from Tales of Symphonia   universe respectively  Mario  amp  Sonic at the Olympic Games  released in Japan two months before Super Smash Bros  Brawl  was the first time that Mario and Sonic  as well as their associated characters  appeared in a game together  In the RPG field  Kingdom Hearts mixes Disney and Final Fantasy characters together  Also  Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon join forces in Crash Bandicoot Purple  Ripto s Rampage and Spyro Orange  The Cortex Conspiracy  The two characters have continued to make slight cameos in each other s games since  In 1993  a video game was released based on the RoboCop versus The Terminator comic book  While the Super Nintendo version used the style of the comic  the Sega Genesis version utilized a darker style  closer to that of the respective movies  Super Robot Wars are turn based strategy games featuring a variety of Japanese mecha series from many generations  such as Mazinger Z  Gundam  Neon Genesis Evangelion  and GaoGaiGar  Wario Blast  Featuring Bomberman  features Wario of Nintendo fame  and Bomberman of Hudson fame  battling against each other  Nicktoons Unite  is a video game similar to the Jimmy Timmy Power Hour  but the shows SpongeBob SquarePants and Danny Phantom are included in the crossover  There is also Mortal Kombat vs  DC Universe  which features many famous characters from both sides like Liu Kang and Sub Zero for the Mortal Kombat side  and characters like Batman and Superman for the DC side  The story explains the merging of the two worlds and the struggle from both sides to overcome the other one  however the game is not considered canon for both companies  More recently  there has been a collaboration between Capcom and Namco  which will result in the upcoming Street Fighter X Tekken and Tekken X Street Fighter  Crave recently made a game called Cartoon Network  Punch Time Explosion where the most popular Cartoon Network characters came together to brawl   edit  Literature In literature  certain authors also engage in crossovers by including characters from different novels they have written in one particular volume  L  Frank Baum did this regularly  and Michael Moorcock frequently uses this device   particularly in his Eternal Champion sequence of novels  which establish a vast  multiverse  populated by numerous different characters  many of whom appear in different novels and even different genres  Kim Newman is another author who frequently uses this device  The works of James Branch Cabell  William Faulkner  Margaret Laurence  Kurt Vonnegut  Mordecai Richler  Edgar Rice Burroughs and Isaac Asimov also  crossover  with each other  linking different characters and settings together over a number of different works  Brazilian writer Monteiro Lobato also created solid and imaginative crossovers  using elements and characters from Brazilian folklore such as the Cuca and Saci  from Greek Mythology such as Heracles  from the Arabian Nights  from Fairy Tales such as Grimm s Snow White  western literature such as Peter Pan  silent movies such as Popeye and Felix the Cat  cartoons  and western films actor Tom Mix  Other examples include many characters from seemingly unrelated works  which are set into a fictional reality of an actual location  Two examples include Irvine Welsh and Bret Eaton Ellis  whose main characters in their most noted works  American Psycho  Ellis  and Trainspotting  Welsh  appear in several other works  One is noted in the film The Rules of Attraction when Sean Bateman answers the phone and asks  Patrick   who in Ellis  universe is Patrick Bateman  protagonist of American Psycho  Sean is in that book but not in the movie  Robert A  Heinlein also made use of this approach  with several of his last works of fiction bringing together key characters that had recurred in various of his previously disjointed timelines  Robert B  Parker has done this as well  with his series Spenser  For Hire  Jesse Stone and Sunny Randall characters making occasional cameo appearances in one anothers  series   edit  Public domain It is also common for authors to  crossover  characters who have passed into the public domain  and thus do not require copyright or royalty payments for their use into their works  a prominent example of this occurs in Loren D  Estleman s novel Sherlock Holmes vs  Dracula  in which Sherlock Holmes and Dracula are brought together and pitted against each other  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen by Alan Moore and Kevin O Neill is another example of this  as all of the main characters and most of the secondary   background characters are fictional characters whose copyright has expired  and all are characters of different authors and creators brought together within one massive extended universe  Many of the works of Philip Jos  Farmer s Wold Newton family sequences  which has also been explored and developed by other authors  also utilize and interweave numerous otherwise unrelated fictional characters into a rich family history by speculating familial connections between them  such as a blood relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Tarzan   Roger Zelazny s novel A Night in the Lonesome October cross overs Sherlock Holmes  Doctor Frankenstein  Jack the Ripper and the Cthulhu Mythos  although he never specifically identifies them as such   The Count    The Good Doctor    Jack   etc    Occasionally  authors will include into crossovers classic fictional characters whose copyright is still held by the original authors  or at least their estates   but who are nevertheless considered iconic or  mythic  enough to be recognised from a few character traits or descriptions without being directly named  thus not requiring royalties payments to be made to the copyright holder   A prominent example occurs within the first volume of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  wherein a character who is clearly intended in appearance and description by other characters to be Dr  Fu Manchu appears as a significant villain  however  as this character was not in the public domain at the time of writing and the rights still held by the estate of his creator Sax Rohmer  he is not directly named as such in the work and is only referred to as  the Devil Doctor    edit  Television series  edit  Crossovers between established shows This section may contain excessive  poor or irrelevant examples  You can improve the article by adding more descriptive text and removing less pertinent examples  See Wikipedia s guide to writing better articles for further suggestions   February 2012  This section may require copy editing for grammar  style  cohesion  tone  or spelling  You can assist by editing it   February 2012  Crossovers involving principals can also occur when the characters have no prior relationship  but are related by time period  locale or profession  Such crossovers were characteristic of early Warner Bros  western television programs  Perhaps the biggest such crossover was seen in the episode  Hadley s Hunters  from the fourth season of Maverick  It featured the lead characters of Cheyenne  Bronco  Lawman and Sugarfoot  along with signature props from Colt  45 and even the non Warner s western Wanted  Dead or Alive  2  3  While seeing so many crossovers in one episode is rare today  the Law and Order franchise rivals the old ABC Warner s westerns in terms of frequency  Like them  the Law and Order series afford a commonality of setting which lends itself to crossovers  Though most common on shows of the same production company  they have also occurred because shows share the same distributor or television network  A good example of this kind of link is that between Murder  She Wrote and Magnum  P I  These shows were made by different companies  but owned by Universal Studios and broadcast on CBS  Another case is that of Mad About You and Friends  which are conjoined by the character of Ursula Buffay  Neither show shares any production or distribution commonality whatsoever  but  rather  an actress  Lisa Kudrow   a setting  New York City  and a schedule  Friends initially followed Mad About You on NBC s Thursday night schedule   On the show Mad About You  there is also an episode in which there is an appearance by the character Cosmo Kramer  from the sitcom Seinfeld  On The King of Queens  characters from Everybody Loves Raymond appear occasionally in cameos with Doug and the rest of the cast  Mad About You and Friends share another type of  network crossover   On rare occasions  networks have chosen to theme an entire night s programming around a crossover  event   In this case  a New York City blackout caused by Paul Reiser s character on Mad About You was experienced by the characters on Friends and  although it could have merely been a blackout in a different fictional universe  apparently Madman of the People  4  But event nights can also be linked by a single character s quest across multiple shows on the same evening  ABC attempted this kind of  event night  crossover with its Friday night programming during the 1997 season  There  they proposed that the title character of Sabrina the Teenage Witch should chase her cat  Salem  through Boy Meets World  You Wish and Teen Angel because it had run away with a  time ball  that was displacing each show through time  5  Another ABC crossover was featured on a Saturday morning cartoon it featured none of the characters from any of the series featured in the Disney s One Saturday Morning block  but a common  villain  named S T U A R T  appeared on Doug  Recess and Pepper Ann  Sometimes the crossovers between adjoining shows can be even more subtle says who   than these examples  such as when characters at the end of an episode of Spin City decided to watch a broadcast of a fictional sports telecast  Sports Night  which led immediately into an episode of the sitcom of the same name  In 1991  NBC did two crossover events with The Golden Girls  Empty Nest and Nurses that respectively had a hurricane and a full moon affect the characters of all three shows  These crossovers were possible since they aired on the same night and were from the same producer   Susan Harris  Some crossovers involve when one character interacts with another character from different shows  For example in an episode of George Lopez   George Gets Cross over Freddie   George thinks that his son Max is having an online conversation with a pedophile when it really is Zoey  from the sitcom Freddie  who is Freddie niece  Later on in the show  George and Ernie invite the pedophile  who is really Freddie and Chris  to Los Angeles to pick a fight with them  but end when Freddie and George show pictures of their families and make up  A week after this episode aired  George  Ernie  and Max are invited to Chicago by Freddie to meet his family in the episode  Freddie Gets Cross over George   On other occasions  crossovers between established shows can occur without a network or production commonality  but simply because there is some narrative rationale for the crossover  The appearance of detective John Munch  from NBC s Homicide  Life on the Street  on Fox s The X Files happened merely because the episode revolved around a crime scene in Baltimore  a logical place for characters on The X Files to have encountered Munch  Munch would also appear on the TV series Law  amp  Order on NBC in which it had one episode which began on that series in New York City and concluded in Baltimore on Homicide  Life on the Street  Later  when Homicide went off the air in 1999  Detective Munch ends up leaving Baltimore to move to New York  and becoming a permanent character  as New York City Detective Munch  on NBC s Law  amp  Order  Special Victims Unit  Crossing Jordan was set in the same fictional universe as fellow NBC series Las Vegas  in the season two episode  What Happens in Vegas Dies in Boston   a case takes Jordan and Woody  Jerry O Connell  to Las Vegas  where Woody got very well acquainted with the Montecito Casino s host Sam Marquez  Vanessa Marcil   and the long distance relationship lasted for a while  O Connell appeared in five episodes of Las Vegas  while Marcil appeared as Sam in two Crossing Jordan episodes  A two part crossover episode between CSI  Crime Scene Investigation with Without a Trace aired on November 8  2007  The first hour was on CSI and the second hour was on Without a Trace  6  While both series are on the same network in the United States  spreading two parts of a story across two different shows can cause problems in international markets where they have been separately sold to different broadcasters  For example  in the United Kingdom  Without a Trace was shown on Channel 4 and CSI on Channel 5  meaning the two companies had to come to a special agreement to show both episodes  6  Likewise  CSI  Crime Scene Investigation had a two way crossover with the show Two and a Half Men in the episodes  Fish in a Drawer  of Two and a Half Men  broadcast on May 5  2008  and  Two and a Half Deaths  of CSI  which aired three days later  7  Another CSI crossover occurred in 2009 when Raymond Langston from CSI  Crime Scene Investigation appeared both in CSI  Miami 8  and CSI  NY  9  traveling to Miami and New York to track a human trafficking and organ harvesting ring  also CSI  NY made a crossover with Cold Case in which Stella became suspect of a murder in Philadelphia  ER had a crossover with Third Watch which involved a series high for the latter show   17 2 million viewers  10  In some cases  there have been crossover episodes which take place before their series had debuted  One example can be found in the Singaporean sitcom Living with Lydia  where the titular character  played by Lydia Shum  recalls coming to Singapore in 1979 to be a  Singapore Girl   But thanks to a mistake at a nightclub  she hooks up with a gigolo who would later become another popular television character with a series that would bear its name  Phua Chu Kang  who she later turns down  At the end of the episode both meet again in the present day  acknowledging their brief encounter  Crossovers are not entirely common in children s television  however there have been a few crossovers involving series of this genre  Disney Channel s Suite Life franchise has featured three crossovers  in 2007   That s So Suite Life of Hannah Montana  featured characters from Hannah Montana and That s So Raven taking a vacation at the Tipton Hotel  the main setting of The Suite Life of Zack  amp  Cody   Hannah Montana Miley Stewart  Miley Cyrus  also eats cake off of Zack  so that s how she remembers Zack and Cody in the 2009 crossover episode  Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana   in which characters from Wizards of Waverly Place and Hannah Montana come on aboard the S S  Tipton  Characters from The Suite Life on Deck also appear in a crossover with fellow Disney sitcom I m in the Band  an unusual crossover given the two series air on different networks  The Suite Life series on Disney Channel  and I m in the Band on Disney XD  in the 2010 episode  Weasels on Deck    Wizards On Deck with Hannah Montana   which premiered on July 17  2009 on Disney Channel  was viewed by more than 9 3 million viewers  becoming the number one program of the night across both cable and broadcast television  and ranks as one of the highest rated episodes for a Disney Channel original series  Characters from Shake It Up  appear in a crossover with fellow Disney sitcom Good Luck Charlie in the 2011 episode  Charlie Shakes It Up    which premiered on June 5  2011  Another type of crossover occurred in a 2010 episode of the Nickelodeon sitcom iCarly  the episode  iStart a Fan War  featured recurring characters from two Nickelodeon series  Drake  amp  Josh characters Eric Blonowitz  Craig Ramirez and Gavin Mitchell  played by Scott Halberstadt  Alec Medlock and series staff writer Jake Farrow  respectively  and Zoey 101 character Stacey Dillsen  played by Abby Wilde   this was possible because all three series were created by the same producer  Dan Schneider  although Drake  amp  Josh and Zoey 101 both ended their runs within a year of iCarly s 2007 debut   this episode however retcons the episode  iGet Pranky   both episodes aired during the show s fourth season  that establishes that Drake  amp  Josh exists as a television series in the iCarly universe  And on June 11  2011  the two of Dan Schenider s shows iCarly and Victorious came together in  iParty with Victorious   The first crossover in the history of the FOX Animation Domination lineup occurred in 2011 when an event known as Night of the Hurricane depicted a storm going through The Cleveland Show  Family Guy and American Dad   all created by Seth MacFarlane  After the storm has passed  Stan Smith  Cleveland Brown and Peter Griffin face each other in a standoff once their houses wind up in the same place   edit  Special usages  edit  Promotional cameos Crossovers can take the form of a promotional cameo appearance  used to draw attention to another work of fiction  with little rational explanation in the context of the hosting show s narrative  When not clearly presented as parody  this is frequently scorned by fans as blatant commercialism  A notable example of this is The Simpsons episode A Star Is Burns  in which the character of Jay Sherman  from The Critic  appeared  This episode was largely condemned by fans of The Simpsons as existing to promote The Critic  Even Simpsons creator Matt Groening objected  preferring to remove his name from the credits of that particular episode in protest  11  In 2010  as a nod to the 50th anniversary of Coronation Street  characters in fellow established TV soap Eastenders made reference to watching the special anniversary episode  which celebrated its 25th Anniversary earlier on in the year   12   edit  Spin offs See also  List of television spin offs In its simplest and most common form  a television crossover involves a starring character on a parent show appearing on a spin off or vice versa because of established character relationships  An obvious example of this type of crossover occurred when Cliff Huxtable of The Cosby Show visited his daughter  Denise  on A Different World  Another example of this is the appearances made by Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters to Angel in Los Angeles from Sunnydale  Sometimes  spin off crossovers do not involve principals  but rather supporting cast members  For instance  the main link between Green Acres  Petticoat Junction and The Beverly Hillbillies is Sam Drucker  Depending on the complexity of the franchise  though  the crossover can be even more indirect  serving to suggest the size of the fictional world  This crossover is common in the Star Trek universe  where minor guest stars from one series have appeared as featured guest stars later ones  A good example of this crossover is that of the Klingons Kor  from the Original Series episode  Errand of Mercy    Koloth  from  The Trouble with Tribbles   and Kang  from  Day of the Dove    After the passage of about a century of narrative time  the three onetime adversaries of Captain Kirk appeared together in the Star Trek  Deep Space Nine episode   Blood Oath    as the Klingons and Federation had become allies in the century between  the former villains are now portrayed as heroes  Another Klingon  Arne Darvin  appeared as a secondary character in  The Trouble with Tribbles   but was the principal villain of DS9 s  Trials and Tribble ations   Intended as a celebration of the franchise s 30th anniversary   Trials and Tribble ations  was actually a crossover in and of itself  using then brand new bluescreen techniques  the episode places the DS9 cast  after hijacking the Defiant  Darvin had gone back in time hoping to kill Kirk and become a hero to the Klingons  and it s up to Sisko  amp  Co  to stop him and preserve the timeline  inside the TOS episode  interacting with Kirk  Spock and the rest of the Enterprise crew  One of the more dramatic examples of a crossover occurred in the two part season four finale of the revived science fiction series Doctor Who  Earlier characters Jack Harkness and Sarah Jane Smith returned to guest star in the episodes  The Stolen Earth  and  Journey s End   accompanied by several characters from their respective series  Gwen Cooper and Ianto Jones from Torchwood  and Luke Smith and the Xylok computer  Mr  Smith  from The Sarah Jane Adventures   A similar thing happened in The Sarah Jane Adventures episodes when the Tenth Doctor appears in Series 3 and the Eleventh Doctor in Series 4  Star Trek affords an easy understanding of yet another kind of spin off crossover  that of crossover by implication  By making the various ships and devices to be of roughly the same visual design  the implication is that all of series take place in the same universe  This kind of crossover occurs in other shows when shared characters are mentioned but do not actually appear  as when Michael Stivic was referenced on Gloria  This type of crossover is also common with Tokusatsu shows from Japan  One of the most common crossovers stars characters from programs under the banner of Super Sentai  Each year  the current Sentai team meets up with the Sentai team that came before them and unite between a common villain  such as Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger vs  Abaranger  During an Anniversary year  Sentai warriors from various teams come together to help the current team  such as GoGo Sentai Boukenger vs  Super Sentai  These adventures are produced under V Cinema  direct to video  These team ups are not limited to Super Sentai  The multiple series of Kamen Rider and Ultraman have instances of current and past heroes meeting with each other  Several of these times occur in theatrical films  such as Kamen Rider Decade  All Riders vs  Dai Shocker and Superior Ultraman 8 Brothers  Rarely  these heroes will crossover with each other  like in Ultraman vs  Kamen Rider and a recent team up between Kamen Rider Decade and Samurai Sentai Shinkenger  This also led to crossovers in its American counterpart  Power Rangers  The distinction between  spin off  and  crossover  is sometimes narrow  The two terms can become especially conflated if two shows are linked by a guest star with a single appearance  There is debate  for instance over whether Out of the Blue is a spin off of Happy Days  or whether the star of Out of the Blue merely crossed over into Happy Days   edit  Parodic crossovers Often  the problems of bringing together two shows with different narrative ambitions make the writing of a crossover burdensome  Such difficulties are encountered by situation comedies that wish to crossover with dramatic television programmes  The satirical crossover ranging in length from a cameo to a full comedy sketch or episode is an extremely popular way of circumventing this problem  By various means  such crossovers typically avoid outcry from fans by being obvious parody or homage  However  on rare occasion  the humor of such crossovers can be used by one show make a narrative point by capitalizing on the audience s experience of the other programme  Such tongue in cheek crossovers typically fall into one of several broad categories  Parodic crossovers can be directly established as being outside of the continuity of one or all of the properties being crossed over  A good example is the crossover between The Simpsons and The X Files  which was largely accepted as being outside of standard X Files continuity  One episode of The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy shows that after Mandy smiles Mandy  Billy and Grim are transformed into The Powerpuff Girls with a cameo by Professor Utonium  They can occur by virtue of a dream sequence  in which the characters of one show will appear as part of a dream had by a character on another show  This method was perhaps used most famously to explain to audiences that the entirety of Newhart had been the dream of Bob Newhart s character on The Bob Newhart Show  It has more recently been used to demonstrate that cast members of The Young And The Restless appeared in a dream of a character onThe King of Queens  Parodic crossovers can take the form of  gag  cameos by characters of one property appearing on another  Characters from King of the Hill have appeared on The Simpsons to comment on a peewee football game  Gag cameos may also include the appearance of an actor from another show  but not necessarily the character that the actor played  For instance  on the ABC CBS show Family Matters during the closing credits of the episode  Scenes From a Mall   Season 5  Episode 12   a scene which was shown earlier in the episode featuring Reginald VelJohnson is re played  but this time with one of the child actors stating that he  looks like that fat guy from Fresh Prince   referring to James Avery who played Judge Phillip Banks on NBC s The Fresh Prince of Bel Air  To the obvious surprise of the studio audience and VelJohnson  Avery walked onto the set with an angry look  being in on the staged joke himself  Ended the episode  but with the cameras filming still   VelJohnson and Avery hugged and smiling they greeted to the public  Crossovers of this type can also be completely wordless  This type of crossover is more common on animated programmes  such as when Bender found and ate Bart Simpson s shorts on Futurama  or Milhouse had a talking Bender doll on The Simpsons  This would seem to be another case when a popular franchise is acknowledged as fiction and not a crossover of the stories  Perhaps the most obvious parodic crossover is found when characters from two series interact outside of either series  This occurs most commonly on a sketch comedy show or as a humorous interlude on an award telecast  Such crossovers may sometimes involve the real actors   for example  a sketch on Royal Canadian Air Farce saw Yasir and Sarah from Little Mosque on the Prairie buying the gas station from Corner Gas  with all characters in the sketch being portrayed by the shows  real actors   although they may also feature one genuine star from the show amid a cast comprised otherwise of the sketch show s own stable of actors  Such crossovers are generally immediately apparent as parodies to the audience   and in no way considered a part of either show s continuity   due to the need for the hosting show to approximate the sets and costumes of the satirized programmes quickly and inexpensively  When Patrick Stewart appeared in a Star Trek  The Next Generation The Love Boat crossover on Saturday Night Live  for instance  few Star Trek fans would have been fooled by the visual design into believing the event  counted  as an episode of their show  However  there are some cases of this type of parody having some canonical resonance with viewers  For instance  the British charity appeal  Comic Relief often contains parodic crossovers of a technically higher quality than the normal sketch show  Many of these Relief sketches are produced by the cast and crew of the actual programmes being parodied  and hence appear to be  normal  episodes  A good example of this is the sketch   BallyKissDibley   an 11 minute piece in which the leads of Ballykissangel appeared on the sets of The Vicar of Dibley  alongside most of Dibley s cast  Since the sketch derived its humor from all actors remaining in character  the extent to which these parodies  count  as part of either show s canon is more open to interpretation than most sketch crossovers  Parodic crossovers can be used to lend verisimilitude to the fictional world of a programme  Characters from a fictional television series may appear on a stylized version of an established non fictional television series  such as game shows or reality shows  These crossovers between celebrity hosts and fictional characters are quite common on situation comedies  Mama s Family once appeared on Family Feud and the townsfolk of The Vicar of Dibley have had their heirlooms valuated on Antiques Roadshow  for instance  In such cases  it is generally the non fictional show which ends up being the most satirized  due to a need to compress the experience to its most recognizable elements  However  these crossovers can happen on dramatic television  such as when Blue Peter provided narrative exposition on The Sarah Jane Adventures  Rarely  brief crossovers between two fictional programmes can be used for this same purpose  In the episode  Army of Ghosts  Peggy Mitchell was seen in a fictionalized scene from EastEnders in order to demonstrate the degree to which the titular ghosts had permeated the popular culture of Doctor Who s Britain  Here  too  time constraints caused the satire of the guest programme  EastEnders  and not the host programme  Doctor Who   Star Wrek is a comedy crossover between Star Trek and Babylon 5  Steve Urkel from Family Matters appeared on the episode  Stephanie Gets Framed  on the sitcom Full House   edit  Retroactive crossovers Sometimes  crossovers occur even when there was no explicit intent to create them  Viewer interpretation can play into the size and complexity of crossovers  These sorts of crossovers involve no creation of additional material  but merely result from inferences drawn about existing filmed episodes  Usually they are a product of narrative ambiguity  Perhaps the best example of this was caused by the unusual ending to St  Elsewhere  One interpretation of the ending scene of the final episode has been that the entire run of the program was a figment of autistic character  Tommy Westphall s imagination  This leads itself to a broad interpretation of the events of that series  Because the show had direct crossovers with twelve different programmes  and each one of these twelve had numerous other crossovers  linkages can be found from Elsewhere to 280 other shows  comprising what has been called  the Tommyverse   13   edit  Unofficial crossovers In contrast with legal crossovers  unofficial crossovers are created solely because of the artistic pleasure derived by its producers  Generally  unofficial crossovers take the form of fan written fiction and fan art  but it is increasingly prevalent in amateur films and audio  Whereas official crossovers are frequently stymied by such concerns as copyright  royalties payments  quality of writing and ownership of the characters  unofficial crossovers are unfettered by such concerns  so long as property holders do not exercise their right to enjoin the distribution of such material  A good example would be the unauthorised live action fan film Batman  Dead End  which brings together the properties of Batman  Alien and Predator in one setting  In the film I Am Legend  a billboard can be seen in Times Square depicting a crossover film of Batman and Superman  with a release date of May 15  2010  Unofficial crossovers can also occur in a  what if  scenario  The most notable is an episode of Family Guy entitled  Lois Kills Stewie  which turned out to be a simulation along with the previous episode  Stewie Kills Lois   Stewie Griffin is confronted by Stan Smith and Avery Bullock from American Dad  while hacking into the central power grid at the CIA in a latest plan for world domination  Stewie mistakes Stan for Joe Swanson  due to notable similarities between the two shows  Stewie threatens to turn off all the electricity in the world until Stan and Bullock fulfill his demands of being  President of the World   which they do  Even though this never really happened  this is considered by some to mark the first official appearance of American Dad  characters in a Family Guy episode  Roger makes frequent cameo appearances in Family Guy  while Brian makes cameos on American Dad   Roger  Rallo Tubbs  and Klaus Heissler were seen in the final Family Guy Star Wars spoof   It s A Trap    as an Imperial Officer  Nien Nunb  and Admiral Ackbar  respectively  Stewie also appears as an interactive hallucination of Booth on Bones when the agent has issues over possibly becoming a sperm donor  Sherlock Holmes s War of the Worlds introduces the famous detective to the scene of London occupied by Martian invaders  depicted by H  G  Wells   the crossover facilitated by the fact that both works  set in late Victorian London  are now in the public domain and can be freely used and modified  Fan fiction crossovers between different science fiction movies and series are often created  such as Star Wars vs  Star Trek or Babylon 5 vs  Stargate  M U G E N  is a fighting game engine that features many fan created and fictional characters and stages from various television series  movies  as well as other video games   edit  See also
