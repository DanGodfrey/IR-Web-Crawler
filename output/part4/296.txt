series to have an ever shifting cast  However  his motivation changed when he realized how popular the original cast was with audiences  therefore  he brought back most of the first season cast for the second season  with a few additions who received star billing  14  In its first season  the show features an ensemble cast of twelve main characters making it the third largest cast in American primetime television behind Desperate Housewives and Lost  Although NBC s first season cast page listed only ten characters  15 Leonard Roberts  who first appeared in the series  fifth episode as D  L

comic books with small story arcs built into the series  larger story arc plot  Each season of Heroes contains one or two  volumes   and these are designed to involve ordinary people who discover extraordinary super powers  and how these abilities take effect in the characters  daily lives  The first season  known as  Volume One  Genesis   begins as a seemingly ordinary group of people gradually becomes aware that they have special abilities  Events illustrate their reactions to these powers  and how the discovery affects their personal and professional lives  At the same time  several ordinary individuals are investigating the origins and extent of these abilities  Mohinder continues his late father s research into the biological source of the change  while Noah represents a secret organization known only as  the Company   While coping with these new abilities  each of the characters is drawn  willingly or unwillingly  into the Company s conspiracy to control superpowered people and into a race to stop an explosion from destroying New York City  Season two  known as  Volume Two  Generations   21  begins four months after the events of Kirby Plaza  The main plot arc of Generations deals with the Company and its research on the Shanti virus  This research is explored through the Company s founders  whose identities are revealed  as well as through the effects of various strains of the virus  The heroes ultimately come together in an attempt to stop the release of a deadly strain of the virus and avert a global pandemic  The first part of season three was known as  Volume Three  Villains   Volume three began with the assassination attempt on Nathan  and explores its consequences  In addition  several villains escape from the confines of Level 5  and the Company attempts to recapture them  Arthur Petrelli  Robert Forster  heals from systemic nerve damage and aims to create a formula to give ordinary people abilities  The second part of season three   Volume Four  Fugitives   involves what happens after Nathan fails to produce the formula  After the destruction of Primatech and Pinehearst  the heroes attempt to lead normal lives until Nathan initiates his plan to round up all people with abilities  Sylar kills Nathan in an intense duel  however  Matt is instructed to alter Sylar s mind to believe that he is Nathan  Season four comprises volume five   Redemption   and takes place six weeks after the events of season three  The heroes try to return to their normal lives  Peter returns to his job as a paramedic  while Claire attends college  Sylar s acquired abilities begin to manifest as  Nathan  struggles to maintain his identity  and Sylar s consciousness  trapped in Matt Parkman s mind  taunts Matt and seeks out his own body  Also  Hiro has to deal with his brain tumor that is slowly killing him and preventing him from controlling his powers  A carnival group is introduced whose leader  Samuel  tries to recruit more people with abilities into his carnival family  purportedly creating a community for these people where they are welcome to be open with their abilities and respected by outsiders  but really is recruiting people for a sinister purpose  The heroes have to come together to battle Samuel and his plan to expose  specials  to the world by killing thousands of people  The series finale ends by opening the nonexistent volume six   Brave New World   in which Claire reveals the existence of people with special abilities to a group of reporters and photographers   edit  Production  edit  Conception Heroes began development early in 2006  when Tim Kring  creator of NBC s Crossing Jordan  came up with the show s concept  Kring wanted to create a  large ensemble saga  that would connect with the audience  He began thinking about how big  scary and complicated he felt the world is  and wanted to create a character driven series about people who could do something about it  Kring felt that a cop or medical drama did not have characters that were big enough to save the world  He came up with the thought of superheroes  ordinary people who would discover extraordinary abilities  while still rooted in the real world and in reality  Casting directors Jason La Padura and Natalie Hart brought forth a cast of new faces such as Milo Ventimiglia who described the pilot as a  character drama about everyday people with a heightened reality   Said heightened reality was brought to light through the work of production designer Ruth Ammon  Kring wanted the series to have touchstones that involved the characters and the world they lived in  22  23  Before he began putting his ideas together  he spoke with Lost executive producer Damon Lindelof  with whom he had worked for three years on Crossing Jordan  Kring credits Lindelof for giving him ideas on how to pitch the series to the network and advice on the lessons he  Lindelof  learned about working on a serialized drama  The two still speak and support each other s projects  24  25  26  When Kring pitched the idea for Heroes to the NBC network  he described the network s reaction as  excited   very supportive   27  He comments that he has been partners with NBC for some time based on his six year run as showrunner for Crossing Jordan  27  When he pitched the pilot  he described every detail  including the cliffhanger ending  When NBC executives asked him what was going to happen next  Kring responded   Well  you ll just have to wait and find out   28  After the project was greenlit  a special 73 minute version of the pilot was first screened to a large audience at the 2006 San Diego Comic Con International  29  It was initially reported that this unaired pilot would not be released  but it was included on the season one DVD set  30   edit  Writing When the writing team worked on an episode  each writer took a character and wrote the individual scenes surrounding them  These stories were then combined and given to the episode writer  This system allowed every writer to contribute to every episode  31  and enabled the writing team to finish scripts sooner  so the filming crew could shoot more scenes at a location  28  Tim Kring described the writing process as a collaborative one and stated that the collaboration process was important because production needed to shoot several scenes at a single location  To do this  several scripts had to be ready  Jesse Alexander  co producer and writer  explained that this process was important in a serialized drama because one has to know where each character s development is heading  28  Season two coincided with the WGA writers  strike  meaning only 11 out of the planned 24 episodes were produced  32  This forced the producers to redesign the season to encompass only the Generations volume out of the three planned  33  The planned third volume  Exodus  34  which was originally designed to be a story arc reflecting the effects of the release of strain 138 of the Shanti virus  was canceled  The planned fourth volume  Villains  was changed to the third volume and moved into season three  5  Scenes from the volume two finale   Powerless   were reshot to reflect the cancellation of the Exodus volume  and to tie up all the loose plot storylines of Generations  35  36  Following criticisms of the second and third volumes  Tim Molloy from TV Guide reported that Heroes would return to its roots with the fourth volume  Fugitives  to attract new viewers and regain those who gave up on the show because of too many characters and plotlines  37  In November 2008  NBC fired Jesse Alexander and Jeph Loeb from the production staff of Heroes over creative differences and budget problems  38  As a result  Tim Kring would refocus the series on character development and simple storytelling  39  However  a high ranking insider told TV Guide that rather than pressure from NBC or Universal Media responding to recent plummeting ratings  it was Kring himself who fired Alexander and Loeb because the duo refused to continue character driven stories that made the first season popular from the start  40  In December 2008  Bryan Fuller signed a 2 year deal with Universal Media Studios after the cancellation of his ABC series Pushing Daisies  41  He rejoined the writing staff of Heroes starting with the 20th episode of season three and had a  key role in the writing and direction  of the series  42  However  on June 22 it was revealed that Fuller left Heroes to work on other projects  43  On April 28  2009  director producer Greg Beeman was fired by NBC  44   edit  Music The series score is composed by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman  with music engineer Michael Perfitt 45  and vocals provided by Shankar  Each episode averages thirty to thirty five minutes of music  Melvoin and Coleman became involved with Heroes from their previous work with executive producer Allan Arkush  46 Tim Kring gave general instructions to the pair  including the emotion and direction for each character  Kring wanted incredibly unusual music and gave Melvoin and Coleman a lot of freedom and permission to experiment  citation needed  In the pilot episode  Kring suggested that a  dreamy  cue be used in the scene involving Claire Bennet running into a burning train  The  dreamy  cue has since become a signature piece of the show  Melvoin and Coleman developed musical cues for each character  Claude s theme involved wind and voices to create the feeling of a ghost like presence  Sylar s involves marimbas and bassoons with staccato to re create the sound of clocks ticking in reference to the character s power  Matt Parkman s theme involves voices being played backwards when he uses his power of telepathy  Peter Petrelli s theme involves marcato strings  Niki Sanders s theme was based on her character s alter ego named Jessica and involved winds and Indian voices chanting in an underscore to give a feeling that she was possessed  Mohinder Suresh s theme is the piano composition that plays at the end of some episodes  46  In 2007  the ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards gave Melvoin and Coleman the  Top Television Series  award for their work on Heroes  47  In France  the theme music of Heroes is composed by Victoria Petrosillo  48  Her song   Le H ros d un autre   is used by television network TF1 to replace the show s original incidental music  The network created a new opening credit sequence so they could play Petrosillo s theme song  49  The official Heroes soundtrack was released on March 18  2008 by The NBCUniversal Television  DVD  Music  amp  Consumer Products Group  On February 29  2008 the Group released five music videos created by Heroes producer director Allan Arkush  each combining show footage with songs from the soundtrack  50  51  52  In September 2008  Melvoin and Coleman announced that they would be releasing an album consisting entirely of the score from Heroes  entitled Heroes  Original Score  53  It was released on April 14  2009 by La La Land Records  54   edit  Filming and visual effects Eric Grenaudier and John Han of Stargate Digital are the visual effects supervisors and Mark Spatny 55  is the visual effects producer for Heroes  They work with visual effects animators Anthony Ocampo and Ryan Wieber  who are also from Stargate  22  56  The series visual effects consist of blue screens and 2D and 3D animation  The visual effects for the series are created after the scene is shot in post production  unlike special effects  which are incorporated into the scenes during filming  57  Notable visual effects include radioactive Ted in  Company Man   Nathan flying from Mr  Bennet and The Haitian in  Hiros   and Hiro s time freezing encounter with the schoolgirl in the red bow in  One Giant Leap   22  The special effects are coordinated by Gary D Amico  Stunts are coordinated by Ian Ouinn  who also uses blue screens to accomplish some of the stunts in the series  such as Nathan Petrelli flying away from Heidi during the car accident scene in  Six Months Ago   Principal filming for Heroes takes place in Los Angeles and Santa Clarita  California  3  The Stargate Digital team are also responsible for making Los Angeles look like international locations  such as India and Ukraine  using blue screens and set designs by Ruth Ammon  production designer for the series  58  The series is filmed using a single camera setup  In keeping with the comic book thematic elements used on Heroes  professional comic book artists Tim Sale and Alex Maleev were brought in to provide the artwork used within the series under the direction of Ruth Ammon  including the artwork of Isaac Mendez  and Mendez metafictional comic book series  the 9th Wonders   59  Additionally  the font used in captions and credits for the show is reminiscent of traditional hand rendered comic book lettering  It was created by Sale and is based on his handwriting style  60 Heroes is designed by production designer Ruth Ammon  Ammon has been nominated for her work on Heroes twice by the Art Directors Guild and has also been nominated for two Emmy Awards for excellence in art direction   edit  Heroes  Origins On May 14  2007  NBC announced that it would air a six episode Heroes spin off called Heroes  Origins during the 2007 2008 season  61  The show was to introduce a new character each week  and viewers were to select which one would stay for the following season of the regular series  62  The show was supposed to air after the completion of the second season of Heroes in April 2008  61  however  on October 31  2007  it was reported that Origins had been postponed because of the Writers Guild of America strike  63  Tim Kring stated in an interview that the first episode of Origins was to reveal the secrets and meanings behind the Helix symbol  However  because of the WGA Strike  Kring commented that the secret will have to be revealed down the line  Kring revealed that he was to write the first episode of Origins  and that John August had been hired to write another episode  64  Director Kevin Smith  a fan of Heroes  was set to write and direct an episode for the spin off  65  as were Eli Roth and Michael Dougherty  66  On April 3  2008  a day after NBC announced its 2008 2009 primetime schedule  Ben Silverman confirmed Origins s cancellation  67   edit  Mythology Main article  Mythology of Heroes Activating Evolution  a fictional book featured in the series Heroes includes some mysterious fictional recurring elements that have been ascribed to science fiction or supernatural phenomena  Tim Kring and the creators of the series refer to these fictional elements as part of the mythology of the series  Kring confirmed that although the show has a unique mythology  he does not want to sink too deeply into it  Rather  Kring has used volumes to wrap up ongoing plot lines instead of carrying storylines over long periods of time as in Lost  68  Among the show s mythological elements are the Company  the legend of Takezo Kensei  paintings of the future  superpowers and their origins  the Shanti virus  9th Wonders  comic book  and numerous other elements and mythological themes   edit  Response  edit  Critical reception During the series  first season  the American Film Institute named Heroes one of the ten  best television programs of the year   69  Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun Times stated   the show s super strengths are its well developed filmmaking  smooth pacing and a perfect cast  It views like the first hour of a fun  thoughtful movie   Barry Garron at The Hollywood Reporter also stated   Heroes is one of TV s most imaginative creations and might  with luck  become this year s Lost   70  Less favorable reviews included the Philadelphia Inquirer  who commented that although the show had lots of  cool effects   it  lands  splat  in a pile of nonsense and dim dialogue   In response to the first pod of season one episodes  The Chicago Tribune went as far as saying   you could watch the first few episodes of Heroes  or you could repeatedly hit yourself on the head with a brick  The effect is surprisingly similar   71  At Metacritic  the Heroes pilot received a 67 100  with generally favorable reviews from critics  72  The show was declared the fourth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb com Pro  2002 2012   73  Season two was criticized by commentators and fans for a much slower pace  less engaging storyline and lack of focus compared to the first season  Milo Ventimiglia stated that  when there s a little bit of a delay  there s not that instant  rewarding scene or moment or episode    people get impatient  so it has been extremely important for them to strike a balance between giving and getting   74  In an interview with Entertainment Weekly  Heroes creator Tim Kring commented on criticisms of season two  and the series  15  decline in ratings  75  Kring said that he felt he had made mistakes with the direction of season two  He had thought that the audience was looking for a  build up of characters and the discovery of their powers   when viewers were instead looking for  adrenaline   Kring also outlined what he felt were problems with plot development  stating that season two  took too long to get to the big picture story   explaining that Peter s vision of the viral armageddon should have occurred in the first episode instead of the seventh  He feels that it would have been better to introduce new characters within the context of the main storyline  as with Elle  rather than in unattached arcs such as that of Maya and Alejandro  Kring also admitted that he should have resolved the  Hiro in Japan  storyline much more quickly  and that the romantic stories are not working well  With regard to Claire and West  and Hiro and Yaeko  he said   I ve seen more convincing romances on TV  In retrospect  I don t think romance is a natural fit for us   75   edit  Awards and nominations By the time Heroes completed the first half of the first season  the show had already collected an
