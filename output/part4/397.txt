It was written by Alex Ross and Mark Waid and painted in gouache by Ross  who also developed the concept from an original idea  Set some twenty years into the future of the then current DC Universe  it deals with a growing conflict between  traditional  superheroes  such as Superman  Wonder Woman  and the Justice League  and a growing population of largely amoral and dangerously irresponsible new vigilantes  in many cases the offspring of the traditional heroes  Between these two groups is Batman and his assembled team  who attempt to contain the escalating disaster  foil the machinations of Lex Luthor  and prevent a world ending superhuman war  Contents 1 Development 2 Plot 2 1 Impending disaster 2 2 Second coming of Superman 2 3 Pact 2 4 Armageddon 2 5 Epilogue 2 6 Collected edition

grand opus  about characters from DC Comics  Ross wrote a 40 page handwritten outline of what would become Kingdom Come and pitched the idea to James Dale Robinson as a project similar in scope to Watchmen  1986 1987  and Alan Moore s infamous  lost work  Twilight of the Superheroes  Ultimately  Ross teamed with writer Mark Waid  who was recommended by DC editors due to his strong familiarity with the history of DC superheroes  1   edit  Plot This section consists almost entirely of a plot summary and should be expanded to provide more balanced coverage that includes real world context  Please edit the article to focus on discussing the work rather than merely reiterating the plot   December 2007   edit  Impending disaster The story is set roughly a generation after the then current DC universe  Ten years prior to the start of the story  the Joker massacres the staff of the Daily Planet  killing  among others  Jimmy Olsen  Perry White and Lois Lane  As he arrives for his trial  he is killed by a new superhero named Magog  In an instance of jury nullification  Magog is acquitted for his cold blooded act  and Superman is appalled by the public embracing a killer as a hero  Already disheartened by Lois Lane s death  Kal El abandons his life as Superman  retreating to his Fortress of Solitude  He spends the next decade there all the while  failing to realize his importance responsibility as a constant inspiration and role model to other superheroes  In the meantime  those other superheroes equally disturbed at the public s overwhelmingly positive reaction to Magog s actions withdraw from the world at large  too  Without the moral compass provided by Superman and his contemporaries  there is little or no distinction between  heroes  and  villains   Metahumans battle openly in the streets without true cause and with no concern for collateral damage or innocent passersby  The narrator and point of view character of the story is a minister named Norman McCay  McCay is a longtime friend of Wesley Dodds  the original Sandman  now infirm and bedridden  The nightmares that once aided Dodds  crimefighting have become disturbing  apocalyptic visions  McCay  like Dodds  doctors  attribute the visions to senility  When Dodds passes away  his visions are transferred to McCay  Already suffering from a crisis of faith  McCay is convinced he has finally gone insane when the Spectre appears to him  The Spectre  still hosted by Jim Corrigan  but no longer in touch with his humanity  recruits McCay to bear witness  and help him determine the innocent from the wicked and ultimately to pass judgment on the approaching superhuman apocalypse  Promotional art for Kingdom Come  Clockwise from top  The Ray  Red Robin  Superman  Wonder Woman  Hawkman  Power Woman  Rev  Norman McCay  the Spectre  in background   Green Lantern  The dark state of the world comes to a head when the Justice Battalion  led by Magog  attacks the Parasite with excessive and unnecessary force   they refuse his offers to surrender and deny his pleas for mercy  Parasite panics and tears apart Captain Atom  releasing his nuclear energies and irradiating the entire state of Kansas and parts of the surrounding states  killing millions and taking out a large portion of America s food production  2   edit  Second coming of Superman Coaxed back into action by Wonder Woman  Superman decides to return to Metropolis and re form the Justice League following the Kansas disaster to rein in the new breed of heroes  2  He manages to collect former heroes  including Green Lantern  the Flash  Hawkman  and Dick Grayson  now known as Red Robin  among others  and reformed  new heroes   such as Avia  Mr  Miracle and Big Barda s daughter   but Batman  one of the most prominent of the old guard  refuses to join Superman s crusade  Batman believes Superman s idealist notions are outdated and that his interference will only exacerbate the problem  He interprets Superman s plan as an example of the strong exerting their will upon the weak  something to which he will not be part of  He instead begins to organize a second group of heroes  made up largely of non powered heroes like Green Arrow and the Blue Beetle  as well as second and third generation heroes like Jade  daughter of the first Green Lantern  and Zatara  son of Zatanna and grandson of the first generation hero whose name he shares  Lex Luthor is still alive and well  and has organized the  Mankind Liberation Front   The MLF is primarily a group of Silver Age Justice League villains  including Batman foes Catwoman and the Riddler  Vandal Savage  King  leader of the Royal Flush Gang  as well as third generation villains like Ra s al Ghul s successor  Ibn al Xu ffasch  who is Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul s son  The MLF work to wrestle control of the world away from the heroes  3   edit  Pact Superman s Justice League gathers more captives than converts  and his prison  nicknamed  The Gulag   is filled to capacity almost as soon as it is built  Superman designates Scott Free  the former Mr  Miracle as warden  aided by other heroes including Big Barda and Captain Comet and works to persuade the inmates that their methods are wrong headed and dangerous  but his entreaties fall upon deaf ears  With hostile hero villains like 666  Kabuki Kommando  and Von Bach locked up together  pressure builds  Meanwhile  Superman  urged on by Wonder Woman  reacts with increasing inflexibility towards the inappropriate behavior of the metahuman community  He learns that Wonder Woman s ardent militant stance may be influenced by her recent exile from Paradise Island  in the eyes of the Amazons  her mission to bring peace to the outside world has failed  At first  Batman and his cadre of heroes seem to enter into an alliance with the MLF as a united front against the Justice League  In time  Luthor reveals his plan to exacerbate the conflict between the League and the inmates by pitting Captain Marvel against the League  the Gulag and Superman  the ensuing chaos will afford Luthor an opportunity to seize power  Assisted by the Martian Manhunter  Batman discovers that an adult Billy Batson is under the villains  control  Batson  who becomes Captain Marvel when he utters the word  Shazam    is the one being capable of matching Superman s power  When the Gulag s inmates riot  killing Captain Comet  Batman s forces ambush Luthor and his conspirators  Batman is unable to restrain the brain washed Batson  who transforms into Marvel and flies to Kansas  He opens the Gulag and unleashes chaos  Superman and Captain Marvel face off in the final page of Kingdom Come  3  Art by Alex Ross  After Captain Comet s murder  Wonder Woman convinces the members of the League to use deadly force to deal with the inmates of the Gulag  Superman still objects  The Justice League clashes with the bloodthirsty inmates  and Superman finds Batman and forces him to recognize that they may very well be facing the end of the world  Superman knows that Batman will act  because his entire crime fighting life is based upon the desire to prevent the loss of human life  Batman at first justifies inaction by saying the world would be better off if all the world s meta humans destroyed each other  Superman rejects this notion  pointing out that if all human life is sacred  then logically  that includes super human life  4   edit  Armageddon Upon arriving at the Gulag  Superman and Captain Marvel battle while the Spectre and Norman look on  4  Although Batman s forces join the fray  aiding Superman s League in quelling the riot  he also works to restrain Superman from imposing narrow rules upon all metahumans  Batman  wearing an armored battle suit with the power of flight  comes into direct conflict with Wonder Woman  who had killed Von Bach in the act of attempting to crush Zatara  one of Batman s force  As the conditions worsen  the United Nations Secretary General Wyrmwood authorizes the deployment of three tactical nuclear warheads  hardened against certain metahuman powers  While this action will destroy hero and villain alike  the U N  feels it has no choice in the matter  if humanity is to survive  metahumanity must be destroyed  An armored Batman and Wonder Woman clash in the middle of the warzone  taking to the skies  where they see the incoming stealth bombers  piloted by the Blackhawk Squadron  delivering the nuclear bombs  They manage to stop two of them  but the third slips past and drops its payload  Captain Marvel continues to batter Superman by using his magic lightning bolt over and over  but dodging before it hits  leaving Superman to bear the brunt of a magical lightning strike  However  as Marvel says the name again  Superman grabs him and the lightning finds its mark  Marvel turns back into Billy Batson  Holding Batson s mouth shut  Superman tells Batson that he is going to stop the remaining bomb  and Batson must make an important choice  either stop Superman and allow the warhead to kill all the metahumans  or let Superman stop the bomb and allow the metahumans  war to engulf the world  Superman tells Batson he must be the one to make this decision  as he is the only one who lives in both worlds  that of normal humans  as Batson  and the metahuman community  as Marvel   Superman releases him and flies off to stop the incoming bomb  Batson  his mind now clear of Luthor s influence  says the name  turns into Marvel  flies past Superman  and takes hold of the bomb  having found a third option  Marvel shouts  Shazam   three more times in rapid succession  and the lightning sets off the bomb prematurely  killing Billy Batson in the process  Despite Marvel s sacrifice  most of the metahumans are obliterated in the explosion  although some survive beneath a force field generated by Green Lantern and his daughter Jade  and others are teleported away at the last second by Fate  Superman  though outside the force field  is virtually untouched  Giving in to his rage at the tremendous loss of life  he flies to the U N  Building and threatens to bring it down atop the delegates as punishment for the massacre   not realizing there were survivors at this point   and reacting in such a fearful and cowardly way to the metahuman war  The surviving metahumans arrive  but Norman McCay is the one who talks him down  pointing out how his appearance and behavior are exactly the sort of reasons that normal humans fear the super powered  Chastised and ashamed  Superman immediately ceases his rampage  He is handed Captain Marvel s cape  the only remnant of the hero  and tells the U N  representatives that he will use his wisdom to guide  rather than lead  humankind  Superman ties Captain Marvel s cape to a flagpole and raises it among the flags of the member nations of the U N   suggesting that this role of guidance would be more political and global in nature than the classic crime busting vigilantism of the past  5   edit  Epilogue In the aftermath of the metahuman civil war  the heroes actively strive to become fully integrated members of the communities they had previously tried to distance themselves from  Masks are abandoned  Wonder Woman s exile from Paradise Island ends  and she becomes an ambassador for super humanity  taking the survivors of the Gulag to Paradise Island for rehabilitation  Batman abandons his crusade and becomes a healer  opening his mansion as a hospital to care for those wounded by the destruction of Kansas and the ensuing violence  He also reconciles with both Dick Grayson Red Robin  and his son Ibn al Xu ffasch  Superman lashes himself to a giant plow and begins the arduous task of restoring the Midwestern farmlands  devastated in the Justice Battalion s attempt to capture the Parasite  He even comes to terms with his past as Clark Kent by accepting a pair of glasses from Wonder Woman  and shares a kiss with her before she returns to Paradise Island  It is a fitting parallel to the end of the generational conflict that started the war  as both men have come full circle in their lives and adopted the vocations of their fathers  Thomas Wayne  the doctor  and Jonathan Kent  the farmer  Norman McCay resumes pastorship of his congregation  preaching a message of hope for humanity  Among the congregation is Jim Corrigan  the Spectre s human host  5  In the novelization  Clark Kent attends a sermon as well   edit  Collected edition additional scenes The first additional scene takes place at the end of the second part of the series  when Superman visits Orion on Apokolips wanting his advice for what to do with the captive rogue metahumans  Orion tells Superman to look for Scott Free and Big Barda  The second additional scene is an epilogue  At Planet Krypton  a theme restaurant owned by Michael Jon Carter  Clark Kent and Diana Prince intend to inform Bruce Wayne they are expecting a child  but Bruce deduces the news before they can tell him  Diana asks Bruce to serve as godfather and mentor to the child  He accepts after Clark states that he believes that Bruce will provide a balancing influence to the child  adding that in spite of their differences over the years he has always trusted Batman  Bruce then notices Norman and Jim Corrigan  discussing the restaurant s  Spectre Platter   much to Corrigan s irritation that this is how he was to be remembered   edit  Characters It has been suggested that this section be split into a new article titled List of Kingdom Come characters

a sequel prequel titled The Kingdom  Alex Ross  original intent was for Gog to be an alien  twice the size of a human  from the planet Urgrund that split into two and created Apokolips and New Genesis  and that Magog would be the grown son of Superman and Wonder Woman who would be mentored by Gog  Waid and Ross disagreed on several concepts and Ross decided to leave the project  6  Without Ross

Doctor Mid Nite  and Damage  and he resurrects Lance from the dead to make him his successor  Magog  Soon  the JSA learns that Gog is forming a parasitic relationship with the planet Earth where  if he remains long enough  the planet will not be able to survive without him  All of the heroes turn on Gog  and he takes back the gifts he had given them  but he is still defeated  They remove his head  and Superman 22 and Starman take it to the Source Wall  Starman  whose costume has the power to transport people throughout the Multiverse  sends Superman back to Earth 22  He arrives in time to see the carnage caused by Captain Marvel detonating the bomb  The events of Kingdom Come continue from there and conclude in its entirety  except that it ends with several scenes depicting Superman and Wonder Woman s life as a couple and the legacy Superman leaves to his Earth  Alex Ross states that this story is not intended as a sequel to Kingdom Come as that would negate the purpose of the

that the volume  constitute d  an unauthorized derivative work that infringe d  upon  DC s  copyrights  violates  their  trademark rights  and misappropriates  their  good will   8  Lamken acquiesced to the recall  despite protesting that DC had prior knowledge of the project  It is likely that the similarities between the material contained in the Revelations volume  available only with the purchase of the considerably more expensive Graphitti DC two volume set  contributed to the recall of the Comicology volume  The recall made the Companion arguably the most difficult Kingdom Come item to find   edit  Trading cards In 1996  Fleer Skybox released a set of trading cards based on Kingdom Come  entitled Kingdom Come eXtra  Alongside the 50 basic cards  featuring art by Ross and text by
