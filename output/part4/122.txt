r  pi  n ju nj n  is an economic and political union or confederation 10  11  of 27 member states which are located primarily in Europe  12  The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community  ECSC  and the European Economic Community  EEC   formed by six countries in 1958  In the intervening years the EU has grown in size by the accession of new member states  and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit  The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union under its current name in 1993  13  The latest amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU  the Treaty of Lisbon  came into force in 2009  The EU operates through a system of supranational independent institutions and intergovernmental negotiated decisions by the member states  14  15  16  Important institutions of the EU include the European Commission  the Council of the European Union  the European Council  the Court of Justice of the European Union  and the European Central Bank  The European Parliament is elected every five years by EU citizens  The EU has developed a single market through a standardised system of laws which apply in all member states  Within the Schengen Area  which includes EU and non EU states  passport controls have been abolished  17  EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people  goods  services  and capital  18  enact legislation in justice and home affairs  and maintain common policies on trade  19 agriculture  20 fisheries and regional development  21  A monetary union  the eurozone  was established in 1999 and  as of January 2012  is composed of 17 member states  Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy the EU has developed a limited role in external relations and defence  Permanent diplomatic missions have been established around the world and the EU is represented at the United Nations  the WTO  the G8 and the G 20  With a combined population of over 500 million inhabitants  22  or 7 3  of the world population  23  the EU generated a nominal GDP of 16 242 billion US dollars in 2010  which represents an estimated 20  of global GDP when measured in terms of purchasing power parity  24  Contents 1

integration were seen by many as an escape from the extreme forms of nationalism which had devastated the continent  25  One such attempt to unite Europeans was the European Coal and Steel Community  which was declared to be  a first step in the federation of Europe   starting with the aim of eliminating the possibility of further wars between its member states by means of pooling the national heavy industries  26  The founding members of the Community were Belgium  France  Italy  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  and West Germany  The originators and supporters of the Community include Jean Monnet  Robert Schuman  Paul Henri Spaak  and Alcide De Gasperi  27  In 1957  the six countries signed the Treaties of Rome  which extended the earlier cooperation within the European Coal and Steel Community  ECSC  and created the European Economic Community   EEC  establishing a customs union and the European Atomic Energy Community  Euratom  for cooperation in developing nuclear energy  The treaty came into force in 1958  27  The Rome Treaty was signed in 1957 and came into force in 1958  It created the European Economic Community  The EEC and Euratom were created separately from ECSC  although they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly  The executives of the new communities were called Commissions  as opposed to the  High Authority   The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein  Hallstein Commission  and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand  Armand Commission  and then Etienne Hirsch  Euratom would integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union between members  28  29  30  Throughout the 1960s tensions began to show with France seeking to limit supranational power  However  in 1965 an agreement was reached and hence in 1967 the Merger Treaty was signed in Brussels  It came into force on 1 July 1967 and created a single set of institutions for the three communities  which were collectively referred to as the European Communities  EC   although commonly just as the European Community  31  32 Jean Rey presided over the first merged Commission  Rey Commission   33  The Iron Curtain s fall in 1989 enabled eastward enlargement   Berlin Wall  In 1973 the Communities enlarged to include Denmark  including Greenland  which later left the Community in 1985   Ireland  and the United Kingdom  34  Norway had negotiated to join at the same time but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum and so Norway remained outside  In 1979  the first direct  democratic elections to the European Parliament were held  35  Greece joined in 1981  Portugal and Spain in 1986  36  In 1985  the Schengen Agreement led the way toward the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non member states  37  In 1986  the European flag began to be used by the Community 38  and the Single European Act was signed  In 1990  after the fall of the Iron Curtain  the former East Germany became part of the Community as part of a newly united Germany  39  With enlargement towards European formerly communist countries as well as Cyprus and Malta on the agenda  the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the European Union were agreed  The introduction of the euro in 2002 replaced several national currencies  The European Union was formally established when the Maastricht Treaty came into force on 1 November 1993  13  and in 1995 Austria  Finland and Sweden joined the newly established EU  In 2002  euro notes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states  Since then  the eurozone has increased to encompass 17 countries  In 2004  the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when Cyprus  the Czech Republic  Estonia  Hungary  Latvia  Lithuania  Malta  Poland  Slovakia and Slovenia joined the Union  40  On 1 January 2007  Romania and Bulgaria became the EU s members  In the same year Slovenia adopted the euro  40  followed in 2008 by Cyprus and Malta  by Slovakia in 2009 and by Estonia in 2011  In June 2009  the 2009 Parliament elections were held leading to a renewal of Barroso s Commission Presidency  and in July 2009 Iceland formally applied for EU membership  On 1 December 2009  the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU  In particular it changed the legal structure of the European Union  merging the EU three pillars system into a single legal entity provisioned with legal personality  and it created a permanent President of the European Council  the first of which is Herman Van Rompuy  and a strengthened High Representative  Catherine Ashton  41  On 9 December 2011  Croatia signed the EU accession treaty  42 The EU accession referendum was held in Croatia on 22 January 2012  with the majority voting for Croatia s accession to the European Union making it the 28th member state as of July 2013   edit  Treaties Main article  Treaties of the European Union SignedIn forceDocument 1948 1948Brussels Treaty

influenced by its 65 993 km  41 006 mi  coastline  Cyprus   Mont Blanc in the Alps is the highest peak in the EU  The EU s member states cover an area of 4 423 147 square kilometres  1 707 787 sq mi   nb 3  The EU is larger in area than all but six countries  and its highest peak is Mont Blanc in the Graian Alps  4 810 45 metres  15 782 ft  above sea level  43  The lowest point in the EU is Zuidplaspolder in the Netherlands  at 7 m  23 ft  below sea level  The landscape  climate  and economy of the EU are influenced by its coastline  which is 65 993 kilometres  41 006 mi  long  The EU has the world s second longest coastline  after Canada  The combined member states share land borders with 19 non member states for a total of 12 441 kilometres  7 730 mi   the fifth longest border in the world  15  44  45  Including the overseas territories of member states  the EU experiences most types of climate from Arctic  North East Europe  to tropical  French Guyana   rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless  The majority of the people lives in areas with a temperate maritime climate  North Western Europe and Central Europe   a Mediterranean climate  Southern Europe   or a warm summer continental or hemiboreal climate  Northern Balkans and Central Europe   46  The EU s population is highly urbanised  with some 75  of inhabitants  and growing  projected to be 90  in 7 states by 2020  living in urban areas  Cities are largely spread out across the EU  although with a large grouping in and around the Benelux  An increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas  In some cases this urban growth has been due to the influx of EU funds into a region  47   edit  Member states Main

Luxembourg and the Netherlands to the present day 27 by successive enlargements as countries acceded to the treaties and by doing so  pooled their sovereignty in exchange for representation in the institutions  49  To join the EU a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria  defined at the 1993 Copenhagen European Council  These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law  a functioning market economy capable of competition within the EU  and the acceptance of the obligations of membership  including EU law  Evaluation of a country s fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council  50  No member state has ever left the Union  although Greenland  an autonomous province of Denmark  withdrew in 1985  51  The Lisbon Treaty now provides a clause dealing with how a member leaves the EU  52  Croatia is expected to become the 28th member state of the EU on 1 July 2013 after a referendum on EU membership was approved by Croatian voters on 22 January 2012  The Croatian accession treaty still has to be ratified by all current EU member states  53  There are five candidate countries  Iceland  Macedonia  nb 4 Montenegro  Serbia and Turkey  54 Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina are officially recognised as potential candidates  54 Kosovo is also listed as a potential candidate but the European Commission does not list it as an independent country because not all member states recognise it as an independent country separate from Serbia  55  Four countries forming the EFTA  that are not EU members  have partly committed to the EU s economy and regulations  Iceland  a candidate country for EU membership   Liechtenstein and Norway  which are a part of the single market through the European Economic Area  and Switzerland  which has similar ties through bilateral treaties  56  57  The relationships of the European microstates  Andorra  Monaco  San Marino and the Vatican include the use of the euro and other areas of cooperation  58   edit  Environment Further information  European Commissioner for the Environment and European Climate Change Programme The first environmental policy of the European Community was launched in 1972  Since then it has addressed issues such as acid rain  the thinning of the ozone layer  air quality  noise pollution  waste and water pollution  The Water Framework Directive is an example of a water policy  aiming for rivers  lakes  ground and coastal waters to be of  good quality  by 2015  59  The Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive are pieces of European Union legislation for protection of biodiversity and natural habitats  These protections however only directly cover animals and plants  fungi and micro organisms have no protection under European Union law  60  The directives are implemented through the Natura 2000 programme and covers 30 000 sites throughout Europe  59  In 2007  the Polish government sought to build a motorway through the Rospuda valley  but the Commission has been blocking construction as the valley is a wildlife area covered by the programme  61  In 2007  member states agreed that the EU is to use 20  renewable energy in the future and that it has to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 by at least 20  compared to 1990 levels  62  This includes measures that in 2020  10  of the overall fuel quantity used by cars and trucks in EU 27 should be running on renewable energy such as biofuels  This is considered to be one of the most ambitious moves of an important industrialised region to fight global warming  63

 Political parties Constituencies Referendums Law Acquis Primacy Subsidiarity Treaties Fundamental Rights Membership v t e The EU operates solely within those competencies conferred on it upon the treaties and according to the principle of subsidiarity  which dictates that action by the EU should only be taken where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states alone   Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms  Generally speaking they can be classified into two groups  those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures  and those which specifically require national implementation measures  64   edit  Governance Main articles  EU institutions and Legislature of the European Union The European Union has seven institutions  the European Parliament  the Council of the European Union  the European Commission  the European Council  the European Central Bank  the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Auditors  Competencies in scrutinising and amending legislation are divided between the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union while executive tasks are carried out by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council  not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union   The monetary policy of the eurozone is governed by the European Central Bank  The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union  The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors  There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area   edit  European Council President of the European Council  Herman Van Rompuy The European Council gives direction to the EU  and convenes at least four times a year  It comprises the President of the European Council  the President of the European Commission and one representative per member state  either its head of state or head of government  The European Council has been described by some as the Union s  supreme political authority   65  It is actively involved in the negotiation of the treaty changes and defines the EU s policy agenda and strategies  The European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions  and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies  It acts externally as a  collective head of state  and ratifies important documents  for example  international agreements and treaties   66  On 19 November 2009  Herman Van Rompuy was chosen as the first permanent President of the European Council  On 1 December 2009  the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force and he assumed office  Ensuring the external representation of the EU  67  driving consensus and settling divergences among members are tasks for the President both during the convocations of the European Council and in the time periods between them  The European Council should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe  an international organisation independent from the EU   edit  Commission Commission President Jos  Manuel Barroso The European Commission acts as the EU s executive arm and is responsible for initiating legislation and the day to day running of the EU  The Commission is also seen as the motor of European integration  It operates as a cabinet government  with 27 Commissioners for different areas of policy  one from each member state  though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state  One of the 27 is the Commission President  currently Jos  Manuel Dur o Barroso  appointed by the European Council  After the President  the most prominent Commissioner is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who is ex officio Vice President of the Commission and is chosen by the European Council too  68  The other 25 Commissioners are subsequently appointed by the Council of the European Union in agreement with the nominated President  The 27 Commissioners as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament   edit  Parliament The European Parliament building in Strasbourg  France The European Parliament  EP  forms one half of the EU s legislature  the other half is the Council of the European Union  see below   The 736  soon to be 751  Members of the European Parliament  MEPs  are directly elected by EU citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation  Although MEPs are elected on a national basis  they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality  Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into sub national constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system  69  The ordinary legislative procedure of the European Union  The Parliament and the Council of the European Union pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure  This also applies to the EU budget  Finally  the Commission is accountable to Parliament  requiring its approval to take office  having to report back to it and subject to motions of censure from it  The President of the European Parliament carries out the role of speaker in parliament and represents it externally  The EP President and Vice Presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years  70   edit  Council The Council of the European Union  also called the  Council  71  and sometimes referred to as the  Council of Ministers   72  forms the other half of the EU s legislature  It consists of a government minister from each member state and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed  Notwithstanding its different configurations  it is considered to be one single body  73  In addition to its legislative functions  the Council also exercises executive functions in relations to the Common Foreign and Security Policy   edit  Budget Main article  Budget of the European Union The 2011 EU

3 billion for the period 2007 2013  75  representing 1 10  and 1 05  of the EU 27 s GNI forecast for the respective periods  By comparison  the United Kingdom s expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be  759 billion  and France was estimated to have spent  801 billion  In 1960  the budget of the then European Economic Community was 0 03  of GDP  76  In the 2010 budget of  141 5 billion  the largest single expenditure item is  cohesion  amp  competitiveness  with around 45  of the total budget  77  Next comes  agriculture  with approximately 31  of the total  77   Rural development  environment and fisheries  takes up around 11   77   Administration  accounts for around 6   77  The  EU as a global partner  and  citizenship  freedom  security and justice  bring up the rear with approximately 6  and 1  respectively  77  The European Court of Auditors aims to ensure that the budget of the European Union has been properly accounted for  The court provides an audit report for each financial year to the Council and the European Parliament  The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission s handling of the budget  The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti fraud actions  78  The Court of Auditors is legally obliged to provide the Parliament and the Council with  a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions   79  The Court has not given an unqualified approval of the Union s accounts since 1993  80  In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure  agriculture and the cohesion fund  were materially affected by error  81  The European Commission estimated that the financial impact of irregularities was  1 863 million  82   edit  Competences EU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union  In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence  These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation  In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate  While both can legislate  member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not  In other policy areas the EU can only co ordinate  support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws  83  That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area  Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence  and even with the same policy area  The distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union is divided in the following three categories  As outlined in Part I  Title I of the consolidated Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union        view talk

Fundamental Rights of the European Union The EU is based on a series of treaties  These first established the European Community and the EU  and then made amendments to those founding treaties  84  These are power giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals  These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation nb 5  which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants  nb 6  The EU has legal personality  with the right to sign agreements and international treaties  85  Under the principle of supremacy  national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified  and thus the laws enacted under them  even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law  and  within limits  even constitutional provisions  nb 7   edit  Courts of Justice The judicial branch of the EU formally called the Court of Justice of the European Union consists of three courts  the Court of Justice  the General Court  and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal  Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU  86  The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states  the institutions  and cases referred to it by the courts of member states  87  The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU s courts  88  and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and its civil service  89  Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law  90   edit  Fundamental rights The last amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU came into force in 2009 and was the Lisbon Treaty  The treaties declare that the EU itself is  founded on the values of respect for human dignity  freedom  democracy  equality  the rule of law and respect for human rights  including the rights of persons belonging to minorities    in a society in which pluralism  non discrimination  tolerance  justice  solidarity and equality between women and men prevail   91  In 2009 the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the EU s legal acts can be judged  It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the  constitutional traditions common to the member states   92  The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has  on occasion  invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights  93  The Charter of Fundamental Rights was drawn up in 2000  Although originally not legally binding the Charter was frequently cited by the EU s courts as encapsulating rights which the courts had long recognised as the fundamental principles of EU law  Although signing the European Convention on Human Rights  ECHR  is a condition for EU membership  nb 8  previously  the EU itself could not accede to the Convention as it is neither a state nb 9  nor had the competence to accede  nb 10  The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this  the former binds the EU to accede to the Convention while the latter formally permits it  The EU also promoted human rights issues in the wider world  The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition  94  Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership  95   edit  Acts The main legal acts of the EU come in three forms  regulations  directives  and decisions  Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force  without the requirement for any implementing measures  nb 11  and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions  nb 5  Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result  The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states  nb 12  When the time limit for implementing directives passes  they may  under certain conditions  have direct effect in national law against member states  Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation  They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals  companies or a particular member state  They are most often used in Competition Law  or on rulings on State Aid  but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions  Regulations  directives  and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy  96   edit  Justice and home affairs Further information  Area of freedom  security and justice The Schengen Area comprises most member states ensuring open borders  Since the creation of the EU in 1993  it has developed its competencies in the area of justice and home affairs  initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism  To this end  agencies have been established that co ordinate associated actions  Europol for co operation of police forces  97 Eurojust for co operation between prosecutors  98  and Frontex for co operation between border control authorities  99  The EU also operates the Schengen Information System 17  which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities  This cooperation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the Schengen Agreement and the associated cross border crime  Furthermore  the Union has legislated in areas such as extradition  100  family law  101  asylum law  102  and criminal justice  103  Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties  nb 13  In more recent years  these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race  religion  disability  age  and sexual orientation  nb 14  By virtue of these powers  the EU has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the work place  age discrimination  and racial discrimination  nb 15   edit  Foreign relations Main articles  Foreign relations of the European Union  Common Foreign and Security Policy  and European External Action Service High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  Catherine Ashton  Foreign policy cooperation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957  when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the Common Commercial Policy  104  Steps for a more wide ranging coordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies  It was not  however  until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act  EPC was renamed as the Common Foreign and Security Policy  CFSP  by the Maastricht Treaty  105  The aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU s own interests and those of the international community as a whole  including the furtherance of international co operation  respect for human rights  democracy  and the rule of law  106  The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue  The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP makes disagreements  such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq  107  not uncommon  The EU participates in all G8 and G20 summits   G20 summit in Seoul  The co ordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  currently Catherine Ashton  who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters  and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment  The High Representative heads up the European External Action Service  EEAS   a unique EU department 108  that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon  109  The EEAS will serve as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the European Union  110  Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union  the international influence of the EU is also felt through enlargement  The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU s accession criteria  and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries  111  This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as  soft power   as opposed to military  hard power   112   edit  Military Main article  Military of the European Union The Eurofighter Typhoon and Eurocopter Tiger are built by a consortium of some EU states  The European Union does not have one unified military  The predecessors of the European Union were not devised as a strong military alliance because NATO was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes  113  21 EU members are members of NATO 114  while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality  115  The Western European Union  a military alliance with a mutual defence clause  was disbanded in 2010 as its role had been transferred to the EU  116  According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute  SIPRI   France spent more than  44 billion on defence in 2010  placing it third in the world after the US and China  while the United Kingdom spent almost  39 billion  the fourth largest  117  Together  France and the United Kingdom account for 45 per cent of Europe s defence budget  50 per cent of its military capacity and 70 per cent of all spending in military research and development  118  In 2000  the United Kingdom  France  Spain  and Germany accounted for 97  of the total military research budget of the then 15 EU member states  119  Following the Kosovo War in 1999  the European Council agreed that  the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action  backed by credible military forces  the means to decide to use them  and the readiness to do so  in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO   To that end  a number of efforts were made to increase the EU s military capability  notably the Helsinki Headline Goal process  After much discussion  the most concrete result was the EU Battlegroups initiative  each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500 personnel  120  EU forces have been deployed on peacekeeping missions from Africa to the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East  121  EU military operations are supported by a number of bodies  including the European Defence Agency  European Union Satellite Centre and the European Union Military Staff  122  In an EU consisting of 27 members  substantial security and defence cooperation is increasingly relying on great power cooperation  123   edit  Humanitarian aid Further information  ECHO  European Commission  Collectively  the EU is the largest contributor of foreign aid in the world  The European Commissions Humanitarian Aid Office  or  ECHO   provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries  In 2006 its budget amounted to  671 million  48  of which went to the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries  124  Counting the EU s own contributions and those of its member states together  the EU is the largest aid donor in the world  125  Humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget  70   as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the European Development Fund  30    126  The EU s external action financing is divided into  geographic  instruments and  thematic  instruments  126  The  geographic  instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument  DCI   16 9 billion  2007 2013   which must spend 95  of its budget on overseas development assistance  ODA   and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument  ENPI   which contains some relevant programmes  126  The European Development Fund  EDF   22 7 bn  2008 2013  is made up of voluntary contributions by member states  but there is pressure to merge the EDF into the budget financed instruments to encourage increased contributions to match the 0 7  target and allow the European Parliament greater oversight  126  The EU s aid has previously been criticised by the eurosceptic think tank Open Europe for being inefficient  mis targeted and linked to economic objectives  127  Furthermore  some charities such as ActionAid have claimed European governments have inflated the amount they have spent on aid by incorrectly including money spent on debt relief  foreign students  and refugees  Under the de inflated figures  the EU as a whole did not reach its internal aid target in 2006 128  and is expected not to reach the international target of 0 7  of gross national income until 2015  129  However  four countries have reached the 0 7  target  Sweden  Luxembourg  the Netherlands and Denmark  125  In 2005 EU aid was 0 34  of the GNP which was higher than that of either the United States or Japan  130  The previous Commissioner for Aid  Louis Michel  has called for aid to be delivered more rapidly  to greater effect  and on humanitarian principles  131   edit  Economy Main articles  Economy of the European Union and Regional policy of the European Union The ten largest economies in the world counting the EU as a single entity  by GDP  2010  132  The EU has established a single market across the territory of all its members  A monetary union  the eurozone  using a single currency comprises 17 member states  133  In 2010 the EU generated an estimated 26   16 242 billion international dollars  share of the global gross domestic product 24  making it the largest economy in the world  It is the largest exporter  134  the largest importer 135  of goods and services  and the biggest trading partner to several large countries such as China  136 India  137  and the United States  Of the top 500 largest corporations measured by revenue  Fortune Global 500 in 2010   161 have their headquarters in the EU  138  In May 2007 unemployment in the EU stood at 7  139  while investment was at 21 4  of GDP  inflation at 2 2  and public deficit at  0 9  of GDP  140  There is a significant variance for annual per capita income within individual EU states  these range from  11 000 to  70 000  about US 14 000 to US 90 000   141  The difference between the richest and poorest regions  271 NUTS 2 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics  ranged  in 2008  from 28  of the EU27 average in the region of Severozapaden in Bulgaria  to 343  of the average in Inner London in the United Kingdom  On the high end  Inner London has  85 800 PPP per capita  Luxembourg  70 000  and Bruxelles Cap  54 100  while the poorest regions  are Severozapaden with  7 100 PPP per capita  Nord Est with  7 200 PPP per capita  Severen tsentralen with  7 500 and Yuzhen tsentralen with  7 600  141 Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds are supporting the development of underdeveloped regions of the EU  Such regions are primarily located in the states of central and southern Europe  142  143  Several funds provide emergency aid  support for candidate members to transform their country to conform to the EU s standard  Phare  ISPA  and SAPARD   and support to the former USSR Commonwealth of Independent States  TACIS   TACIS has now become part of the worldwide EuropeAid programme  The EU Seventh Framework Programme  FP7  sponsors research conducted by consortia from all EU members to work towards a single European Research Area  144   edit  Internal market Main article  Internal Market  European Union  EU Member States have a standardised passport design with the name of the member state  a symbol  and the words  European Union  given in their official language s    Ireland model  Two of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market  subsequently renamed the single market  and a customs union between its member states  The single market involves the free circulation of goods  capital  people and services within the EU  133  and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market  Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties  discriminatory taxes or import quotas  as they travel internally  The non EU member states of Iceland  Norway  Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union  56  Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU  145  Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries  146  Until the drive towards Economic and Monetary Union the development of the capital provisions had been slow  Post Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom  The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non member states  The free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live  work  study or retire in another country  This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states  147  The free movement of services and of establishment allows self employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis  While services account for 60 70  of GDP  legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas  This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed Directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services  148  According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised   edit  Competition Further information  European Union competition law and European Commissioner for Competition The EU operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market  nb 16  The Commission as the competition regulator for the single market is responsible for antitrust issues  approving mergers  breaking up cartels  working for economic liberalisation and preventing state aid  149  The Competition Commissioner  currently Joaqu n Almunia  is one of the most powerful positions in the Commission  notable for the ability to affect the commercial interests of trans national corporations  150  For example  in 2001 the Commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States  GE and Honeywell  which had already been approved by their national authority  151  Another high profile case against Microsoft  resulted in the Commission fining Microsoft over  777 million following nine years of legal action  152   edit  Monetary union Main articles  Eurozone and Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union The eurozone  in darker blue  is constituted by 17 member states adopting the euro as legal tender  The European Central Bank in Frankfurt governs the monetary policy  The creation of a European single currency became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969  However  it was only with the advent of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 that member states were legally bound to start the monetary union no later than 1 January 1999  On this date the euro was duly launched by eleven of the then 15 member states of the EU  It remained an accounting currency until 1 January 2002  when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone  which by then consisted of 12 member states  The eurozone  constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro  has since grown to 17 countries  the most recent being Estonia which joined on 1 January 2011  All other EU member states  except Denmark and the United Kingdom  are legally bound to join the euro 153  when the convergence criteria are met  however only a few countries have set target dates for accession  Sweden has circumvented the requirement to join the euro by not meeting the membership criteria  nb 17  The euro is designed to help build a single market by  for example  easing travel of citizens and goods  eliminating exchange rate problems  providing price transparency  creating a single financial market  price stability and low interest rates  and providing a currency used internationally and protected against shocks by the large amount of internal trade within the eurozone  It is also intended as a political symbol of integration and stimulus for more  154  Since its launch the euro has become the second reserve currency in the world with a quarter of foreign exchanges reserves being in euro  155  The euro  and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU  are under the control of the European Central Bank  ECB   156  The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone  and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability  It is at the centre of the European System of Central Banks  which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council  consisting of the President of the ECB  who is appointed by the European Council  the Vice President of the ECB  and the governors of the national central banks of all 27 EU member states  157  The monetary union has been shaken by the European sovereign debt crisis since 2009   edit  Financial supervision The European System of Financial Supervisors is an institutional architecture of the EU s framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities  the European Banking Authority  the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority  To complement this framework  there is also a European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the ECB  The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU  158   edit  Energy Main article  Energy policy of the European Union EU energy production 46  of total

energy consumed was produced within the member states while 54  was imported  159  In these statistics  nuclear energy is treated as primary energy produced in the EU  regardless of the source of the uranium  of which less than 3  is produced in the EU  160  The EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence  this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel Community  The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005  and the first draft policy was published in January 2007  161  The EU has five key points in its energy policy  increase competition in the internal market  encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids  diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis  establish a new treaty framework for energy co operation with Russia while improving relations with energy rich states in Central Asia 162  and North Africa  use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing use of renewable energy  and finally increase funding for new energy technologies  161  The EU currently imports 82  of its oil  57  of its natural gas 163  and 97 48  of its uranium 160  demands  There are concerns that Europe s dependence on Russian energy is endangering the Union and its member countries  The EU is attempting to diversify its energy supply  164   edit  Infrastructure Further information  European Commissioner for Transport and European Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship The  resund Bridge between Denmark and Sweden is part of the Trans European Networks  The EU is working to improve cross border infrastructure within the EU  for example through the Trans European Networks  TEN   Projects under TEN include the Channel Tunnel  LGV Est  the Fr jus Rail Tunnel  the  resund Bridge  the Brenner Base Tunnel and the Strait of Messina Bridge  In 2001 it was estimated that by 2010 the network would cover  75 200 kilometres  46 700 mi  of roads  78 000 kilometres  48 000 mi  of railways  330 airports  270 maritime harbours  and 210 internal harbours  165  166  The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network  In the pre 2004 EU members  the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution  After the recent enlargement  the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda  167  The Polish road network in particular was in poor condition  at Poland s accession to the EU  4 600 roads needed to be upgraded to EU standards  demanding approximately  17 billion  168  not in citation given  The Galileo positioning system is another EU infrastructure project  Galileo is a proposed Satellite navigation system  to be built by the EU and launched by the European Space Agency  ESA   and is to be operational by 2012  The Galileo project was launched partly to reduce the EU s dependency on the US operated Global Positioning System  but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for far greater accuracy  given the aged nature of the GPS system  169  It has been criticised by some due to costs  delays  and their perception of redundancy given the existence of the GPS system  170   edit  Agriculture Main article  Common Agricultural Policy EU farms are supported by the CAP  the largest budgetary expenditure   Vineyard in Spain  The Common Agricultural Policy  CAP  is one of the oldest policies of the European Community  and was one of its core aims  171  The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production  providing certainty in food supplies  ensuring a high quality of life for farmers  stabilising markets  and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers  nb 19  It was  until recently  operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention  Until the 1990s  the policy accounted for over 60  of the then European Community s annual budget  and still accounts for around 34   172  The policy s price controls and market interventions led to considerable overproduction  resulting in so called butter mountains and wine lakes  These were intervention stores of produce bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels  In order to dispose of surplus stores  they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices  or farmers were offered subsidies  amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices  to export their produce outside the Community  This system has been criticised for under cutting farmers outside of Europe  especially those in the developing world  173  The overproduction has also been criticised for encouraging environmentally unfriendly intensive farming methods  173  Supporters of CAP say that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living  in what would otherwise be an economically unviable way of life  However  the EU s small farmers receive only 8  of CAP s available subsidies  173  Since the beginning of the 1990s  the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms  Initially these reforms included the introduction of set aside in 1988  where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production  milk quotas  by the McSharry reforms in 1992  and  more recently  the  de coupling   or disassociation  of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce  by the Fischler reforms in 2004   Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce  toward direct payments based on farm size  This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels  while maintaining agricultural income levels  171  One of these reforms entailed the abolition of the EU s sugar regime  which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU  141   edit  Education and science Main articles  Educational policies and initiatives of the European Union and Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development Renewable energy is one priority in transnational research activities such as the FP7 Education and science are areas where the EU s role is limited to supporting national governments  In education  the policy was mainly developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility  The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme  a university exchange programme which began in 1987  In its first 20 years it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1 5 million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life  174  There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers  for trainees in vocational education and training  and for adult learners in the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007 2013  These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU  175  Through its support of the Bologna process the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe  Scientific development is facilitated through the EU s Framework Programmes  the first of which started in 1984  The aims of EU policy in this area are to co ordinate and stimulate research  The independent European Research Council allocates EU funds to European or national research projects  176  The Seventh Framework Programme  FP7  deals in a number of areas  for example energy where it aims to develop a diverse mix of renewable energy for the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels  177   edit  Health care European Health Insurance Card   French version pictured  Although the EU has no major competences in the field of health care  Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms that  A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities   All the member states have either publicly sponsored and regulated universal health care or publicly provided universal health care  The public plans in some countries provide basic or  sick  coverage only  their citizens can purchase supplemental insurance for additional coverage  The European Commission s Directorate General for Health and Consumers seeks to align national laws on the protection of people s health  on the consumers  rights  on the safety of food and other products  178  179  180  Health care in the EU is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level  The systems are primarily publicly funded through taxation  universal health care   Private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private  non subsidised  health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance  All EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free European Health Insurance Card which  on a reciprocal basis  provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries  181  A directive on cross border healthcare aims at promoting cooperation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high quality cross border healthcare for European patients  182  183  184   edit  Demographics Main article  Demographics of the European Union On 23 October

alphabet  199  Besides the 23 official languages  there are about 150 regional and minority languages  spoken by up to 50 million people  199  Of these  only the Spanish regional languages  that is  Catalan  Galician  and the non Indo European Basque   Scottish Gaelic  and Welsh 200  can be used by citizens in communication with the main European institutions  201  Although EU programmes can support regional and minority languages  the protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the individual member states  The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage   edit  Religion Main article  Religion in the European Union The percentage of Europeans in each member state who believe in  a God   202  The EU is a secular body with no formal connection with any religion  but Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union recognises the  status under national law of churches and religious associations  as well as that of  philosophical and non confessional organisations   203  The preamble to the Treaty on European Union mentions the  cultural  religious and humanist inheritance of Europe   203  Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention Christianity or  God  or both  in the preamble of the text  but the idea faced opposition and was dropped  204  Christians in the EU are divided among followers of Roman Catholicism  numerous Protestant denominations  especially in northern Europe   and Orthodoxy  in Greece  Cyprus  Bulgaria and Romania   Other religions  such as Islam and Judaism  are also represented in the EU population  As of 2009  the EU had an estimated Muslim population of 13 million  205  and an estimated Jewish population of over a million  206  Eurostat s Eurobarometer opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52  of EU citizens believed in a god  27  in  some sort of spirit or life force   and 18  had no form of belief  202  Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years  207  The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia  16   and the Czech Republic  19    202  The most religious countries are Malta  95   predominantly Roman Catholic   and Cyprus and Romania both with about 90  of the citizens believing in God  both predominantly Eastern Orthodox   Across the EU  belief was higher among women  increased with age  those with religious upbringing  those who left school at 15 with a basic education  and those  positioning themselves on the right of the political scale  57     202   edit  Culture and sport Main articles  Cultural policies of the European Union and Sport policies of the European Union Maribor in Slovenia  left  and Guimar es in Portugal  right  are the European Capitals of Culture in 2012 Cultural co operation between member states has been a concern of the EU since its inclusion as a community competency in the Maastricht Treaty  208  Actions taken in the cultural area by the EU include the Culture 2000 7 year programme  208  the European Cultural Month event  209  the Media Plus programme  210  orchestras such as the European Union Youth Orchestra 211  and the European Capital of Culture programme   where one or more cities in the EU are selected for one year to assist the cultural development of that city  212  Sport is mainly the responsibility of an individual member states or other international organisations rather than that of the EU  However  there are some EU policies that have had an impact on sport  such as the free movement of workers which was at the core of the Bosman ruling  which prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship  213  The Treaty of Lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity  214  This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the International Olympic Committee and FIFA  due to objections over the applications of free market principles to sport which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs  215  The EU does fund a program for Israeli  Jordanian  Irish and British football coaches  as part of the Football 4 Peace project  216   edit  See also Geography portal Europe portal European Union portal Book  European Union Wikipedia books are collections of articles that can be
