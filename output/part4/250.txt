Romance novel From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article is about the genre of fiction involving love and lust  For classical Romance novels  see Romanticism  For the medieval genre  see Romance  heroic literature   For the novel named  Romance   see Romance  novel   Jane Austen was a pioneer of the genre  A 19th century illustration from Sense and Sensibility  The romance novel is a literary genre developed in Western culture  mainly in English speaking countries  Novels in this genre place their primary focus on the relationship and romantic love between two people  and must have an  emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending   1  Through the late 20th and early 21st centuries  these novels are commercially in two main varieties  category romances  which are shorter books with a one month shelf life  and single title romances  which are generally longer with a longer shelf life  Separate from their type  a romance novel can exist within one of many subgenres  including contemporary  historical  science fiction and paranormal  One of the earliest romance novels was Samuel Richardson s popular 1740 novel Pamela  or Virtue Rewarded  which was revolutionary on two counts  it focused almost entirely on courtship and did so entirely from the perspective of a female protagonist  In the next century  Jane Austen expanded the genre  and her Pride and Prejudice is often considered the epitome of the genre  Austen inspired Georgette Heyer  who introduced historical romances in 1921  A decade later  British company Mills and Boon began releasing the first category romance novels  Their books were resold in North America by Harlequin Enterprises Ltd  which began direct marketing to readers and allowing mass market merchandisers to carry the books  It is often claimed that the modern romance genre was born in 1972 with Avon s publication of Kathleen Woodiwiss s The Flame and the Flower  the first single title romance novel to be published as an original paperback in the US  though in the UK the romance genre was long established through the works of Georgette Heyer  Catherine Cookson  and others  Nancy Coffey was the senior editor who negotiated the multi book deal  The genre boomed in the 1980s  with the addition of many category romance lines and an increased number of single title romances  Popular authors began pushing the boundaries of the genre and plots  and characters began to modernize  In North America  romance novels are the most popular genre in modern literature  comprising almost 55  of all paperback books sold in 2004  The genre is also popular in Europe and Australia  and romance novels appear in 90 languages  Most of the books  however  are written by authors from English speaking countries  leading to an Anglo Saxon perspective in the fiction  Despite the popularity and widespread sales of romance novels  the genre has attracted significant derision  skepticism and criticism

External links  edit  Definition According to the Romance Writers of America  the main plot of a romance novel must revolve around the two people as they develop romantic love for each other and work to build a relationship together  Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship although the novel can also contain subplots that do not specifically relate to the main characters  romantic love  Furthermore  a romance novel must have an  emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending   Others  including Leslie Gelbman  a president of the Berkley Group  define the genre more simply  stating only that a romance must make the  romantic relationship between the hero and the heroine     the core of the book   2  In general  romance novels reward characters who are good people and penalize those who are evil  and a couple who fights for and believes in their relationship will likely be rewarded with unconditional love  1  Bestselling author Nora Roberts sums up the genre  saying  The books are about the celebration of falling in love and emotion and commitment  and all of those things we really want   3 Women s fiction  including chick lit  is not directly a subcategory of the romance novel genre  because in women s fiction the heroine s relationship with her family or friends may be equally as important as her relationship with the hero  2  Some romance novel authors and readers believe the genre has additional restrictions  from plot considerations such as the protagonists meeting early on in the story  to avoiding themes such as adultery  Other disagreements have centered on the firm requirement for a happy ending  Some readers admit stories without a happy ending  if the focus of the story is on the romantic love between the two main characters  e g  Romeo and Juliet   While the majority of romance novels meet the stricter criteria  there are also many books that are widely considered to be romance novels that deviate from these rules  Therefore  the general definition  as embraced by the RWA and publishers  includes only the focus on a developing romantic relationship and an optimistic ending  4  5  As long as a romance novel meets those twin criteria  it can be set in any time period and in any location  There are no specific restrictions on what can or cannot be included in a romance novel  1  Even controversial subjects are addressed in romance novels  including topics such as date rape  domestic violence  addiction  and disability  6  The combination of time frame  location  and plot elements does  however  help a novel to fit into one of several romance subgenres  1  Despite the numerous possibilities this framework allows  many people in the mainstream press claim that  all  romance novels  seem to read alike   7  Stereotypes of the romance genre abound  For instance  some believe that all romance novels are similar to those of Danielle Steel  featuring rich  glamorous people traveling to exotic locations  8  Many romance readers disagree that Steel writes romance at all  considering her novels more mainstream fiction  9  Romance novels are sometimes referred to as  smut  or female pornography  10  11  and are the most popular form of modern erotica for women  12  While some romance novels do contain more erotic acts  in other romance novels the characters do no more than kiss chastely  The romance genre runs the spectrum between these two extremes  13  Because women buy 90  of all romance novels  12  most romance novels are told from a woman s viewpoint  in either first or third person  14  Although most romance novels are about heterosexual pairings there is a sizeable amount of romance novels that deal with same sex relationships  This is often considered a subgenre   edit  Formats Romance novels are divided into two sub sets  category romances  also known as series romances  and single title romances  1  Many authors write only within one of the formats  but others  including Jayne Ann Krentz and Jennifer Crusie  have achieved success in both formats  15   edit  Category romance Category romances are short  usually no more than 200 pages  or about 55 000 words  16  17  The books are published in clearly delineated lines  with a certain number of books published in each line every month  In many cases  the books are numbered sequentially within the line  1  These novels have widespread distribution often worldwide but a single U S  print run  remaining on a bookseller s shelves until they are sold out or until the next month s titles are released and take their place  15  Writers for the largest publisher of category romance  Harlequin Mills  amp  Boon  can find their novels translated into 26 languages and sold in over 100 international markets  18  To write a successful novel of this length  the  author must pare the story down to its essentials  Subplots and minor characters are eliminated or relegated to the backstory   17  Nonetheless  category romance lines each have a distinct identity  which may involve similar settings  characters  time periods  levels of sensuality  or types of conflict  Publishers of category romances usually issue guidelines for each line  specifying the elements necessary for a novel to be included in each line  19  20  21  Depending on the current market and perceived reader preferences  publishers frequently begin new lines or end existing ones  Most recently  erotic and Christian lines have been introduced while traditional Regency romance lines have ended  22   edit  Single title romances Single titles novels are romance novels not published as part of a publisher s category  They are longer than category romances  typically between 350 and 400 pages  or 100 000 110 000 words  16  Publishers may release the novels over a shorter space of time for sales velocity and publicity reasons  but on average authors write 1 5 novels per year and have one each year published  2  23  Single title novels remain on the booksellers  shelves at the discretion of the store  24  Despite their name  single title novels are not always standalone novels  Some authors prefer to write several interconnected books  ranging in number from trilogies to long running series  so that they can revisit characters or worlds  Such sets of books often have similar titles  and may be labelled as  Number 1 in the XXX Series   but they are not considered series romances because they are not part of a particular line  25   edit  Subgenres Subgenre Popularity in the United States  2006  26  Subgenre   of market Category romance 40  Historical romance 17  Contemporary romance 16  Paranormal romance 9  Romantic suspense 7  Inspirational romance 6  All others 5  Because the definition of a romance novel does not limit the types of plot devices  time frames  or locations that can be included  the genre has grown to encompass a wide variety of material and spawned multiple sub genres  Sub genres of romance are often closely related to other literature genres  and some books could be considered a romance subgenre novel and another genre novel at the same time  For example  romantic suspense novels are often similar to mysteries  crime fiction and thrillers  and paranormal romances use elements popular in science fiction and fantasy novels   edit  Contemporary romance Main article  Contemporary romance Contemporary romance  which is set after World War II  27  is often what people mean when they refer to a romance novel  Contemporary romance novels the largest sub genre are set in the time when they are written  and usually reflect the mores of that time  Heroines in contemporary romances prior to 1970 usually quit working when they marry or have children while heroines after 1970 usually have  and keep  a career  28  As contemporary romance novels have grown to contain more complex plotting and more realistic characters  the line between this sub genre and the genre of women s fiction has blurred  29  Most contemporary romance novels contain elements that date the books  The majority of them eventually become irrelevant to more modern readers and go out of print  29  Those that survive the test of time  such as Jane Austen s work  are often reclassified as historical romances  28  Over half of the romantic fiction published in the United States in 2004  1468 out of 2 285 books  were contemporary romance novels  30  Contemporary romance novels have twice been chosen by Kelly Ripa to be featured in her Reading with Ripa book club  31   edit  Historical romance Main article  Historical romance Historical romance is set before World War II  27  This subgenre includes a wide variety of other subgenres  including Regency romance  Historical romance novels are rarely published in hardcover  with fewer than 15 receiving that status each year  less than one fifth of the number of contemporary romance novels published in that format  Because historical romances are primarily published in mass market format  their fortunes are tied to a certain extent to the mass market trends  Booksellers and large merchandisers now sell fewer mass market paperbacks  preferring trade paperbacks or hardcovers  which prevents historical romances from being sold in some price clubs and other mass merchandise outlets  32  In 2001  778 historical romances were published  a 10 year high  By 2004  the annual number had dropped to 486  which was still 20  of all romance novels published  Kensington Books says they receive fewer submissions of historical novels  and their previously published authors have switched to contemporary  30  32   edit  Romantic suspense Romantic suspense involves an intrigue or mystery for the protagonists to solve  27  Typically  however  the heroine is the victim of a crime or attempted crime  and works with a hero  who tends to be in a field where he would serve as a protector  such as a police officer  FBI agent  bodyguard  or Navy SEAL  33  34  By the end of the novel  the mystery is resolved and the interaction between the hero and heroine has evolved into a solid relationship  33  These novels primarily take place in contemporary times  but authors such as Amanda Quick have broadened the genre to also include historical timeframes  35  Like all romances  romantic suspense novels must place the development of a relationship between the protagonists at the heart of the story  The relationship  must impact each decision they make and increase the tension of the suspense as it propel the story  In turn  the events of suspense must also directly affect the relationship and move the story forward   36  Romantic suspense novels tend to have more  clean  language  without the  emotional  intimate  descriptions often used in more traditional romances  36  Because the mystery is a crucial aspect of the plot  these novels are more plot driven instead of character driven  36  This blend of the romance and mystery was perfected by Mary Stewart  who wrote ten romantic suspense novels between 1955 and 1967  Stewart was one of the first to seamlessly combine the two genres  maintaining a full mystery while focusing on the courtship between two people  37  In her novels  the process of solving the mystery  helps to illuminate  the hero s personality  helping the heroine to fall in love with him  38   edit  Paranormal romance Main article  Paranormal romance Paranormal romance blends the real with the fantastic or science fictional  The fantastic elements may be woven into an alternate version of our own world in an urban fantasy involving vampires  demons  and or werewolves  or they may be more  normal  manifestations of the paranormal humans with psychic abilities  witches  or ghosts  Time travel  futuristic  and extraterrestrial romances also fall beneath the paranormal umbrella  27  39  These novels often blend elements of other subgenres including suspense  mystery  or chick lit with their fantastic themes  40  A few paranormals are set solely in the past and are structured much like any historical romance novel  Others are set in the future  sometimes on different worlds  Still others have a time travel element with either the hero or the heroine traveling into the past or the future  5  Between 2002 and 2004  the number of paranormal romances published in the United States doubled to 170 per year  A popular title in the genre can sell over 500 000 copies  41  Many paranormal romances rely on the blend of contemporary American life with the existence of supernatural or magically empowered beings  human or otherwise  sometimes the larger culture is aware of the magical in its midst  sometimes it isn t  Some paranormal romances focus less on the specifics of their alternative worlds than do traditional science fiction or fantasy novels  keeping the attention strongly on the underlying romance  35  Others develop the alternate reality meticulously  combining well planned magical systems and inhuman cultures with contemporary reality   edit  Science Fiction romance The first futuristic romance to be marketed by a mainstream romance publisher  Jayne Ann Krentz s Sweet Starfire  was published in 1986 and was a  classic road trip romance  that just happened to be set in a separate galaxy  42  This genre has become more popular since 2000  Krentz attributes the popularity of this romance genre to the fact that the novels  are  at heart  classic historical romances that just happen to be set on other worlds   42  A science fiction romance is a romance novel that takes place in a story that would otherwise be classified as a science fiction story   edit  Fantasy romance Main article  Romantic fantasy Fantasy Romance  also known as Romantic Fantasy  is a subgenre of fantasy fiction  describing a fantasy story using many of the elements and conventions of the romance genre  Romantic fantasy has been published by both fantasy and romance lines  with some publishers distinguishing between  fantasy romance  being more like a contemporary fantasy novel with romantic elements  and  romantic fantasy  with more emphasis on the romance elements of the story  43   edit  Time travel romances Time travel romances are a version of the classic  fish out of water  story  In most  the heroine is from the present day and travels into the past to meet the hero  In a smaller subset of these novels  the hero  who lives in the past  travels forward into his future to meet the heroine  A successful time travel romance must have the characters react logically to their experience and should investigate some of the differences  both physical and mental  between the world the character normally inhabits and the one where they landed  Some writers end their novels with the protagonists trapped in different time periods and unable to be together to the displeasure of many readers of the genre  44   edit  Inspirational romance Inspirational romance  as the market exists today  combines explicitly Christian themes with the development of a romantic relationship  27  In 2004  167 novels were published in the inspirational romance subgenre  30  These novels typically do not include gratuitous violence or swearing  and the central courtship is chaste  Sex  if it is present at all  occurs after marriage and is not explicitly detailed  Many novels in this genre also focus on the hero or heroine s faith  turning the love story into  a triangle  the man and the woman and also their relationship with God   45  Themes such as forgiveness  honesty  and fidelity are common  46  The first line of series inspirational romances debuted shortly after the 1980 U S  presidential election  when Silhouette launched their Silhouette Inspirations line  The books were aimed at born again Christians and were marketed in religious bookstores  The Silhouette Inspirations line was closed after Harlequin acquired Silhouette in 1984 because it was not profitable  47  However  Christian publishers continue to produce romance novels  including historical and contemporary   edit  Multicultural romance Multicultural romance typically features a hero and or heroine who is African American  although some multicultural lines also include Asian or Hispanic heroes or heroines or interracial relationships  48  The first line of multicultural romance novels  Arabesque  was launched by Kensington books in 1994  BET Books purchased the line in 1998  and the number of new authors that they publish has continued to expand each year  BET has also developed some of the Arabesque novels into made for television movies  49  In 1999  Kensington Publishing launched the first line of Latino romance novels   ENCANTO  The ENCANTO novels were originally released in two ways   a bilingual Spanish English version and a Spanish only version  Two novels were published every month until late 2001 when the line went into hiatus  Despite the demise of the line  several of the ENCANTO authors have continued writing novels with Latino protagonists namely  Sylvia Mendoza  Tracy Montoya  Caridad Pineiro  Berta Platas  Lara Rios and Lynda Sandoval  Although romance novels featuring African Americans and Hispanic protagonists are becoming more popular  those featuring Asian or Asian American characters are rare  Author Tess Gerritsen believes this is due to the fact that there are fewer Asian American women who read romances   We read romances because we want to feel good about love   in order to do that  the reader must identify with the heroine   50   edit  Erotic romance Erotic romance  sometimes called romantica  is a blend of romance and erotica  Erotic romance novels are characterized by strong sexual content  but can contain elements of any of the other romance subgenres  Erotic romance novels tend to use more frank language  avoiding many of the euphemisms used in books with milder content  These novels also usually include more sex scenes  often focusing more on the sex act rather than being a more traditional love scene  and may include more unusual positions or acts  51  Despite a greater emphasis on the sex scenes  however  erotic romance is not to be confused with pornography  Pornography concentrates on the sex acts  but erotic novels include well developed characters and a plot that could exist without the sex acts  52  Erotic romances lengths run from short stories to single title novels  Some of these are published as part of a category  such as Harlequin Blaze  while others are published as part of an anthology and are only novella length  Even single title erotic romances may be as short as a novella  however  51  Many of the publishers of erotic romance are either small press publishers or electronic book publishers  Writers often have more leeway in what types of erotic acts can be included when working with an electronic publisher than they would have working with a print publisher  51  The market for erotic romances has been growing rapidly  leading some publishers to create new lines for these types of books  53  Some subjects are still considered taboo  even with erotic romance  Themes such as pedophilia  incest  and bestiality are discouraged by all publishers  51  The market for erotic romances has grown rapidly  Ellora s Cave  an electronic publisher that focuses on erotic romance  became the first electronic publisher recognized by the Romance Writers of America as a legitimate publisher  52   edit  History  edit  Development One of the earliest romance novels was Pamela  or Virtue Rewarded  by Samuel Richardson  Published in 1740  Pamela was the first popular novel to be based on a courtship as told from the perspective of the heroine  Unlike many of the novels of the time  Pamela had a happy ending  The book was one of the first bestsellers  with five editions printed in the first eleven months of release  54  The genre did not fully take form  however  until the nineteenth century  2  Elizabeth tells her father that Darcy was responsible for uniting Lydia and Wickham  This is one of the two earliest illustrations of Pride and Prejudice  55  Jane Austen is widely considered to be one of the masters of the romance novel genre  and Pride and Prejudice  published in 1813  has been rightly called  the best romance novel ever written   56  Critics  however  lamented that Austen s works reinforced the sexist stereotype  i e  economic and social reality that to avoid poverty that women must marry   57  In the early part of the Victorian era  the Bront  sisters built upon Austen s work with their novels  Charlotte Bront  s Jane Eyre  published in 1847  introduced the orphaned heroine  Incorporating elements of both gothic novels and Elizabethan drama  Jane Eyre  demonstrate d  the flexibility of the romance novel form   58  The genre continued to be popular into the twentieth century  In 1919  E M  Hull s novel The Sheik was published in the United Kingdom  The novel  which became hugely popular  was adapted into a movie  which established star Rudolph Valentino as the top male actor of the time  The hero of this book was an iconic alpha male who kidnapped the heroine and won her admiration through his forceful actions  The novel was one of the first to introduce the rape fantasy  Although women were gaining more independence in life  publishers believed that readers would only accept premarital sex in the context of rape  In this novel and those that followed  the rape was depicted as more of a fantasy  the heroine is rarely if ever shown experiencing terror  stress  or trauma as a result  59  The first historical romances appeared in 1921  when Georgette Heyer began writing romances set during the English Regency period  1811  1820   when the Prince Regent ruled Great Britain in place of his ill father  George III  Heyer was inspired by Austen s novels  Austen also wrote romances set in the Regency period  but she was describing the times she lived in  so her novels were contemporary  Because Heyer set her writing amid events that occurred over 100 years previously  she had to include more detail on the time period to help her readers understand  60  Unlike other romance novels of the time  Heyer s novels used the setting as a plot device  Her characters often contained more modern day sensibilities  and more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine s eccentricities  such as wanting to marry for love  61  Heyer was a prolific author  and write one to two historical romance novels per year until her death in 1974  62   edit  Rise of the category romance In the 1930s  Mills and Boon began releasing hardback romance novels  The books were sold through weekly two penny libraries and were known as  the books in brown  for their brown binding  In the 1950s  the company began offering the books for sale through newsagents across the United Kingdom  63  A Canadian company  Harlequin Enterprises  began distributing in North America in 1957 the category romances published by Mills and Boon  64  Mary Bonneycastle  wife of Harlequin founder Richard Bonneycastle  and her daughter  Judy Burgess  exercised editorial control over which Mills and Boon novels Harlequin reprinted  They had a  decency code   and rejected more sexually explicit material that Mills and Boon submitted for reprinting  Realizing that the genre was popular  Richard Bonneycastle finally decided to read a romance novel  He chose one of the more explicit novels and enjoyed it  On his orders  the company conducted a market test with the novel he had read and discovered that it outsold a similar  tamer novel  65  Overall  the novels were short and formulaic  featuring heroines who were sweet  compassionate  pure and innocent  The few heroines who worked did so in traditional female jobs  including as nurses  governesses and secretaries  Intimacy in the novels never extended beyond a chaste kiss between the protagonists  64  On October 1  1971  Harlequin purchased Mills and Boon  By this point  the romance novel genre     had been popularized and distributed widely to an enthusiastic audience  in Great Britain  In an attempt to duplicate Mills and Boon s success in North America  Harlequin improved their distribution and marketing system  66  By choosing to sell their books  where the women are   they allowed many mass market merchandisers and even supermarkets to sell the books  all of which were exactly 192 pages  Harlequin then began a reader service  selling directly to readers who agreed to purchase a certain number of books each month  67   edit  Birth of modern romance Kathleen Woodiwiss s The Flame and the Flower The modern romance genre was born in 1972 with Avon s publication of Kathleen Woodiwiss s The Flame and the Flower  the first romance novel  to  follow  the principals into the bedroom   68  69  Aside from its content  the book was revolutionary in that it was one of the first single title romance novels to be published as an original paperback  rather than being first published in hardcover  and  like the category romances  was distributed in drug stores and other mass market merchandising outlets  70  The novel went on to sell 2 35 million copies  71  Avon followed its release with the 1974 publication of Woodiwiss s second novel  The Wolf and the Dove and two sexy novels by newcomer Rosemary Rogers  Sweet Savage Love and Dark Fires  The latter sold two million copies in its first three months of release  By 1975  Publishers Weekly had reported that the  Avon originals  had sold a combined 8 million copies  70  The following year over 150 historical romance novels  many of them paperback originals  were published  selling over 40 million copies  71  The success of these novels prompted a new style of writing romance  concentrating primarily on historical fiction tracking the monogamous relationship between a helpless heroine and the hero who rescued her  even if he had been the one to place her in danger  6  The covers of these novels tended to feature scantily clad women being grabbed by the hero  and caused the novels to be referred to as  bodice rippers   68  A Wall St  Journal article in 1980 referred to these bodice rippers as  publishing s answer to the Big Mac  They are juicy  cheap  predictable  and devoured in stupefying quantities by legions of loyal fans   72  The term bodice ripper is now considered offensive to many in the romance industry  68  In this new style of historical romance  heroines were independent and strong willed and were often paired with heroes who evolved into caring and compassionate men who truly admired the women they loved  73  This was in contrast to the contemporary romances published during this time  which were often characterized by weak females who fell in love with overbearing alpha males  74  Although these heroines had active roles in the plot  they were  passive in relationships with the heroes   75  Across the genre  heroines during this time were usually aged 16 21  with the heroes slightly older  usually around 30  The women were virgins  while the men were not  and both members of the couple were described as beautiful  76   edit  Category romance adapts Category romance lines were slower to react to some of the changes that had swept the historical romance subgenre  Despite the fact that the former Mills  amp  Boon lines were now owned by a North American company  the lines did not have any American writers until 1975  when Harlequin purchased a novel by Janet Dailey  77  78  Dailey s novels provided the romance genre s  first look at heroines  heroes and courtships that take place in America  with American sensibilities  assumptions  history  and most of all  settings   79  Harlequin was unsure how the market would react to this new type of romance  and was unwilling to fully embrace it  In the late 1970s  a Harlequin editor rejected a manuscript by Nora Roberts  who has since become the top selling romance author  because  they already had their American writer   80  In 1980  Simon and Schuster formed Silhouette Books to take advantage of the untapped talent of the American writers  81  They published several lines of category romance  and encouraged their writers to create stronger heroines and less dominant heroes  Authors were also expected to address contemporary issues where appropriate  82  Silhouette soon saw their market share expand  and in 1984  Harlequin acquired them  Despite the acquisition  Silhouette continued to retain editorial control and to publish various lines under their own imprint  66  Harlequin had also failed to adapt quickly to the signs that readers appreciated novels with more explicit sex scenes  and in 1980  several publishers entered the category romance market to fill that gap  That year  Dell launched their Candlelight Ecstasy line with Amii Lorin s The Tawny Gold Man  becoming the first line to waive the requirement that heroines be virgins  By the end of 1983 sales for the Candlelight Ecstasy line totaled  30 million  Silhoeutte also launched similar lines  Desire  sexually explicit  and Special Edition  sexually explicit and longer stories  up to 250 pages   each of which had a 90 100  sellout rate each month  83  A 1982 survey of romance readers confirmed that the new styles of writing were attracting new readers to the genre  35  of the readers surveyed had begun reading romances after 1977  An additional 31  of those surveyed had been readers for between 6 and 10 years  meaning they had become interested in the genre after 1972  when Woodiwiss s revolutionary novel was published  This means that two thirds of those surveyed joined the genre after it had begun to change  84  The number of category romance lines increased at a rapid pace  and by 1985 there were 16 separate lines producing a total of 80 novels per month  85  The sudden increase in category romance lines meant an equally sudden increase in demand for writers of the new style of romance novel  This tight market caused a proportionate decrease in the quality of the novels that were being released  By 1984  the market was saturated with category lines and readers had begun to complain of redundancy in plots  86  The following year  the  dampening effect of the high level of redundancy associated with series romances was evident in the decreased number of titles being read per month   87  Harlequin s return rate  which had been less than 25  in 1978  when it was the primary provider of category romance  swelled to 60   88   edit  Further change The genre continued to expand in the mid to late 1980s  as publishers realized that the more popular authors were often those who stretched the boundaries of the genre  A 1984 novel by LaVyrle Spencer featured an overweight  middle aged hero who had to make drastic changes to his lifestyle to win the heroine  while a 1987 Dailey novel involved an ugly hero and a heroine who was searching for her birth mother  89 Jayne Ann Krentz s 1986 novel Sweet Starfire became the first futuristic romance  combining elements of traditional romance novels and science fiction  42  The relationships had also modernized  by the 1990s  it was rare to see a book that featured a man raping his future wife  74  A Knight in Shining Armor  the first book to be published by a romance author transitioning from mass market originals to hardback  The cover uses the new landscape cover style  In the mid to late 1980s  contemporary romances began to feature women in more male dominated jobs  such as offshore oil rigs and the space program  By the early 1990s  the pendulum had swung back to feature heroines who were self employed  The age range of heroines also began to expand  so that books began to feature women who had already reached 30 and even 40  Heroes also changed  with some authors veering towards a more sensitive man  Despite the broadening of some aspects of the plot  other taboos remained  and publishers discouraged authors from writing about controversial subjects such as terrorism  warfare  and masculine sports  90  Romance novels began to contain more humor beginning in the 1990s  as Julie Garwood began introducing a great deal of humor into her historical romances  91  The romance novel began to expand in other ways as well  92  In 1989  author Jude Deveraux became the first romance author to transition from writing original mass market paperbacks to being published in hardcover  Her novel  A Knight in Shining Armor   became a natural bestseller   2  Several authors found success writing single title romances set in contemporary times  and publishing houses began to encourage the growth in the genre  Because the novels were set in modern times  they could include more of the elements that modern women could relate to  and soon began to touch on themes such as single parenthood  adoption  and abuse  92  By 2000  the covers had begun to evolve from featuring a scantily clad couple to instead showing a view of the landscape featured in the novel  2  As women s career options have expanded in real life  so have those of their fictional counterparts  In the earliest Harlequin romance novels  heroines were typically nurses and secretaries  As time has passed and women have entered the workforce in larger numbers  romance heroines have spanned the career spectrum  93  Modern romance novels now feature more balanced relationships between men and women  6   edit  Markets  edit  North America The romance fiction market  has been impervious to the overall economic recession  with faithful readers spending up to  40 a month  on romance novels in 1982  94  That year  paperback romances totaled  300 million in sales  and the total audience was estimated at 20 million readers  A survey of 600 regular romance readers the same year  found that they mirror the general population in age  education  and marital and socioeconomic status   Over half of the women had at least some college education  and 40  were employed full time  60  of the women surveyed read at least one romance every two days  The women admitted to reading romances as an antidote to stress  for mental escape  and to learn about history and new careers  95  The romance novel market continued to expand  so that by 1991  they comprised 46  of all mass market paperbacks sold in the US  This expansion was due in part to voracious readers  with over half of Harlequin s customers purchasing 30 novels per month  By this time  the romance novel audience had become more educated  with 45  having a college degree  and more than half of the audience worked outside the home  96  By the 2000s  romance had become the most popular genre in modern literature  In 2008  romantic fiction generated  1 37 billion in sales  with 7 311 romance novels published and making up 13 5  of the consumer book market  Over 74 million people claimed to have read at least one romance novel in 2008  according to a Romance Writers of America study  Nine point five percent of romance readers identified themselves as male  and the study reported that romance readers were more likely to be married or living with a partner  Of the entire American population  24 6  read at least one romance novel in 2008  30   edit  International markets   Along with cowboys and horses  the authors were told to skip ethnic heroes  for European readers  and not to let family members steal too much of the limelight   But secret babies sell quite well  as do marriages of convenience  or arranged marriages and  of course  alpha heroes   Stoecker said     The New York Times  2004 97  74 8 million people read an English language romance novel in 2008  12  Harlequin sells more than 4 books per second  half of them internationally  Author Heather Graham attributes this to the fact that  emotions translate easily   98  In the United Kingdom  over 20  of all fiction books sold each year are romance novels  99  Although romance novels are translated into over 90 languages  69  the majority of authors of these works are from Great Britain  the United States  Canada  or  to a lesser extent  Australia  97  Even in France  where over 12 million romance novels are sold each year  all of the books are translations  69  This leads to a more Anglo Saxon perspective in the fiction  which at times can be much less successful in a European market  Although Italy is the strongest foreign market for the chick lit sold by single title imprint Red Dress Ink  in that country romance readers do not care to read books about cowboys  as this type of occupation was not common in their culture  The paranormal romance genre is not popular in countries such as Poland and Russia  although historical romance tends to be very successful  97  Inspirational romance does not sell well in Europe  where romances that feature babies are very popular  69  Some publishing companies in Germany refuse to allow their romance authors to use their own names  fearing that the German audience will not buy a romance novel that does not have an Anglo American pseudonym  German readers enjoy reading more erotic romance novels  97  and some German translations of English romance novels expand or insert love scenes into otherwise tame stories  The alternate scenario also occurs  as other German translators censor the love scenes  100  In 2004  sales of romance novels in Australia increased 28  over the year before  Between 1999 and 2004 there was an increase of 40 50  in the number of new titles released  Harlequin received 20 000 unsolicited manuscripts each year  India is recently witnessing a surge in the demand of Romantic novels with the success of some heavy dosed novels such as I too had a love story  Love was never mine  2 States  Can love happen twice etc   101   edit  Awards Further information  Romance Writers of America Awards The most prestigious and notable awards for romance novels are the RITA Awards  which are presented annually by the Romance Writers of America to the best novels in romantic fiction  102   edit  Critical attention  Romances are  in fact  subversive literature  They encourage women to be dissatisfied with inequality  and to set higher expectations for themselves  and they show them ways to achieve those expectations  largely by taming men and  in a way  usurping their power  Romances are arguably the only art form of any kind that portrays women as equal partners with men     David Pollard The romance genre has been popularly derided and critically ignored  Despite recent rehabilitation and merging of the genre with other genres  the stigma attached to the romance genre continues to be strong  with some dedicated readers embarrassed to admit to buying or even reading the books  3  The romance genre has over the years generated significant derision  skepticism and criticism  Some critics point to a lack of suspense  as it is obvious that the hero and heroine will eventually resolve their issues  and wonder whether it is beneficial  for women to be whiling away so many hours reading impossibly glamorized love stories   3  According to fiction author Melissa Pritchard  a romance novel  perpetuates something slightly dangerous  that there s this notion  that there s this perfect love out there  and it can distract you from the work of loving yourself   103  Romance novelists attribute the stigma to the fact that romance is the only genre  written almost exclusively by women for women   3  Romance novelist Jennifer Crusie counters that in the modern romance novel  a woman is rewarded with unconditional love  only  if she remains true to herself   75  while novelist Susan Elizabeth Phillips believes that romance novels are popular because the heroine always wins  sometimes overcoming great odds so that she is no longer a victim  24   edit  See also Novels portal List of romantic novelists Romance film  edit  Footnotes   a b c d
