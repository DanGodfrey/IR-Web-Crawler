agencies Main article  Bank regulation in the United States Bank regulation in the United States is highly fragmented compared with other G10countries  where most countries have only one bank regulator  In the U S   banking is regulated at both the federal and state level  Depending on the type of charter a banking organization has and on its organizational structure  it may be subject to numerous federal and state banking regulations  Unlike Japan and the United Kingdom  where regulatory authority over the banking  securities and insurance industries is combined into one single financial service agency   the U S  maintains separate securities  commodities  and insurance regulatory agencies separate from the bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state level  2  U S  banking regulation addresses privacy  disclosure  fraud prevention  anti money laundering  anti terrorism  anti usury lending  and the promotion of lending to lower income populations  Some individual cities also enact their own financial regulation laws  for example  defining what constitutes usurious lending   Since the enactment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1989  FDICIA   all commercial banks that accept deposits are required to obtain FDIC insurance and to have a primary federal regulator  the Fed for state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System  the FDIC for  nonmember  state banks  and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for all National Banks   Federal credit unions are regulated by National Credit Union Administration  NCUA   Savings  amp  Loan Associations  S amp L  and Federal savings banks  FSB  are regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision  OTS    edit  Federal Reserve system Main article  Federal Reserve system The central banking system of the United States  called the Federal Reserve system  was created in 1913 by the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act  largely in response to a series of financial panics  particularly a severe panic in 1907  3  4  5  Over time  the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and its structure has evolved  4  6  Events such as the Great Depression were major factors leading to changes in the system  7  Its duties today  according to official Federal Reserve documentation  are to conduct the nation s monetary policy  supervise and regulate banking institutions  maintain the stability of the financial system and provide financial services to depository institutions  the U S  government  and foreign official institutions  8  The Federal Reserve System s structure is composed of the presidentially appointed Board of Governors  or Federal Reserve Board   the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC   twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout the nation  numerous privately owned U S  member banks and various advisory councils  9  10  11  The FOMC is the committee responsible for setting monetary policy and consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents  though only five bank presidents vote at any given time  The responsibilities of the central bank are divided into several separate and independent parts  some private and some public  The result is a structure that is considered unique among central banks  It is also unusual in that an entity outside of the central bank  namely the United States Department of the Treasury  creates the currency used  12  According to the Board of Governors  the Federal Reserve is independent within government in that  its decisions do not have to be ratified by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branch of government   However  its authority is derived from the U S  Congress and is subject to congressional oversight  Additionally  the members of the Board of Governors  including its chairman and vice chairman  are chosen by the President and confirmed by Congress  The government also exercises some control over the Federal Reserve by appointing and setting the salaries of the system s highest level employees  Thus the Federal Reserve has both private and public aspects  13  14  15  16  The U S  Government receives all of the system s annual profits  after a statutory dividend of 6  on member banks  capital investment is paid  and an account surplus is maintained  In 2010  the Federal Reserve made a profit of  82 billion and transferred  79 billion to the U S  Treasury  17   edit  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Main article  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation The FDIC s satellite campus in Arlington  Virginia  is home to many administrative and support functions  though the most senior officials work at the main building in Washington The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  FDIC  is a United States government corporation created by the Glass Steagall Act of 1933  It provides deposit insurance  which guarantees the safety of deposits in member banks  up to  250 000 per depositor per bank  As of November 18  2010  2010  11 18  update   the FDIC insures deposits at 7 723 institutions  18  The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness  performs certain consumer protection functions  and manages banks in receiverships  failed banks   Since the start of FDIC insurance on January 1  1934  no depositor has lost any insured funds as a result of a bank failure  19   edit  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Main article  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is a U S  federal agency established by the National Currency Act of 1863 and serves to charter  regulate  and supervise all national banks and the federal branches and agencies of foreign banks in the United States  The acting Comptroller of the Currency is John Walsh   edit  Office of Thrift Supervision Main article  Office of Thrift Supervision The Office of Thrift Supervision is a United States federal agency under the Department of the Treasury  It was created in 1989 as a renamed version of another federal agency  that was faulted for its role in the Savings and loan crisis   Like other U S  federal bank regulators  it is paid by the banks it regulates   edit  Active banks of the United States A list of many commercial banks in the United States can be found at the website of the FDIC  20  According to the FDIC  there were 8 430 FDIC insured commercial banks in the United States as of August 22  2008  Every member of the Federal Reserve System is listed here along with non members who are also insured by the FDIC  This list does not include banks and investments that are not FDIC insured   edit  Bank mergers and closures Bank mergers happen for many reasons in normal business  for example  to create a single larger bank in which operations of both banks can be streamlined  to acquire another bank s brands  or due to regulators closing the institution due to unsafe and unsound business practices or inadequate capitalization and liquidity  Banks are not allowed to go bankrupt in the United States  Accounts are insured up to  250 000 as of Oct 2008 per individual per bank by the FDIC  Banks that are in danger of failing are either taken over by the FDIC  administered temporarily and eventually sold off or merged with other banks  A list of banks seized by regulators and the assuming institutions can be obtained at Federal Deposit Insurance Corp   Failed Bank list   edit  History Main article  History of banking in the United States  edit  Antebellum history In the first half of the 19th century  many of the smaller commercial banks within New England were easily chartered as laws allowed to do so  primarily due to open franchise laws   The rise of commercial banking saw an increase in opportunities for wealthy individuals to become involved in entrepreneurial projects they would not involve themselves in without someone to guarantee a return on their investment  These early banks acted as intermediaries for entrepreneurs who did not have enough wealth to fund their own investment projects and for those who did have wealth but did not want to bear the risk of investing in projects  Thus  this private banking sector witnessed an array of insider lending  due primarily to low bank leverage and an information quality correlation  but many of these banks actually spurred early investment and helped spur many later projects  Despite what some may consider discriminatory practices with insider lending  these banks actually were very sound and failures remained uncommon  further encouraging the financial evolution in the United States   edit  Early attempts to create a national bank In 1781  an act of the Congress of the Confederation established the Bank of North America in Philadelphia  where it superseded the state chartered Bank of Pennsylvania founded in 1780 to help fund the American Revolutionary War  The Bank of North America was granted a monopoly on the issue of bills of credit as currency at the national level  Prior to the ratification of the Articles of Confederation  amp  Perpetual Union  only the States had sovereign power to charter a bank authorized to issue their own bills of credit  Afterwards  Congress also had that power  Robert Morris  the first Superintendent of Finance appointed under the Articles of Confederation  proposed the Bank of North America as a commercial bank that would act as the sole fiscal and monetary agent for the government  He has accordingly been called  the father of the system of credit  and paper circulation  in the United States   21  He saw a national  for profit  private monopoly following in the footsteps of the Bank of England as necessary  because previous attempts to finance the Revolutionary War  such as continental currency issued by the Continental Congress  had led to depreciation of such an extent that Alexander Hamilton considered them to be  public embarrassments   After the war  a number of state banks were chartered  including in 1784  the Bank of New York and the Bank of Massachusetts  In 1791  Congress chartered the First Bank of the United States to succeed the Bank of North America under Article One of the United States Constitution  Section 8  However  Congress failed to renew the charter for the Bank of the United States  which expired in 1811  Similarly  the Second Bank of the United States was chartered in 1816 and shuttered in 1836   edit  Jacksonian Era Main article  Banking in the Jacksonian Era The Second Bank of the United States opened in January 1817  six years after the First Bank of the United States lost its charter  The predominant reason that the Second Bank of the United States was chartered was that in the War of 1812  the U S  experienced severe inflation and had difficulty in financing military operations  Subsequently  the credit and borrowing status of the United States was at its lowest level since its founding  The charter of the Second Bank of the United States  BUS  was for 20 years and therefore up for renewal in 1836  Its role as the depository of the federal government s revenues made it a political target of banks chartered by the individual states who objected envied the B U S  s relationship with the central government  Partisan politics came heavily into play in the debate over the renewal of the charter  President Andrew Jackson strongly opposed the renewal of its charter  and built his platform for the election of 1832 around doing away with the Second Bank of the United States  Apart from a general hostility to banking and the belief that specie  gold and or silver  were the only true money  Jackson s reasons for opposing the renewal of the charter revolved around his belief that bestowing power and responsibility upon a single bank was the cause of inflation and other perceived evils  During September 1833  President Jackson issued an executive order that ended the deposit of government funds into the Bank of the United States  After September 1833  these deposits were placed in the state chartered banks   edit  1837 1863   Free Banking  Era Prior to 1838 a bank charter could be obtained only by a specific legislative act  but in that year New York adopted the Free Banking Act  which permitted anyone to engage in banking  upon compliance with certain charter conditions  The Michigan Act  1837  allowed the automatic chartering of banks that would fulfill its requirements without special consent of the state legislature  These banks could issue bank notes against specie  gold and silver coins  and the states regulated the reserve requirements  interest rates for loans and deposits  the necessary capital ratio etc  Free banking spread rapidly to other states  and from 1840 to 1863 all banking business was done by state chartered institutions  22  Numerous banks that were started during this period ultimately proved to be unstable  23  In many Western states  the banking industry degenerated into  wildcat  banking because of the laxity and abuse of state laws  Bank notes were issued against little or no security  and credit was overexpanded  depressions brought waves of bank failures  In particular  the multiplicity of state bank notes caused great confusion and loss  The real value of a bank bill was often lower than its face value  and the issuing bank s financial strength generally determined the size of the discount  Banks failed because of joint stock rules  which enforced unreasonable capital requirements and made branches unsustainable  Free banking episodes were successful in Canada  New York State and Australia  The real value of any fiat currency issued by a national Government is often lower than the face value  inflation   and the credibility of seignorage relates to the issuing nation s economic output   edit  National Bank Act Main article  National Bank Act To correct such conditions  Congress passed  1863  the National Bank Act  which provided for a system of banks to be chartered by the federal government  The National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864 were two United States federal laws that established a system of national charters for banks  and created the United States National Banking System  They encouraged development of a national currency backed by bank holdings of U S  Treasury securities and established the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as part of the Department of the Treasury and authorized the Comptroller to examine and regulate nationally chartered banks  Congress passed the National Bank Act in an attempt to retire the greenbacks that it had issued to finance the North s effort in the American Civil War  24  This opened up an option for chartering banks nationally  As an additional incentive for banks to submit to Federal supervision  in 1865 Congress began taxing any of state bank notes  also called  bills of credit  or  scrip   a standard rate of 10   which encouraged many state banks to become national ones  This tax also gave rise to another response by state banks the widespread adoption of the demand deposit account  also known as a checking account  By the 1880s  deposit accounts had changed the primary source of revenue for many banks  The result of these events is what is known as the  dual banking system   New banks may choose either state or national charters  a bank also can convert its charter from one to the other    edit  Rise of investment banks Main article  History of investment banking in the United States  edit  Civil War During the Civil War  banking houses were syndicated to meet the federal government s need for money to fund its war efforts  Jay Cooke launched the first mass securities selling operation in U S  history employing thousands of salesmen to float what ultimately amounted to  830 million worth of government bonds to a wide group of investors  25  Cooke then reached out to the general public  acting as an agent of the Treasury Department  personally led a war bond drive that netted approximately  1 5 billion for Treasury  26  27   edit  Surging demand for capital in the Gilded Age The rise of the commercial banking sector coincided with the growth of early factories  since entrepreneurs had to rely on commercial banks in order to fund their own projects  Because of this need for capital  many banks began to arise by the late 19th century  By 1880  New England became one of the most heavily banked areas in the world  28  Lance Davis has demonstrated that the process of capital formation in the nineteenth century was markedly different between the British capital market and the American capital market  British industrialists were readily able to satisfy their need for capital by tapping a vast source of international capital through British banks such as Westminster s  Lloyds and Barclays  In contrast  the dramatic growth of the United States created capital requirements that far outstripped the limited capital resources of American banks  Investment banking in the United States emerged to serve the expansion of railroads  mining companies  and heavy industry  Unlike commercial banks  investment banks were not authorized to issue notes or accept deposits  Instead  they served as brokers or intermediaries  bringing together investors with capital and the firms that needed that capital  29  30   edit  Bimetallism and the gold standard Main article  Coinage Act of 1873 See also  Bimetallism and Gold standard Toward the end of the nineteenth century  bimetallism became a center of political conflict During the civil war  to finance the war the U S  switched from bimetallism to a flat greenback currency  In 1873  the government passed the Fourth Coinage Act and soon resumption to specie payments began without the free and unlimited coinage of silver  This put the U S  on a mono metallic gold standard  31   edit  Early 20th century During the period from 1890 1925  the investment banking industry was highly concentrated and dominated by an oligopoly that consisted of JP Morgan  amp  Co   Kuhn  Loeb  amp  Co   Brown Brothers  and Kidder  Peabody  amp  Co  There was no legal requirement to separate the operations of commercial and investment banks  as a result deposits from the commercial banking side of the business constituted an in house supply of capital that could be used to fund the underwriting business of the investment banking side  32   edit  The Panic of 1907 and the Pujo Committee Main article  Pujo Committee In 1913  the Pujo Committee unanimously determined that a small cabal of financiers had gained consolidated control of numerous industries through the abuse of the public trust in the United States  The chair of the House Committee on Banking and Currency  Representative Ars ne Pujo   D La  7th  convened a special committee to investigate a  money trust   the de facto monopoly of Morgan and New York s other most powerful bankers  The committee issued a scathing report on the banking trade that concluded that a community of influential financial leaders had gained control of major manufacturing  transportation  mining  telecommunications and financial markets of the United States  The report revealed that no less than eighteen different major financial corporations were under control of a cartel led by J P Morgan  George F Baker and James Stillman  These three men  through the resources of seven banks and trust companies  Banker s Trust Co   Guaranty Trust Co   Astor Trust Co   National Bank of Commerce  Liberty National Bank  Chase National Bank  Farmer s Loan and Trust Co   controlled an estimated  2 1 billion  The report revealed that a handful of men held manipulative control of the New York Stock Exchange and attempted to evade interstate commerce laws  The findings of the committee inspired public support for ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913  passage of the Federal Reserve Act that same year  and passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914   edit  The Federal Reserve System Main article  Federal Reserve System The Panic of 1907 was headed off by a private conglomerate  who set themselves up as  lenders of last resort  to banks in trouble  citation needed  This effort succeeded in stopping the panic  and led to calls for a Federal agency to do the same thing  citation needed  In response  the Federal Reserve System was created by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913  establishing a new central bank intended serve as a formal  lender of last resort  to banks in times of liquidity crisis panics where depositors tried to withdraw their money faster than a bank could pay it out  The legislation provided for a system that included a number of regional Federal Reserve Banks and a seven member governing board  All national banks were required to join the system and other banks could join  Congress created Federal Reserve notes to provide the nation with an elastic supply of currency  The notes were to be issued to Federal Reserve Banks for subsequent transmittal to banking institutions in accordance with the needs of the public  The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 established the present day Federal Reserve System and brought all banks in the United States under the authority of the Federal Reserve  a quasi governmental entity   creating the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks which are supervised by the Federal Reserve Board   edit  McFadden Act Main article  McFadden Act The McFadden Act was enacted in 1927 based on recommendations made by the Comptroller of Currency Henry May Dawes  The Act sought to give national banks competitive equality with state chartered banks by letting national banks branch to the extent permitted by state law  The McFadden Act specifically prohibited interstate branching by allowing each national bank to branch only within the state in which it is situated  Although the Riegle Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 33  repealed this provision of the McFadden Act  it specified that state law continues to control intrastate branching  or branching within a state s borders  for both state and national banks   edit  Credit unions Main article  Credit unions in the United States Credit unions originated in Europe in the mid 19th century  The first credit union in the United States was established in 1908 in New Hampshire  At the time  banks were unwilling to lend to many poor laborers  who then turned to corrupt moneylenders and loan sharks  34  Businessman and philanthropist Edward Filene spearheaded an effort to secure legislation for credit unions first in Massachusetts and later throughout the United States  With the help of the Credit Union National Extension Bureau and an army of volunteers  states began passing credit union legislation in the 1920s  Credit unions were formed based on a bond of association  often beginning with a small group of employees  Despite opposition from the banking industry  the Federal Credit Union Act was signed into law in 1934 as part of the New Deal  allowing the creation of federally chartered credit unions in the United States  The Credit Union National Association  CUNA  was formed and by 1937  6400 credit unions with 1 5 million members were active in 45 states  35  Today there are over 9500 credit unions in the United States and they are regulated by the National Credit Union Administration NCUA   36   edit  Savings and loan associations Main article  Savings and loan association The savings and loan association became a strong force in the early 20th century through assisting people with home ownership  through mortgage lending  and further assisting their members with basic saving and investing outlets  typically through passbook savings accounts and term certificates of deposit  The U S  Congress passed the Federal Home Loan Bank Act in 1932  during the Great Depression  It established the Federal Home Loan Bank and associated Federal Home Loan Bank Board to assist other banks in providing funding to offer long term  amortizedloans for home purchases  The idea was to get banks involved in lending  not insurance companies  and to provide realistic loans which people could repay and gain full ownership of their homes  Savings and loan associations sprang up all across the United States because there was low cost funding available through the Federal Home Loan Bank for the purposes of mortgage lending   edit  New Deal era reforms Further information  New Deal During the 1930s  the U S  and the rest of the world experienced a severe economic contraction that is now called the Great Depression  In the U S  during the height of the Great Depression  the official unemployment rate was 25  and the stock market had declined 75  since 1929  Bank runs were common because there wasn t insurance on deposits at banks  banks kept only a fraction of deposits in reserve  and customers ran the risk of losing the money that they had deposited if their bank failed  37  By the beginning of 1933  the banking system in the United States had effectively ceased to function  The incoming Roosevelt administration and the incoming Congress took immediate steps to pass legislation to respond to the Great Depression  Roosevelt entered office with enormous political capital  Americans of all political persuasions were demanding immediate action  and Roosevelt responded with a remarkable series of new programs in the  first hundred days  of the administration  in which he met with Congress for 100 days  During those 100 days of lawmaking  Congress granted every request Roosevelt asked  and passed a few programs  such as the FDIC to insure bank accounts  that he opposed  A major component of Roosevelt s New Deal was reform of the nation s banking system  With strident language Roosevelt took credit for dethroning the bankers he alleged had caused the debacle  38     edit  Emergency Banking Act Roosevelt closed all the banks in the country and kept them all closed until he could pass new legislation  39  On March 9  Roosevelt sent to Congress the Emergency Banking Act  drafted in large part by Hoover s top advisors  The act was passed and signed into law the same day  It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under Treasury Department supervision  with federal loans available if needed  Three quarters of the banks in the Federal Reserve System reopened within the next three days  Billions of dollars in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month  thus stabilizing the banking system  By the end of 1933  4 004 small local banks were permanently closed and merged into larger banks   Their depositors eventually received on average 86 cents on the dollar of their deposits  it is a common myth that they received nothing back    edit  Creation of the FDIC and FSLIC In June 1933  over Roosevelt s objections  Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  FDIC   which insured deposits for up to  2 500 beginning January 1  1934  On June 16  1933  President Franklin D  Roosevelt signed the Banking Act of 1933  This legislation  37  Established the FDIC as a temporary government corporation Gave the FDIC authority to provide deposit insurance to banks Gave the FDIC the authority to regulate and supervise state nonmember banks Funded the FDIC with initial loans of  289 million through the U S  Treasury and the Federal Reserve Extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time Separated commercial and investment banking  Glass Steagall Act  Prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts Allowed national banks to branch statewide  if allowed by state law  The FSLIC was created as part of the National Housing Act of 1934 in order to insure deposits in savings and loans  a year after the FDIC was created to insure deposits in commercial banks  It was administered by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board  FHLBB   40   edit  Abandonment of the gold standard To deal with deflation  the nation went off the gold standard  In March and April in a series of laws and executive orders  the government suspended the gold standard for US   41  Anyone holding significant amounts of gold coinage was mandated to exchange it for the existing fixed price of US dollars  after which the US would no longer pay gold on demand for the dollar  and gold would no longer be considered valid legal tender for debts in private and public contracts  The dollar was allowed to float freely on foreign exchange markets with no guaranteed price in gold  only to be fixed again at a significantly lower level a year later with the passage of the Gold Reserve Act in 1934  Markets immediately responded well to the suspension  in the hope that the decline in prices would finally end  42   edit  Glass Steagall Act of 1933 The Glass Steagall Act of 1933 was passed in reaction to the collapse of a large portion of the American commercial banking system in early 1933  One of its provisions introduced the separation of bank types according to their business  commercial and investment banking   In order to comply with the new regulation  most large banks split into separate entities  For example  JP Morgan split into three entities  JP Morgan continued to operate as a commercial bank  Morgan Stanley was formed to operate as an investment bank  and Morgan Grenfell operated as a British merchant bank  43   edit  Banking Act of 1935 The Banking Act of 1935 strengthened the powers of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in the area of credit management  tightened existing restrictions on banks engaging in certain activities  and enlarged the supervisory powers of the FDIC   edit  Bretton Woods system Main article  Bretton Woods system The Bretton Woods system of monetary management established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world s major industrial states in the mid 20th century  The Bretton Woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relations among independent nation states  Setting up a system of rules  institutions  and procedures to regulate the international monetary system  the planners at Bretton Woods established the International Monetary Fund  IMF  and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  IBRD   which today is part of the World Bank Group  The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate by tying its currency to the U S  dollar and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments   edit  Automated teller machines Main article  Automated teller machine On September 2  1969  Chemical Bank installed the first ATM in the U S  at its branch in Rockville Centre  New York  The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card  44  A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted  On Sept  2 our bank will open at 9 00 and never close again   45   edit  Nixon shock Main article  Nixon Shock In 1971  President Richard Nixon took a series of economic measures that collectively are known as the Nixon Shock  These measures included unilaterally cancelling the direct convertibility of the United States dollar to gold that essentially ended the existing Bretton Woods system of international financial exchange   edit  Deregulation of the 1980s and 1990s Legislation passed by the federal government during the 1980s  such as the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the Garn St  Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982  diminished the distinctions between banks and other financial institutions in the United States  This legislation is frequently referred to as  deregulation   and it is often blamed for the failure of over 500 savings and loan associations between 1980 and 1988  and the subsequent failure of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation  FSLIC  whose obligations were assumed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  FDIC  in 1989  However  some critics of this viewpoint  particularly libertarians  have pointed out that the federal government s attempts at deregulation granted easy credit to federally insured financial institutions  encouraging them to overextend themselves and  thus  fail   edit  Savings and loan crisis Main article  Savings and loan crisis The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s was the failure of 747 out of the 3 234 savings and loan associations in the United States   As of December 31  1995  RTC estimated that the total cost for resolving the 747 failed institutions was  87 9 billion   The remainder of the bailout was paid for by charges on savings and loan accounts 46  which contributed to the large budget deficits of the early 1990s  The concomitant slowdown in the finance industry and the real estate market may have been a contributing cause of the 1990 1991 economic recession  Between 1986 and 1991  the number of new homes constructed per year dropped from 1 8 million to 1 million  which was at the time the lowest rate since World War II  47   edit  Expansion of FDIC insurance   1989 Until 1989  national banks  those with national charters  were required to participate in the FDIC  while state banks either were required to obtain FDIC insurance by state law or they could voluntarily join it  usually in an attempt to bolster their appearance of solvency   After enactment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1989  FDICIA   all commercial banks that accepted deposits were required to obtain FDIC insurance and to have a primary federal regulator  the Fed for state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System  the FDIC for  nonmember  state banks  and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for all National Banks   Note  Federal credit unions are regulated by National Credit Union Administration  NCUA   Savings  amp  Loan Associations  S amp L  and Federal savings banks  FSB  are regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision  OTS   edit  Interstate banking This section requires expansion  The Reigle Neale Interstate Banking and Branching Act of 1994  48   edit  Repeal of the Glass Steagall Act Provisions of the Glass Steagall Act that prohibit a bank holding company from owning other financial companies were repealed on November 12  1999  by the Gramm Leach Bliley Act  49  50  The repeal of the Glass Steagall Act of 1933 effectively removed the separation that previously existed between Wall Street investment banks and depository banks  This repeal directly contributed to the severity of the Financial crisis of 2007 2010  51  52  53  54  55   edit  Late 2000s financial crisis Main article  late 2000s financial crisis The late 2000s financial crisis is considered by many economists to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s  56  It was triggered by a liquidity shortfall in the United States banking system 57  and has resulted in the collapse of large financial institutions  the bailout of banks by national governments  and downturns in stock markets around the world  In many areas  the housing market has also suffered  resulting in numerous evictions  foreclosures and prolonged vacancies  It contributed to the failure of key businesses  declines in consumer wealth estimated in the trillions of U S  dollars  and a significant decline in economic activity  leading to a severe global economic recession in 2008  58  The collapse of the U S  housing bubble  which peaked in 2006  caused the values of securities tied to U S  real estate pricing to plummet  damaging financial institutions globally  59  Questions regarding bank solvency  declines in credit availability and damaged investor confidence had an impact on global stock markets  where securities suffered large losses during 2008 and early 2009  Economies worldwide slowed during this period  as credit tightened and international trade declined  60  Critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage related financial products  and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st century financial markets  61  Governments and central banks responded with unprecedented fiscal stimulus  monetary policy expansion and institutional bailouts  There is some debate as to what role the repeal of Glass Steagall had on the late 2000s financial crisis  62  Although there have been aftershocks  the financial crisis itself ended sometime between late 2008 and mid 2009  46  63  64  While many causes for the financial crisis have been suggested  with varying weight assigned by experts  65  the United States Senate issuing the Levin Coburn Report found  that the crisis was not a natural disaster  but the result of high risk  complex financial products  undisclosed conflicts of interest  and the failure of regulators  the credit rating agencies  and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street   66  Both market based and regulatory solutions have been implemented or are under consideration  67   edit  Expansion of FDIC insurance   2008 2010 Due to the 2008 financial crisis  and to encourage businesses and high net worth individuals to keep their cash in the largest banks  rather than spreading it out   Congress temporarily increased the insurance limit to  250 000  With the passage of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  this increase became permanent as of July 21  2010   edit  Dodd Frank Act Main article  Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act This section requires expansion  The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is the most sweeping change to financial regulation in the United States since the Great Depression  68  69  70  71  and represents a significant change in the American financial regulatory environment affecting all Federal financial regulatory agencies and affecting almost every aspect of the nation s financial services industry  72  73   edit  See also UK banking German banking Japanese banking  edit  Notes   Norris  Floyd  October 11  2008    The

Federal Reserve  the nation was plagued with financial crises  At times  these crises led to  panics   in which people raced to their banks to withdraw their deposits  A particularly severe panic in 1907 resulted in bank runs that wreaked havoc on the fragile banking system and ultimately led Congress in 1913 to write the Federal Reserve Act  Initially created to address these banking panics  the Federal Reserve is now charged with a number of broader responsibilities  including fostering a sound banking system and a healthy economy     BoG 2005  pp  1 2   BoG 2005  pp  1  It was founded by
