1853  The territory straddling the border between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers was considered a good place to build settlements   edit  Exploration and settlement Kansas City Pioneer Square monument in Westport features Pony Express founder Alexander Majors  Westport Kansas City founder John Calvin McCoy and Mountainman Jim Bridger who owned Chouteau s Store  The first documented European visit to Kansas City was  tienne de Veniard  Sieur de Bourgmont  who was also the first European to explore the lower Missouri River  Criticized for his handling of a Native American attack of Fort D troit  he had deserted his post as commander of the fort and was avoiding the French authorities  Bourgmont lived with a Native American wife in the Missouri village about 90 miles  140 km  east near Brunswick  Missouri  and illegally traded furs  In order to clear his name  he wrote  Exact Description of Louisiana  of Its Harbors  Lands and Rivers  and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It  and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony  in 1713 followed in 1714 by  The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River   In the documents he describes the junction of the  Grande Riv i re  des Cansez  and Missouri River  being the first to refer to them by those names  French cartographer Guillaume Delisle used the descriptions to make the first reasonably accurate map of the area  The Spanish took over the region in the Treaty of Paris  1763   but were not to play a major role in the area other than taxing and licensing all traffic on the Missouri River  The French continued their fur trade on the river under Spanish license  The Chouteau family operated under the Spanish license at St  Louis in the lower Missouri Valley as early as 1765  but it would be 1821 before the Chouteaus reached Kansas City  when Fran ois Chouteau established Chouteau s Landing  After the Louisiana Purchase  Lewis and Clark visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers  noting it was a good place to build a fort  In 1831 a group of Mormons from New York settled in an area that would later be part of Kansas City  They built the first school within the current boundaries of the city  but were forced out by mob violence in 1833 and their settlement was left vacant  9  In 1833 John McCoy established West Port along the Santa Fe Trail  three miles  5 km  away from the river  Then in 1834  McCoy established Westport Landing on a bend in the Missouri River to serve as a landing point for West Port  Soon after the Kansas Town Company  a group of investors  began to settle the area  taking their name from an English spelling of  Cansez   In 1850 the landing area was incorporated as the Town of Kansas  10  By that time  the Town of Kansas  Westport  and nearby Independence  had become critical points in America s westward expansion  Three major trails   the Santa Fe  California  and Oregon   all originated in Jackson County  On February 22  1853  the City of Kansas was created with a newly elected mayor  It had an area of 0 70 square miles  1 8 km2  and a population of 2 500  The boundary lines at that time extended from the middle of the Missouri River south to what is now Ninth Street  and from Bluff Street on the west to a point between Holmes Road and Charlotte Street on the east  11   edit  Civil War The Kansas City area was rife with animosity during the period popularly known as Bleeding Kansas  which immediately preceded the Civil War  Already situated just inside a state bitterly divided on the issue of slavery  southern sympathizers in the area immediately recognized the threat posed by neighboring Kansas petitioning to enter the Union under the new doctrine of popular sovereignty  Infuriated by the idea of Kansas becoming a free state  many from the area crossed into Kansas to sway the state towards allowing slavery  at first by ballot box and then by bloodshed  Bird s eye view of Kansas City  Missouri  January 1869  Drawn by A  Ruger  Merchants Lith  Co   currently located at the Irish Museum and Cultural Center in Union Station During the Civil War  the City of Kansas and its immediate environs were the focus of intense military activity  Although the First Battle of Independence in August 1862 resulted in a Confederate victory  the Southerners were unable to follow up their win in any significant fashion  as the City of Kansas was occupied by Union troops and proved too heavily fortified for them to assault  The Second Battle of Independence  part of Sterling Price s Missouri expedition of 1864  also resulted in a Confederate triumph  Once again the Southern victory proved hollow  as Price was decisively defeated in the pivotal Battle of Westport the next day  effectively ending Confederate efforts to occupy the city  Moreover  General Thomas Ewing  in response to a successful raid on nearby Lawrence  Kansas  led by William Quantrill  issued General Order No  11  forcing the eviction of residents in four western Missouri counties including Jackson except those living in the city and nearby communities and those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing  Walnut St   Downtown Kansas City  Mo  1906  edit  Post Civil War After the Civil War  the City of Kansas grew rapidly  The selection of the city over Leavenworth  Kansas  for the Hannibal  amp  St  Joseph Railroad bridge over the Missouri River brought about significant growth  The population exploded after 1869  when the Hannibal Bridge  designed by Octave Chanute  opened  The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889 and the city limits to extend south and east  Westport became part of Kansas City on December 2  1897  In 1900  Kansas City was the 22nd largest city in the country  with 163 752 residents  12  Kansas City  guided by architect George Kessler  became a forefront example of the City Beautiful movement  developing a network of boulevards and parks around the city  13  The relocation of Union Station to its current location in 1914 and the opening of the Liberty Memorial in 1923 gave the city two of its most identifiable landmarks  Robert A  Long  president of the Liberty Memorial Association  was a driving force in the funding for construction  Long was a long time resident and wealthy businessman having built the R A  Long Building for the Long Bell Lumber Company  his home  Corinthian Hall now the Kansas City Museum  and Longview Farm  he was known and respected  Further spurring Kansas City s growth was the opening of the innovative Country Club Plaza development by J C  Nichols in 1925 as part of his Country Club District plan   edit  Pendergast era At the turn of the 19th to 20th century  political machines attempted to gain clout in the city  with the one led by Tom Pendergast emerging as the dominant machine by 1925  Several important buildings and structures were built during this time  including the Kansas City City Hall and the Jackson County Courthouse both added new skyscrapers to the city s growing skyline  The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast  riddled with health problems  pleaded guilty to tax evasion   edit  Post World War II development Kansas City satellite map Kansas City s suburban development originally began with the implementation of streetcars in the early decades of the 20th century  The city s first suburbs were in the neighborhoods of Pendleton Heights and Quality Hill  After World War II  many relatively affluent residents left for suburbs like Johnson County  Kansas and eastern Jackson County  Missouri  Many also went north of the Missouri River  where Kansas City had incorporated areas between the 1940s to 1970s  In 1950  blacks represented 12 2  of Kansas City s population  12  The sprawling characteristics of the city and it environs today mainly took shape after the race riots of the 1960s in Kansas City  The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr  was a catalyst for the 1968 Kansas City riot  At this time  slums were also beginning to form in the inner city  and those who could afford to leave  left for the suburbs and outer edges of the city  The post World War II idea of suburbs and the  American Dream  also contributed to the sprawl of the area  As the city s population continued to grow  the inner city also continued to decline  In 1940  the city had about 400 000 residents  by 2000  the same area was home to only about 180 000  From 1940 to 1960  the city more than doubled its physical size  while increasing its population by only about 75 000  By 1970  the city had a total area of approximately 316 square miles  820 km2   more than five times its size in 1940  The Hyatt Regency walkway collapse was a major disaster that occurred on July 17  1981 killing 114 people and injuring more than 200 others during a tea dance  At the time it was the deadliest structural collapse in U
