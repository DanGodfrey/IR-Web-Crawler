November 1955 A 1  to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975  This war followed the First Indochina War and was fought between North Vietnam  supported by its communist allies  and the government of South Vietnam  supported by the United States of America and other anti communist countries  26  The Viet Cong  also known as the National Liberation Front  or NLF   a lightly armed South Vietnamese communist controlled common front  largely fought a guerrilla war against anti communist forces in the region  The Vietnam People s Army  North Vietnamese Army  engaged in a more conventional war  at times committing large units into battle  U S  and South Vietnamese forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations  involving ground forces  artillery  and airstrikes  The U S  government viewed involvement in the war as a way to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam as part of their wider strategy of containment  The North Vietnamese government and Viet Cong viewed the conflict as a colonial war  fought initially against France  backed by the U S   and later against South Vietnam  which it regarded as a U S  puppet state  27  American military advisors arrived in what was then French Indochina beginning in 1950  U S  involvement escalated in the early 1960s  with troop levels tripling in 1961 and tripling again in 1962  28  U S  combat units were deployed beginning in 1965  Operations spanned international borders  with Laos and Cambodia heavily bombed  American involvement in the war peaked in 1968  at the time of the Tet Offensive  After this  U S  ground forces were gradually withdrawn as part of a policy known as Vietnamization  Despite the Paris Peace Accords  signed by all parties in January 1973  fighting continued  U S  military involvement ended on 15 August 1973 as a result of the Case Church Amendment passed by the U S  Congress  29  The capture of Saigon by the Vietnam People s Army in April 1975 marked the end of the war  and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year  The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities  see Vietnam War casualties   Estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from less than one million 30  to more than three million  31  Some 200 000 300 000 Cambodians  18  19  20  20 000 200 000 Laotians  32  33

Historiography 20 External links Names for the War Further information  Terminology of the Vietnam War Various names have been applied to the conflict  Vietnam War is the most commonly used name in English  It has also been called the Second Indochina War  and the Vietnam Conflict  As there have been so many conflicts in Indochina  this conflict is known by the name of their chief opponent to distinguish it from the others  38  Thus  in Vietnamese  the war is known as Chi n tranh Vi t Nam  The Vietnam War   or as Kh ng chi n ch ng M   Resistance War Against America   loosely translated as the American War  39  The main military organizations involved in the war were  on one side  the Army of the Republic of Vietnam  ARVN  and the U S  military  and  on the other side  the Vietnam People s Army  VPA   also known as the North Vietnamese Army  or NVA   and the Viet Cong  or National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam  NLF   a South Vietnamese communist guerrilla force  Background to 1949 See also  History of Vietnam  Cochinchina Campaign  Can Vuong  Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang  and Yen Bai mutiny France began its conquest of Indochina in the late 1850s  and completed pacification by 1893  40  41  42  The Treaty of Hu   concluded in 1884  formed the basis for French colonial rule in Vietnam for the next seven decades  In spite of military resistance  most notable by the Can Vuong of Phan Dinh Phung  by 1888 the area of the current day nations of Cambodia and Vietnam was made into the colony of French Indochina  Laos was added later   43  Various Vietnamese opposition movements to French rule existed during this period  such as the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang who staged the failed Yen Bai mutiny in 1930  but none were ultimately as successful as the Viet Minh common front  which was founded in 1941  controlled by the Indochinese Communist Party  and funded by the U S  and the Chinese Nationalist Party in its fight against Japanese occupation  44  A 4  During World War II  the French were defeated by the Germans in 1940  For French Indochina  this meant that the colonial authorities became Vichy French  allies of the German Italian Axis powers  In turn this meant that the French collaborated with the Japanese forces after their invasion of French Indochina during 1940  The French continued to run affairs in the colony  but ultimate power resided in the hands of the Japanese  44  The Viet Minh was founded as a league for independence from France  but also opposed Japanese occupation in 1945 for the same reason  The U S  and Chinese Nationalist Party supported them in the fight against the Japanese  46  However  they did not have enough power to fight actual battles at first  Viet Minh leader Ho Chi Minh was suspected of being a communist and jailed for a year by the Chinese Nationalist Party  47  Double occupation by France and Japan continued until the German forces were expelled from France and the French Indochina colonial authorities started holding secret talks with the Free French  Fearing that they could no longer trust the French authorities  the Japanese army interned them all on 9 March 1945 and assumed direct control themselves 48  through their puppet state  the Empire of Vietnam  under B o   i  During 1944 1945  a deep famine struck northern Vietnam due to a combination of bad weather and French Japanese exploitation  1 million people died of starvation  out of a population of 10 million in the affected area   49  Exploiting the administrative gap 50  that the internment of the French had created  the Viet Minh in March 1945 urged the population to ransack rice warehouses and refuse to pay their taxes  51  Between 75 and 100 warehouses were consequently raided  52  This rebellion against the effects of the famine and the authorities that were partially responsible for it bolstered the Viet Minh s popularity and they recruited many members during this period  50  In August 1945  the Japanese had been defeated and surrendered unconditionally  In French Indochina this created a power vacuum  as the French were still interned and the Japanese forces stood down  52  The Viet Minh stepped into this vacuum and grasped power across Vietnam in the August Revolution  52  largely supported by the Vietnamese population  53  After their defeat in the war  the Imperial Japanese Army  IJA  gave weapons to the Vietnamese  and kept Vichy French officials and military officers imprisoned for a month after the surrender  The Vi t Minh had recruited more than 600 Japanese soldiers and given them roles to train or command Vietnamese soldiers  54  55  Ho Chi Minh declared the independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam before a crowd of 500 000 in Hanoi on 2 September 1945  52  In an overture to the Americans  he began his speech by paraphrasing the United States Declaration of Independence  All men are created equal  The Creator has given us certain inviolable Rights  the right to Life  the right to be Free  and the right to achieve Happiness  52  However  the major allied victors of World War II  the United Kingdom  the United States  and the Soviet Union  all agreed the area belonged to the French  52  As the French did not have the ships  weapons  or soldiers to immediately retake Vietnam  the major powers came to an agreement that British troops would occupy the south while Nationalist Chinese forces would move in from the north  52  Nationalist Chinese troops entered the country to disarm Japanese troops north of the 16th parallel on September 14  1945  56  When the British landed in the south  they rearmed the interned French forces as well as parts of the surrendered Japanese forces to aid them in retaking southern Vietnam  as they did not have enough troops to do this themselves  52  Following the party line from Moscow  Ho Chi Minh initially attempted to negotiate with the French  who were slowly re establishing their control across the country  57  In January 1946  the Viet Minh won elections across central and northern Vietnam  58  On March 6  1946  Ho signed an agreement allowing French forces to replace Nationalist Chinese forces  in exchange for French recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a  free  republic within the French Union  with the specifics of such recognition to be determined by future negotiation  59  60  61  The French landed in Hanoi by March 1946 and in November of that year they ousted the Viet Minh from the city  62  British forces departed on 26 March 1946  leaving Vietnam in the hands of the French  63  Soon thereafter  the Viet Minh began a guerrilla war against the French Union forces  beginning the First Indochina War  The war spread to Laos and Cambodia  where Communists organized the Pathet Lao and the Khmer Serei  both of which were modeled on the Viet Minh  64  Globally  the Cold War began in earnest  which meant that the rapprochement that existed between the Western powers and the Soviet Union during World War II disintegrated  The Viet Minh fight was hampered by a lack of weapons  this situation changed by 1949 when the Chinese Communists had largely won the Chinese Civil War and were free to provide arms to their Vietnamese allies  64  Exit of the French  1950 1954 Main articles  First Indochina War and Operation Passage to Freedom In January 1950  the communist nations  led by the People s Republic of China  PRC   recognized the Viet Minh s Democratic Republic of Vietnam  based in Hanoi  as the government of Vietnam  while non communist nations recognized the French backed State of Vietnam in Saigon  led by former Emperor B o   i  as the Vietnamese government the following month  65  The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 convinced many Washington policymakers that the war in Indochina was an example of communist expansionism directed by the Kremlin  66  French soldiers fight off a Viet Minh ambush in 1952  PRC military advisors began assisting the Viet Minh in July 1950  67  PRC weapons  expertise  and laborers transformed the Viet Minh from a guerrilla force into a regular army  68  In September 1950  the United States created a Military Assistance and Advisory Group  MAAG  to screen French requests for aid  advise on strategy  and train Vietnamese soldiers  69  By 1954  the United States had supplied 300 000 small arms and spent US 1 billion in support of the French military effort  shouldering 80 percent of the cost of the war  70  There were also talks between the French and Americans in which the possible use of three tactical nuclear weapons was considered  though reports of how seriously this was considered and by whom are even now vague and contradictory  71  72  One version of the plan for the proposed Operation Vulture envisioned sending 60 B 29s from U S  bases in the region  supported by as many as 150 fighters launched from U S  Seventh Fleet carriers  to bomb Viet Minh commander Vo Nguyen Giap s positions  The plan included an option to use up to three atomic weapons on the Viet Minh positions  Admiral Arthur W  Radford  Chairman of the U S  Joint Chiefs of Staff  gave this nuclear option his backing  U S  B 29s  B 36s  and B 47s could have executed a nuclear strike  as could carrier aircraft from the Seventh Fleet  73  U S  carriers sailed to the Gulf of Tonkin  and reconnaissance flights over Dien Bien Phu were conducted during the negotiations  According to U S  Vice President Richard Nixon  the plan involved the Joint Chiefs of Staff drawing up plans to use three small tactical nuclear weapons in support of the French  71  Nixon  a so called  hawk  on Vietnam  suggested that the United States might have to  put American boys in   74  U S  President Dwight D  Eisenhower made American participation contingent on British support  but London was opposed to such a venture  74  In the end  convinced that the political risks outweighed the possible benefits  Eisenhower decided against the intervention  75  As an experienced five star general  Eisenhower was very wary of getting the United States involved in a land war in Asia  The Viet Minh received crucial support from the Soviet Union and PRC  PRC support in the Border Campaign of 1950 allowed supplies to come from the PRC into Vietnam  Throughout the conflict  U S  intelligence estimates remained skeptical of French chances of success  76  The Battle of Dien Bien Phu marked the end of French involvement in Indochina  Giap s Viet Minh forces handed the French a stunning military defeat  and on 7 May 1954  the French Union garrison surrendered  Of the 12 000 French prisoners taken by the Viet Minh  only 3 000 survived  77  At the Geneva Conference  the French negotiated a ceasefire agreement with the Viet Minh  and independence was granted to Cambodia  Laos  and Vietnam  Transition period Main articles  Geneva Conference  1954   Operation Passage to Freedom  Battle of Saigon  1955   Ba Cut  and State of Vietnam referendum  1955 Vietnam was temporarily partitioned at the 17th parallel  and under the terms of the Geneva Accords  civilians were to be given the opportunity to move freely between the two provisional states for a 300 day period  Elections throughout the country were to be held in 1956 to establish a unified government  78  Around one million northerners  mainly minority Catholics  fled south  fearing persecution by the communists 79  following an American propaganda campaign using slogans such as  The Virgin Mary is heading south   80  and aided by a U S  funded  93 million relocation program  which included ferrying refugees with the Seventh Fleet  81  It is estimated that as many as two million more would have left had they not been stopped by the Viet Minh  82  The northern  mainly Catholic refugees were meant to give the later Ng    nh Di m regime a strong anti communist constituency  83  Diem later went on to staff his administration s key posts mostly with northern and central Catholics  In addition to the Catholics flowing south  up to 130 000  Revolutionary Regroupees  went to the north for  regroupment   expecting to return to the south within two years  84  The Viet Minh left roughly 5 000 to 10 000 cadres in the south as a  politico military substructure within the object of its irredentism   85  The last French soldiers were to leave Vietnam in April 1956  68  The PRC completed its withdrawal from North Vietnam at around the same time  67  Around 52 000 Vietnamese civilians moved from south to north  86  In the north  the Viet Minh ruled as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and engaged in a drastic land reform program in which an estimated 8 000 perceived  class enemies  were executed  87  In 1956  leaders in Hanoi admitted to  excesses  in implementing this program and restored a large amount of the land to the original owners  88  The south  meanwhile  constituted the State of Vietnam  with B o   i as Emperor and Ng    nh Di m  appointed in July 1954  as his prime minister  In June 1955  Diem announced that the scheduled 1956 elections would not be held  claiming South Vietnam had rejected the Geneva Accords from the beginning and was therefore not bound by them   How can we expect  free elections  to be held in the Communist North   he asked  President Eisenhower echoed senior U S  experts 89  when he wrote that  in 1954   80 per cent of the population would have voted for the Communist Ho Chi Minh  over Emperor B o   i  90  91  From April to June 1955  Diem  against U S  advice  eliminated any political opposition in the south by launching military operations against the Cao Dai religious sect  the Hoa Hao sect of Ba Cut  and the Binh Xuyen organized crime group  which was allied with members of the secret police and some military elements   As broad based opposition to his harsh tactics mounted  Diem increasingly sought to blame the communists  92  In a referendum on the future of the State of Vietnam on 23 October 1955  Diem rigged the poll supervised by his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu and was credited with 98 2 percent of the vote  including 133  in Saigon  His American advisers had recommended a more modest winning margin of  60 to 70 percent   Diem  however  viewed the election as a test of authority  93  Three days later  he declared South Vietnam to be an independent state known as the Republic of Vietnam  ROV   with himself as president  94  The ROV was created largely because of the Eisenhower administration s desire for an anti communist state in the region  92  The domino theory  which argued that if one country fell to communism  then all of the surrounding countries would follow  was first proposed as policy by the Eisenhower administration  95  It was  and is still  commonly hypothesized that it applied to Vietnam  John F  Kennedy  then a U S  Senator  said in a speech to the American Friends of Vietnam   Burma  Thailand  India  Japan  the Philippines and obviously Laos and Cambodia are among those whose security would be threatened if the Red Tide of Communism overflowed into Vietnam   96  Diem era  1955 1963 Main articles  Ngo Dinh Diem and War in Vietnam  1954 1959  The Geneva Conference  1954 U S  President Dwight D  Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles greet President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam in Washington  May 8  1957  Rule See also  Ngo Dinh Diem presidential visit to Australia A devout Roman Catholic  Diem was fervently anti communist  nationalist  and socially conservative  Historian Luu Doan Huynh notes  however  that  Diem represented narrow and extremist nationalism coupled with autocracy and nepotism   97  As he was a wealthy Catholic  many ordinary Vietnamese viewed Diem as part of the elite who had helped the French rule Vietnam  Diem had been interior minister in the colonial government  The majority of Vietnamese people were Buddhist  and were alarmed by actions such as Diem s dedication of the country to the Virgin Mary  Beginning in the summer of 1955  Diem launched the  Denounce the Communists  campaign  during which communists and other anti government elements were arrested  imprisoned  tortured  or executed  He instituted the death penalty against any activity deemed communist in August 1956  98  The regime branded its opponents Viet Cong   Vietnamese communist   to degrade their nationalist credentials  As a measure of the level of political repression  about 12 000 suspected opponents of Diem were killed between 1955 and 1957 and by the end of 1958 an estimated 40 000 political prisoners had been jailed  99  In May 1957  Diem undertook a ten day state visit to the United States  President Eisenhower pledged his continued support  and a parade was held in Diem s honor in New York City  Although Diem was publicly praised  in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives  100  Future U S  Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara wrote that the new American patrons of the ROV were almost completely ignorant of Vietnamese culture  They knew little of the language or long history of the country  65  There was a tendency to assign American motives to Vietnamese actions  and Diem warned that it was an illusion to believe that blindly copying Western methods would solve Vietnamese problems  65  Insurgency in the South  1954 1960 Main articles  Viet Cong and War in Vietnam  1959 1963  President Eisenhower noted that had the Geneva Accords been held   possibly 80 percent of the population would have voted for Communist Ho Chi Minh  and the government quickly became more repressive and unpopular  The Diem government had largely failed in implementing a land reform program for the peasants of South Vietnam  90  of the population  which along with  Peace  security  freedom   and  their standard of living  was the peasants  prime concern according to specialist Philippe Devillers  Among the changes the government altered the tenant structure to competitive bidding which led to more tenant insecurity  Only 10  of the tenants benefited from the program and were often times northerners  refugees  or Catholics which created more animosity among the Vietnamese  In 1959 the program became inoperative and by 1960  only 2  of the landowners owned 45  of the land  25  The South government used widespread repression  between 1954 and 1960 it captured 50 000 prisoners and had put them into  political reeducation camps  as part of the Denunciation of Communists Campaign  In 1959 British specialist PJ Honey was invited to examine the camps and concluded after interviewing rural Vietnamese that   the consensus of the opinion expressed by these peoples is that   the majority of the detainees are neither communists nor pro communists   25  According to the Pentagon Papers the prisons were  little more than concentration camps for potential foes of the government  and used torture regardless of whether they were communist or not  The Diem government had also abolished elections for village councils out of fear of large amounts of Viet Minh candidates winning and replaced administrative village autonomy with government officials  25  This had an effect  between 1954 and 1957 there was large scale random dissidence in the countryside which the Diem government successful quelled  In early 1957 South Vietnam had its first peace in over a decade  However  by mid 1957 through 1959 incidents of violence increased but the government  did not construe it as a campaign  considering the disorders too diffuse to warrant committing major GVN resources   By Early 1959 however  Diem had considered it a campaign and implemented Law 10 59  which made political violence punishable by death and property confiscation  101  There had been some division among former Viet Minh whose main goal was to hold the elections promised in the Geneva Accords  leading to  wildcat  activities separate from the other communists and anti GVN activists  25  In December 1960  the National Liberation Front  NFL  was formally created consisting of all anti GVN activists and included non communists  According to the Pentagon Papers  the NLF  placed heavy emphasis on the withdrawal of American advisors and influence  on land reform and liberalization of the GVN  on coalition government and the neutralization of Vietnam   Often the leaders of the organization were kept secret  25  North Vietnam interference  Very little evidence points to organization or interference on the part of North Vietnam  As the Pentagon Papers point out   No direct links have been established between Hanoi and perpetrators of rural violence   As Kahin and Lewis point out  Contrary to United States policy assumptions  all available evidence shows that the revival of the civil war in the South in 1958 was undertaken by Southerners at their own  not Hanoi s  initiative   Insurgency activity against the Saigon government began in the South under Southern leadership not as a consequence of any dictate from Hanoi  but contrary to Hanoi s injunctions  25  Similarly  historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr  states that  it was not until September  1960 that the Communist Party of North Vietnam bestowed its formal blessing and called for the liberation of the south from American imperialism   25  During John F  Kennedy s administration  1961 1963 Main articles  Strategic Hamlet Program and Pham Ngoc Thao In the 1960 U S  presidential election  Senator John F  Kennedy defeated Vice President Richard Nixon  Although Eisenhower warned Kennedy about Laos and Vietnam  Europe and Latin America  loomed larger than Asia on his sights   102  In his inaugural address  Kennedy made the ambitious pledge to  pay any price  bear any burden  meet any hardship  support any friend  oppose any foe  in order to assure the survival and success of liberty   103  In June 1961  he bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev when they met in Vienna to discuss key U S  Soviet issues  The Kennedy administration remained essentially committed to the Cold War foreign policy inherited from the Truman and Eisenhower administrations  In 1961  the U S  had 50 000 troops based in Korea  and Kennedy faced a three part crisis   the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion  the construction of the Berlin Wall  and a negotiated settlement between the pro Western government of Laos and the Pathet Lao communist movement  104  These made Kennedy believe that another failure on the part of the United States to gain control and stop communist expansion would fatally damage U S  credibility with its allies and his own reputation  Kennedy was thus determined to  draw a line in the sand  and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam  He told James Reston of The New York Times immediately after his Vienna meeting with Khrushchev   Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place   105  106  In May 1961  Vice President Lyndon B  Johnson visited Saigon and enthusiastically declared Diem the  Winston Churchill of Asia   107  Asked why he had made the comment  Johnson replied   Diem s the only boy we got out there   100  Johnson assured Diem of more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists  Kennedy s policy toward South Vietnam rested on the assumption that Diem and his forces must ultimately defeat the guerrillas on their own  He was against the deployment of American combat troops and observed that  to introduce U S  forces in large numbers there today  while it might have an initially favorable military impact  would almost certainly lead to adverse political and  in the long run  adverse military consequences   108  The quality of the South Vietnamese military  however  remained poor  Bad leadership  corruption  and political promotions all played a part in emasculating the ARVN  The frequency of guerrilla attacks rose as the insurgency gathered steam  While Hanoi s support for the NLF played a role  South Vietnamese governmental incompetence was at the core of the crisis  109  South Vietnam  Military Regions  1967 One major issue Kennedy raised was whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the United States  Although Kennedy stressed long range missile parity with the Soviets  he was also interested in using special forces for counterinsurgency warfare in Third World countries threatened by communist insurgencies  Although they were originally intended for use behind front lines after a conventional invasion of Europe  Kennedy believed that the guerrilla tactics employed by special forces such as the Green Berets would be effective in a  brush fire  war in Vietnam  Kennedy advisers Maxwell Taylor and Walt Rostow recommended that U S  troops be sent to South Vietnam disguised as flood relief workers  Kennedy rejected the idea but increased military assistance yet again  In April 1962  John Kenneth Galbraith warned Kennedy of the  danger we shall replace the French as a colonial force in the area and bleed as the French did   110  By 1963  there were 16 000 American military personnel in South Vietnam  up from Eisenhower s 900 advisors  111  The Strategic Hamlet Program had been initiated in 1961  This joint U S  South Vietnamese program attempted to resettle the rural population into fortified camps  The aim was to isolate the population from the insurgents  provide education and health care  and strengthen the government s hold over the countryside  citation needed  The Strategic Hamlets  however  were quickly infiltrated by the guerrillas  citation needed  The peasants resented being uprooted from their ancestral villages  citation needed  In part  this was because Colonel Pham Ngoc Thao  a Diem favourite who was instrumental in running the program  was in fact a communist agent who used his Catholicism to gain influential posts and damage the ROV from the inside  citation needed  The government refused to undertake land reform  which left farmers paying high rents to a few wealthy landlords  Corruption dogged the program and intensified opposition  On 23 July 1962  fourteen nations  including the People s Republic of China  South Vietnam  the Soviet Union  North Vietnam and the United States  signed an agreement promising the neutrality of Laos  112  Coup and assassinations See also  Kennedy s role  1960 South Vietnamese coup attempt  1962 South Vietnamese

Taylor mission  1963 South Vietnamese coup  and Reaction to the 1963 South Vietnamese coup The inept performance of the South Vietnamese army was exemplified by failed actions such as the Battle of Ap Bac on 2 January 1963  in which a small band of Viet Cong beat off a much larger and better equipped South Vietnamese force  many of whose officers seemed reluctant even to engage in combat  113  The ARVN were led in that battle by Diem s most trusted general  Huynh Van Cao  commander of the IV Corps  Cao was a Catholic who had been promoted due to religion and fidelity rather than skill  and his main job was to preserve his forces to stave off coups  he had earlier vomited during a communist attack  Some policymakers in Washington began to conclude that Diem was incapable of defeating the communists and might even make a deal with Ho Chi Minh  He seemed concerned only with fending off coups  and had become more paranoid after attempts in 1960 and 1962  which he partly attributed to U S  encouragement  As Robert F  Kennedy noted   Diem wouldn t make even the slightest concessions  He was difficult to reason with     114  Discontent with Diem s policies exploded following the Hu  Ph t   n shootings of majority Buddhists who were protesting against the ban on the Buddhist flag on Vesak  the Buddha s birthday  This resulted in mass protests against discriminatory policies that gave privileges to the Catholic Church and its adherents  Diem s elder brother Ngo Dinh Thuc was the Archbishop of Hu  and aggressively blurred the separation between church and state  Thuc s anniversary celebrations shortly before Vesak had been bankrolled by the government and Vatican flags were displayed prominently  There had also been reports of Buddhist pagodas being demolished by Catholic paramilitaries throughout Diem s rule  Diem refused to make concessions to the Buddhist majority or take responsibility for the deaths  On 21 August 1963  the ARVN Special Forces of Colonel Le Quang Tung  loyal to Diem s younger brother Ngo Dinh Nhu  raided pagodas across Vietnam  causing widespread damage and destruction and leaving a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds  Ngo Dinh Diem after being shot and killed in the 1963 coup  U S  officials began discussing the possibility of a regime change during the middle of 1963  The United States Department of State was generally in favor of encouraging a coup  while the Defense Department favored Diem  Chief among the proposed changes was the removal of Diem s younger brother Nhu  who controlled the secret police and special forces was seen as the man behind the Buddhist repression and more generally the architect of the Ngo family s rule  This proposal was conveyed to the U S  embassy in Saigon in Cable 243  The Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  was in contact with generals planning to remove Diem  They were told that the United States would not oppose such a move nor punish the generals by cutting off aid  President Diem was overthrown and executed  along with his brother  on 2 November 1963  When he was informed  Maxwell Taylor remembered that Kennedy  rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face   115  He had not approved Diem s murder  The U S  ambassador to South Vietnam  Henry Cabot Lodge  invited the coup leaders to the embassy and congratulated them  Ambassador Lodge informed Kennedy that  the prospects now are for a shorter war   116  Following the coup  chaos ensued  Hanoi took advantage of the situation and increased its support for the guerrillas  South Vietnam entered a period of extreme political instability  as one military government toppled another in quick succession  Increasingly  each new regime was viewed as a puppet of the Americans  whatever the failings of Diem  his credentials as a nationalist  as Robert McNamara later reflected  had been impeccable  117  U S military advisers were embedded at every level of the South Vietnamese armed forces  They were  however  almost completely ignorant of the political nature of the insurgency  The insurgency was a political power struggle  in which military engagements were not the main goal  118  The Kennedy administration sought to refocus U S  efforts on pacification and  winning over the hearts and minds  of the population  The military leadership in Washington  however  was hostile to any role for U S  advisers other than conventional troop training  119  General Paul Harkins  the commander of U S  forces in South Vietnam  confidently predicted victory by Christmas 1963  120  The CIA was less optimistic  however  warning that  the Viet Cong by and large retain de facto control of much of the countryside and have steadily increased the overall intensity of the effort   121  Paramilitary officers from the CIA s Special Activities Division trained and led Hmong tribesmen in Laos and into Vietnam  The indigenous forces numbered in the tens of thousands and they conducted direct action missions  led by paramilitary officers  against the Communist Pathet Lao forces and their North Vietnamese supporters  122  The CIA also ran the Phoenix Program and participation

a priority and was more concerned with his  Great Society  and progressive social programs  Presidential aide Jack Valenti recalls   Vietnam at the time was no bigger than a man s fist on the horizon  We hardly discussed it because it was not worth discussing   124  125  On 24 November 1963  Johnson said   the battle against communism    must be joined    with strength and determination   126  The pledge came at a time when Vietnam was deteriorating  especially in places like the Mekong Delta  because of the recent coup against Diem  127  Johnson had reversed Kennedy s disengagement policy from Vietnam in withdrawing 1 000 troops by the end of 1963  NSAM 263 on 11 October   128  with his own NSAM 273  26 November  129  130  to expand the war  The military revolutionary council  meeting in lieu of a strong South Vietnamese leader  was made up of 12 members headed by General Duong Van Minh whom Stanley Karnow  a journalist on the ground  later recalled as  a model of lethargy   131  Lodge  frustrated by the end of the year  cabled home about Minh   Will he be strong enough to get on top of things   His regime was overthrown in January 1964 by General Nguyen Khanh  132  However  there was persistent instability in the military as several coups not all successful occurred in a short space of time  An alleged NLF activist  captured during an attack on an American outpost near the Cambodian border  is interrogated  On 2 August 1964  the USS Maddox  on an intelligence mission along North Vietnam s coast  allegedly fired upon and damaged several torpedo boats that had been stalking it in the Gulf of Tonkin  133  A second attack was reported two days later on the USS Turner Joy and Maddox in the same area  The circumstances of the attack were murky  Lyndon Johnson commented to Undersecretary of State George Ball that  those sailors out there may have been shooting at flying fish   134  The second attack led to retaliatory air strikes  prompted Congress to approve the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August 5  1964  signed by Johnson  and gave the President power to conduct military operations in Southeast Asia without declaring war  135  Although Congressmen at the time denied that this was a full scale war declaration  the Tonkin Resolution allowed the President unilateral power to launch a full scale war if the President deemed necessary  135  In the same month  Johnson pledged that he was not      committing American boys to fighting a war that I think ought to be fought by the boys of Asia to help protect their own land   136  An undated NSA publication declassified in 2005  however  revealed that there was no attack on 4 August  137  It had already been called into question long before this   Gulf of Tonkin incident   writes Louise Gerdes   is an oft cited example of the way in which Johnson misled the American people to gain support for his foreign policy in Vietnam   138  George C  Herring argues  however  that McNamara and the Pentagon  did not knowingly lie about the alleged attacks  but they were obviously in a mood to retaliate and they seem to have selected from the evidence available to them those parts that confirmed what they wanted to believe   139   From a strength of approximately 5 000 at the start of 1959 the Viet Cong s ranks grew to about 100 000 at the end of 1964   Between 1961 and 1964 the Army s strength rose from about 850 000 to nearly a million men   118  The numbers for U S  troops deployed to Vietnam during the same period were quite different  2 000 in 1961  rising rapidly to 16 500 in 1964  140  A Marine from 1st Battalion  3rd Marines  moves an alleged NLF activist to the rear during a search and clear operation held by the battalion 15 miles  24 km  west of Da Nang Air Base  The National Security Council recommended a three stage escalation of the bombing of North Vietnam  On 2 March 1965  following an attack on a U S  Marine barracks at Pleiku  141 Operation Flaming Dart  initiated when Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin was at a state visit to North Vietnam   Operation Rolling Thunder and Operation Arc Light commenced  142  The bombing campaign  which ultimately lasted three years  was intended to force North Vietnam to cease its support for the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam  NLF  by threatening to destroy North Vietnam s air defenses and industrial infrastructure  As well  it was aimed at bolstering the morale of the South Vietnamese  143  Between March 1965 and November 1968   Rolling Thunder  deluged the north with a million tons of missiles  rockets and bombs  144  Bombing was not restricted to North Vietnam  Other aerial campaigns  such as Operation Commando Hunt  targeted different parts of the NLF and VPA infrastructure  These included the Ho Chi Minh trail  which ran through Laos and Cambodia  The objective of forcing North Vietnam to stop its support for the NLF  however  was never reached  As one officer noted  this is a political war and it calls for discriminate killing  The best weapon    would be a knife    The worst is an airplane   145  The Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force Curtis LeMay  however  had long advocated saturation bombing in Vietnam and wrote of the Communists that  we re going to bomb them back into the Stone Age   146  Escalation and ground war Universal Newsreel film about an attack on U S  air bases and the U S  response  1965 Peasants suspected of being Vietcong under detention of U S  army  1966 After several attacks upon them  it was decided that U S  Air Force bases needed more protection  The South Vietnamese military seemed incapable of providing security  On 8 March 1965  3 500 U S  Marines were dispatched to South Vietnam  This marked the beginning of the American ground war  U S  public opinion overwhelmingly supported the deployment  147  In a statement similar to that made to the French almost two decades earlier  Ho Chi Minh warned that if the Americans  want to make war for twenty years then we shall make war for twenty years  If they want to make peace  we shall make peace and invite them to afternoon tea   148  As former First Deputy Foreign Minister Tran Quang Co has noted  the primary goal of the war was to reunify Vietnam and secure its independence  The policy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam  DRV  was not to topple other non communist governments in South East Asia  149  The Marines  assignment was defensive  The initial deployment of 3 500 in March was increased to nearly 200 000 by December  150  The U S  military had long been schooled in offensive warfare  Regardless of political policies  U S  commanders were institutionally and psychologically unsuited to a defensive mission  150  In December  ARVN forces suffered heavy losses at the Battle of B nh Gi   151  in a battle that both sides viewed as a watershed  Previously communist forces had utilized hit and run guerrilla tactics  however at Binh Gia they had defeated a strong ARVN force in conventional warfare  152  Tellingly  South Vietnamese forces were again defeated in June  at the Battle of   ng Xo i  153  U S  soldiers searching a village for NLF Desertion rates were increasing  and morale plummeted  General William Westmoreland informed Admiral U  S  Grant Sharp  Jr   commander of U S  Pacific forces  that the situation was critical  150  He said   I am convinced that U S  troops with their energy  mobility  and firepower can successfully take the fight to the NLF  National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam    154  With this recommendation  Westmoreland was advocating an aggressive departure from America s defensive posture and the sidelining of the South Vietnamese  By ignoring ARVN units  the U S  commitment became open ended  155  Westmoreland outlined a three point plan to win the war  Phase 1  Commitment of U S   and other free world  forces necessary to halt the losing trend by the end of 1965  Phase 2  U S  and allied forces mount major offensive actions to seize the initiative to destroy guerrilla and organized enemy forces  This phase would end when the enemy had been worn down  thrown on the defensive  and driven back from major populated areas  Phase 3  If the enemy persisted  a period of twelve to eighteen months following Phase 2 would be required for the final destruction of enemy forces remaining in remote base areas  156  The plan was approved by Johnson and marked a profound departure from the previous administration s insistence that the government of South Vietnam was responsible for defeating the guerrillas  Westmoreland predicted victory by the end of 1967  157  Johnson did not  however  communicate this change in strategy to the media  Instead he emphasized continuity  158  The change in U S  policy depended on matching the North Vietnamese and the NLF in a contest of attrition and morale  The opponents were locked in a cycle of escalation  159  The idea that the government of South Vietnam could manage its own affairs was shelved  159  Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin with U S  President Lyndon B  Johnson at the Glassboro Summit Conference where the two representatives discussed the possibilities of a peace settlement  The one year tour of duty deprived units of experienced leadership  As one observer noted  we were not in Vietnam for 10 years  but for one year 10 times   145  As a result  training programs were shortened  South Vietnam was inundated with manufactured goods  As Stanley Karnow writes   the main PX  Post Exchange   located in the Saigon suburb of Cholon  was only slightly smaller than the New York Bloomingdale s     160  The American buildup transformed the economy and had a profound effect on South Vietnamese society  A huge surge in corruption was witnessed  The Ho Chi Minh Trail running through Laos  1967 Washington encouraged its SEATO allies to contribute troops  Australia  New Zealand  the Republic of Korea  Thailand  and the Philippines 161  all agreed to send troops  Major allies  however  notably NATO nations Canada and the United Kingdom  declined Washington s troop requests  162  The U S  and its allies mounted complex operations  such as operations Masher  Attleboro  Cedar Falls  and Junction City  However  the communist insurgents remained elusive and demonstrated great tactical flexibility  Meanwhile  the political situation in South Vietnam began to stabilize with the coming to power of Prime Minister Air Marshal Nguy n Cao K  and figurehead Chief of State  General Nguy n V n Thi u  in mid 1965 at the head of a military junta  This ended a series of coups that had happened more than once a year  In 1967  Thieu became president with Ky as his deputy  after rigged elections  Although they were nominally a civilian government  Ky was supposed to maintain real power through a behind the scenes military body  However  Thieu outmanoevred and sidelined Ky by filling the ranks with generals from his faction  Thieu was also accused of murdering Ky loyalists through contrived military accidents  Thieu  mistrustful and indecisive  remained president until 1975  having won a one man election in 1971  163  The Johnson administration employed a  policy of minimum candor  164  in its dealings with the media  Military information officers sought to manage media coverage by emphasizing stories that portrayed progress in the war  Over time  this policy damaged the public trust in official pronouncements  As the media s coverage of the war and that of the Pentagon diverged  a so called credibility gap developed  164  Tet Offensive Main article  Tet Offensive Having lured General Westmoreland s forces into the hinterland at Khe Sanh in Qu ng Tr  Province  165  in January 1968  the NVA and NLF broke the truce that had traditionally accompanied the T t  Lunar New Year  holiday  They launched the surprise Tet Offensive in the hope of sparking a national uprising  Over 100 cities were attacked  with assaults on General Westmoreland s headquarters and the U S  Embassy  Saigon  Although the U S  and South Vietnamese forces were initially taken aback by the scale of the urban offensive  they responded quickly and effectively  decimating the ranks of the NLF  In the former capital city of Hu   the combined NLF and VPA troops captured the Imperial Citadel and much of the city  which led to the Battle of Hu   Throughout the offensive  the American forces employed massive firepower  in Hu  where the battle was the fiercest  that firepower left 80  of the city in ruins  166  During the interim between the capture of the Citadel and end of the  Battle of Hu    the communist insurgent occupying forces massacred several thousand unarmed Hu  civilians  estimates vary up to a high of 6 000   After the war  North Vietnamese officials acknowledged that the Tet Offensive had  indeed  caused grave damage to NLF forces  But the offensive had another  unintended consequence  General Westmoreland had become the public face of the war  He was featured on the cover of Time magazine three times and was named 1965 s Man of the Year  167 Time described him as  the sinewy personification of the American fighting man     who  directed the historic buildup  drew up the battle plans  and infused the    men under him with his own idealistic view of U S  aims and responsibilities   167  U S  Marines fighting in Hu  In November 1967 Westmoreland spearheaded a public relations drive for the Johnson administration to bolster flagging public support  168  In a speech before the National Press Club he said that a point in the war had been reached  where the end comes into view   169  Thus  the public was shocked and confused when Westmoreland s predictions were trumped by Tet  168  The American media  which had been largely supportive of U S  efforts  rounded on the Johnson administration for what had become an increasing credibility gap  Despite its military failure  the Tet Offensive became a political victory and ended the career of President Lyndon B  Johnson  who declined to run for re election  Johnson s approval rating slumped from 48 to 36 percent  168  As James Witz noted  Tet  contradicted the claims of progress    made by the Johnson administration and the military   168  The Tet Offensive was the turning point in America s involvement in the Vietnam War  It had a profound impact on domestic support for the conflict  The offensive constituted an intelligence failure on the scale of Pearl Harbor  161  170  Journalist Peter Arnett quoted an unnamed officer  saying of B n Tre  laid to rubble by U S  firepower  171  that  it became necessary to destroy the village in order to save it   though the authenticity of this quote is disputed   172  According to one source  this quote was attributed to Major Booris of 9th Infantry Division  173  NLF NVA killed by U S  air force personnel during an attack on the perimeter of Tan Son Nhut Air Base during the Tet Offensive Westmoreland became Chief of Staff of the Army in March  just as all resistance was finally subdued  The move was technically a promotion  However  his position had become untenable because of the offensive and because his request for 200 000 additional troops had been leaked to the media  Westmoreland was succeeded by his deputy Creighton Abrams  a commander less inclined to public media pronouncements  174  On 10 May 1968  despite low expectations  peace talks began between the United States and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam  Negotiations stagnated for five months  until Johnson gave orders to halt the bombing of North Vietnam  The Democratic candidate  Vice President Hubert Humphrey  was running against Republican former vice president Richard Nixon  As historian Robert Dallek writes   Lyndon Johnson s escalation of the war in Vietnam divided Americans into warring camps    cost 30 000 American lives by the time he left office   and  destroyed Johnson s presidency     175  His refusal to send more U S  troops to Vietnam was seen as Johnson s admission that the war was lost  176  It can be seen that the refusal was a tacit admission that the war could not be won by escalation  at least not at a cost acceptable to the American people  176  As Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara noted   the dangerous illusion of victory by the United States was therefore dead   177  Vietnamization  1969 1972 Nixon Doctrine   Vietnamization Propaganda leaflet urging the defection of NLF and North Vietnamese to the side of the Republic of Vietnam For more details on this topic  see Role of the United States in the Vietnam War Vietnamization  1969 1975 and  Vietnamization  1969 1974  Severe communist losses during the Tet Offensive allowed U S  President Richard Nixon to begin troop withdrawals  His plan  called the Nixon Doctrine  was to build up the ARVN  so that they could take over the defense of South Vietnam  The policy became known as  Vietnamization   Vietnamization had much in common with the policies of the Kennedy administration  One important difference  however  remained  While Kennedy insisted that the South Vietnamese fight the war themselves  he attempted to limit the scope of the conflict  Nixon said in an announcement   I am tonight announcing plans for the withdrawal of an additional 150 000 American troops to be completed during the spring of next year  This will bring a total reduction of 265 500 men in our armed forces in Vietnam below the level that existed when we took office 15 months ago   178  On 10 October 1969  Nixon ordered a squadron of 18 B 52s loaded with nuclear weapons to race to the border of Soviet airspace to convince the Soviet Union that he was capable of anything to end the Vietnam War  Nixon also pursued negotiations  Theater commander Creighton Abrams shifted to smaller operations  aimed at communist logistics  with better use of firepower and more cooperation with the ARVN  Nixon also began to pursue d tente with the Soviet Union and rapprochement with the People s Republic of China  This policy helped to decrease global tensions  D tente led to nuclear arms reduction on the part of both superpowers  But Nixon was disappointed that the PRC and the Soviet Union continued to supply the North Vietnamese with aid  In September 1969  Ho Chi Minh died at age seventy nine  179  The anti war movement was gaining strength in the United States  Nixon appealed to the  silent majority  of Americans to support the war  But revelations of the My Lai Massacre  in which a U S  Army platoon raped and killed civilians  and the 1969  Green Beret Affair  where eight Special Forces soldiers  including the 5th Special Forces Group Commander were arrested for the murder 180  of a suspected double agent 181  provoked national and international outrage  The civilian cost of the war was again questioned when U S  forces concluded Operation Speedy Express with a claimed bodycount of 10 889 Communist guerillas with only 40 U S  losses  Kevin Buckley writing in Newsweek estimated that perhaps 5 000 of the Vietnamese dead were civilians  182  Beginning in 1970  American troops were being taken away from border areas where much more killing took place  and instead put along the coast and interior  which is one reason why casualties in 1970 were less than half of 1969 s totals  178  Operation Menu  the secret bombing of Cambodia and Laos Main article  Operation Menu Prince Norodom Sihanouk had proclaimed Cambodia neutral since 1955  183  but the communists used Cambodian soil as a base and Sihanouk tolerated their presence  because he wished to avoid being drawn into a wider regional conflict  Under pressure from Washington  however  he changed this policy in 1969  The Vietnamese communists were no longer welcome  President Nixon took the opportunity to launch a massive secret bombing campaign  called Operation Menu  against their sanctuaries along the Cambodia Vietnam border  This violated a long succession of pronouncements from Washington supporting Cambodian neutrality  Richard Nixon wrote to Prince Sihanouk in April 1969 assuring him that the United States respected  the sovereignty  neutrality and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia     184  In 1970  Prince Sihanouk was deposed by his pro American prime minister Lon Nol  The country s borders were closed  while U S  forces and ARVN launched incursions into Cambodia to attack VPA NLF bases and buy time for South Vietnam  The invasion of Cambodia sparked nationwide U S  protests  Four students were killed by National Guardsmen at Kent State University during a protest in Ohio  which provoked public outrage in the United States  The reaction to the incident by the Nixon administration was seen as callous and indifferent  providing additional impetus for the anti war movement  185  In 1971 the Pentagon Papers were leaked to The New York Times  The top secret history of U S  involvement in Vietnam  commissioned by the Department of Defense  detailed a long series of public deceptions  The Supreme Court ruled that its publication was legal  186  The ARVN launched Operation Lam Son 719 in February 1971  aimed at cutting the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos  112  The ostensibly neutral Laos had long been the scene of a secret war  After meeting resistance  ARVN forces retreated in a confused rout  They fled along roads littered with their own dead  When they ran out of fuel  soldiers abandoned their vehicles and attempted to barge their way on to American helicopters sent to evacuate the wounded  Many ARVN soldiers clung to helicopter skids in a desperate attempt to save themselves  U S  aircraft had to destroy abandoned equipment  including tanks  to prevent them from falling into enemy hands  Half of the invading ARVN troops were either captured or killed  The operation was a fiasco and represented a clear failure of Vietnamization  As Karnow noted  the blunders were monumental    The  South Vietnamese  government s top officers had been tutored by the Americans for ten or fifteen years  many at training schools in the United States  yet they had learned little   187  In 1971 Australia and New Zealand withdrew their soldiers  The U S  troop count was further reduced to 196 700  with a deadline to remove another 45 000 troops by February 1972  As peace protests spread across the United States  disillusionment and ill discipline grew in the ranks  188  Vietnamization was again tested by the Easter Offensive of 1972  a massive conventional invasion of South Vietnam  The VPA and NLF quickly overran the northern provinces and in coordination with other forces attacked from Cambodia  threatening to cut the country in half  U S  troop withdrawals continued  But American airpower came to the rescue with Operation Linebacker  and the offensive was halted  However  it became clear that without American airpower South Vietnam could not survive  The last remaining American ground troops were withdrawn in August  1972 election and

ordered Operation Linebacker II  a massive bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong 18 29 December 1972  The offensive destroyed much of the remaining economic and industrial capacity of North Vietnam  Simultaneously Nixon pressured Thieu to accept the terms of the agreement  threatening to conclude a bilateral peace deal and cut off American aid  On 15 January 1973  Nixon announced the suspension of offensive action against North Vietnam  The Paris Peace Accords on  Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam  were signed on 27 January 1973  officially ending direct U S  involvement in the Vietnam War  A cease fire was declared across North and South Vietnam  U S  POWs were released  The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and  like the Geneva Conference of 1954  called for national elections in the North and South  The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty day period for the total withdrawal of U S  forces   This article   noted Peter Church   proved    to

involvement in the Vietnam War Some advocates within the peace movement advocated a unilateral withdrawal of U S  forces from Vietnam  One reason given for the withdrawal is that it would contribute to a lessening of tensions in the region and thus less human bloodshed  Early opposition to U S  involvement in Vietnam was centered around the Geneva conference of 1954  American support of Diem in refusing elections was thought to be thwarting the very democracy that America claimed to be supporting  John Kennedy  while Senator  opposed involvement in Vietnam  140  Opposition to the Vietnam War tended to unite groups opposed to U S  anti communism  imperialism and colonialism and  for those involved with the New Left such as the Catholic Worker Movement  capitalism itself  Others  such as Stephen Spiro opposed the war based on the theory of Just War  Some wanted to show solidarity with the people of Vietnam  such as Norman Morrison emulating the actions of Th ch Qu ng   c  Some critics of U S  withdrawal predicted that it would not contribute to peace but rather vastly increase bloodshed  These critics advocated U S  forces remain until all threats from the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army had been eliminated  Advocates of U S  withdrawal were generally known as  doves   and they called their opponents  hawks   following nomenclature dating back to the War of 1812  High profile opposition to the Vietnam War turned to street protests in an effort to turn U S  political opinion  On 15 October 1969  the Vietnam Moratorium attracted millions of Americans  190  The fatal shooting of four students at Kent State University led to nation wide university protests  191  Riots broke out at the 1968 Democratic National Convention  192  After explosive news reports of American military abuses  such as the 1968 My Lai Massacre  brought new attention and support to the anti war movement  some veterans joined Vietnam Veterans Against the War  Anti war protests ended with the final withdrawal of troops after the Paris Peace Accords were signed in 1973  South Vietnam was left to defend itself alone when the fighting resumed  Many South Vietnamese subsequently fled to the United States  193  Victims of the My Lai Massacre Exit of the Americans  1973 1975 The United States began drastically reducing their troop support in South Vietnam during the final years of  Vietnamization   Many U S  troops were removed from the region  and on 5 March 1971  the United States returned the 5th Special Forces Group  which was the first American unit deployed to South Vietnam  to its former base in Fort Bragg  North Carolina  194  A 5  Under the Paris Peace Accords  between North Vietnamese Foreign Minister L    c Th  and U S  Secretary of State Henry Kissinger  and reluctantly signed by South Vietnamese President Thi u  U S  military forces withdrew from South Vietnam and prisoners were exchanged  North Vietnam was allowed to continue supplying communist troops in the South  but only to the extent of replacing materials that were consumed  Later that year the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Kissinger and Th   but the Vietnamese negotiator declined it saying that a true peace did not yet exist  The communist leaders had expected that the ceasefire terms would favor their side  But Saigon  bolstered by a surge of U S  aid received just before the ceasefire went into effect  began to roll back the Vietcong  The communists responded with a new strategy hammered out in a series of meetings in Hanoi in March 1973  according to the memoirs of Tr n V n Tr   197  As the Vietcong s top commander  Tr  participated in several of these meetings  With U S  bombings suspended  work on the Ho Chi Minh Trail and other logistical structures could proceed unimpeded  Logistics would be upgraded until the North was in a position to launch a massive invasion of the South  projected for the 1975 76 dry season  Tr  calculated that this date would be Hanoi s last opportunity to strike before Saigon s army could be fully trained  197  Calling for immediate withdrawal of U S  forces from Vietnam  George McGovern s 1972 Presidential Campaign lost 49 of 50 states to Richard Nixon  In the November 1972 Election  McGovern lost 49 of 50 states to Richard Nixon  who was re elected U S  president  Despite supporting Nixon over McGovern  many American voters split their tickets  returning a Democratic majority to both houses of Congress  On 15 March 1973  U S  President Richard Nixon implied that the United States would intervene militarily if the communist side violated the ceasefire  Public and congressional reaction to Nixon s trial balloon was unfavorable and in April Nixon appointed Graham Martin as U S  ambassador to Vietnam  Martin was a second stringer compared to previous U S  ambassadors and his appointment was an early signal that Washington had given up on Vietnam  During his confirmation hearings in June 1973  Secretary of Defense James R  Schlesinger stated that he would recommend resumption of U S  bombing in North Vietnam if North Vietnam launched a major offensive against South Vietnam  On 4 June 1973  the U S  Senate passed the Case Church Amendment to prohibit such intervention  198  In the 1972 Congressional Election  the majority of Americans voted for Democratic Congressmen  This map shows the House seats by party holding plurality in state   80 1 100  Republican   80 1 100  Democratic   60 1 80  Republican   60 1 80  Democratic   up to 60  Republican   up to 60  Democratic The oil price shock of October 1973 caused significant damage to the South Vietnamese economy  The Vietcong resumed offensive operations when dry season began and by January 1974 it had recaptured the territory it lost during the previous dry season  After two clashes that left 55 South Vietnamese soldiers dead  President Thi u announced on 4 January that the war had restarted and that the Paris Peace Accord was no longer in effect  There had been over 25 000 South Vietnamese casualties during the ceasefire period  199  Gerald Ford took over as U S  president on 9 August 1974 after President Nixon resigned due to the Watergate scandal  At this time  Congress cut financial aid to South Vietnam from  1 billion a year to  700 million  The U S  midterm elections in 1974 brought in a new Congress dominated by Democrats who were even more determined to confront the president on the war  Congress immediately voted in restrictions on funding and military activities to be phased in through 1975 and to culminate in a total cutoff of funding in 1976  The success of the 1973 74 dry season offensive inspired Tr  to return to Hanoi in October 1974 and plead for a larger offensive in the next dry season  This time  Tr  could travel on a drivable highway with regular fueling stops  a vast change from the days when the Ho Chi Minh Trail was a dangerous mountain trek  200  Gi p  the North Vietnamese defense minister  was reluctant to approve Tr  s plan  A larger offensive might provoke a U S  reaction and interfere with the big push planned for 1976  Tr  appealed over Gi p s head to first secretary L  Du n  who approved of the operation  Tr  s plan called for a limited offensive from Cambodia into Phuoc Long Province  The strike was designed to solve local logistical problems  gauge the reaction of South Vietnamese forces  and determine whether U S  would return to the fray  On 13 December 1974  North Vietnamese forces attacked Route 14 in Phuoc Long Province  Phuoc Binh  the provincial capital  fell on 6 January 1975  Ford desperately asked Congress for funds to assist and re supply the South before it was overrun  Congress refused  The fall of Phuoc Binh and the lack of an American response left the South Vietnamese elite demoralized  The speed of this success led the Politburo to reassess its strategy  It was decided that operations in the Central Highlands would be turned over to General V n Ti n D ng and that Pleiku should be seized  if possible  Before he left for the South  D ng was addressed by L  Du n   Never have we had military and political conditions so perfect or a strategic advantage as great as we have now   201  At the start of 1975  the South Vietnamese had three times as much artillery and twice the number of tanks and armoured cars as the opposition  They also had 1 400 aircraft and a two to one numerical superiority in combat troops over their Communist enemies  202  However  the rising oil prices meant that much of this could not be used  They faced a well organized  highly determined and well funded North Vietnam  Much of the North s material and financial support came from the communist bloc  Within South Vietnam  there was increasing chaos  Their abandonment by the American military had compromised an economy dependent on U S  financial support and the presence of a large number of U S  troops  South Vietnam suffered

artillery  The target was Bu n Ma Thu t  in   k L k Province  If the town could be taken  the provincial capital of Pleiku and the road to the coast would be exposed for a planned campaign in 1976  The ARVN proved incapable of resisting the onslaught  and its forces collapsed on 11 March  Once again  Hanoi was surprised by the speed of their success  Dung now urged the Politburo to allow him to seize Pleiku immediately and then turn his attention to Kon Tum  He argued that with two months of good weather remaining until the onset of the monsoon  it would be irresponsible to not take advantage of the situation  President Nguy n V n Thi u  a former general  was fearful that his forces would be cut off in the north by the attacking communists  Thieu ordered a retreat  The president declared this to be a  lighten the top and keep the bottom  strategy  But in what appeared to be a repeat of Operation Lam Son 719  the withdrawal soon turned into a bloody rout  While the bulk of ARVN forces attempted to flee  isolated units fought desperately  ARVN General Phu abandoned Pleiku and Kon Tum and retreated toward the coast  in what became known as the  column of tears   As the ARVN tried to disengage from the enemy  refugees mixed in with the line of retreat  The poor condition of roads and bridges  damaged by years of conflict and neglect  slowed Phu s column  As the North Vietnamese forces approached  panic set in  Often abandoned by the officers  the soldiers and civilians were shelled incessantly  The retreat degenerated into a desperate scramble for the coast  By 1 April the  column of tears  was all but annihilated  On 20 March  Thieu reversed himself and ordered Hu   Vietnam s third largest city  be held at all costs  and then changed his policy several times  Thieu s contradictory orders confused and demoralized his officer corps  As the North Vietnamese launched their attack  panic set in  and ARVN resistance withered  On 22 March  the VPA opened the siege of Hu   Civilians flooded the airport and the docks hoping for any mode of escape  Some even swam out to sea to reach boats and barges anchored offshore  In the confusion  routed ARVN soldiers fired on civilians to make way for their retreat  On 25 March  after a three day battle  Hu  fell  As resistance in Hu  collapsed  North Vietnamese rockets rained down on Da Nang and its airport  By 28 March  35 000 VPA troops were poised to attack the suburbs  By 30 March 100 000 leaderless ARVN troops surrendered as the VPA marched victoriously through Da Nang  With the fall of the city  the defense of the Central Highlands and Northern provinces came to an end  Final North Vietnamese offensive For more details on the final North Vietnamese offensive  see Ho Chi Minh Campaign  With the northern half of the country under their control  the Politburo ordered General Dung to launch the final offensive against Saigon  The operational plan for the Ho Chi Minh Campaign called for the capture of Saigon before 1 May  Hanoi wished to avoid the coming monsoon and prevent any redeployment of ARVN forces defending the capital  Northern forces  their morale boosted by their recent victories  rolled on  taking Nha Trang  Cam Ranh  and Da Lat  On 7 April  three North Vietnamese divisions attacked Xuan Loc  40 miles  64 km  east of Saigon  The North Vietnamese met fierce resistance at Xuan Loc from the ARVN 18th Division  who were outnumbered six to one  For two bloody weeks  severe fighting raged as the ARVN defenders made a last stand to try to block the North Vietnamese advance  By 21 April  however  the exhausted garrison were ordered to withdraw towards Saigon  An embittered and tearful President Thieu resigned on the same day  declaring that the United States had betrayed South Vietnam  In a scathing attack  he suggested U S  Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had tricked him into signing the Paris peace agreement two years ago  promising military aid that failed to materialise  Having transferred power to Tran Van Huong  he left for Taiwan on 25 April  At the same time  North Vietnamese tanks had reached Bien Hoa and turned toward Saigon  brushing aside isolated ARVN units along the way  By the end of April  the ARVN had collapsed on all fronts except in the Mekong Delta  Thousand of refugees streamed southward  ahead of the main communist onslaught  On 27 April 100 000 North Vietnamese troops encircled Saigon  The city was defended by about 30 000 ARVN troops  To hasten a collapse and foment panic  the VPA shelled the airport and forced its closure  With the air exit closed  large numbers of civilians found that they had no way out  Fall of Saigon Evacuation of CIA station personnel by Air America on April 29  1975  Photo

Martial law was declared  American helicopters began evacuating South Vietnamese  U S   and foreign nationals from various parts of the city and from the U S  embassy compound  Operation Frequent Wind had been delayed until the last possible moment  because of U S  Ambassador Graham Martin s belief that Saigon could be held and that a political settlement could be reached  Schlesinger announced early in the morning of 29 April 1975 the evacuation from Saigon by helicopter of the last U S  diplomatic  military  and civilian personnel  Frequent Wind was arguably the largest helicopter evacuation in history  It began on 29 April  in an atmosphere of desperation  as hysterical crowds of Vietnamese vied for limited space  Martin pleaded with Washington to dispatch  700 million in emergency aid to bolster the regime and help it mobilize fresh military reserves  But American public opinion had soured on this conflict  In the United States  South Vietnam was perceived as doomed  President Gerald Ford had given a televised speech on 23 April  declaring an end to the Vietnam War and all U S  aid  Frequent Wind continued around the clock  as North Vietnamese tanks breached defenses on the outskirts of Saigon  In the early morning hours of 30 April  the last U S  Marines evacuated the embassy by helicopter  as civilians swamped the perimeter and poured into the grounds  Many of them had been employed by the Americans and were left to their fate  Victorious NVA troops at the Presidential Palace  Saigon  On 30 April 1975  VPA troops overcame all resistance  quickly

Democratic Republic of Vietnam and sent weapons  as well as military advisors led by Luo Guibo to assist the Viet Minh in its war with the French  The first draft of the 1954 Geneva Accords was negotiated by French Prime Minister Pierre Mend s France and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai who  fearing U S  intervention  urged the Viet Minh to accept a partition at the 17th parallel  204  China s ability to aid the Viet Minh declined when Soviet aid to China was reduced following the end of the Korean War in 1953  Moreover  a divided Vietnam posed less of a threat to China  China provided material and technical support to the Vietnamese communists worth hundreds of millions of dollars  Chinese supplied rice allowed North Vietnam to pull military age men from the paddies and to impose a universal draft beginning in 1960  In the summer of 1962  Mao Zedong agreed to supply Hanoi with 90 000 rifles and guns free of charge  Starting in 1965  China sent anti aircraft units and engineering battalions to North Vietnam to repair the damage caused by American bombing  rebuild roads and railroads  and to perform other engineering works  This freed North Vietnamese army units for combat in the South  Sino Soviet relations soured after the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in August 1968  In October  the Chinese demanded North Vietnam cut relations with Moscow  but Hanoi refused  205  The Chinese began to withdraw in November 1968 in preparation for a clash with the Soviets  which occurred at Zhenbao Island in March 1969  The Chinese also began financing the Khmer Rouge as a counterweight to the Vietnamese communists at this time  China s withdrawal from Vietnam was completed in July 1970  206  The Khmer Rouge launched ferocious raids into Vietnam in 1975 1978  Vietnam responded with an invasion that toppled the Khmer Rouge  In response  China launched a brief  punitive invasion of Vietnam in 1979  Soviet Union Leonid Brezhnev was the leader of the Soviet Union during the second half of the Vietnam War Soviet ships in the South China Sea gave vital early warnings to NLF forces in South Vietnam  The Soviet intelligence ships would pick up American B 52 bombers flying from Okinawa and Guam  Their airspeed and direction would be noted and then relayed to COSVN headquarters  COSVN using airspeed and direction would calculate the bombing target and tell any assets to move  perpendicularly to the attack trajectory   These advance warning gave them time to move out of the way of the bombers and while the bombing runs caused extensive damage  because of the early warnings from 1968 1970 they did not kill a single military or civilian leader in the headquarter complexes  207  The Soviet Union supplied North Vietnam with medical supplies  arms  tanks  planes  helicopters  artillery  anti aircraft missiles and other military equipment  Soviet crews fired USSR made surface to air missiles at the B 52 bombers  which were the first raiders shot down over Hanoi  Fewer than a dozen Soviet citizens lost their lives in this conflict  Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991  Russian officials acknowledged that the Soviet Union had stationed up to 3 000 troops in Vietnam during the war  208  Some Russian sources give more specific numbers  the hardware donated by the USSR included 2 000 tanks  7 000 artillery guns  over 5 000 anti aircraft guns  158 surface to air rocket launchers  Over the course of the war the Soviet money donated to the Vietnamese cause was equal to 2 million dollars a day  From July 1965 to the end of 1974  fighting in Vietnam was attended by some 6 500 officers and generals  as well as more than 4 500 soldiers and sergeants of the Soviet Armed Forces  In addition  military schools and academies of the USSR began training Vietnamese soldiers   more than 10 thousand people  209  North Korea As a result of a decision of the Korean Workers  Party in October 1966  in early 1967 North Korea sent a fighter squadron to North Vietnam to back up the North Vietnamese 921st and 923rd fighter squadrons defending Hanoi  They stayed through 1968  and 200 pilots were reported to have served  210  In addition  at least two anti aircraft artillery regiments were sent as well  North Korea also sent weapons  ammunition and two million sets of uniforms to their comrades in North Vietnam  211 Kim Il sung is reported to have told his pilots to  fight in the war as if the Vietnamese sky were their own   212  Cuba The extent of manpower contributions to North Vietnam by the communist Republic of Cuba  under Fidel Castro  is still a matter of debate  Then and since  the communist Vietnamese and Cuban governments have not divulged any information on this matter  There are numerous reports by former U S  prisoners of war that Cuban military personnel were present at North Vietnamese prison facilities during the war  and that they participated in torture activities  in what is known as the  Cuba Program   213  214  215  216  217  Witnesses to this include Senator John McCain  2008 U S  Presidential candidate and former Vietnam prisoner of war  according to his 1999 book Faith of My Fathers  218  That there was at least a small contingent of Cuban military advisors present in North Vietnam during the war is without question  Some  notably Vietnam War POW MIA issue advocates  claim evidence that Cuba s military and non military involvement may have run into the  thousands  of personnel  219  Pro Saigon South Korea Further information  Republic of Korea Marine Corps Vietnam

participation  220  The first South Korean troops began arriving in 1964 and large combat battalions began arriving a year later  with the South Koreans soon developing a reputation for effectiveness  Indeed arguably  they conducted counterinsurgency operations so well that American commanders felt that Korean area of responsibility was the safest  221  Approximately 320 000 South Korean soldiers were sent to Vietnam  222  each serving a one year tour of duty  Maximum troop levels peaked at 50 000 in 1968  however all were withdrawn by 1973  223  About 5 000 South Koreans were killed and 11 000 were injured during the war  South Korea killed 41 000 Viet Congs  222  United States paid South Korean soldiers 235 560 000 dollars for their service in Vietnam  222  and South Korean GNP

regular infantry which were attached to Australian formations  225  Australia s peak commitment was 7 672 combat troops and New Zealand s 552  More than 60 000 Australian personnel were involved during the course of the war  of which 521 were killed and more than 3 000 wounded  226  Approximately 3 000 New Zealanders served in Vietnam  losing 37 killed and 187 wounded  227  Most Australians

Vietnam War   1986   230  231  Women in Vietnam American nurses Da Nang  South Vietnam  1968 During the Vietnam War  women served on active duty doing a variety of jobs  Early in 1963  the Army Nurse Corps  ANC  launched Operation Nightingale  an intensive effort to recruit nurses to serve in Vietnam  Most nurses who volunteered to serve in Vietnam came from predominantly working or middle class families with histories of military service  The majority of these women were white Catholics and Protestants  232  Because the need for medical aid was great  many nurses underwent a concentrated four month training program before being deployed to Vietnam in the ANC  233  Due to the shortage of staff  nurses usually worked twelve hour shifts  six days per week and often suffered from exhaustion  First Lieutenant Sharon Lane was the only female military nurse to be killed by enemy gunfire during the war on June 8  1969  234  At the start of the Vietnam War  it was commonly thought that American women had no place in the military  Their traditional place had been in the domestic sphere  but with the war came opportunity for the expansion of gender roles  In Vietnam  women held a variety of jobs which included operating complex data processing equipment and serving as stenographers  235  Although a small number of women were assigned to combat zones  they were never allowed directly in the field of battle  The women who served in the military were solely volunteers  They faced a plethora of challenges  one of which was the relatively small number of female soldiers  Living in a male dominated environment created tensions between the sexes  While this high male to female ratio was often uncomfortable for women  many men reported that having women in the field with them boosted their morale  236  Although this was not the women s purpose  it was one positive result of the their service  By 1973  approximately 7 500 women had served in Vietnam in the Southeast Asian theater  237  In that same year  the military lifted the prohibition on women entering the armed forces  American women serving in Vietnam were subject to societal stereotypes  Many Americans either considered female in Vietnam mannish for living under the army discipline  or judged them to be women of questionable moral character who enlisted for the sole purpose of seducing men  238  To address this problem  the ANC released advertisements portraying women in the ANC as  proper  professional and well protected    26  This effort to highlight the positive aspects of a nursing career reflected the ideas of second wave feminism that occurred during the 1960s 1970s in the United States  Although female military nurses lived in a heavily male environment  very few cases of sexual harassment were ever reported  239  In 2008  by contrast  approximately one third of women in the military felt that they had been sexually harassed compared with one third of men  Vietnamese women Unlike the American women who went to Vietnam  Vietnamese women fought in the combat zone as well as provided manual labor to keep the Ho Chi Minh Trail open  they also worked in the rice fields to provide food for their families and the war effort  Women were enlisted in both the North Vietnamese Army  NVA  and the VietCong guerrilla force in South Vietnam  Nguyen Thi Dinh was an example of a woman who had fought most of her adult life against foreign forces in her country  She was a member of the Vietminh fighting against the French and was imprisoned in the 1940s but on her release continued to fight and led a revolt in 1945 in Ben Tre and also in 1960 against Diems government  In the mid 1960s  she became a deputy commander of the Viet Cong  the highest ranking combat position held by a woman during the war  240  Nguyen Thi Duc Hoan  who would later go on to be an actress director  also joined the fight at a young age and would later become a guerrilla fighter against the Americans  at the time her own daughter was training in the militia  241  Weapons U S  soldier carries a M67 recoilless rifle past a burning Viet Cong base camp in My Tho  South Vietnam  1968 Communist forces were principally armed with Chinese 242  and Soviet weaponry 243  though some Viet Cong guerrilla units were equipped with Western infantry weapons either captured from French stocks during the first Indochina war or from ARVN units or requisitioned through illicit purchase  244  The ubiquitous Soviet AK 47 was widely regarded as the best assault rifle of the war and it was not uncommon to see U S  special forces with captured AK 47s  The American M16  which replaced the M14  was considered more accurate and was lighter than the AK 47 but was prone to jamming  Oftentimes the gun suffered from a jamming flaw known as  failure to extract   which meant that a spent cartridge case remained lodged in the chamber after a bullet flew out the muzzle  245  According to a congressional report  the jamming was caused primarily by a change in gunpowder which was done without adequate testing and reflected a decision for which the safety of soldiers was a secondary consideration  246  The heavily armored  90 mm M48A3 Patton tank saw extensive action during the Vietnam War and over 600 were deployed with US Forces  They played an important role in infantry support though there were few actual tank versus tank battles  The M67A1 flamethrower tank  nicknamed the Zippo  was an M48 variant used in Vietnam  Artillery was used extensively by both sides but the Americans were able to ferry the lightweight 105 mm M102 howitzer by helicopter to remote locations on quick notice  247  248  With its 17 mile  27 km  range  the Soviet 130 mm M 46 towed field gun was a highly regarded weapon and used to good effect by the NVA  It was countered by the long range  American 175 mm M107 Self Propelled Gun  249  The United States had air superiority though many aircraft were lost to surface to air missiles and anti aircraft artillery  U S  air power was credited with breaking the siege of Khe Sanh and blunting the 1972 Communist offensive against South Vietnam  At sea  the U S  Navy had the run of the coastline  using aircraft carriers as platforms for offshore strikes and other naval vessels for offshore artillery support  Offshore naval fire played a pivotal role in the Battle for the city of Hue  providing accurate fire in support of the U S  counter offensive to retake the city  250  The Vietnam War was the first conflict that saw wide scale tactical deployment of helicopters  251  The Bell UH 1 Iroquois was used extensively in counter guerilla operations both as a troop carrier and a gunship  248  In the latter role  the  Huey  as
