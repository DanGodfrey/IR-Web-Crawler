Arkansas  derives from the same root as the name for the state of Kansas  The Kansa tribe of Native Americans are closely associated with the Sioux tribes of the Great Plains  The word  Arkansas  itself is a French pronunciation   Arcansas   of a Quapaw  a related  Kaw  tribe  word  akakaze  meaning  land of downriver people  or the Sioux word akakaze meaning  people of the south wind   The pronunciation of Arkansas was made official by an act of the state legislature in 1881  after a dispute between the two U S  Senators from Arkansas  One wanted to pronounce the name   r k nz s  ar KAN z s and the other wanted    rk ns    AR k n saw  7  In 2007  the state legislature passed a non binding resolution declaring the possessive form of the state s name to be Arkansas s  which has been followed increasingly by the state government  8   edit  Geography See also  List of Arkansas counties  List of cities in Arkansas  List of Arkansas townships  and List of Arkansas native plants View

and Greene counties where the St  Francis River forms the western boundary of the Missouri Bootheel  and in dozens of places where the current channel of the Mississippi has meandered from where it had last been legally specified  9  Arkansas shares its southern border with Louisiana  its northern border with Missouri  its eastern border with Tennessee and Mississippi  and its western border with Texas and Oklahoma  Arkansas is a land of lakes and rivers  thick forests and fertile soil  The Arkansas Delta is a flat landscape of rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding of the adjacent Mississippi  Farther away from the river  in the southeast portion of the state  the Grand Prairie consists of a more undulating landscape  Both are fertile agricultural areas  The Delta region is bisected by an unusual geological formation known as Crowley s Ridge  A narrow band of rolling hills  Crowley s Ridge rises from 250 to 500 feet  150 m  above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern Arkansas  Northwest Arkansas is part of the Ozark Plateau including the Ozark Mountains  to the south are the Ouachita Mountains  and these regions are divided by the Arkansas River  the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands  These mountain ranges are part of the U S  Interior Highlands region  the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains  10  11  The highest point in the state is Mount Magazine in the Ouachita Mountains  it rises to 2 753 feet  839 m  above sea level  Buffalo National River  one of many attractions that give the state s nickname The Natural State  Arkansas is home to many caves  such as Blanchard Springs Caverns  More than 43 000 Native American living  hunting and tool making sites  many of them Pre Columbian burial mounds and rock shelters  have been catalogued by the State Archeologist  Arkansas is currently the only U S  state in which diamonds are mined although by members of the public with primitive digging tools for a small daily fee  not by commercial interests  12  13   near Murfreesboro   Arkansas is home to many areas protected by the National Park System  These include  14  Arkansas Post National Memorial at Gillett Buffalo National River Fort Smith National Historic Site Hot Springs National Park Little Rock

hiking  and primitive camping  No mechanized vehicles are allowed in these areas  some of which are rarely visited and can provide a good experience of feeling as if you are the only person to have ever stepped foot there   edit  Climate Arkansas generally has a humid subtropical climate  which borders on humid continental in some northern highland areas  While not bordering the Gulf of Mexico  Arkansas is still close enough to this warm  large body of water for it to influence the weather in the state  Generally  Arkansas has hot  humid summers and cold  slightly drier winters  In Little Rock  the daily high temperatures average around 93  F  34  C  with lows around 73  F  23  C  in the month of July  In January highs average around 51  F  11  C  and lows around 32  F  0  C   In Siloam Springs in the northwest part of the state  the average high and low temperatures in July are 89  F  32  C  and 67  F  19  C  and in January the average high and lows are 44  F  7  C  and 23  F   5  C   Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about 40 and 60 inches  1 000 and 1 500 mm   somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state  15  Snowfall is common  more so in the north half of the state  which usually gets several snowfalls each winter  This is not only due to its closer proximity to the plains states  but also to the higher elevations found throughout the Ozark and Ouachita mountains  The half of the state south of Little Rock gets less snow  and is more apt to see ice storms  however  sleet and freezing rain are expected throughout the state during the winter months  and can significantly impact travel and day to day life  Arkansas  all time record high is 120  F  49  C  at Ozark on August 10  1936  the all time record low is  29  F   34  C  at Pond on February 13  1905  Arkansas is known for extreme weather  A typical year will see thunderstorms  tornadoes  hail  snow and ice storms  Between both the Great Plains and the Gulf States  Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms  A few of the most destructive tornadoes in U S  history have struck the state  While being sufficiently away from the coast to be safe from a direct hit from a hurricane  Arkansas can often get the remnants of a tropical system which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes   edit  History Flatside Wilderness Area  Ouachita Mountains  Arkansas Main article  History of Arkansas The first European to reach Arkansas was the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto  a veteran of Pizarro s conquest of Peru who died near Lake Village on the Mississippi River in 1542 after almost a year traversing the southern part of the state in search of gold and a passage to China  Arkansas is one of several U S  states formed from the territory purchased from Napoleon Bonaparte in the Louisiana Purchase  The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name  which is probably a phonetic spelling of the Illinois tribe s name for the Quapaw people  who lived downriver from them  16  Other Native American tribes who lived in Arkansas before moving west were the Quapaw  Caddo  and Osage nations  In their forced move westward  under U S  Indian removal policies   the Five Civilized Tribes inhabited Arkansas during its territorial period  The Territory of Arkansas 7  was organized on July 4  1819  On June 15  1836  the state of Arkansas was admitted to the Union as the 25th state and the 13th slave state  Planters settled in the Delta to cultivate cotton  this was the area of the state where most enslaved African Americans were held  Other areas had more subsistence farmers and mixed farming  Arkansas played a key role in aiding Texas in its war for independence from Mexico  it sent troops and materials to Texas to help fight the war  The proximity of the city of Washington to the Texas border involved the town in the Texas Revolution of 1835 36  Some evidence suggests Sam Houston and his compatriots planned the revolt in a tavern at Washington in 1834  17  When the fighting began  a stream of volunteers from Arkansas and the southeastern states flowed through the town toward the Texas battle fields  When the Mexican American War began in 1846  Washington became a rendezvous for volunteer troops  Governor Thomas S  Drew issued a proclamation calling on the state to furnish one regiment of cavalry and one battalion of infantry to join the United States Army  Ten companies of men assembled here  where they were formed into the first Regiment of Arkansas Cavalry  The state developed a cotton culture in the east in lands of the Mississippi Delta  This was where enslaved labor was used most extensively  as planters brought with them or imported slaves from the Upper South  On the eve of the Civil War in 1860  enslaved African Americans numbered 111 115 people  just over 25  of the state s population  18  Arkansas refused to join the Confederate States of America until after United States President Abraham Lincoln called for troops to respond to the Confederate attack upon Fort Sumter  South Carolina  The state of Arkansas declared its secession from the Union on May 6  1861  While not often cited in historical accounts  the state was the scene of numerous small scale battles during the American Civil War  Arkansans of note who contributed to the Civil War included Confederate Major General Patrick Cleburne  Considered by many to be one of the most brilliant Confederate division commanders of the war  Cleburne was often referred to as  The Stonewall of the West   Also of note was Major General Thomas C  Hindman  A former United States Representative  Hindman commanded Confederate forces at the Battle of Cane Hill and Battle of Prairie Grove  Under the Military Reconstruction Act  Congress restored Arkansas to the Union in June 1868  The Reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage while disenfranchising former Confederates  mostly Democrats   a public education system  and other general issues to improve the state and help more of the population  The state came under almost exclusive control of Radical Republicans   those who emigrated from the North being derided as  carpetbaggers  by ex Confederates based on allegations of corruption   led by newly elected Governor Powell Clayton  marking a time of great upheaval and racial violence in the state between state militia and the Ku Klux Klan  In 1874  the Brooks Baxter War  a political struggle between factions of the Republican Party shook Little Rock and the state governorship  It was settled only when President Ulysses S  Grant ordered Joseph Brooks to disperse his militant supporters  19  Following the Brooks Baxter War  a new state constitution was ratified re enfranchising former Confederates  In 1881  the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation of the state s name  to combat a controversy then simmering   See Law and Government below   After Reconstruction  the state began to receive more immigrants and migrants  Chinese  Italian  and Syrian men were recruited for farm labor in the developing Delta region  None of these nationalities stayed long at farm labor  the Chinese especially quickly became small merchants in towns around the Delta  Some early 20th century immigration included people from eastern Europe  Together  these immigrants made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state  In the same years  some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property  Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college  20  Wife and children of a sharecropper in Washington County  Arkansas  c  1935 Construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market  It also brought new development into different parts of the state  including the Ozarks  where some areas were developed as resorts  In a few years at the end of the 19th century  for instance  Eureka Springs in Carroll County grew to 10 000 people  rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth largest city of the state  It featured newly constructed  elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs  considered to have healthful properties  The town s attractions included horse racing and other entertainment  It appealed to a wide variety of classes  becoming almost as popular as Hot Springs  In the late 1880s  the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements  leading to interracial coalitions  Struggling to stay in power  in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that disfranchised blacks and poor whites  Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance  In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a literacy test  knowing that many blacks and whites would be excluded  at a time when more than 25  of the population could neither read nor write  In 1892 they amended the state constitution to include a poll tax and more complex residency requirements  both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers  and forced them from electoral rolls  By 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the white primary in county and state elections  further denying blacks a part in the political process  Only in the primary was there any competition among candidates  as Democrats held all the power  The state was a Democratic one party state for decades  until after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 were passed  21  Between 1905 and 1911  Arkansas began to receive a small migration of German  Slovak  and Irish immigrants  The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the Prairie  and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state  The Germans were mostly Catholic and the Slovaks were Lutheran  The Irish were mostly Protestant from Ulster  After the Supreme Court s decision in Brown v  Board of Education of Topeka  Kansas in 1954  the Little Rock Nine brought Arkansas to national attention when the Federal government intervened to protect African American students trying to integrate a high school in the Arkansas capital  Governor Orval Faubus ordered the Arkansas National Guard to aid segregationists in preventing nine African American students from enrolling at Little Rock s Central High School  After attempting three times to contact Faubus  President Dwight D  Eisenhower sent 1000 troops from the active duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African American students as they entered school on September 25  1957  In defiance of federal court orders to integrate  the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year  By the fall of 1959  the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated  22  Bill Clinton  the 42nd President of the United States  was born in Hope  Arkansas  Before his presidency  Clinton served as the 40th and 42nd Governor of Arkansas  a total of nearly 12 years   edit  Demographics Historical

Party holds majority status in the Arkansas General Assembly  A majority of local and statewide offices are also held by Democrats  This is rare in the modern South  where a majority of statewide offices are held by Republicans  Arkansas had the distinction in 1992 of being the only state in the country to give the majority of its vote to a single candidate in the presidential election native son Bill Clinton while every other state s electoral votes were won by pluralities of the vote among the three candidates  Arkansas has become more reliably Republican in presidential elections in recent years  The state voted for John McCain in 2008 by a margin of 20 percentage points  making it one of the few states in the country to vote more Republican than it had in 2004   The others were Louisiana  Tennessee  Oklahoma and West Virginia   42  Obama s relatively poor showing in Arkansas was likely due to a lack of enthusiasm from state Democrats following former Arkansas First Lady Hillary Clinton s failure to win the nomination citation needed   and his relatively poor performance among rural white voters  However  the Democratic presence remains strong on the state level  in 2006  Democrats were elected to all statewide offices by the voters in a Democratic sweep that included the Democratic Party of Arkansas regaining the governorship  and in 2008  freshman Senator Mark Pryor was re elected with nearly 80  of the vote against Green candidate Rebekah Kennedy with no Republican opposition  citation needed  Most Republican strength lies mainly in the northwestern part of the state  particularly Fort Smith and Bentonville  as well as North Central Arkansas around the Mountain Home area  In the latter area  Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote  The rest of the state is more Democratic  Arkansas has only elected two Republicans to the U S  Senate since Reconstruction  Tim Hutchinson  who was defeated after one term by Mark Pryor and John Boozman  who defeated incumbent Blanche Lincoln  The General Assembly has not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction and is the fourth most heavily Democratic Legislature in the country  after Massachusetts  Hawaii  and Connecticut  Arkansas was one of just three states among the states of the former Confederacy that sent two Democrats to the U S  Senate  the others being Florida and Virginia  during the first decade of the 21st century  Although Democrats have an overwhelming majority of registered voters  Arkansas Democrats tend to be slightly more conservative than their national counterparts  particularly outside Little Rock  Arkansas  Democratic congressman is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition  which tends to be more pro business  pro military  and socially conservative than the center left Democratic mainstream  Reflecting the state s large evangelical population  the state has a strong social conservative bent  Under the Arkansas Constitution Arkansas is a right to work state  its voters passed a ban on same sex marriage with 75  voting yes  and the state is one of a handful with legislation on its books banning abortion in the event Roe v  Wade is ever overturned  In Arkansas  the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party  Each officer s term is four years long  Office holders are term limited to two full terms plus any partial terms before the first full term  Arkansas governors served two year terms until a referendum lengthened the term to four years  effective with the 1986 general election  Statewide elections are held two years after presidential elections  Some of Arkansas s counties have two county seats  as opposed to the usual one seat  The arrangement dates back to when travel was extremely difficult in the state  The seats are usually on opposite sides of the county  Though travel is no longer the difficulty it once was  there are few efforts to eliminate the two seat arrangement where it exists  since the county seat is a source of pride  and jobs  to the city involved  Arkansas is the only state to specify the pronunciation of its name by law  AR kan saw   7  Article 19  Miscellaneous Provisions   Item 1 in the Arkansas Constitution is entitled  Atheists disqualified from holding office or testifying as witness   and states that  No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State  nor be competent to testify as a witness in any Court   However  in 1961  the United States Supreme Court in Torcaso v  Watkins  1961   held that a similar requirement in Maryland was unenforceable because it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution  The latter amendment  per current precedent  makes the federal Bill of Rights binding on the states  As a result  this provision has not been known to have been enforced in modern times  and it is understood that it would be struck down if challenged in court  See also  List of Arkansas Governors and Political party strength in Arkansas  edit  Metropolitan areas The Little Rock North Little Rock Pine Bluff Combined

name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions  The region was organized as the Territory of Arkansaw on July 4  1819  but the territory was admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15  1836  The name was historically    rk ns       r k nz s   and several other variants  In 1881  the Arkansas General Assembly passed the following concurrent resolution  now Arkansas Code 1 4 105  official text   Whereas  confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings  And  whereas  the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock  which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history  and the early usage of the American immigrants  Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly  that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state  in the opinion of this body  is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound  It should be pronounced in three  3  syllables  with the final  s  silent  the  a  in each syllable with the Italian sound  and the accent on the first and last syllables  The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of  a  in  man  and the sounding of the terminal  s  is an innovation to be discouraged  Citizens of the state of Kansas often pronounce the Arkansas River as   r k nz s  r v r   in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state    Gambrell  John   Senate gives support to possessive form of Arkansas   Arkansas Democrat Gazette
