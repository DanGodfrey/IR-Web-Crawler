h  m z   officially the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  is a nation consisting of more than 3 000 islands  cays  and islets  It is located in the Atlantic Ocean north of Cuba and Hispaniola  Dominican Republic and Haiti   northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands  and southeast of the United States  nearest to the state of Florida   Its land area is 13 939 km2  5 382 sq mi   with a population of 353 658  Its capital is Nassau  Geographically  The Bahamas lie in the same island chain as Cuba  Hispaniola and the Turks and Caicos Islands  the designation of Bahamas refers normally to the Commonwealth and not the geographic chain  Originally inhabited by the Lucayans  a branch of the Arawakan speaking Taino people  the Bahamas were the site of Columbus  first landfall in the New World in 1492  Although the Spanish never colonized the Bahamas  they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola  The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 to 1648  when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera  The Bahamas became a Crown Colony in 1718 when the British clamped down on piracy  After the American War of Independence  thousands of pro British loyalists and enslaved Africans moved to the Bahamas and set up a plantation economy  The slave trade was abolished in the British Empire in 1807 and many Africans liberated from slave ships by the Royal Navy were settled in the Bahamas during the 19th century  Slavery itself was abolished in 1834 and the descendants form the majority of the Bahamas s population today  In terms of GDP per capita  The Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the Americas  following Bermuda  the United States  Cayman Islands  Canada  and the British Virgin Islands  8  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2 1 18th

upper middle land    9   edit  History Map of The Bahamas Main article  History of The Bahamas Taino people moved into the uninhabited southern Bahamas from Hispaniola and Cuba around the 11th century AD  These people came to be known as the Lucayans  There were an estimated 30 000  Lucayans at the time of Columbus s arrival in 1492  Christopher Columbus s first landfall in the New World was on an island named San Salvador  known to the Lucayans as Guanahani   which some researchers believe to be present day San Salvador Island   also known as Watling s Island  in the southeastern Bahamas  An alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on Samana Cay  according to calculations made in 1986 by National Geographic writer and editor Joseph Judge based on Columbus s log  Evidence in support of this remains inconclusive  On the landfall island  Columbus made first contact with the Lucayans and exchanged goods with them  The Lucayans throughout the Bahamas were wiped out as a result of Spanish forced migration of the population to Hispaniola for use as forced labour there  and exposure to diseases to which they had no immunity  10  The smallpox that ravaged the Taino Indians after Columbus s arrival wiped out half of the population in what is now The Bahamas  11  It is generally assumed that the islands were uninhabited by Europeans until the mid 17th century  However  recent research suggests that there may have been attempts to settle the islands by groups from Spain  France  and Britain  as well as by other Amerindians  In 1648  the Eleutherian Adventurers migrated from Bermuda  These English Puritans established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named Eleuthera the name derives from the Greek word for freedom  They later settled New Providence  naming it Sayle s Island after one of their leaders  To survive  the settlers resorted to salvaged goods from wrecks  In 1670 King Charles II granted the islands to the Lords Proprietors of the Carolinas  who rented the islands from the king with rights of trading  tax  appointing governors  and administering the country  12  In 1684 Spain s corsair Juan de Alcon raided the capital  Charles Town  later renamed Nassau   and in 1703 a joint Franco Spanish expedition briefly occupied the Bahamian capital during the War of the Spanish Succession   edit  18th century During proprietary rule  the Bahamas became a haven for pirates  including the infamous Blackbeard  To restore orderly government  The Bahamas were made a British crown colony in 1718 under the royal governorship of Woodes Rogers  who  after a difficult struggle  succeeded in suppressing piracy  13  In 1720  Rogers led local militia to drive off a Spanish attack  During the American War of Independence  the islands were a target for American naval forces under the command of Commodore Ezekial Hopkins  The capital of Nassau on the island of New Providence was occupied by US Marines for a fortnight  In 1782  following the British defeat at Yorktown  a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau  and the city surrendered without a fight  After American independence  some 7 300 Loyalists and their slaves moved to the Bahamas from New York  Florida  and the Carolinas  These Loyalists established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital  The small population became mostly African from this point on  The British abolished the slave trade in 1807  which led to the forced settlement on Bahamian islands of thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships by the Royal Navy  Slavery itself was finally abolished in the British Empire on August 1  1834   edit  20th century Modern political development began after the Second World War  The first political parties were formed in the 1950s and the British made the islands internally self governing in 1964  with Sir Roland Symonette of the United Bahamian Party as the first premier  The fourth James Bond film Thunderball was partly filmed in 1965 in Nassau  In 1967  Sir Lynden Pindling of the Progressive Liberal Party became the first black premier of the colony  and in 1968 the title was changed to prime minister  In 1973  The Bahamas became fully independent  but retained membership in the Commonwealth of Nations  Sir Milo Butler was appointed the first Bahamian governor general  the representative of Queen Elizabeth II  shortly after independence  Based on the twin pillars of tourism and offshore finance  the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s  However  there remain significant challenges in areas such as education  health care  housing  international narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration from Haiti  The College of The Bahamas is the national higher education  tertiary system  Offering baccalaureate  masters and associate degrees  COB has three campuses and teaching and research centers throughout The Bahamas  The College is in the process of becoming The University of The Bahamas as early as 2012   edit  Geography and climate Main article  Geography of The Bahamas The Bahamas from space  NASA Aqua satellite image  2009 The country lies between latitudes 20  and 28 N  and longitudes 72  and 80 W  In 1864 the Governor of the Bahamas reported that there were 29 islands  661 cays  and 2 387 rocks in the colony  14  The closest island to the United States is Bimini  which is also known as the gateway to The Bahamas  The island of Abaco is to the east of Grand Bahama  The southeasternmost island is Inagua  The largest island is Andros Island  Other inhabited islands include Eleuthera  Cat Island  Long Island  San Salvador Island  Acklins  Crooked Island  Exuma and Mayaguana  Nassau  capital city of The Bahamas  lies on the island of New Providence  All the islands are low and flat  with ridges that usually rise no more than 15 to 20 m  49 to 66 ft   The highest point in the country is Mount Alvernia   formerly Como Hill  on Cat Island  It has an altitude of 63 metres  207 ft   To the southeast  the Turks and Caicos Islands  and three more extensive submarine features called Mouchoir Bank  Silver Bank  and Navidad Bank  are geographically a continuation of The Bahamas  but not part of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas  citation needed   edit  Climate See also  Geography of the Bahamas The climate of The Bahamas is subtropical to tropical  and is moderated significantly by the waters of the Gulf Stream  particularly in winter  15  Conversely  this often proves very dangerous in the summer and autumn  when hurricanes pass near or through the islands  Hurricane Andrew hit the northern islands during the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season  and Hurricane Floyd hit most of the islands during the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season  While there has never been a freeze reported in The Bahamas  the temperature can fall as low as 2 3  C  35 6 37 4  F  during Arctic outbreaks that affect nearby Florida  Snow was reported to have mixed with rain in Freeport in January 1977  the same time that it snowed in the Miami area  16  The temperature was about 4 5  C  40 1  F  at the time  17  Climate data for Nassau

mast  superimposed on a horizontal background made up of two colours on three equal stripes of aquamarine  gold and aquamarine  The symbolism of the flag is as follows  Black  a strong colour  represents the vigour and force of a united people  the triangle pointing towards the body of the flag represents the enterprise and determination of the Bahamian people to develop and possess the

scripted the national motto  22   Forward  Upward  Onward Together   The yellow elder  edit  National flower The yellow elder was chosen as the national flower of The Bahamas because it is native to the Bahama Islands  and it blooms throughout the year  Selection of the yellow elder over many other flowers was made through the combined popular vote of members of all four of New Providence s garden clubs of the 1970s   the Nassau Garden Club  the Carver Garden Club  the International Garden Club  and the YWCA Garden Club  They reasoned that other flowers grown there   such as the bougainvillea  hibiscus  and poinciana   had already been chosen as the national flowers of other countries  The yellow elder  on the other hand  was unclaimed by other countries  although it is now also the national flower of the United States Virgin Islands   23   edit  Economy Cruise ships in Nassau Harbour Main article  Economy of The Bahamas One of the most prosperous countries in the Caribbean region  The Bahamas relies on tourism to generate most of its economic activity  Tourism as an industry not only accounts for over 60 percent of the Bahamian GDP  but provides jobs for more

the largest ethnic group in The Bahamas  accounting for some 85  of the country s population  1   edit  Europeans European Bahamians  or Bahamians of European descent  numbering about 38 000  28  are mainly the descendants of the British Puritans and American Loyalists who arrived in 1649 and 1783 respectively  29  They form the largest minority group in The Bahamas  making up some 12  of the population  1  Many Southern Loyalists went to Abaco  which is about 50  white  30  A small portion of the European Bahamian population is descended from Greek labourers who came to help develop the sponging industry in the 1900s  Although making up less than 1  of the nation s population  they have been able to preserve their distinct Greek Bahamian culture  One of the features of the Bahamian genealogy is that most families have branches  and even immediate family members  spanning the entire spectrum between   light    brown  and  unequivocally dark    31   edit  Demographics Population
