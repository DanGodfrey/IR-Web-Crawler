Cyclops due to her inherent tracking skills as well as assassination training  Wolverine is later approached to lead the team  and although he accepts  he becomes angry and disappointed to find out that Cyclops had drafted Laura without consulting him first  and that Laura had agreed to join an operation that would expose her to the same types of brutality and ruthlessness that he had been trying to remove her from in the first place  Wolverine asks her to reconsider taking part in the operation  since he feels that she does not understand what she is giving up and stating that if she

Wolfsbane and Angel  and also decide what to do with Elixir  who unfortunately knows too much about X Force  X 23 believes the easiest thing to do would be to kill Josh  but she knows that would not be allowed  Instead  she goes behind everyone s back and contacts the Stepford Cuckoos  who are loyal to Cyclops and would keep X Force s existence a secret  X 23 and Josh request that the Three in One erase Josh s memories of X Force  thus allowing him to return home without being a risk to the team  Around this time  a S H I E L D  member known as Agent Morales begins looking into X 23 s past

twisted joke and attempts to hit her in anger  but the punch is stopped due to X 23 s reflexes  Jubilee explains that despite being a predator  she wants to keep the remaining shards of her humanity intact  She decided to leave Utopia because the people she once considered friends are now afraid of her  to the point of wanting to kill her  X 23 empathizes with her because she was born and raised to be a killer  and murder is the only way she knows she s alive  X 23 left because she couldn t just become someone new that easily  especially with the others watching and judging  Jubilee questions

bends back in position and attempts to continue her assault on Jubilee  Gambit and Wolverine intervene to calm X 23 s rage  Wolverine takes the full impact of her blows stating that he is not going to give up on her  Gambit manages to get X 23 to remember who really cares about her  X 23 s rage disappears and she apologizes to the group  24   edit  Chaos Theory While having a dream of a mysterious symbol  Laura wakes up in a cab as she and Gambit are in New York  The two later met with Cecilia Reyes  as Gambit was bleeding from his groin  and X 23 left him in Cecilia s care while she went to search Alex Cimini for information  As she found him in a lab on the University Physics Department  she instead left him alone and left  unknown to her  a bright light appeared in the lab Alex was in  While walking on the street  Laura saw the same symbol from her dream in the sky and on a man  as an earthquake appeared and the building near her collapsed  As Laura was helping an elderly woman from a few stories floor  Spider Man appeared and helped brought them down  Laura and Spider Man later saw the symbol appearing in the sky  and both realised that they have been dreaming the same symbol  After the two helped save civilians from the collapsed building  Laura and Spider Man were approched by Reed Richards  Susan Storm and Ben Grimm  25  The Future Foundation then brought Laura back to the Baxter Building to run some tests and discovered her emitting energy signatures were responsible for the earthquake  Later  a device showed Reed and Valeria that Laura  Spider Man and Sue were all emitting the same energy signature  Spider Man realises that the energy emitting from them is involved with the Uni Power that changes beings into Captain Universe  While discussing even further  Valeria activates the device and Laura  Spider Man and Sue are transported to an alien world  where they were confronted by monstrous warriors  26   edit  Misadventures In Babysitting X 23 babysits Reed and Susan s children Franklin and Valeria  She is trying to decide what direction to take in her life  27  Valeria and Franklin Richards play with a temporal window  that unleashes a dragon  Hellion appears as all of them are transported to a space junkyard  28  Hellion finally kisses X 23 only to be rejected by her saying that she no longer has feelings for him  Jubilee appears to tell her to come back to Utopia so she can make a decision as to what side of the  schism  she wants to be on  29   edit  X Men  Regenesis X 23 was asked by Wolverine to join him  she replies by if there is any other choice  30  While she thinks what choice she will make  X 23 went for a walk with Jubilee and asked her why did she choose Cyclops  side  Jubilee tells her she chose to stay with Cyclops because  as vampire  she can hear the heartbeat of everyone around her and it makes her hungry and want to eat them  X 23 tells her that she won t hurt them but Jubilee tells her that the urge is there and she needs to fight as much she needs blood and she can t be with Wolverine because she s afraid to violate his new philosophy  if you re a kid you don t fight  as he sees her as a kid  X tell her Logan sees her the same way  they both agree that it sucks  X s phone rings as the others need an answer  but they ignore it and Jubilee tells X to go and have some fun and dance  X tells her she can t dance but Jubilee tells her it doesn t matter because she s hot  X tell her she s not hot  However  as they go  someone follows them  While Jubilee was dancing  X was looking at someone and after knowing that he took over Zebra Daddy s operation after she killed him  She and Jubilee beat him and his men and take the girl who was with him and know where is the other girls and free them  As they think about what to do with the girls as they can t just call the police  the Black Widow and some S H I E L D agent appear and take the girls to help them  Natasha offers X to come to the Avengers Academy and she accepts  The next day she tells Logan what happened  and Wolverine tells her he is going to miss her and he is sorry he couldn t do better by her  She tells him she is going to miss him too  then she takes a bike and drives to the Academy  31   edit  Avengers Academy Following Fear Itself  X 23 appears as one of the students at the new Avengers Academy  32  The Academy sees she doesn t need any combat training after she fought Tigra  After she introduced herself to the other students  she explained to Mettle the difference between killing an innocent and killing to protect an innocent  telling him that he is not a psycho killer  and that they can talk more about it another time  This makes Hazmat feel jealous  33   edit  Powers and abilities X 23 is a female clone created from Wolverine s genetic material  Consequently  her mutant powers are similar to his  Like Wolverine  X 23 s primary mutant ability is an accelerated healing factor that allows her to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissues with far greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human  Injuries such as gunshot wounds  slashes  and puncture wounds completely heal within a matter of minutes  Her healing factor is developed to such a degree that she can reattach severed limbs  She has also been shown to be able to regrow limbs  for example  she regrew her arm in time after Kimura had severed it from her body  She severs her own hand to escape the restraints placed on her by Kimura  34  The effects of her accelerated healing powers extend to her body s immune system  rendering her immune to disease and infection  She is also immune to most drugs and toxins  although she can be affected by certain drugs if given sufficient dosage  X 23 s mutant healing factor heightened her physical senses  strength  speed  agility  reflexes reactions  coordination  balance  endurance to superhuman levels  Like Wolverine  X 23 possesses retractable claws sheathed within her forearms  She releases the claws through the tissue of her knuckles  leaving small wounds which are healed by her healing factor  Unlike Wolverine  however  X 23 has only two claws that emerge from her fists  She possesses a single  retractable claw housed within each foot  These claws are actually made of bone and were forcefully extracted by Zander Rice  sharpened  coated with adamantium  and reinserted into her body  Also unlike Wolverine  X 23 escaped before the procedure to fuse her entire skeleton with adamantium could be performed  34  Since the claws are laced with adamantium  they are virtually unbreakable and are capable of cutting almost any substance  The four known exceptions are adamantium itself  Kimura s skin  the alloy of Captain America s shield  and Thor s hammer Mjolnir   edit  Special skills Born and raised in captivity  X 23 has been trained to become a living weapon  She is highly trained in the use of long range weapons and explosives and is a formidable hand to hand combatant  with intensive training in numerous armed and unarmed martial arts techniques  She has also been subjected to conditioning in which a specific  trigger scent  has been used to send her into a berserker rage  killing anything in sight  Emma Frost is unsure if this will ever be fully suppressed  She is also highly educated and so far has displayed that she is fluent in French and Japanese   edit  Personality Upon initially encountering her  X 23 might be mistaken for a typical young woman  calm and quiet  However  as her character evolved  she has become somewhat darker and more complex  X 23 is very taciturn  rarely uttering more than one sentence or two at a time  Because she grew up in a controlled environment  she speaks using perfect grammar  rarely using slang  She also engages in self injury  cutting herself with her own claws  this is something she has done since a very young age  2  35  36  X 23 is a highly trained and skilled combatant  she is able to kill dozens of heavily armed opponents during a single encounter  X 23 s mother  Dr  Sarah Kinney  did her best to ensure the child retained some semblance of humanity  but her efforts appeared to be in vain  X 23 rarely spoke  or expressed much interest in her mother  who was forced to reject any emotional advance the girl might make  such as laying her head in her mother s lap  because of the Facility  Despite the upbringing X 23 received  she has always shown signs of humanity  In one particular mission when X 23 was assigned to assassinate Martin Sutter and his family  she killed Sutter and his wife without hesitation  but she spared their young son  Henry  2  X 23 seemed to have taken up a better disposition since joining the New X Men  37  She became a student at the Xavier Institute  found friends in Dust and Mercury  and developed apparent romantic feelings towards Hellion  Being a central part of a team helped her adjust to the world  However  she still retains the cold  no nonsense attitude that was evident in the Mercury Falling arc which  along with the Children of X Men arc  showed that Laura also has trouble comprehending and expressing the many new emotions she has been experiencing for the very first time  When Blackheart forced her to face her fears embodied in a single  perfect  adversary   her fears took the form of  X 666   a stereotypical cheerleader with murderous intents  X 666 then explained how she was meant to be the thing lacking to Laura to be truly human  while every human is  nuanced   possessing a dark side and an inner self rarely shown to others  Laura s upbringing left her utterly bidimensional  driven and apparently lacking any other personality trait beyond the ones she s already showing  unable to grow further as person   38   edit  Relationships In X 23  Target X  she had a close friendship with her cousin  Megan  and received a locket from her  containing her mother s passport picture and a picture of Megan  which X 23 wears throughout the New X Men run  During the events of NYX  X 23 befriends a number of mutant runaways  By the first time she comes to live at the Xavier Institute  she has regressed to sullen silence and snarls  which are a ploy to keep people away for their own safety  She has developed bonds with roommates Kitty Pryde and Rachel Summers  and has formed a solid bond with Psylocke  due to their mutual love of battle  X 23 has found common ground with the cosmic being known as Captain Universe who  like X 23  has been hunted relentlessly by terrorists who wish to use his power for their own selfish ends  Although their meeting was brief  the two formed an intimate and intricate bond that is common amongst most Uni Power recipients  When she returns to the school  X 23 is met with much apprehension from headmistress Emma Frost  Emma does  however  come to appreciate her as a valuable member of the New X Men team  The other students become more receptive of her  especially following her major role in countering Stryker s attack  Subsequently  she bonds with her teammates  she and Sooraya develop a mutual respect for each other  She is also good friends with Mercury  whom she saved on two different occasions  Cessily is one of the first people to instantly show respect to her and she treats her with kindness  especially chiding Santo for calling her clone and says firmly her name is Laura  She also ran after Laura after Nori kissed Julian and she hugged her tightly  Laura was even willing to sacrifice her life to protect her and Julian  The first time Laura and Julian meet each other  Julian is harsh to her  mostly because his ex girlfriend Sophia stopped talking to him because of an underhanded remark he made about depowered individuals being useless  Hellion takes out his pent up frustration out on her while Laura  completely silent  takes an instant fascination to him  This is shown when in the Danger Cave  Julian gets attacked by dinosaurs and she constantly saves him  However  he treats her like a dog and tells her to shoo  When Hellion gets injured while checking the bus that exploded  he subsequently appears at the funeral where Laura is shown to be watching him walk by  During the New X Men s battle with Nimrod in Texas  Laura helped Surge and Mercury deliver the finishing blow by jumping directly on the android and slicing open its armor  Though the attack is successful  Laura ends up taking the full brunt of Nimrod s energy attacks which incinerated her body past the limits of her healing abilities  With the team crippled and seriously wounded  Julian compels Emma to unlock the mental block that controls his powers so that he can fly X 23 back to the mansion at hypersonic speeds  Hellion manages to bring Laura to the mansion in the nick of time  but the strain of his uncontrolled powers and the previous battle causes him to pass out and fall asleep for a few days  Laura stood over Julian for a long time  just watching him but when he said  Sophia  in his sleep  she was visibly upset and left the room  She even watches over him when he does his training with Beast  causing Emma Frost to reveal that she had been following Hellion around  Cessily eventually overhears and asks about her liking Julian  but Laura merely responds  I do not wish to talk about this   smiling a little  When Cessily is captured  Laura gets ready to go after her  until Hellion walks in and demands to go with her  She refuses  mostly out of concern for his safety  but he forces her to take him by flying them both  This caused her to blush a little  When she kills a man in front of him  he freaks out and tells her to stop killing  This upsets her greatly  Also twice in this arc  Julian is referred to as  your boyfriend   During the Quest for Magik  Nori and Julian end up having a talk about what happened  and Hellion states that X 23 is seriously  messed up   In the Children of X Men arc  Surge unexpectedly kisses Julian in front of the whole school to upset Prodigy enough so he d leave the institute  When Laura sees this  she simply unsheathes her claws and appears to storm off  Cessily later finds a bloodied Laura sitting against the wall of a bathroom she had just completely demolished  Laura tells her that she doesn t understand all these emotions she has been feeling and is afraid she might hurt someone  Meanwhile  Julian admits to Dust that he s confused about romance and  he can t stop thinking about a girl that literally scares him   In the Messiah Complex event  Julian is seriously wounded by Lady Deathstrike  When Laura fights and apparently kills Deathstrike later  she says that Deathstrike was  dead the moment she touched Julian Keller   During X Force Wolverine regrets giving out the names of the captives  noting that among them is Julian at which he notes   I could smell it on her  Her whole body lit up when I said Keller s name   39  She also says before passing out  Have  to get  to Julian   Also  during Second Coming when Julian is critically injured  she can be seen visiting him with sadness in her face before going on X Force s assumed suicide mission  40  When Laura met the X Kids after Second Coming  Surge was relentlessly bullying her about her involvement in X Force  Hellion states that he was happy to see her  as it was different when she wasn t getting him in trouble  He was going to say something when out of the blue  Laura says that she had missed him  This shocks Julian  who says that she has never said that to him before   You know I am not good with words   After Hellverine reveals himself to Laura  she attacks him but Julian walks in at the same time  thinking Laura has gone crazy and restrains her with TK  She tells him he s making a mistake but he says he s doing this because she s his best friend  When Hellverine stabs Hellion  Laura offers her soul in exchange for reviving Hellion  In hell  Hellverine taunts her  saying that they re all scared of her  and  are they still worth it   He points out Julian  whom she knows to herself that he is worth saving  This turns out to be all in her mind but it visibly has an effect on her and causes her to want to leave the X Men  Before she leaves  she tries to say goodbye to Hellion but thinking he is asleep  she just stares at him and walks away  Unknown to her  he was never asleep  Laura has also developed a somewhat antagonistic relationship with Jubilee  This seems to stem from the latter s amicable relationship with Wolverine  who both girls see as a father figure  While meeting up in Paris with both girls in tow  Gambit tells Wolverine not to pretend that  it doesn t make it hard for her when she sees the difference in how  he  treat Jubilee   41   edit

she was 12  her entire skeleton was infused with adamantium  Upon learning about her genetic origins and raiding a S H I E L D  facility to get information about his whereabouts  X 23 angrily decided to get revenge on Wolverine  whom she held responsible for her creation  She invaded the X Mansion and handily defeated the other X Men and New Mutants inside  When Wolverine confronted her  he calmed her by pointing out that he knew what she was going through and that he is the closest thing to family she has  and instead of turning her over to S H I E L D  like Nick Fury wanted  he let her go  Later  Wolverine would encounter X 23 again  on the run from Hydra s agents as well as S H I E L D  She allowed herself and Wolverine to be captured  with the intention of using this as a way into
