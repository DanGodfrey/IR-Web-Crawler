edit  Popularity Dollar coins have found little popular acceptance in circulation in the United States since the early 20th century  despite several attempts since 1971 to phase in a coin in place of the one dollar bill  This contrasts with currencies of most other developed countries  where denominations of similar value exist only in coin  These coins have largely succeeded because of a removal  or lack  of their corresponding paper issues 1   whereas the United States government has taken no action to remove the one dollar bill  due to either intensive lobbying by  Save the Greenback  or genuine consumer resistance  The United States Government Accountability Office  GAO  has stated that discontinuing the dollar bill in favor of the dollar coin would save the U S  government approximately  5 5 billion over thirty years  1   edit  Mint Marks The mint marks are  C    CC    D    D    O    P    S   and  W    C   Charlotte  North Carolina  gold coins only  1838 1861    CC

coins from many European nations circulated freely in the American colonies  as did coinage issued by the various colonies  Chief among these was the Spanish silver dollar coins  also called pieces of eight or eight reales  minted in Mexico and other colonies with silver mined from Central and South American mines  These coins  along with others of similar size and value  were in use throughout the colonies  and later the United States  and were legal tender until 1857  In 1776  the Continental Congress authorized plans to produce a silver coin to prop up the rapidly failing Continental the first attempt by the fledgling US at paper currency  Several examples were struck in brass  pewter  and silver  but a circulating coin was not produced  due in large part to the financial difficulties of running the Revolutionary War  The Continental Dollar bears a date of 1776  and while its true denomination is not known  it is generally the size of later dollars  and the name has stuck  The failure of the Continental exacerbated a distrust of paper money among both politicians and the populace at large  The letters of Thomas Jefferson indicate that he wished the United States to eschew paper money and instead mint coins of similar perceived value and worth to those foreign coins circulating at the time  2  The Coinage Act of 1792 authorized the production of dollar coins from silver  The United States Mint produced silver dollar coins from 1794 to 1803  then ceased regular production of silver dollars until 1836  The first silver dollars  precisely 1 758 of them  were coined on October 15  1794 and were immediately delivered to Mint Director David Rittenhouse for distribution to dignitaries as souvenirs  3  Thereafter  until 1804  they were struck in varying quantities  There are two obverse designs  Flowing Hair  1794 1795  and Draped Bust  1795 1804   There are also two reverse designs used for the Draped Bust variety  small eagle  1795 1798  and heraldic eagle  1798 1804   Original silver dollars from this period are highly prized by coin collectors and are exceptionally valuable  and range from fairly common to incredibly rare  Due to the early practice of hand engraving each die  there are dozens of varieties known for all dates between 1795 1803  It is also one of only two denominations  the other being the cent  minted in every year from its inception during the first decade of mint operation  However  the order was given by President Thomas Jefferson to halt silver dollar production due to the continued exportation of US dollars  The Spanish 8 Reale  which was slightly heavier than the US dollar  nonetheless traded at a 1 to 1 ratio  So US dollars went to the Caribbean  were traded for heavier 8 Reales  and those were then brought back to the US  where they would be recoined for free into more US dollars  the difference in silver  then  was kept by the exporter  This ensured that no dollars would circulate in the US  but would instead be exported for their heavier counterparts overseas  leaving little but old  foreign money to circulate in the United States in a process known as Gresham s Law   edit  The 1804 dollar Main article  1804 silver dollar The 1804 silver dollar is one of the rarest and most famous and popular coins in the world  4  Its creation was the result of a simple bookkeeping error  but its status as the king of coins has been established for nearly a century and a half  The silver dollars reported by the mint as being struck in 1804 were actually dated 1803  die steel being very expensive in the early 19th century  dies were used until they were no longer in working condition  This is why many early US coins exhibit all kinds of die cracks  occlusions  cuds  clash marks  and other late state die wear  Dies were used until they literally fell apart  Nearly every coin the US struck from 1793 to 1825 has an example that was struck in a year other than that which it bears   No dollars bearing the date 1804 were ever struck in 1804  though this was unknown to mint officials at the time the 1804 dollar came to be  The 1804 silver dollar was actually produced in 1834  when the U S  Department of State decided to produce a set of U S  coins to be used as gifts to rulers in Asia in exchange for trade advantages  Since 1804 was the last recorded year of mintage for both the dollar and  10 Eagle  it was decided that the set would contain examples of those coins dated 1804  as well as the other denominations currently being produced  Mint officials  not realizing that the 19 000  dollars recorded as being produced in 1804 were all dated 1803  proceeded to make new dies dated 1804  Little did they know the stunning rarity they were creating  Only 15 silver dollars with the date of 1804 are known to exist  in 1999  one of them sold at auction for more than  4 million  There are 8 Class I dollars  struck in 1834 for the aforementioned sets  1 Class II dollar  struck over an 1857 Swiss Shooting Thaler  and now residing in the US Coin Collection at the Smithsonian Institution   and 6 Class III dollars  struck surreptitiously sometime between 1858 and 1860 to meet collector demand for the coin   edit  Seated Liberty dollar  1836 1873  Main article  Seated Liberty dollar Seated Liberty Dollars were introduced in 1840 and were minted in larger quantities than the sparsely minted Gobrecht Dollar that preceded it  The dollars were used in general circulation until 1853  The production of large numbers of US gold coins  First  1 1849 and  20 in 1850  from the new California mines lowered the price of gold  so the value of silver rose  By 1853  the value of a US Silver Dollar contained in gold terms   1 07 of silver  With the Mint Act of 1853  all US Silver coins  except for the US Silver Dollar and new 3 cent coin  were reduced by 6 9  as of weight with arrows on the date to denote reduction  The US Silver Dollar was continued to be minted in very small numbers mainly as a foreign trade to the Orient  The international trading partners did not like the fact that U S A  coins were reduced in weight  The use of much more common half dollars became problematic since merchants would have to separate higher value pre 1853 coins from the newer reduced ones  From 1853 onwards  trade with Asia was typically done with Mexican coins that kept their weight and purity in the 19th Century  This ended in 1874 when the price of silver dropped so that a silver dollar has less than  1 00 worth of silver in it  huge amounts of silver coming from the Nevada Comstock Lode mines   By 1876  all silver coins were being used as money and by 1878  gold was at par with all US paper dollars  Beginning in 1878  huge amounts of the Morgan silver dollars were produced but few were used as money  The size was too large to carry on business so silver certificates were used instead  The mint make the coins  placed them in their vaults and issued the Silver Certificates instead  This is the reason so many Morgan and Peace dollars can be purchased in AU or UNC condition  near perfect     they sat in bank US Treasury vaults most of the time  Each coin is composed of 0 77344 troy oz of silver  They were minted at Philadelphia  New Orleans  Carson City  and San Francisco  A Silver dollar is worth  1 in silver at  1 31 per troy ounce  Current silver price  October 21  2010  is  23 12 per troy ounce so a silver dollar is worth  melted down  melt value  of about  17 88 US   edit  Gold dollar coins  1849 1889  Main article  Gold dollar The gold dollar was produced from 1849 to 1889  1849 to 1853 gold dollar coins were 13 mm across and are called Type I  Type II gold dollars were thinner but larger at 15 mm diameter and were produced from 1854 to 1855  The most common gold dollar are the Type III and started in 1856 until 1889  Production US  1 gold dollars was high until the Civil War and by 1863  only the larger value gold coins were produced large quantities  Most gold coins produced from 1863 and onward were produced for imports to pay for enormous amounts of war material and interest on some US Government bonds  Many of these coins from the Civil War and after  silver coins included  are in excellent condition since they saw very limited circulation with greenbacks and postage currency taking their place  Composed of 90  pure gold  it was the smallest denomination of gold currency ever produced by the United States federal government  When the US system of coinage was originally designed there had been no plans for a gold dollar coin  but in the late 1840s  two gold rushes later  Congress was looking to expand the use of gold in the country s currency  5  6  The gold dollar was authorized by the Act of March 3  1849  and the Liberty Head type began circulating soon afterward  7  Because of the high value of gold  the gold dollar is the smallest coin in the history of US coinage   edit  Trade Dollar  1873 1885  Main article  Trade Dollar  United States coin  The Trade Dollar was produced in response to other Western powers  such as Great Britain  Spain  France  and particularly Mexico  circulating large  crown size silver coins in Asia  Trade Dollars had a slightly higher silver content than the regular circulation Seated Liberty Dollars and Morgan Dollars  to compete with these foreign trade coins  Most Trade Dollars ended up in Asia during their first two years of production  where they were very successful  Many of them exhibit chopmarks which are counterstamps from Asian merchants to verify the authenticity of the coins  Many trade coins of the western powers and large silver coins from China  Korea  and Japan also bear these chopmarks  While most chopmarked coins are generally worth less than those without  some of the more fascinating chopmarks can actually give the coin a modest premium  Trade Dollars did not circulate in the United States initially  but were legal tender for up to  5  Things changed  however  in 1876  when the price of silver spiraled downward as western producers dumped silver on the market  making the Trade Dollar worth more at face value than its silver content  That resulted in Trade Dollars pouring back into the United States  as they were bought for as little as the equivalent of 80 US cents in Asia  and were then spent at  1 in the United States  This prompted Congress to revoke their legal tender status  and restrict their coinage to exportation demand only  However  this didn t stop unscrupulous persons from buying Trade Dollars at bullion value  and using them for payment as  1 to unsuspecting workers and merchants  Production of the Trade Dollar was officially halted for business strikes in 1878  and thereafter from 1879 1885  produced only as proof examples of the coin  The issues of 1884 and 1885 were produced surreptitiously  and were unknown to the collecting public until 1908  In February 1887  all non mutilated outstanding Trade Dollars were made redeemable to the United States Treasury  and approximately 8 million of them were turned in  Collectors are warned that a large number of perfect copies  apparently made in China  have been made  Buying only from known dealers  or certified specimens  is highly recommended   edit  Morgan dollar  1878 1904  1921  The Morgan silver dollar Main article  Morgan Dollar Morgan silver dollars were minted between 1878 and 1921  with a notable break between 1905 and 1920  8  The 1921 dated coins are the most common  and there exists a substantial collector market for pristine  uncirculated specimens of the rarer dates and mint marks  Morgan dollars are second only to Lincoln Cents in collector popularity  The large size  design and inexpensive nature of most dates of the Morgan dollar makes them highly popular  The coin is named after George T  Morgan  its designer  Some people collect Morgan dollars by  VAM  designation  named for Leroy C  Van Allen and A  George Mallis  who did extensive research on the die characteristics of this series   The top 100 VAM varieties are highly collectible  As well  this is the most popular United States series collected by grade  with  finest known  being a very attractive selling point  The mint mark is found on the reverse below the wreath  above the  O  in  DOLLAR   One of the keys to the series is the proof only 1895  struck at the Philadelphia mint   which can sell for up to  100 000 in top condition  Since the rarity of the coin was not initially realized  there were 12 000 business strikes recorded  but these were later melted   and since the coins were available at the Mint for a modest premium above face value  circulated  or  impaired  specimens are known  Because no business strike exists for this date and mint  many collectors are forced to buy the proof  or settle for what is regarded as an incomplete date mint collection  The rarest  by mintage  business strike Morgan is the 1893 S with a paltry 100 000 examples struck  and certainly not all examples survive  A top condition example  MS67 is currently the highest known  can bring nearly  1 Million at auction  Morgan dollars from the Carson City mint   CC  mintmark  are worth a premium  1889 CC  while not the rarest Carson City dollar by mintage  is the rarest by surviving examples today  and is the most valuable Carson City dollar  Other rare dates include 1892 S  1893  1893 O  1894  1894 S  1895 O  1895 S  1902 S  1903 S  1903 O  and 1904 S all worth  100 or more even in circulated  Fine About Uncirculated  conditions  Several coins in the series  while quite common in circulated condition  are very rare in uncirculated conditions  and can command hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece  1901 is such a coin  as is 1884 S  There is currently only a single known MS68 1884 S dollar and if sold at auction  that coin could easily bring  750 000  1 000 000   for a  common  date coin  Many of the spectacular rarities of the series  both by grade and absolutely  can be attributed to the order to melt down 270 million silver dollars still on hand by the Pittman Act of 1918  Because of this  and subsequent melting  it is estimated that only 17  of all Morgan dollars minted still survive  However  that s still many millions of examples  Many examples exceed  100 in uncirculated condition  but the majority do not  A common date in uncirculated can normally be found for around  40  and often as little as  28 circulated and  32 uncirculated  depending upon the current price of silver  High grade Morgan dollars are generally considered  investor  coins  This is because the prices are very volatile  and the values for certified   slabbed   pieces are set on well established exchanges   edit  Peace dollar  1921 1935  1964  The Peace silver dollar Main article  Peace Dollar Introduced in December 1921  the Peace dollar  designed by medalist Anthony de Francisci  was promulgated to commemorate the signing of formal peace treaties between the Allied forces and Germany and Austria  9  These treaties officially ended the Allies  World War I hostilities with these two countries  In 1922 the Mint made silver dollar production its top priority  causing other denominations to be produced sparingly if at all that year  Production ceased temporarily after 1928  original plans apparently called for only a one year suspension  but this was extended by the Great Depression  Mintage resumed in 1934  but for only two years  In May 1965  316 000  Peace Dollars were minted  all at the Denver Mint and dated 1964 D  however  plans for completing this coinage were abandoned  and most of those already minted were melted  with two known trial strike specimens being preserved  for assay purposes  until 1970  when they too were melted  and none released either for circulation or collection purposes  It is rumored that one or more pieces still exist  most notably any examples obtained by key members of Congress  the President  or mint officials  However  this coin  much like the 1933  20 gold Double Eagle  aside from the  exception   sold in 2002 for over  7 million   is illegal to own and would be subject to confiscation  10   edit  Release of dollars by the US Treasury  the GSA sale Because of the size and weight of the dollar coins  they circulated minimally throughout their history  except in the West  especially at casinos in the early to mid 20th century  where they were commonly used both at the tables and at slot machines   As a result  the coins were generally shipped to Washington and stored in the vaults of the US Treasury  at times these stores numbered into the hundreds of millions  citation needed  They were very popular as Christmas gifts  however  and from the 1930s to the early 1960s  many bags were annually released to banks nationwide to be distributed as presents  In November 1962  during this annual distribution  it was discovered that there were some rare and valuable dates  still sealed in their original mint bags  all in uncirculated condition  among the millions of dollar coins still in the Treasury vaults  Collectors investors dealers lined up to purchase them in  1 000 bags  trading silver certificates for the coins  Before this event  the great rarity of the Morgan series was 1903 O  which was by far the most expensive of the entire set  It was discovered that there were millions of this specific date and mint in the Treasury vaults  an estimated 84  of the entire mintage sat in these bags  untouched for 60 years  all in uncirculated condition  While still relatively expensive in circulated grades  uncirculated examples can be had for a modest amount over common dates  citation needed  On March 25  1964  Secretary of the Treasury C  Douglas Dillon announced that Silver Certificates would no longer be redeemable for silver dollars  11  Subsequently  another act of Congress dated June 24  1967  provided that Silver Certificates could be exchanged for silver bullion for a period of one year  until June 24  1968  12  Following this  the Treasury inventoried its remaining stock of dollar coins  and found approximately 3 000 bags containing 3 million coins  Many of the remaining coins were Carson City mint dollars  which even then carried a premium  The coins were placed in special hard plastic holders and the General Services Administration  GSA  was given authorization to sell them to the public in a series of mail bid sales  Five sales were conducted in 1973 and 1974  but sales were poor  and the results unspectacular  There was much complaining among the coin buying public  many stating that the United States Government should not be in the  coin business   especially considering that the government had spent little more than a dollar to mint and store each coin  After these sales  more than a million coins were still left unsold  These sat again until 1979 1980  where  amidst an extraordinarily volatile precious metals market  the remaining coins were sold under chaotic conditions  The GSA  having published minimum bids in November 1979  announced on January 2  1980  that those minimum bids were no longer valid  and that prospective bidders would have to  call in  to a toll free number to get current minimum bids  Then  on February 21  13 days after the bidding process officially began  the maximum number of coins per bidder was changed from 500 to 35  Many bidders  under these confusing conditions  ended up with no coins at all  Complaints again flooded in to Congress  but the damage had already been done  and the last silver dollars held by the United States Treasury were gone  13  14  15  Over the years  many of these GSA dollars have been broken out of their special holders for purposes of grading or otherwise  and now GSA dollars still in the unbroken original holders carry a small premium  Some third party grading companies have begun to grade coins still in their GSA holders  as a means of preservation  though this is not without controversy  16   edit  Eisenhower dollar  1971 1978  Main article  Eisenhower Dollar The Eisenhower 1972 clad dollar  obverse   1975 1976 Bicentennial Commemorative coin  reverse   From 1971 to 1978  the U S  Mint issued dollar coins with the obverse depicting Dwight D  Eisenhower and the reverse the insignia of the Apollo 11 moon landing  both designed by Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro  17  The 1976 Bicentennial commemorative design  produced in 1975 and 1976  featured the Liberty Bell and the Moon on the reverse  designed by Dennis R  Williams   while retaining the Eisenhower obverse  and the dual dates 1776 1976  The Eisenhower dollars minted for general circulation contained no silver or gold  but were instead composed of the same copper nickel clad composition used for the dime  quarter  and half dollar  This made the circulation coins extremely resistant to wear and  like the smaller denominations  they still retain a good deal of shine even when subject to mass usage  From 1971 through 1976 the Mint also produced dollars composed of 40  silver aimed at the collector market  The 1971 74 issues appeared in brown boxes or blue packages  depending on whether they were proof or uncirculated  Somewhat different Bicentennial sets were produced in the following two years  All issues remain very common  The coins were never very popular  primarily due to their large size and weight which made them inconvenient to carry and the fact that very few vending machines were designed to accept them  They saw the greatest use in casinos  and one dollar tokens in United States casinos still approximate the size and weight of the coins  Prior to the withdrawal of the coins  which remain legal tender  and are sometimes available at banks by request citation needed    many casinos did not strike their own tokens  but instead used the Eisenhower dollar   edit  Susan B  Anthony dollar  1979 1981  1999  Main article  Susan B  Anthony dollar The Anthony clad dollar  1979  The Anthony clad dollar  1999  From 1979 to 1981  and again in 1999  the Mint produced Anthony Dollars  depicting Susan B  Anthony  the first non fictitious woman portrayed on circulating U S  coinage   Many earlier circulating coins featured images of women  but the women depicted were all non specific representations of Liberty  Spain s Queen Isabella was portrayed on the 1893 Columbian Exposition quarter dollar  but it was not intended as a circulating coin  although some did circulate   The Anthony dollars  like the Eisenhower dollars  were made from a copper nickel clad  The 1981 coins were issued for collectors only  but occasionally show up in circulation  The Anthony dollar resembled the quarter in size  Often confused with it  this is one reason why the coin was never popular  It was quickly discontinued  but resurrected in 1999 when Treasury reserves were low  and the Sacagawea dollar was still a year away from production  18  While reserves of the coins were initially high  the coins were in demand to be used as change in vending machines  most often in transit systems and post offices  This dollar is often referred to as a  Suzy  or  Susie  citation needed   another variation is to refer to the coin as a  Susan B  or  Susie Suzy B   another common term is the  Carter quarter   citation needed  referring to its emergence during the Presidential term of Jimmy Carter and the fact that it was often confused with the quarter dollar coin   edit  Sacagawea dollar  2000 present  Main article  Sacagawea dollar Obverse  left  of the current Sacagawea Dollar and reverse  right  of the original Sacagawea Dollar  2000 2008 The Sacagawea dollar was authorized by Congress in 1997 because the supply of Anthony dollars  in inventory since their last mintage in 1981  was soon expected to be depleted  Delays in ramping up Sacagawea dollar production led to a final 1999 dated mintage of Susan B  Anthony dollars  Dollar coins are used infrequently in general commerce  They used to be given as change by United States Postal Service stamp vending machines  which created a relatively small but significant demand  but the USPS eliminated all those machines by 2010  The obverse was designed by artist Glenna Goodacre  Since no verifiable image of Sacagawea exists  Goodacre used Randy L He dow Teton  a University of New Mexico college student and a Shoshone Indian  as a model for the coin  19  There are approximately 1 billion Sacagawea coins in circulation  and about 250 million in reserve  The US Mint greatly reduced production of Sacagawea dollars after the 2001 minting  citing sufficient inventory  As of 2011  the dollar coin is still being minted for collectors  and is available in uncirculated rolls  mint sets  and proof Sets  but has not been released for general circulation since 2001  The Mint took great care to create the coin with the same size  weight  and electromagnetic properties as the Anthony dollar  but with a golden color  Unlike most other coins in circulation  the selected alloy has a tendency to tarnish quite severely in circulation  as is the case with most brasses  resulting in a loss of the golden shine  except on raised areas where the  patina  is more frequently rubbed off  20  While some consider the blackening an undesired quality  the Mint suggests the uneven tarnishing effect gives the coins an  antique finish  that  accentuate s  the profile and add s  a dimension of depth to the depiction of Sacagawea and her child   20  The coin featured a plain edge through 2008  but starting in 2009 incused lettering was applied  The year and mint mark moved from the coin s obverse  front  to its edge  As of 2011 update   dollar coins are not widely encountered in US commerce  except in vending machines for rides on mass transit  some pay and display machines  some laundromats  and old fashioned slot machines  Most vending machines and parking meters have been redesigned  however  to accept dollar coins for purchase over a quarter dollar  citation needed  The Sacagawea dollar has achieved popularity in El Salvador  Ecuador and Panama  where the US dollar is also the official currency  18   edit  Native American series The Sacagawea dollar reverse for 2009  left  representing agriculture and the reverse for 2010  right  representing government With the passage of the Native American  1 Coin Act 21  on September 20  2007  the U S  Mint began designing a series of Sacagawea dollars with modified reverses to further commemorate  Native Americans and the important contributions made by Indian tribes and individual Native Americans to the development of the United States and the history of the United States   Four designs were to be minted  each for one year from 2009 to 2012  The first Native American series coin was released in January 2009 and had a reverse that depicted a Native American woman sowing seeds of the Three Sisters  symbolizing the Indian tribes  contributions to agriculture  Like the Presidential Dollar  the year of issue  mint mark  and motto E Pluribus Unum are found on the edge of the coin instead of on the obverse or reverse  which allows for more room for the design  22  Unlike the Presidential  1 coins from before 2009   In God We Trust  remains on the obverse and the vacant space on the edge lettering has been taken up by thirteen stars  symbolizing the Thirteen Colonies  Also  unlike any other denomination of circulating U S  coinage  but in common with the Presidential  1 coins   the value is inscribed in numerals on the reverse  The act passed by Congress requires that 20  of the total dollar coins minted in any year during the Presidential  1 Coin Program be Sacagawea dollars bearing the new design  In January 2010  the second reverse design in the series was released which has the theme of  Government  and the  Great Tree of Peace   The 2010 Sacagawea reverse depicts the Hiawatha Belt and five arrows bound together representing unity with the inscription  Haudenosaunee   a synonym for the Iroquois Confederacy meaning  People of the Longhouse   Another inscription is found along the lower edge of the reverse spelling  Great Law of Peace   an English translation of Gayanashagowa  the Iroquois Confederacy constitution   The Great Law of Peace was used as a model for the Constitution of the United States  The four links on the belt are meant to symbolize four of the five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy  namely the Mohawk  Oneida  Cayuga and Seneca Nations  The Eastern White Pine tree in the middle of the belt represents the fifth Nation  the Onondaga  and is a depiction of the Tree of Peace   edit  Presidential Dollar Coin  2007 2011  Main article  Presidential  1 Coin Program Obverse  left  and reverse  right  of the George Washington   1  dollar coin In December 2005  Congress decided to create a new series of  1 coins which will honor the former U S  presidents  In 2007  Presidential coins of four different designs were produced  Another four designs will be produced each year  honoring the Presidents in order of service   Grover Cleveland will be on two coins  since he served two non consecutive terms   The Presidential  1 Coin Act is intended to create renewed interest in the coin like that seen during the 50 State Quarters program  23  At least one third of all dollar coins produced are still Sacagawea coins  with the remaining coins making up the four presidential coins annually  Under federal law  31 U S C    5112   no coins may be issued featuring a living president  or a president who died less than two years earlier  The program was scheduled to run until 2016  but was canceled to save money  The presidential dollar coin is the same size and composition as the Sacagawea dollar   In God We Trust   the issue year  and the mint mark appear on the edge  24  The fact that these national mottoes appear on the edge has caused some conservative commentators to decry the designs  25  26  The first dollar  honoring George Washington  was released into circulation on February 15  2007  However  H R  2764 became law on December 26  2007 which moved  In God We Trust  from the edge to the obverse  A common minting error on this coin  estimated at 80 000  from a mintage of 300 000 000 coins  is the omission of the edge lettering causing a plain outside edge  27  28  Because the omission includes the words  In God We Trust   some in the popular media have dubbed it the  godless  coin  29  A false  although at one time widely reported  error is the report that the edge lettering is upside down  The edge lettering does not occur at the same time as the minting of the coins  allowing for the natural occurrence of the lettering in either orientation  citation needed  except Proof Coins where the date and lettering are all  right side up   Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of the relatively unpopular coins  the production of new Sacagawea and presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on December 13  2011  Future minting of such coins will be made solely for collectors  30   edit  Designs Silver dollar coins Flowing Hair Dollar 1794 1795 Draped Bust Dollar 1795 1803 Draped Bust  Small
