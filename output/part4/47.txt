Star Trek is an American science fiction entertainment franchise created by Gene Roddenberry  The core of Star Trek is its six television series  The Original Series  The Animated Series  The Next Generation  Deep Space Nine  Voyager  and Enterprise  The franchise also includes eleven feature films  dozens of games  hundreds of novels as well as a themed attraction in Las Vegas  opened in 1998 and closed in September 2008  and at least two traveling museum exhibits of props  Beginning with the original television series and continuing with the subsequent films and series  the franchise has become a cult phenomenon  initiated the creation of the fully functional constructed language Klingon  and spawned many pop culture references  1  The original Star Trek followed the interstellar adventures of James T  Kirk and the crew of an exploration vessel of a 23rd century galactic  United Federation of Planets  the Starship Enterprise  This series debuted in 1966 and ran for three seasons on NBC  after the network rejected an initial pilot film  The Cage  with a mostly different cast  though this pilot is now routinely packaged with the original series  Following the release of other series in the franchise  the Kirk led series was retroactively referred to as  Star Trek  The Original Series   These adventures were continued by the short lived Star Trek  The Animated Series and six feature films  Four more television series were eventually produced  based in the same universe but following other characters  Star Trek  The Next Generation  following the crew of a new Starship Enterprise set a century after the original series  Star Trek  Deep Space Nine and Star Trek  Voyager  set contemporaneously with The Next Generation  and Star Trek  Enterprise  set before the original series  in the early days of human interstellar travel  Four additional feature films were produced  following the crew of The Next Generation  and  most recently  a 2009 movie reboot of the franchise featuring a young crew of the original Enterprise set in an alternate timeline  The original Star Trek series began production under Desilu Productions  With the merger of Desilu into Paramount Pictures  that studio assumed outright ownership of the Star Trek franchise  CBS took ownership of the franchise in 2006  though certain aspects  feature film and DVD distribution rights  are still owned by Paramount  Contents 1 Conception and setting 2 Production history 2 1 Beginnings 2 2 Rebirth 2 3 After Roddenberry 2 4 Reboot 3 Television series 3 1 The Original Series  1966 1969

setting As early as 1964  Gene Roddenberry drafted a proposal for the science fiction series that would become Star Trek  Although he publicly marketed it as a Western in outer space a so called  Wagon Train to the Stars   like the popular Western TV series 2   he privately told friends that he was modeling it on Jonathan Swift s Gulliver s Travels  intending each episode to act on two levels  as a suspenseful adventure story and as a morality tale  3  Star Trek stories usually depict the adventures of humans and aliens who serve in Starfleet  the space borne humanitarian and peacekeeping armada of the United Federation of Planets  The protagonists are essentially altruists  whose ideals are sometimes imperfectly applied to the dilemmas presented in the series  The conflicts and political dimensions of Star Trek sometimes represent allegories for contemporary cultural realities  Star Trek  The Original Series addressed issues of the 1960s  4  just as later spin offs have reflected issues of their respective decades  Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace  the value of personal loyalty  authoritarianism  imperialism  class warfare  economics  racism  religion  human rights  sexism  feminism  and the role of technology  5  Roddenberry stated    By creating  a new world with new rules  I could make statements about sex  religion  Vietnam  politics  and intercontinental missiles  Indeed  we did make them on Star Trek  we were sending messages and fortunately they all got by the network   6  Roddenberry intended the show to have a highly progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter culture of the youth movement  though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this  He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into  if only it would learn from the lessons of the past  most specifically by ending violence  An extreme example is the Vulcans  who had a very violent past but learned to control their emotions  Roddenberry also wanted to imply an anti war message and to depict the United Federation of Planets as an ideal  optimistic version of the United Nations  7  His efforts were thwarted by the network s concerns over marketability  e g   they were opposed to Roddenberry s insistence on a racially diverse crew of the Enterprise  8   edit  Production history  edit  Beginnings Star Trek creator  producer and writer Gene Roddenberry In 1964  Roddenberry proposed the original Star Trek TV series  to Desilu Studios as  like Wagon Train  a Wagon Train to the stars   9  The network rejected the show s first pilot   The Cage   starring Jeffrey Hunter as Enterprise Captain Christopher Pike  however  Desilu executives  still impressed with the concept  made the unusual decision to commission a second pilot   Where No Man Has Gone Before   The first regular episode of Star Trek aired on Thursday  September 8  1966  10  While the show initially enjoyed high ratings  the average rating of the show at the end of its first season dropped to 52nd  out of 94 programs   Unhappy with the show s ratings  NBC threatened to cancel the show during its second season  11  The show s fan base  led by Bjo Trimble  conducted an unprecedented letter writing campaign  petitioning the network to keep the show on the air  12  13  NBC renewed the show  but moved it from primetime to the  Friday night death slot   and substantially reduced its budget  14  Roddenberry reduced his direct involvement in Star Trek to protest the changed timeslot and Fred Freiberger became producer of the show s third season  Despite the protests of a renewed letter writing campaign  NBC canceled the series   edit  Rebirth After Star Trek s cancellation  Paramount Studios  the company that bought the show s original production company Desilu  sold the syndication rights to Star Trek to help recoup the original series  production losses  Reruns began in the fall of 1969 and by the late 1970s the series aired in over 150 domestic and 60 international markets  This helped Star Trek develop a cult following greater than its popularity during its original run  15  The series  newfound success led to rumors of reviving the franchise  16  Filmation with Paramount Television produced the first post original series show  Star Trek  The Animated Series  It ran on NBC for twenty two half hour episodes over two seasons on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1974  Although short lived  typical for animated productions in that timeslot during that period  the series garnered the franchise s only  Best Series  Emmy Award as opposed to the franchise s later technical ones  Paramount Pictures and Roddenberry began developing a new Star Trek  Phase II series in May 1975 in response to the franchise s newfound popularity  However  work on the series ended when the proposed Paramount Television Service folded  Following the success of the science fiction movies Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind  Paramount adapted the planned pilot episode of Phase II into the feature film  Star Trek  The Motion Picture  The film opened in North America on December 7  1979  with mixed reviews from critics  The film earned  139 million worldwide  below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel  The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels  The success of the critically acclaimed sequel  Star Trek II  The Wrath of Khan reversed the fortunes of the franchise  While the sequel grossed less than the first movie  The Wrath of Khan s lower production costs made it more profitable  Paramount produced Six Star Trek feature films between 1979 and 1991  In response to Star Trek s movie theater popularity  the franchise returned to television with Star Trek  The Next Generation  TNG  in 1987  Paramount choose to distribute it as a first run syndication show rather than a network show  17   edit  After Roddenberry Roddenberry died on October 24  1991  leaving Executive Producer Rick Berman in control of what those within Paramount now called  the franchise   because of its great success and recurring role as a tent pole for the studio when other projects failed  18 TNG had the highest ratings of any Star Trek series and became the  1 syndicated show during the last years of its original seven season run  19  In response to TNG s success  Paramount release a spin off series Deep Space Nine in 1993  While never as popular as TNG  the series had sufficient ratings for it to last seven seasons  In January 1995  a few months after TNG ended  Paramount released a fourth TV series  Voyager  Star Trek saturation reached a peak in the mid 1990s with DS9 and Voyager airing concurrently and three of the four TNG based feature films released in 1994  1996  and 1998  By 1998  Star Trek was Paramount s most important property  the enormous profits of  the franchise  funded much of the rest of the studio s operations  20  49 50 54Voyager became the flagship show of the new United Paramount Network  UPN  and thus the first major network Star Trek series since the original  21  The show also ran for seven seasons until 2001  making it the longest running show in UPN s history  After Voyager ended  UPN produced Enterprise  a prequel TV series to the original show  Enterprise did not enjoy the high ratings of its predecessors and UPN threatened to cancel it after the series  third season  Fans launched a campaign reminiscent of the one that saved the third season of the Original Series  Paramount renewed Enterprise for a fourth season  22  but moved it to the  Friday night death slot   23  Like the Original Series  Enterprise ratings dropped during this time slot  and UPN cancelled Enterprise at the end of its fourth season  Enterprise aired its final episode on May 13  2005  24  Fan groups  such as  Save Enterprise   attempted to save the series 25  and tried to raise  30 million to privately finance a fifth season of Enterprise  25  Though the effort garnered considerable press  the fan drive failed to save the series  The cancellation of Enterprise ended an eighteen year continuous production run of Star Trek programming on television  The poor box office performance in 2002 of the film Nemesis  cast an uncertain light upon the future of the franchise  Paramount relieved the franchise producer s  Berman  control of Star Trek   edit  Reboot Paramount turned down several proposals in the mid 2000s to reboot the franchise  These included pitches from film director Bryan Singer  26 Babylon 5 creator J  Michael Straczynski  27  and Trek actors Jonathan Frakes and William Shatner  28  The network also turned down an animated web series 29  Instead Paramount hired a new creative team to  reboot  the franchise in 2007  Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and Lost producer  J  J  Abrams  had the freedom to reinvent the feel of Trek and alter the canonical timeline  This team created the franchise s eleventh film  titled simply Star Trek  releasing it in May 2009  The eleventh Star Trek film s marketing campaign targeted non fans  even stating in the films advertisments that  this is not your father s Star Trek   30  The film earned considerable critical and financial success  grossing in inflation adjusted dollars the most box office sales of any other Star Trek film  31  The plaudits include the franchise s first Academy Award  for makeup   The film s major cast members are contracted for two sequels  32  Paramount plans to release the sequel to the reboot on May 17  2013  33   edit  Television series Six television series make up the bulk of the Star Trek mythos  The Original Series  The Animated Series  The Next Generation  Deep Space Nine  Voyager  and Enterprise  In total 726 Star Trek episodes have been produced across the 30 seasons of the TV series   edit  The Original Series  1966 1969  Main article  Star Trek  The Original Series Star Trek  also known as  TOS  or The Original Series  debuted in the United States on NBC on September 8  1966  34  The show tells the tale of the crew of the starship Enterprise and its five year mission  to boldly go where no man has gone before   The original 1966 1969 television series featured William Shatner as Captain James T  Kirk  Leonard Nimoy as Spock  DeForest Kelley as Dr  Leonard  Bones  McCoy  James Doohan as Montgomery  Scotty  Scott  Nichelle Nichols as Uhura  George Takei as Hikaru Sulu  and Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov  During the series  original run  it earned several nominations for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and won twice  for the two parter  The Menagerie  and the Harlan Ellison written episode  The City on the Edge of Forever   The show s creator  Gene Roddenberry  was not involved in the show during its third and final year of production due to a dispute with NBC  After three seasons  NBC canceled the show  and the last original episode aired on June 3  1969  35  However  the petition near the end of the second season to save the show signed by many CalTech students and its multiple Hugo nominations would indicate that despite low Nielsen ratings  it was highly popular with science fiction fans and engineering students  The series later became popular in reruns and found a cult following  34  Originally presented under the title Star Trek  it has in recent years become known as Star Trek  The Original Series or as  Classic Star Trek  retronyms that distinguish it from its sequels and the franchise as a whole   edit  The Animated Series  1973 1974  Main article  Star Trek  The Animated Series Star Trek  The Animated Series  produced by Filmation  ran for two seasons from 1973 to 1974  Most of the original cast performed the voices of their characters from The Original Series  and many of the original series  writers  such as D  C  Fontana  David Gerrold and Paul Schneider  wrote for the series  While the animated format allowed the producers to create more exotic alien landscapes and life forms  animation errors and liberal reuse of shots and musical cues have tarnished the series  reputation  36  Although originally sanctioned by Paramount  which owned the Star Trek franchise following its acquisition of Desilu in 1967  Gene Roddenberry often spoke of TAS as non canon  37 Star Trek writers have used elements of the animated series in later live action series and movies  and as of June 2007  the Animated Series has references in the library section of the official Startrek com web site  TAS won Star Trek s first Emmy Award on May 15  1975  38 Star Trek TAS briefly returned to television in the mid 1980s on the children s cable network Nickelodeon  Nickelodeon s Evan McGuire greatly admired the show and used its various creative components as inspiration for his short series called Piggly Wiggly Hears A Sound which never aired  Nickelodeon parent Viacom would purchase Paramount in 1994  In the early 1990s  the Sci Fi Channel also began rerunning TAS  The complete TAS was also released on Laserdisc format during the 1980s  39  The complete series was first released in the USA on eleven volumes of VHS tapes in 1989  All 22 episodes were released on DVD in 2006   edit  The Next Generation  1987 1994  Main article  Star Trek  The Next Generation Star Trek

 Patrick Stewart  and Commander William Riker  Jonathan Frakes   The series introduced alien races new to the Federation as crewmembers  including Deanna Troi  a half Betazoid counselor played by Marina Sirtis and Worf as the first Klingon officer in Starfleet  played by Michael Dorn  It also featured Gates McFadden as Dr  Beverly Crusher  LeVar Burton as chief engineer Geordi La Forge  the android Data portrayed by Brent Spiner  and Dr  Crusher s son Wesley Crusher played by Wil Wheaton  The show premiered on September 28  1987  and ran for seven seasons  ending on May 23  1994  40  It had the highest ratings of any of the Star Trek series and became the  1 syndicated show during the last few years of its original run  allowing it to act as a springboard for ideas in other series  Many relationships and races introduced in TNG became the basis of episodes in Deep Space 9 and Voyager  19  It earned an Emmy nomination for Best Dramatic Series during its final season  It also received a Peabody Award for Outstanding Television Programming for the episode  The Big Goodbye   41  The first two seasons were largely produced by the original creator of Star Trek  Gene Roddenberry  Beginning in Season 3  the primary overseer of the show was Rick Berman who also largely responsible for the remaining Trek television series as well as the films involving the cast of The Next Generation  Drama shows in that era  as opposed to a talk show or game shows  rarely went into syndication in first run rather than airing on the same network throughout America  Next Generation became one of the most popular syndicated shows of its era and inaugurated a market for syndicated science fiction series   edit  Deep Space Nine  1993 1999  Main article  Star Trek  Deep Space Nine Star Trek  Deep Space Nine  also known as  DS9   takes place during the last years and the immediate post years of The Next Generation  2369 2375  and aired for seven seasons  debuting the week of January 3  1993  42  Like Star Trek  The Next Generation  it aired in syndication in the United States and Canada  Unlike the other Star Trek series  DS9 takes place primarily on a space station rather than aboard a starship  The show begins after the brutal occupation of the planet Bajor  With the Cardassians gone  the Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a Cardassian built space station  Deep Space Nine  outside of Bajor  After the Federation takes control of the station  the protagonists of the show discover a uniquely stable wormhole that provides immediate access to the distant Gamma Quadrant making Bajor and the station one of the most strategically important locations in the galaxy  43  The show chronicles the events of the station s crew  led by Commander  later Captain  Benjamin Sisko  played by Avery Brooks  and Major  later Colonel  Kira Nerys  played by Nana Visitor  Recurring plot elements include the repercussions of the lengthy and brutal Cardassian occupation of Bajor  Sisko s spiritual role for the Bajorans as the Emissary of the Prophets  and in later seasons a war with the Dominion  Deep Space Nine stands apart from earlier Trek series for its lengthy serialized storytelling  conflict within the crew  and religious themes all elements that critics and audiences praised but Roddenberry forbade in the original series and The Next Generation  44  Nevertheless  he was informed before his death of DS9  making this the last Star Trek series connected to Gene Roddenberry  45   edit  Voyager  1995 2001  Main article  Star Trek  Voyager Star Trek  Voyager ran for seven seasons  airing from January 16  1995  to May 23  2001  launching a new Paramount owned television network UPN  It features Kate Mulgrew as

as Deep Space Nine and the years following that show s end  2371 2378   The premiere episode has the USS Voyager and its crew pursue a Maquis ship  crewed by Federation rebels   Both ships become stranded in the Delta Quadrant about 70 000 light years from Earth  47  Faced with a 70 year voyage to Earth  the crew must learn to work together and overcome challenges on the long and perilous journey home while also seeking ingenious ways to shorten the return voyage  Like Deep Space Nine  early seasons of Voyager feature greater conflict between its crewmembers than seen in later episodes  Such conflict often arises from friction between  by the book  Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together on the same ship  Eventually  though  they settle their differences  after which the overall tone becomes more reminiscent of The Original Series  Voyager  isolated from many of the familiar aspects and races of the Star Trek franchise  faces new races and original plot lines not possible when in a show that takes place in the other Star Trek series  Later seasons  however  brought an influx of characters and races from prior shows  such as the Borg  Q  the Ferengi  Romulans  Klingons  Cardassians as well as cast members of The Next Generation   edit  Enterprise  2001 2005  Main article  Star Trek  Enterprise Star Trek  Enterprise   originally titled Enterprise  a prequel to the original Star Trek series  aired from September 26  2001 to May 13  2005  48 Enterprise takes place in the 2150s  some 90 years after the events of

Captain Jonathan Archer  played by Scott Bakula   and the Vulcan Sub Commander T Pol  played by Jolene Blalock  During the show s first two seasons  Enterprise had an episodic structure  like The Original Series  The Next Generation and Voyager  The third season consisted of one arc   Xindi mission   which had the darker tone and serialized nature of Deep Space 9  Season 4 consisted of several two to three episode mini arcs  The final season showed the origins of elements seen in earlier series  and it rectified and resolved some core continuity problems between the various Star Trek series  Ratings for Enterprise started strong but declined rapidly  Although critics received the fourth season very well  both fans and the cast reviled the series finale  partly because of the episode s focus on the guest appearance of members of The Next Generation cast  49  The cancellation of Enterprise ended an 18 year run of back to back new Star Trek shows beginning with The Next Generation in 1987   edit  Feature films Main article  Star Trek  film series  Paramount Pictures has produced eleven Star Trek feature films  the most recent released in May 2009 with a twelfth in development

named after the fictional starship with Star Trek television cast members and creator Gene Roddenberry  The Star Trek media franchise is a multi billion dollar industry  currently owned by CBS  54  Gene Roddenberry sold Star Trek to NBC as a classic adventure drama  he pitched the show as  Wagon Train to the Stars  and as Horatio Hornblower in Space  55  The opening line   to boldly go where no man has gone before   was taken almost verbatim from a US White House booklet on space produced after the Sputnik flight in 1957  56  The central trio of Kirk  Spock  and McCoy was modeled on classical mythological storytelling  55  Star Trek and its spin offs have proven highly popular in syndication and are currently shown on TV stations worldwide  57  The show s cultural impact goes far beyond its longevity and profitability  Star Trek conventions have become popular among its fans  who call themselves  trekkies  or  trekkers   An entire subculture has grown up around the show 58  which was documented in the film Trekkies  Star Trek was the highest ranked cult show by TV Guide  59  The Star Trek franchise inspired some designers of technologies  such as the Palm PDA and the handheld mobile phone  60  61  Michael Jones  Chief technologist of Google Earth  has cited the tricorder s mapping capability as one inspiration in the development of Keyhole Google Earth  62  It

writing campaign  NASA named its prototype space shuttle Enterprise  after the fictional starship  64  Later  the introductory sequence to Star Trek  Enterprise included footage of this shuttle which  along with images of a naval sailing vessel called the Enterprise  depicted the advancement of human transportation technology  Beyond Star Trek s fictional innovations  one of its greatest and most significant contributions to TV history is its creation of a cast of different races and cultures in the sets  This became common in television shows in the 1980s such as L A  Law but was controversial and daring in the 1960s  On the bridge of the Enterprise were a Japanese helmsman  a Russian navigator  a black female communications officer  and a Vulcan Earthling first officer   among other members  Also  controversial at its time  in the episode Plato s Stepchildren   was Captain Kirk s kiss with Lt  Uhura which became a defining moment in television history as it was believed to be American TV s first scripted interracial kiss  there had already been footage of  real life  interracial kisses  such as on news footage and in documentaries  65  And  there were other scripted interracial kisses that occurred beforehand  such as the kiss between Robert Culp and France Nuyen in the 1966 I Spy episode The Tiger 66   and the kiss between David McCallum and Victoria Young in the 1966 The Man from U N C L E  episode  The Her Majesty s Voice Affair  67    edit  Parodies This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by

is usually given to film or television presentations  The Hugo does not give out awards for best actor  director  or other aspects of film production  Before 2002  films and television shows competed for the same Hugo  before the split of the drama award into short drama and long drama  In 1968  all five nominees for a Hugo award were individual episodes of Star Trek  as were three of the five nominees in 1967  the other two being the films Fahrenheit 451 and Fantastic Voyage   The only Star Trek series to not get even a Hugo nomination are the animated series and Voyager  though only the original series and Next Generation ever won the award  No Star Trek film has ever won a Hugo  though a few were nominated  In 2008  the fan made episode of Star Trek  New Voyages entitled  World Enough and Time  was nominated for the Hugo for Best Short Drama  where it competed with professional episodes from shows such as Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica  72  The prestigious science fiction Saturn Awards did not exist during broadcasting of the original series  Unlike the Hugo  the Saturn Award gives out prizes for best actor  special effects and music  and also unlike the Hugo  until 2002  movies and television shows have never competed against each other for Saturns  The two Star Trek series to win multiple Saturn awards during their run were The Next Generation  twice winning for best television series  and Voyager  twice winning for best actress   Kate Mulgrew and Jeri Ryan   The original series retroactively won a Saturn Award for best DVD release  Several Star Trek films have won Saturns including categories such as best actor  actress  director  costume design  and special effects  However  Star Trek has never won a Saturn for best make up  73  As for non science fiction specific awards  the Star Trek series has won 31 Emmy Awards  74  The eleventh Star Trek film won the 2009 Academy Award for Best Makeup  the franchise s first Academy Award  75   edit  Crossovers Main article  Star Trek crossovers Several characters within the Star Trek franchise  primary and secondary  often made crossover appearances between one live action series and another  This included appearances of established characters on premiere episodes of new series  a few long term transfers from one series to another  and even crossovers between Trek films and television  A few crossover appearances  such as that of Spock on Next Generation and the time travel of the crew of Deep Space Nine to the era of The Original Series were especially lauded by both fans and critics  At least one crossover  featuring Next Generation characters in the final episode of Enterprise  was poorly received   edit  Corporate ownership At Star Trek s creation  Norway Productions  Roddenberry s production company  shared ownership with Desilu and  after Gulf Western acquired Desilu in 1967  with Paramount Pictures  the conglomerate s film studio  Paramount did not want to own the unsuccessful show  net profit was to be shared between Norway  Desilu Paramount  Shatner  and NBC but Star Trek lost money  and the studio did not expect to syndicate it  In 1970 Paramount offered to sell all rights to Star Trek to Roddenberry  but he could not afford the  150 000   898 000 today  price  76  218 220 In 1989 Gulf Western renamed itself as Paramount Communications  and in 1994 merged with Viacom  76  218 In 2005 Viacom divided into CBS Corporation  whose CBS Television Studios subsidiary retained the Star Trek brand  and Viacom  whose Paramount Pictures subsidiary retained the Star Trek film library and rights to make additional films  along with video distribution rights to the TV series on behalf of CBS  77  76  223 Both Viacom and CBS are controlled by National Amusements  78   edit  Notable fan fiction Main article  Star Trek fan productions The online fan produced Star Trek  Phase II series is permitted by CBS and Paramount Pictures since no profit is being made from it  The son of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry  Eugene Roddenberry Jr   has served as consulting producer  and several members of the cast of the original series have given it support  79  Both actors and writers involved with official Star Trek have contributed  Actress Denise Crosby has played the grandmother of her Next Generation character  and both George Takei and Walter Koenig have played older versions of the same characters they played on Star Trek  The second episode  entitled  To Serve All My Days   was written by original series writer D C  Fontana 80  and other former Trek writers have contributed their talent  One episode World Enough and Time was nominated for the prestigious 81  Hugo award  competing against episodes of Doctor Who  Torchwood  and Battlestar Galactica  82  As with other material available only online in the form of  webisodes   the Internet Movie Database lists this as a television series  83   edit  References   Italie
