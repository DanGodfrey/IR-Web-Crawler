varieties  collectively known as Flemish  are generally differentiated from Netherlands varieties  In both Belgium and Netherlands  native official name for Dutch is Nederlands  and its dialects have their own name  e g   Hollands  Hollander   West Vlaams  West Flemish   Limburgs  Limburger   Brabants  Brabantine   4  The language has been known under a variety of names  In Middle Dutch  dietsc  in the South  and diutsc  duutsc  in the North  were used to refer variably to Dutch  Low German  and German  This word is derived from diet  people  and was used to translate Latin  lingua  vulgaris  popular language  in order to set apart the Germanic vernacular from Latin  the language of writing and the Church  and Romance  5  An early form of this word appears Latinized in the Strasbourg Oaths  842 a d   as teudisca  lingua  to refer to the Rhenish Franconian portion of the oath and also underlies dialectal French thiois  Luxembourgish  Lorraine Franconian   During the Renaissance in the 16th century  differentiation began to be made by opposing duytsch  modern Duits   German  and nederduytsch  Low German  with dietsch or nederlandsch  Dutch   6  a distinction that is echoed in English later the same century with the terms High Dutch  German  and Low Dutch  Dutch   However  owing to Dutch commercial and colonial rivalry in the 16th and 17th centuries  the English term came to refer exclusively to the Dutch  In modern Dutch  Duits has narrowed in meaning to refer to  German   Diets went out of common use because of its Nazi associations 7  and now somewhat romantically refers to older forms of Dutch  8  whereas Hollands and Vlaams are sometimes used to name the language as a whole for the varieties spoken in respectively The Netherlands and Belgium  9 Nederlands  the official Dutch word for  Dutch   did not become firmly established until the 19th century  The repeated use of neder  or  low  to refer to the language is a reference to the Netherlands  downriver location at the mouth of the Rhine  harking back to Latin nomenclature  e g   Germania inferior vs  Germania superior  and the fact that it lies in the lowest dip of the Northern European plain  10

paired with its sister language Limburgian  or East Low Franconian  both of which stand out by mixing characteristics of Low German and German  13  Dutch is at one end of a dialect continuum known as the Rhenish fan where German gradually turns into Dutch  There was also at one time a dialect continuum that blurred the boundary between Dutch and Low German  In some small areas  there are still dialect continua  but they are gradually becoming extinct  All three languages have shifted earlier        d   show final obstruent devoicing  Du brood  bread   bro t    and experienced lengthening of short vowels in stressed open syllables which has led to contrastive vowel length that is used as a morphological marker  Dutch stands out from Low German and German in its retention of the clusters sp st  shifting of sk to  sx  and initial g  to      highly simplified morphology  and the fact it did not develop i mutation as a morphological marker  In earlier periods  Low Franconian of either sort differed from Low German by maintaining a three way plural verb conjugation  Old Dutch  un   it   unt   Middle Dutch  en   t   en   In modern Dutch  however  the former 2nd person plural   t  took the place of the 2nd person singular  and the plural endings were reduced into a single form  en  cf  Du jij maakt  you sg  make  vs  we jullie ze maken  we you pl  they make    However  it is still possible to distinguish it from German  which has retained the three way split  and Low German  which has  t in the present tense  wi ji se niemmet  we you pl  they take    Dutch and Low German

of the Netherlands  a nation of 16 7 million people of whom 96 percent speak Dutch as their mother tongue  15  In the province of Friesland and a small part of Groningen  Frisian is also recognised but is spoken by only a few hundred thousand Frisians  In the Netherlands there are many different dialects  but these are often overruled and replaced by the language of the media  school  government  i e   Standard Dutch   Immigrant languages are Indonesian  Turkish  English  Spanish  Berber  Moroccan Arabic  Papiamento  and Sranan  In the second generation these newcomers often speak Dutch as

which are  in order from the greatest speaker population to the smallest  Dutch  sometimes colloquially referred to as Flemish   French  and German  An estimated 59  of all Belgians speak Dutch as their first language  while French is the mother tongue of 40   16  Dutch is the official language of the Flemish Region  where it is the mother tongue of about 97  of the population  15  and one of the two official languages  along with French  of the Brussels Capital Region  Dutch is not official nor a recognised minority language in the Walloon Region  although on the border with the Flemish Region  there are four municipalities with language facilities for Dutch speakers  The most important Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium are West Flemish  spoken even in France in French Flanders  or

 2006  17    French only   French  amp  Dutch   French  amp  language other than Dutch   Dutch only   Neither French nor Dutch Since the founding of the Kingdom of Belgium in 1830  Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely Dutch speaking  with a small French minority  to being a multilingual city with French as the majority language and lingua franca  This language shift  the Frenchification of Brussels  is rooted in the 18th century but accelerated after Belgium became independent and Brussels expanded past its original boundaries  18  19  Not only is French speaking immigration responsible for the frenchification of Brussels  but more importantly the language change over several generations from Dutch to French was performed in Brussels by the Flemish people themselves  The main reason for this was the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium at the time  20  From 1880 on more and more Dutch speaking people became bilingual resulting in a rise of monolingual French speakers after 1910  Halfway through the 20th century the number of monolingual French speakers carried the day over the  mostly  bilingual Flemish inhabitants  21  Only since the 1960s  after the fixation of the Belgian language border and the socio economic development of Flanders was in full effect  could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use  22  This phenomenon is  together with the future of Brussels  one of the most controversial topics in all of Belgian politics  23  24  Today an estimated 16 percent of city residents are native speakers of Dutch  while an additional 13 percent claim to have a  good to excellent  knowledge of Dutch  17   edit  France Language situation in the Dunkirk district of northern France in 1874 and then in 1972  French Flemish  a variant of West Flemish  is spoken in the north east of France by an estimated population of 20 000 daily speakers and 40 000 occasional speakers  It is spoken alongside French  which is gradually replacing it for all purposes and in all areas of communication  25  Neither Dutch nor its regional French Flemish variant is afforded any legal status in France  either by the central or regional public authorities  by the education system or before the courts  In brief  the State is not taking any measures to ensure use of Dutch in France  25  In the 9th century the Germanic Romance language border went from the mouth of the Canche to just north of the city of Lille  where it coincided with the present language border in Belgium  26  From the late 9th century on  the border gradually started to shift northward and eastward to the detriment of the Germanic language  Boulogne sur Mer was bilingual up to the 12th century  Calais up to the 16th century  and Saint Omer until the 18th century  The western part of the County of Flanders  consisting of the castellanies of Bourbourg  Bergues  Cassel and Bailleul  became part of France between 1659 and 1678  However  the linguistic situation in this formerly monolingually Dutch speaking region did not dramatically change until the French Revolution in 1789  and Dutch continued to fulfil the main functions of a cultural language throughout the 18th century  26  During the 19th century  especially in the second half of it  Dutch was banned from all levels of education and lost most of its functions as a cultural language  The cities of Dunkirk  Gravelines and Bourbourg had become predominantly French speaking by the end of the 19th century  In the countryside  until World War I  many elementary schools continued to teach in Dutch  and the Roman Catholic Church continued to preach and teach the cathechism in Flemish in many parishes  26  Nonetheless  since French enjoyed a much higher status than Dutch  from about the interbellum onward everybody became bilingual  the generation born after World War II being raised exclusively in French  In the countryside  the passing on of Flemish stopped during the 1930s or 1940s  As a consequence  the vast majority of those still having an active command of Flemish belong to the generation of over the age of 60  26  Therefore  complete extinction of French Flemish can be expected in the coming decades  26   edit  Asia An anachronous map of the Dutch colonial Empire  Light green  territories administered by or originating from territories administered by the Dutch East India Company  dark green the Dutch West India Company  The growth of the Dutch East Indies  27  Despite the Dutch presence in Indonesia for almost three hundred and fifty years  the Dutch language has no official status there 28  and the small minority that can speak the language fluently are either educated members of the oldest generation  or employed in the legal profession  29  as some legal codes are still only available in Dutch  30  Many universities include Dutch as a source language  mainly for law and history students  roughly 35 000 of them nationally   31  32  Contrary to other European nations  the Dutch chose to not follow a policy of language expansion amongst the indigenous peoples of their colonies  33  In the last quarter of the 19th century  however  a local elite gained proficiency in Dutch so as to meet the needs of expanding bureaucracy and business  34  Nevertheless  the Dutch government remained reluctant to teach Dutch on a large scale out of fear of destabilising the colony  Dutch  the language of power  was supposed to remain in the hands of the leading elite  34  Instead  use of local languages  or  where this proved to be impractical  of Malay  was encouraged  As a result  less than two percent of Indonesians could speak Dutch in 1940  34  Only when in 1928 the Indonesian nationalist movement had chosen Malay as a weapon against Dutch influence  the colonial authorities gradually began to introduce Dutch in the educational curriculum  But owing to the 1942 Japanese invasion and the subsequent Indonesian independence in 1949  this shift in policy did not come into full effect  34  After independence  Dutch was dropped as an official language and replaced by Malay  Yet the Indonesian language inherited many words from Dutch  both in words for everyday life  and as well in scientific or technological terminology  35  One scholar argues that 20  of Indonesian words can be traced back to Dutch words  36  many of which transliterated to reflect phonetic pronunciation e g   kantoor   Dutch for  office   in Indonesian is  kantor   while  bus    bus   becomes  bis   In addition  many Indonesian words are calques on Dutch  for example   rumah sakit   Indonesian for  hospital   is calqued on the Dutch  ziekenhuis   literally  sick house     kebun binatang    zoo   on  dierentuin   literally  animal garden     undang undang dasar    constitution   from  grondwet   literally  basic law    These account for some of the differences in vocabulary between Indonesian and Malay  The original spelling system devised for Indonesian  devised by Charles van Ophuijsen 36  was influenced by Dutch  with the use of Dutch letter combinations such as  oe   For example   tempo doeloe   meaning  the past   was pronounced as one vowel like in  moeder   Dutch for  mother    In 1947  this was changed to  u   hence  tempo dulu   However  the letter combination  oe  continued to be used in people s names  for example  the spelling of the names of the first and second Presidents  Sukarno and Suharto are often written as  Soekarno  and  Soeharto   In 1972  following an agreement with Malaysia to harmonise the spelling of Indonesian and Malay  other Dutch influenced letter combinations such as  tj  and  dj  were replaced with  c  and  j   hence  tjap    brand  in Indonesian  became  cap  and  Djakarta   the country s capital  became  Jakarta   Dutch based creole languages  once  spoken in the Dutch East Indies include Javindo and Petjo  most of whose speakers were Indo or Eurasians  As a result of Indo emigration to the Netherlands following independence  the use of these languages declined  The century and half of Dutch rule in Ceylon  now Sri Lanka  and southern India left few or no traces of the Dutch language   edit  Oceania After the declaration of independence of Indonesia  Western New Guinea remained a Dutch colony until 1962  known as Netherlands New Guinea  37  Despite prolonged Dutch presence  the Dutch language is not spoken by many Papuans  the colony having been ceded to Indonesia in 1963  Immigrant communities can be found in Australia and New Zealand  The 2006 Australian census showed 36 179 people speaking Dutch at home  38  According to the 2006 census in New Zealand  16 347 people claim sufficient fluency in Dutch to hold an everyday conversation  39   edit  Americas Location of Suriname in South America  Location of the former Netherlands Antilles in the southern Caribbean  In contrast to the colonies in the East Indies  from the second half of the 19th century onwards  the Netherlands envisaged expansion of Dutch in its colonies in the West Indies  Until 1863  when slavery was abolished in the West Indies  slaves were forbidden to speak Dutch  Most important were the efforts of Christianisation through Dutchification  which did not occur in Indonesia owing to a policy of non involvement in already Islamised regions  Secondly  most of the people in Dutch Guiana  now Suriname  worked on Dutch plantations  which reinforced the importance of Dutch as a means for direct communication  34  40  In Indonesia  the colonial authorities had less interference in economic life  The size of the population was decisive  whereas the Antilles and Dutch Guiana combined only had a few hundred thousand inhabitants  Indonesia had many millions  by far outnumbering the population of the Netherlands  34   edit  Suriname In Suriname  where in the second half of the 19th century the Dutch authorities introduced a policy of assimilation  34  Dutch is the sole official language 41  and over 60 percent of the population speaks it as a mother tongue  1  A further twenty four percent of the population speaks Dutch as a second language  42  Suriname gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1975 and has been an associate member of the Dutch Language Union since 2004  43  The lingua franca of Suriname  however  is Sranan Tongo  44  spoken natively by about a fifth of the population  15  45   edit  Caribbean In Aruba  Cura ao and Sint Maarten  all part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  Dutch is the official language but spoken as a first language by only seven to eight percent of the population  46  47  although most native born people on the islands can speak the language since the education system is in Dutch at some or all levels  48  The lingua franca of Aruba  Bonaire and Cura ao is Papiamento  a creole language that originally developed among the slave population  The population of the three northern Antilles  Sint Maarten  Saba  and Sint Eustatius  is predominantly English speaking  34   edit  North America In New Jersey in the United States  an almost extinct

only U S  President to have spoken a language other than English as his first language  Dutch prevailed for many generations as the dominant language in parts of New York along the Hudson River  Another famous American born in this region who spoke Dutch as a first language was Sojourner Truth  According to the 2000 United States census  150 396 people spoke Dutch at home  51  while according to the 2006 Canadian census  this number reaches 160 000 Dutch speakers  52  In Canada  Dutch is the fourth most spoken language by farmers  after English  French and German  53  and the fifth most spoken non official language overall  by 0 6  of Canadians   54   edit  Africa  edit  Belgian Africa The Belgian colonial empire  Belgium  which had gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1830  also held a colonial empire from 1901 to 1962  consisting of the Belgian Congo and Ruanda Urundi  Unlike Belgium itself  the colonies had no de jure official language  55  56  Although a majority of Belgians residing in the colonies were Dutch speaking  55 French was de facto the sole language used in administration  jurisdiction and secondary education  57  After World War II  proposals of dividing the colony into a French speaking and a Dutch speaking part after the example of Belgium were discussed within the Flemish Movement  57  58  In general  however  the Flemish Movement was not as strong in the colonies as in the mother country  59  Although in 1956  on the eve of Congolese independence  an estimated 50 000 out of a total of 80 000 Belgian nationals would have been Flemish  55  only 1 305 out of 21 370 children were enrolled in Dutch language education  60  When the call for a better recognition of Dutch in the colony got louder  the  volu s   developed Congolese   among them Mobutu Sese Seko argued that Dutch had no right over the indigenous languages  defending the privileged position of French  55  60  Moreover  the image of Afrikaans as the language of the apartheid was injurious to the popularity of Dutch  60  The colonial authorities used Lingala  Kongo  Swahili and Tshiluba in communication with the local population and in education  57  In Ruanda Urundi this was Kirundi  61  Knowledge of French or  to an even lesser extent  Dutch was hardly passed on to the natives  55  of whom only a small number were taught French to work in local public services  34  After their independence  French would become an official language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Rwanda and Burundi  61  Of these  Congo is the most

of Dutch  Flemish and other northwest European farmer  in Dutch  boer  settlers  all of whom were quickly assimilated  62  After the colony passed into British hands in the early 19th century  the settlers spread into the hinterland  taking their language with them  The subsequent isolation from the rest of the Dutch speaking world made the Dutch as spoken in Southern Africa evolve into what is now Afrikaans  22  European Dutch remained the literary language until the early 20th century  when under pressure of Afrikaner nationalism the local  African  Dutch was preferred over the written  European based standard  62  In 1925  section 137 of the 1909 constitution of the Union of South Africa was amended by Act 8 of 1925  stating  the word Dutch in article 137       is hereby declared to include Afrikaans   63  64  The new constitution of 1961 only listed English and Afrikaans as official languages  It is estimated that between 90  to 95  of Afrikaans vocabulary is ultimately of Dutch origin  65  66  Both languages are still largely mutually intelligible  although this relation can in some fields  such as lexicon  spelling and grammar  be asymmetric  as it is easier for Dutch speakers to understand written Afrikaans than it is for Afrikaans speakers to understand written Dutch  67  Afrikaans is grammatically far less complex than Dutch  and vocabulary items are generally altered in a clearly patterned manner  e g  vogel becomes vo l  bird  and regen becomes re n  rain    68  See also  Differences between Afrikaans and Dutch It is the third language of South Africa in

communication  71  It is the lingua franca in Namibia  62  72  73  where it is spoken natively in 11 percent of households  74  In total  Afrikaans is the first language for about 6 million and a second language for 10 million people  75  compared to over 23 million 1  and 5 million respectively  for Dutch  2   edit  History Main article  History of Dutch The history of the Dutch language begins around AD 450 500 after Old Frankish  one of the many West Germanic tribal languages  was split by the Second Germanic consonant shift  At more or less the same time the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law led to the development of the direct ancestors of modern Dutch Low Saxon  Frisian and English  The northern dialects of Old Frankish generally did not participate in either of these two shifts  except for a small amount of phonetic changes  and are hence known as Old Low Franconian  the  Low  refers to dialects not influenced by the consonant shift  The most south eastern dialects of the Franconian languages became part of High though not Upper German even though a dialect continuum remained  The fact that Dutch did not undergo the sound changes may be the reason why some people say that Dutch is like a bridge between English and German  Within Old Low Franconian there were two subgroups  Old East Low Franconian and Old West Low Franconian  which is better known as Old Dutch  East Low Franconian was eventually absorbed by Dutch as it became the dominant form of Low Franconian  although it remains a noticeable substrate within the southern Limburgish dialects of Dutch  As the two groups were so similar  it is often difficult to determine whether a text is Old Dutch or Old East Low Franconian  hence most linguists will generally use Old Dutch synonymously with Old Low Franconian and mostly do not differentiate  Dutch  like other Germanic languages  is conventionally divided into three development phases which were  450 500  1150 Old Dutch  First attested in the Salic Law  1150 1500 Middle Dutch  Also called  Diets  in popular use  though not by linguists  1500 present Modern Dutch  Saw the creation of the Dutch standard language and includes contemporary Dutch  The transition between these languages was very gradual and one of the few moments linguists can detect somewhat of a revolution is when the Dutch standard language emerged and quickly established itself  Standard Dutch is very similar to most Dutch dialects  The development of the Dutch language is illustrated by the following sentence in Old  Middle and Modern Dutch   Irl sin sol an frithe s la m na fan th n thia gin cont mi  wanda under managon he was mit mi   Old Dutch   Erlossen sal  hi  in vrede siele mine van dien die genaken mi  want onder menegen hi was met mi   Middle Dutch   Using same word order   Verlossen zal hij in vrede ziel mijn van degenen die  te  na komen mij  want onder menigeen hij was met mij   Modern Dutch   Using correct contemporary Dutch word order   Hij zal mijn ziel in vrede verlossen van degenen die mij te na komen  want onder menigeen was hij met mij   Modern Dutch   see Psalm 55 19   He shall my soul in peace free from those who me too near come  because amongst many was he with me   English literal translation in the same word order   He will deliver my soul in peace from those who attack me  because  amongst many  he was with me   English translation in unmarked word order   see Psalm 55 18  A process of standardisation started in the Middle Ages  especially under the influence of the Burgundian Ducal Court in Dijon  Brussels after 1477   The dialects of Flanders and Brabant were the most influential around this time  The process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the 16th century  mainly based on the urban dialect of Antwerp  In 1585 Antwerp fell to the Spanish army  many fled to the Northern Netherlands  especially the province of Holland  where they influenced the urban dialects of that province  In 1637  a further important step was made towards a unified language  when the Statenvertaling  the first major Bible translation into Dutch  was created that people from all over the United Provinces could understand  It used elements from various  even Dutch Low Saxon  dialects but was predominantly based on the urban dialects of Holland   edit  Dialects Main article  Dutch dialects

beard   pronounced as baart  has plural baarden and sg  rib  rib   pronounced as rip has plural ribben  Because of assimilation  often the initial consonant of the next word is also devoiced  e g  het vee  the cattle  is   h  tfe   This process of devoicing is taken to an extreme in some regions  Amsterdam  Friesland  with almost complete loss of  v    z  and      These phonemes are certainly present in the middle of a word  Compare standard Dutch pronunciation logen and loochen  lo  n  vs   lox n   In the dialects the contrast is even greater   lo  n  vs   lo  n   The final n of the plural ending  en is often not pronounced  as in Afrikaans where it is also dropped in the written language   except in the northeast Netherlands where dialects of Low German are traditionally spoken   edit  Vowels The vowel inventory of Dutch is large  with 13 simple vowels and four diphthongs  The vowels  e           o   are included on the diphthong chart because they are actually produced as narrow closing diphthongs in many dialects  but behave phonologically like the other simple vowels       a near open central vowel  is an allophone of unstressed  a  and      IPA chart of Netherlandic

since they are allophones  The vowel in beer  being different from both bet and beet  is usually represented by  e    Similarly the one in boor  is neither like bot nor boot  and represented by  o     edit  Consonants The syllable structure of Dutch is  C  C  C V C  C  C  C   Many words  as in English  begin with three consonants  for example  straat  street   There are words that end in four consonants  e g   herfst  autumn   ergst  worst   interessantst  most interesting   sterkst  strongest   the last three of which are superlative adjectives  The most number of consonants in a single cluster is found in the word slechtstschrijvend  writing worst  with 7 consonant phonemes  though in normal speech the number of phonemes is usually reduced to 6 because of assimilation of  tstsch  to  stsch   or even to 5 by many speakers who pronounce the cluster  schr  as  sr    Like most Germanic languages  Dutch consonant system did not undergo the High German consonant shift and has a syllable structure that allows fairly complex consonant clusters  Dutch is often noted for its prominent use of velar fricatives    Bilabial Labio  dental Alveolar Post  alveolar Palatal Velar Uvular

 and velar in Belgian dialects  77   5 In some dialects  the voiced fricatives have almost completely merged with the voiceless ones      is usually realized as  h   in the North  v  is usually realized as  f    z  is usually realized as  s   yet only in the North  In the South  v  is pronounced  v  and  z  is  z   In the North     is usually realized as  x   whereas in the South the distinction between     and     has been preserved   6 The realization of the  r  phoneme varies considerably from dialect to dialect  In  standard  Dutch   r  is realized as the alveolar trill  r   but the uvular trill     is a common alternative  In some dialects it is realized as the alveolar tap      the voiced uvular fricative      or as the alveolar approximant       7 The realization of the     varies considerably from the Northern to the Southern and Belgium dialects of the Dutch language  A number of Belgian dialects 78  79  pronounce it like a bilabial approximant        Other

south  or huis  house   the  lt au ou gt  in pauw  peacock  or koud  cold   and the  lt ij gt  sound in words like mijt  mite  or wijn  wine  present difficulties  Even though some of these words are superficially like their English equivalents the correct sound is very different  Another issue with pronunciation is the  lt ch gt  sound if preceded by s  which Dutch native speakers pronounce as      North  or      South   It has no counterpart in English  Particularly the voiced equivalents  northern     and     in the south  are rare among other European languages  In Northern Dutch there is a tendency for using the voiceless sound in all places  The morphological flexibility and cohesiveness of Dutch sometimes produces words that might baffle speakers of other languages owing to the large number of consonant clusters  such as the word angstschreeuw    stsxre w    listen   scream in fear   which has a total of six in a row  ngstschr   the ng and ch being digraphs   It has to be noted though that the pronunciation of a word can differ greatly from its written form  In this case  angstschreeuw actually contains 6 consonant sounds  ng s t s ch r  originating from two distinct compounded words  angst and schreeuw   which is reduced further by some speakers in connected speech by blending consecutive consonants  ch and r  into one sound  This can be even further shortened to    sre w  by those who normally reduce the schr sequence to sr   edit  Historical sound changes Dutch  with the exception of the Limburg dialects  did not undergo the second or High German consonant shift compare German machen   x   vs  Dutch maken  English make  German Pfanne  pf   vs  Dutch pan  English pan  German zwei  ts   vs  Dutch twee  English two  Dutch underwent a few changes of its own  For example  words in  old olt lost the  l  to a diphthong after l vocalization  compare English old  German alt vs  Dutch oud   and  ks  sounds were reduced to  s   compare English fox  German Fuchs vs  Dutch vos   81  Germanic   u   fronted to  y    which in turn became a diphthong   y   spelt  ui   Long   i   also diphthongized to   i   spelt  ij   The phoneme      originally in allophonic variation with      became     in every position except after  n   where it instead merged with  n  into       It later palatalised to     in the South  Flanders  Limburg  Brabant   A similar development took place in the neighbouring Western dialects of German  where the palatisation has gone so far as to merge     with  j   also heard in Kerkrade    edit  Polder Dutch A notable deviation from the official pronunciation of Standard Dutch in younger generations in the Netherlands has been dubbed  Polder Dutch  by Jan Stroop  82  The diphthongs spelt  lt ij gt    lt ou gt   and  lt ui gt  are pronounced not as   i     u   and   y   but lowered  as  ai    au   and  ay  respectively  Instead   e     o    and      are pronounced as diphthongs now  as   i     u   and   y  respectively  which makes this change an instance of a chain shift  This change is interesting from a sociolinguistic point of view because it has apparently happened relatively recently  in the 1970s  and was pioneered by older well educated women from the upper middle classes  83  The lowering of the diphthongs has long been current in many Dutch dialects  and is comparable to the English Great Vowel Shift  and the diphthongisation of long high vowels in Modern High German  which centuries earlier reached the state now found in Polder Dutch  Stroop theorizes that the lowering of open mid to open diphthongs is a phonetically  natural  and inevitable development and that Dutch  after having diphthongised the long high vowels like German and English   should  have lowered the diphthongs like German and English as well  Instead  he argues  this development has been artificially frozen in an  intermediate  state by the standardisation of Dutch pronunciation in the 16th century  where lowered diphthongs found in rural dialects were perceived as ugly by the educated classes and accordingly declared substandard  Now  however  in his opinion  the newly affluent and independent women can afford to let that natural development take place in their speech  Stroop compares the role of Polder Dutch with the urban variety of British English pronunciation called Estuary English  Among Belgian Dutch speakers  this vowel shift is not taking place  as the diphthongs   i     u  and   y  are often pronounced as the monophthongs            and        edit  Grammar Main article  Dutch grammar Dutch is grammatically similar to German  such as in syntax and verb morphology  for a comparison of verb morphology in English  Dutch and German  see Germanic weak verb and Germanic strong verb   Dutch has grammatical cases  but these are now mostly limited to pronouns and a large number of set phrases  Inflected forms of the articles are also often found in surnames and toponyms  Originally  Dutch had three genders  masculine  feminine and neuter  although for many speakers  masculine and feminine have merged to form the common gender  de   while the neuter  het  remains distinct as before  This gender system is similar to those of most Continental Scandinavian languages  Many Belgian speakers still make a clear distinction between masculine and feminine words  see Gender in Dutch   As in English  but to a lesser degree  the inflectional grammar of the language  e g   adjective and noun endings  has simplified over time   edit  Genders and cases The table of definite articles below demonstrates that contemporary Dutch is less complex than German  The article has just two forms  de and het  more complex than English  which has only  the   The use of the older inflected form den in the dative or accusative as well as use of  der  in the dative are restricted to numerous set phrases  surnames and toponyms  Dutch German Masculine singular Feminine singular Neuter singular Plural  any gender  Masculine singular Feminine singular Neuter singular Plural  any gender  Nominative de  d   de het    t  de der die das die Genitive  des    van de  der    van de  des    van het  der    van de des der des der Dative de de het de dem der dem den Accusative de de het de den die das die In modern Dutch  the genitive articles  des  and  der  are only commonly used in idioms and are typically considered poetical or archaic  In most circumstances  the preposition  van  is instead used  followed by the normal definitive article  de  or  het   For the idiomatic use of the articles in the genitive  see for example  Masculine singular   des duivels   of the devil  Feminine singular  het woordenboek der Friese taal  the dictionary of the Frisian language  Neuter singular  de vrouw des huizes  the lady of the house  Plural  de voortgang der werken  the progress of  public  works  In contemporary usage  the genitive case still occurs a little more often with plurals than with singulars  as the plural article is  der  for all genders and no special noun inflection must be taken account of   Der  is commonly used in order to avoid reduplication of  van   e g  het merendeel der gedichten van de auteur instead of het meerendeel van de gedichten van de auteur   the bulk of the author s poems    Dutch also has a range of fixed expressions that make use of the genitive articles  which can be abbreviated using apostrophes  Common examples include   s ochtends   with  s as abbreviation of des  in the morning  and  desnoods   lit  of the need  translated  if necessary   The Dutch written grammar has simplified over the past 100 years  cases are now mainly used for the pronouns  such as ik  I   mij  me  me   mijn  my   wie  who   wiens  whose  masculine or neuter singular   wier  whose  feminine singular  masculine or feminine plural   Nouns and adjectives are not case inflected  except for the genitive of proper nouns  names    s    s or      In the spoken language cases and case inflections had already gradually disappeared from a much earlier date on  probably the 15th century  as in many continental West Germanic dialects  Inflection of adjectives is more complicated  The adjective receives no ending with indefinite neuter nouns in singular  as with een   n   a an    and  e in all other cases   This was also the case in Middle English  as in  a goode man    Note that fiets belongs to the masculine feminine category  and that water and huis are neuter  Water has no plural form  Masculine singular or feminine singular Neuter singular Plural  any gender  Definite  with definite article or pronoun  de mooie fiets  the beautiful bicycle  het mooie huis  the beautiful house  de mooie fietsen  the beautiful bicycles  de mooie huizen  the beautiful houses  Indefinite  with indefinite article or no article and no pronoun  een mooie fiets  a beautiful bicycle  koude soep  cold soup  een mooi huis  a beautiful house  koud water  cold water  mooie fietsen  beautiful bicycles  mooie huizen  beautiful houses  An adjective has no e if it is in the predicative  De soep is koud  More complex inflection is still found in certain lexicalized expressions like de heer des huizes  literally  the man of the house   etc  These are usually remnants of cases  in this instance  the genitive case which is still used in German  cf  Der Herr des Hauses  and other inflections no longer in general use today  In such lexicalized expressions remnants of strong and weak nouns can be found too  e g  in het jaar des Heren  Anno Domini   where   en  is actually the genitive ending of the weak noun  Also in this case  German retains this feature   edit  Word order Dutch exhibits subject object verb word order  but in main clauses the conjugated verb is moved into the second position in what is known as verb second or V2 word order  This makes Dutch word order almost identical to that of German  but often different from English  which has subject verb object word order and has since lost the V2 word order that existed in Old English  84  An example sentence used in some Dutch language courses and textbooks is  Ik kan mijn pen niet vinden omdat het veel te donker is   which translates into English word for word as  I can my pen not find because it far too dark is   but in standard English word order would be written  I cannot find my pen because it is far too dark   If the sentence is split into a main and subclause and the verbs highlighted  the logic behind the word order can be seen  Main clause   Ik kan mijn pen niet vinden  Verbs are placed in the final position  but the conjugated verb  in this case  kan   can   is made the second element of the clause  Subclause   omdat het veel te donker is  The verb or verbs always go in the final position   edit  Diminutives Dutch nouns can take endings for size   je for singular diminutive and  jes for plural diminutive  Between these suffixes and the radical can come extra letters depending on the ending of the word  boom  tree    boompje ring  ring    ringetje koning  king    koninkje tien  ten    tientje  a ten euro note  These diminutives are very common  As in German  all diminutives are neuter  In the case of words like  het meisje   the girl   this is different from the natural gender  A diminutive ending can also be appended to an adverb or adjective  but not when followed by a noun   klein  little  small    een kleintje  a small one   edit  Compounds Like most Germanic languages  Dutch forms noun compounds  where the first noun modifies the category given by the second  for example  hondenhok  doghouse   Unlike English  where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in open form with separating spaces  Dutch  like the other Germanic languages  either uses the closed form without spaces  for example  boomhuis  Eng  tree house  or hyphenated  VVD coryfee  outstanding member of the VVD  a political party   Like German  Dutch allows arbitrarily long compounds  but the longer they get  the less frequent they tend to be  The longest serious entry in the Van Dale dictionary is  wapenstilstandsonderhandeling  help info   ceasefire negotiation   Leafing through the articles of association  Statuten  one may come across a 30 letter  vertegenwoordigingsbevoegdheid  help info   authorisation of representation   An even longer word cropping up in official documents is ziektekostenverzekeringsmaatschappij  health insurance company  though the shorter ziektekostenverzekeraar  health insurer  is more common  Notwithstanding official spelling rules  some Dutch people nowadays tend to write the parts of a compound separately  which is sometimes dubbed  the English disease  or  de Engelse ziekte   85  86   edit  Vocabulary Dutch vocabulary is predominantly Germanic in origin  considerably more so than English  This is to a large part due to the heavy influence of Norman on English  and to Dutch patterns of word formation  such as the tendency to form long and sometimes very complicated compound nouns  being more similar to those of German and the Scandinavian languages  The Dutch vocabulary is one of the richest in the world and comprises at least 268 826 headwords  87  In addition  the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal  English   The Dictionary of the Dutch language   is the largest dictionary in the world in print and has over 430 000 entries of Dutch words  88  Like English  Dutch includes words of Greek and Latin origin  Somewhat paradoxically  most loanwords from French have entered into Dutch vocabulary via the Netherlands and not via Belgium  in spite of the cultural and economic dominance exerted by French speakers in Belgium until the first half of the 20th century  This happened because the status French enjoyed as the language of refinement and high culture inspired the affluent upper and upper middle classes in the Netherlands to adopt many French terms into the language  In Belgium no such phenomenon occurred  since members of the upper and upper middle classes would have spoken French rather than Frenchify their Dutch  French terms heavily influenced Dutch dialects in Flanders  but Belgian speakers did  and do  tend to resist French loanwords when using standard Dutch  Nonetheless some French loanwords of relatively recent date have become accepted in standard Dutch  also in Belgium  albeit with a shift in meaning and not as straight synonyms for existing Dutch words  For example   blesseren   from French blesser  to injure  is almost exclusively used to refer to sports injuries  while in other contexts the standard Dutch verbs  kwetsen  and  verwonden  continue to be used  Especially on the streets and in many professions  there is a steady increase of English loanwords  rather often pronounced or applied in a different way  see Dutch pseudo anglicisms   The influx of English words is maintained by the dominance of English in the mass media and on the Internet  The most important dictionary of the modern Dutch language is the Van Dale groot woordenboek der Nederlandse taal  89  more commonly referred to as the Dikke van Dale   dik  means  thick    However  it is dwarfed by the 45 000 page Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal  a scholarly endeavour that took 147 years from initial idea to first edition   edit  Writing system Main articles  Dutch alphabet and Dutch orthography Dutch is written using the Latin script  Dutch uses one additional character beyond the standard alphabet  the digraph IJ  It has a relatively high proportion of doubled letters  both vowels and consonants  This is due to the formation of compound words and also to the spelling devices for distinguishing the many vowel sounds in the Dutch language  An example of five consecutive doubled letters is the word voorraaddoos  supply box   The diaeresis  Dutch  trema  is used to mark vowels that are pronounced separately  In the most recent spelling reform  a hyphen has replaced the diaeresis in compound words  i e   if the vowels originate from separate words  not from prefixes or suffixes   e g  zee end  seaduck  is now spelled zee eend  The acute accent occurs mainly on loanwords like caf   but can also be used for emphasis or to differentiate between two forms  Its most common use is to differentiate between the indefinite article  een   a  an  and the numeral    n   one   also  h    hey  also written  hee    The grave accent is used to clarify pronunciation   h    what   what the       tag question  eh      b ta   and in loanwords   caissi re   female cashier    apr s ski    In the recent spelling reform  the accent grave was dropped as stress sign on short vowels in favour of the acute accent  e g   w l  was changed to  w l    Other diacritical marks such as the circumflex only occur on a few words  most of them loanwords from French  The official spelling is set by the Wet schrijfwijze Nederlandsche taal  Law on the writing of the Dutch language  Belgium 1946  Netherlands 1947  based on a 1944 spelling revision  both amended in the 1990s after a 1995 spelling revision   The Woordenlijst Nederlandse taal  more commonly known as  het groene boekje   i e   the green booklet   because of its colour   is usually accepted as an informal explanation of the law  However  the official 2005 spelling revision  which reversed some of the 1995 changes and made new ones  has been welcomed with a distinct lack of enthusiasm in both the Netherlands and Belgium  As a result  the Genootschap Onze Taal  Our Language Society  decided to publish an alternative list   het witte boekje    the white booklet    which tries to simplify some complicated rules and offers several possible spellings for many contested words  This alternative orthography is followed by a number of major Dutch media organisations but mostly ignored in Belgium   edit  Dutch as a foreign language As a foreign language  Dutch is mainly taught in primary and secondary schools in areas adjacent to the Netherlands and Flanders  In French speaking Belgium  over 300 000 pupils are enrolled in Dutch courses  followed by over 20 000 in the German states of Lower Saxony and North Rhine Westphalia  and over 7 000 in the French region of Nord Pas de Calais  of which 4 550 already in primary school   90  Dutch is the obligatory medium of instruction in schools in Suriname  even for non native speakers  91  Dutch is taught in various educational centres in Indonesia  the most important of which is the Erasmus Language Centre  ETC  in Jakarta  Each year  some 1 500 to 2 000 students take Dutch courses there  92  In total  several thousand Indonesians study Dutch as a foreign language  93  At an academic level  Dutch is taught in over 225 universities in more than 40 countries  About 10 000 students worldwide study Dutch at university  32  The largest number of faculties of neerlandistiek can be found in Germany  30 universities   followed by France and the United States  20 each   Five universities in the United Kingdom offer the study of Dutch  90  94  Owing to centuries of Dutch rule in Indonesia  many old documents are written in Dutch  Many universities therefore include Dutch as a source language  mainly for law and history students  31  In Indonesia this involves about 35 000 students  32  In South Africa  the number is difficult to estimate  since the academic study of Afrikaans inevitably includes the study of Dutch  32  Elsewhere in the world  the number of people learning Dutch is relatively small   edit  See also Afrikaans Differences between Afrikaans and Dutch Bargoens Dutch dialects Dutch grammar Dutch Language Union Dutch linguistic
