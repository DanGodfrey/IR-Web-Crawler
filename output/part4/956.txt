is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Scandinavian committees in recognition of cultural and scientific advances  The will of the Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel  the inventor of dynamite  established the prizes in 1895  The prizes in Physics  Chemistry  Physiology or Medicine  Literature  and Peace were first awarded in 1901  1  The Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo  Norway  while the other prizes are awarded in Stockholm  Sweden  Baruch Aba Shalev  author of a book on the Nobel Prize  has said  the Nobel Prize has come to be regarded as the best known and most prestigious award available in the fields of literature  medicine  physics  chemistry  peace and economics   2  In 1968  Sveriges Riksbank instituted an award that is often associated with the Nobel prizes  the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel  The first such prize was awarded in 1969  Although it is not an official Nobel Prize  its announcements and presentations are made along with the other prizes  The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Nobel Prize in Physics  the Nobel Prize in Chemistry  and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences  The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine  The Swedish Academy grants the Nobel Prize in Literature  The Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by a Swedish organisation but by the Norwegian Nobel Committee  Each recipient  or laureate  receives a gold medal  a diploma  and a sum of money which depends on the Nobel Foundation s income that year  In 2011  each prize was worth SEK 10 million  c  US 1 46 million   1 16 million   The prize is not awarded posthumously  however  if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it  the prize may still be presented   3  A prize may not be shared among more than three people  The average number of laureates per prize has increased substantially over the 20th century  4  Contents 1

 help info   was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm  Sweden  into a family of engineers  5  He was a chemist  engineer  and inventor  In 1894 Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill  which he made into a major armaments manufacturer  Nobel also invented ballistite  a precursor to many smokeless military explosives  especially the British smokeless powder cordite  Nobel was even involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite  Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime  Most of his wealth was from his 355 inventions  of which dynamite is the most famous  6  In 1888  Alfred was astonished to read his own obituary  titled  The merchant of death is dead   in a French newspaper  As it was Alfred s brother Ludvig who had died  the obituary was eight years premature  The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered  This inspired him to change his will  7  On 10 December 1896 Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo  Italy  from a cerebral haemorrhage  He was 63 years old  8  To widespread astonishment  Nobel s last will specified that his fortune be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the  greatest benefit on mankind  in physics  chemistry  peace  physiology or medicine  and literature  9  Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime  The last was written over a year before he died  signed at the Swedish Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895  10  11  Nobel bequeathed 94  of his total assets  31 million SEK  c  US 186 million   150 million in 2008   to establish the five Nobel Prizes  12  Because of scepticism surrounding the will  it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the Storting in Norway  13  The executors of Nobel s will  Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist  formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel s fortune and organise the award of prizes  14  Nobel s instructions named a Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Peace Prize  the members of whom were appointed shortly after the will was approved in April 1897  Soon thereafter  the other prize awarding organisations were established  These were the Karolinska Institutet on 7 June  the Swedish Academy on 9 June  and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June  15  The Nobel Foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded  and in 1900  the Nobel Foundation s newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II  9  In 1905  the Union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved  Thereafter Norway s Nobel Committee was responsible for awarding the Nobel Peace Prize and the Swedish institutions retained responsibility for the other prizes  13   edit  Nobel Foundation Main article  Nobel Foundation Alfred Nobel s will stated that 94  of his total assets should be used to establish the Nobel Prizes  The Nobel Foundation was founded as a private organisation on 29 June 1900  to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes  16  In accordance with Nobel s will  the primary task of the Foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left  Robert and Ludwig Nobel were involved in the oil business in Azerbaijan and according to Swedish historian E  Bargengren  who accessed the Nobel family archives  it was this  decision to allow withdrawal of Alfred s money from Baku that became the decisive factor that enabled the Nobel Prizes to be established   17  Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to market the prizes internationally and to oversee informal administration related to the prizes  The Foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates  18  19  In many ways the Nobel Foundation is similar to an investment company  in that it invests Nobel s money to create a solid funding base for the prizes and the administrative activities  The Nobel Foundation is exempt from all taxes in Sweden  since 1946  and from investment taxes in the United States  since 1953   20  Since the 1980s  the Foundation s investments have become more profitable and as of 31 December 2007  the assets controlled by the Nobel Foundation amounted to 3 628 billion Swedish kronor  c  US 560 million   21  According to the statutes  the Foundation consists of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens  with its seat in Stockholm  The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Swedish King in Council  with the other four members appointed by the trustees of the prize awarding institutions  An Executive Director is chosen from among the board members  a Deputy Director is appointed by the King in Council  and two deputies are appointed by the trustees  However  since 1995 all the members of the board have been chosen by the trustees  and the Executive Director and the Deputy Director appointed by the board itself  As well as the board  the Nobel Foundation is made up of the prize awarding institutions  the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences  the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute  the Swedish Academy  and the Norwegian Nobel Committee   the trustees of these institutions  and auditors  21   edit  First prizes Wilhelm Conrad R ntgen received the first Physics Prize for his discovery of X rays  Once the Nobel Foundation and its guidelines were in place  the Nobel Committees began collecting nominations for the inaugural prizes  Subsequently they sent a list of preliminary candidates to the prize awarding institutions  Originally  the Norwegian Nobel Committee appointed prominent figures including J rgen L vland  Bj rnstjerne Bj rnson and Johannes Steen to give the Nobel Peace Prize credibility  22  The committee awarded the Peace Prize to two prominent figures in the growing peace movement around the end of the 19th century  Fr d ric Passy was co founder of the Inter Parliamentary Union and Henry Dunant was founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross  23  24  25  The Nobel Committee s Physics Prize shortlist cited Wilhelm Conrad R ntgen s discovery of X rays and Philipp Lenard s work on cathode rays  The Academy of Sciences selected R ntgen for the prize  26  27  In the last decades of the 19th century  many chemists had made significant contributions  Thus  with the Chemistry Prize  the Academy  was chiefly faced with merely deciding the order in which these scientists should be awarded the prize   28  The Academy received 20 nominations  eleven of them for Jacobus van t Hoff  29  Van t Hoff was awarded the prize for his contributions in chemical thermodynamics  30  31  The Swedish Academy chose the poet Sully Prudhomme for the first Nobel Prize in Literature  A group including 42 Swedish writers  artists and literary critics protested against this decision  having expected Leo Tolstoy to win  32  Some  including Burton Feldman  have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet  Feldman s explanation is that most of the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet  33  The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring  During the 1890s  von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria  which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year  34  35   edit  World War II In 1938 and 1939  Adolf Hitler s Third Reich forbade three laureates from Germany  Richard Kuhn  Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt  and Gerhard Domagk  from accepting their prizes  36  Each man was later able to receive the diploma and medal  37  Even though Sweden was officially neutral during World War II  the prizes were awarded irregularly  In 1939  the Peace Prize was not awarded  No prize was awarded in any category from 1940 42  due to the occupation of Norway by Germany  In the subsequent year  all prizes were awarded except those for literature and peace  38  During the occupation of Norway  three members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile  The remaining members escaped persecution from the Nazis when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property  Thus it was a safe haven from the German military  which was not at war with Sweden  39  These members kept the work of the Committee going but did not award any prizes  In 1944 the Nobel Foundation  together with the three members in exile  made sure that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again  36  Map of Nobel laureates by country   edit  Prize in Economic Sciences Main article  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences In 1968  Sveriges Riksbank celebrated its 300th anniversary by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a prize in honor of Nobel  The following year  the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded for the first time  The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences became responsible for selecting laureates  The first laureates for the Economics Prize were Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Frisch  for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes   40  41  Although not a Nobel Prize  it is intimately identified with the other awards  the laureates are announced with the Nobel Prize recipients  and the Prize in Economic Sciences is presented at the Swedish Nobel Prize Award Ceremony  42  The Board of the Nobel Foundation decided that after this addition  it would allow no further new prizes  43   edit  Award process The award process is similar for all of the Nobel Prizes  the main difference is in who can make nominations for each of them  44  The announcement of the laureates in Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 by Gunnar  quist  permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature announcement by Peter Englund in Swedish  English and German  edit  Nominations Nomination forms are sent by the Nobel Committee to about 3000 individuals  usually in September the year before the prizes are awarded  These individuals are often academics working in a relevant area  For the Peace Prize  inquiries are sent to governments  members of international courts  professors and rectors  former Peace Prize laureates and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee  The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award  44  45  The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names  46  The nominees are not publicly named  nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize  All nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize  47  48   edit  Selection The Nobel Committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice of experts in the relevant fields  This  along with the list of preliminary candidates  is submitted to the prize awarding institutions  49  The institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote  Their decision  which cannot be appealed  is announced immediately after the vote  50  A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award  Except for the Peace Prize  which can be awarded to institutions  the awards can only be given to individuals  51  If the Peace Prize is not awarded  the money is split among the scientific prizes  This has happened 19 times so far  52   edit  Posthumous nominations Although posthumous nominations are not permitted  individuals who die in the months between their nomination and the decision of the prize committee were originally eligible to receive the prize  This has occurred twice  the 1931 Literature Prize awarded to Erik Axel Karlfeldt  and the 1961 Peace Prize awarded to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskj ld  Since 1974  laureates must be thought alive at the time of the October announcement  There has been one laureate  William Vickrey  who died after the prize was announced but before it could be presented  53  On 3 October 2011  the laureates for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine were announced  however  the committee was not aware that one of the laureates  Ralph M  Steinman  had died three days earlier  The committee was debating about Steinman s prize  since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously  3  The committee later decided that as the decision to award Steinman the prize  was made in good faith   it would remain unchanged  54   edit  Recognition time lag Nobel s will provides for prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made  during the preceding year   Early on  the awards usually recognised recent discoveries  55  However  some of these early discoveries were later discredited  For example  Johannes Fibiger was awarded the 1926 Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his purported discovery of a parasite that caused cancer  56  To avoid this embarrassment  the awards increasingly recognised scientific discoveries that had withstood the test of time  57  58  59  According to Ralf Pettersson  former chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Physiology or Medicine   the criterion  the previous year  is interpreted by the Nobel Assembly as the year when the full impact of the discovery has become evident   58  The committee room of the Norwegian Nobel Committee The interval between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline  The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement  60  61  The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work  For example 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts  62  63  However  they can also be awarded for specific recent events  64  For instance  Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary General of the United Nations  65  Similarly Yasser Arafat  Yitzhak Rabin  and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award  about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords  66  Although Nobel s will stated that prizes should be awarded for contributions made  during the preceding year   awards for physics  chemistry  and medicine are typically awarded once the achievement has been widely accepted  This may sometimes take decades   for example  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar shared the 1983 Physics Prize for his 1930s work on stellar structure and evolution  67  68  Not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognised  Some discoveries can never be considered for a prize if their impact is realised after the discoverers have died  69  70  71   edit  Award ceremonies Left  Barack Obama after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo City Hall from the hands of Norwegian Nobel Committee Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland  Right  Giovanni Jona Lasinio presenting Yoichiro Nambu s Nobel Lecture at Aula Magna  Stockholm in 2008 Except for the Peace Prize  the Nobel Prizes are presented in Stockholm  Sweden  at the annual Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December  the anniversary of Nobel s death  The recipients  lectures are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony  The Peace Prize and its recipients  lectures are presented at the annual Prize Award Ceremony in Oslo  Norway  usually on 10 December  The award ceremonies and the associated banquets are typically major international events  72  73  The Prizes awarded in Sweden s ceremonies  are held at the Stockholm Concert Hall  with the Nobel banquet following immediately at Stockholm City Hall  The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony has been held at the Norwegian Nobel Institute  1905 1946   at the auditorium of the University of Oslo  1947 1989  and at Oslo City Hall  1990 present   74  The highlight of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm occurs when each Nobel Laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of the King of Sweden  In Oslo  the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the King of Norway  73  75  At first King Oscar II did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners  It is said that his mind changed once his attention had been drawn to the publicity value of the prizes for Sweden  76   edit  Nobel banquet Table at the 2005 Nobel Banquet in Stockholm After the award ceremony in Sweden  a banquet is held at the Stockholm City Hall  which is attended by the Swedish Royal Family and around 1 300 guests  The banquet features a three course dinner  entertainment and dancing and is extensively covered by local and international says who   media  Before 1930  the banquet in Sweden was held in the ballroom of Stockholm s Grand Hotel  74  The Nobel Peace Prize banquet is held in Oslo at the Grand Hotel after the award ceremony  Apart from the laureate  guests include the President of the Storting  the Prime Minister and  since 2006  the King and Queen of Norway  In total there are about 250 guests attending who all are treated a five course meal  77  For the first time in its history  the banquet was cancelled in Oslo in 1979 because the laureate Mother Teresa refused to attend  saying the money would be better spent on the poor  Mother Teresa used the US 7 000 that was to be spent on the banquet to hold a dinner for 2 000 homeless people on Christmas Day  78  79   edit  Nobel lecture According to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation  each laureate is required to give a public lecture on a subject related to the topic of their prize  80  81  The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format  82  These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week  the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet  which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet   but this is not mandatory  The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize  Some have happened even later  For example  US president Theodore Roosevelt won the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910  after his term in office  83  The lectures are organized by the same association which selected the laureates  84   edit  Prizes  edit  Medals The Nobel Prize medals  minted by Myntverket in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902  are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation  85  Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse  The medals for physics  chemistry  physiology or medicine  and literature have identical obverses  showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death  Nobel s portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for the Economics Prize  but with a slightly different design  For instance  the laureate s name is engraved on the rim of the Economics medal  86  The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize  The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design  87  Laureates receive a heavily decorated diploma together with a gold medal and the prize money  Here Fritz Haber s diploma is shown  which he received for the development of a method to synthesise ammonia  All medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold  Since then they have been struck in 18 carat green gold plated with 24 carat gold  The weight of each medal varies with the value of gold  but averages about 175 grams  0 39 lb  for each medal  The diameter is 66 millimetres  2 6 in  and the thickness varies between 5 2 millimetres  0 20 in  and 2 4 millimetres  0 094 in   88  Because of the high value of their gold content and tendency to be on public display  Nobel medals are subject to medal theft  89  90  91  During World War II  the medals of German scientists Max von Laue and James Franck were sent to Copenhagen for safekeeping  When Germany invaded Denmark  chemist George de Hevesy dissolved them in aqua regia  to prevent confiscation by Nazi Germany and to prevent legal problems for the holders  After the war  the gold was recovered from solution  and the medals re cast  92   edit  Diplomas Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden or the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee  Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them  86  The diploma contains a picture and text which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize  None of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has ever had a citation on their diplomas  93  94   edit  Award money The laureates are given a sum of money when they receive their prizes  in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded  86  The amount of prize money depends upon how much money the Nobel Foundation can award each year  The purse has increased since the 1980s  when the prize money was 880 000 SEK  c  2 6 million SEK  US 350 000 or  295 000 today   In 2009  the monetary award was 10 million SEK  US 1 4 million   950 000   95  96  If there are two laureates in a particular category  the award grant is divided equally between the recipients  If there are three  the awarding committee has the option of dividing the grant equally  or awarding one half to one recipient and one quarter to each of the others  97  98  99  It is not uncommon for recipients to donate prize money to benefit scientific  cultural  or humanitarian causes  100  101   edit  Controversies and criticisms Main article  Nobel Prize controversies  edit  Controversial recipients Among other criticisms  the Nobel Committees have been accused of having a political agenda  and of omitting more deserving candidates  They have also been accused of Eurocentrism  especially for the Literature Prize  102  103  104  When it was announced that Henry Kissinger was to be awarded the Peace Prize two of the Norwegian Nobel Committee members resigned in protest  Peace Prize Among the most criticised Nobel Peace Prizes was the one awarded to Henry Kissinger and L    c Th   who later declined the prize  105  This led to two Norwegian Nobel Committee members resigning  Kissinger and Th  were awarded the prize for negotiating a ceasefire between North Vietnam and the United States in January 1973  However  when the award was announced  both sides were still engaging in hostilities  106  Many critics were of the opinion that Kissinger was not a peace maker but the opposite  responsible for widening the war  47  107  Yasser Arafat  Shimon Peres  and Yitzhak Rabin received the Peace Prize in 1994 for their efforts in making peace between Israel and Palestine  47  108  Many issues  such as the plight of Palestinian refugees  had not been addressed 109  and no final status agreement was reached  110  Immediately after the award was announced  one of the five Norwegian Nobel Committee members denounced Arafat as a terrorist and resigned  111  Additional misgivings about Arafat were widely expressed in various newspapers  112  Another controversial Peace Prize was that awarded to Barack Obama in 2009  113  Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President  but the actual evaluation occurred over the next eight months  52  Obama himself stated that he did not feel deserving of the award  114  115  or worthy of the company it would place him in  116  Past Peace Prize laureates were divided  some saying that Obama deserved the award  and others saying he had not yet earned it  Obama s award  along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore  also prompted accusations of a left wing bias  117  Literature Prize The award of the 2004 Literature Prize to Elfriede Jelinek drew a protest from a member of the Swedish Academy  Knut Ahnlund  Ahnlund resigned  alleging that the selection of Jelinek had caused  irreparable damage to all progressive forces  it has also confused the general view of literature as an art   He alleged that Jelinek s works were  a mass of text shovelled together without artistic structure   118  119  The 2009 Literature Prize to Herta M ller also generated criticism  According to The Washington Post many US literary critics and professors had never previously heard of her  120  This made many feel that the prizes were too Eurocentric  121  Science prizes In 1949  the Portuguese neurologist Ant nio Egas Moniz received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the prefrontal leucotomy  The previous year Dr  Walter Freeman had developed a version of the procedure which was faster and easier to carry out  Due in part to the publicity surrounding the original procedure  Freeman s procedure was prescribed without due consideration or regard for modern medical ethics  Endorsed by such influential publications as The New England Journal of Medicine  leucotomy or  lobotomy  became so popular that about 5 000 lobotomies were performed in the United States in the three years immediately following Moniz s receipt of the Prize  122  123   edit  Overlooked achievements The Norwegian Nobel Committee declined to award a prize in 1948  the year of Gandhi s death  on the grounds that  there was no suitable living candidate   James Joyce  one of the controversial omissions of the Literature Prize The Norwegian Nobel Committee confirmed that Mahatma Gandhi was nominated for the Peace Prize in 1937 39  1947 and a few days before he was assassinated in January 1948  124  Later members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee expressed regret that he was not given the prize  125  Geir Lundestad  Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said   The greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize  Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize  Whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question   126  In 1948  the year of Gandhi s death  the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the grounds that  there was no suitable living candidate  that year  125  127  Later  when the Dalai Lama was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989  the chairman of the committee said that this was  in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi   128  Other high profile individuals with widely recognised contributions to peace have been missed out  Foreign Policy lists Eleanor Roosevelt  V clav Havel  Ken Saro Wiwa  Sari Nusseibeh and Corazon Aquino as people who  never won the prize  but should have   129  The Literature Prize also has controversial omissions  Adam Kirsch has suggested that many notable writers have missed out on the award for political or extra literary reasons  The heavy focus on European and Swedish authors has been a subject of criticism  130  131  The Eurocentric nature of the award was acknowledged by Peter Englund  the 2009 Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy  as a problem with the award and was attributed to the tendency for the academy to relate more to European authors  132  Notable writers that have been overlooked for the Literature Prize include Leo Tolstoy  Anton Chekhov   mile Zola  Jorge Luis Borges  Marcel Proust  Ezra Pound  James Joyce  August Strindberg  Simon Vestdijk  John Updike  Arthur Miller  Chinua Achebe and Mark Twain  133  The strict rule against awarding a prize to more than three people is also controversial  134  When a prize is awarded to recognize an achievement by a team of more than three collaborators  one or more will miss out  For example  in 2002  the prize was awarded to Koichi Tanaka and John Fenn for the development of mass spectrometry in protein chemistry  an award that did not recognize the achievements of Franz Hillenkamp and Michael Karas of the Institute for Physical and Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Frankfurt  135  136  Similarly  the prohibition of posthumous awards fails to recognise achievements by an individual or collaborator who dies before the prize is awarded  In 1962  Francis Crick  James D  Watson  and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Physiology or Medicine Prize for discovering the structure of DNA  Rosalind Franklin  a key contributor in that discovery  died of ovarian cancer four years earlier  137   edit  Emphasis on discoveries over inventions Alfred Nobel left his fortune to finance annual prizes to be awarded  to those who  during the preceding year  shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind   He stated that the Nobel Prizes in Physics should be given  to the person who shall have made the most important  discovery  or  invention  within the field of physics   Nobel did not emphasise discoveries  but they have historically been held in higher respect by the Nobel Prize Committee than inventions  77  of the Physics Prizes have been given to discoveries  compared with only 23  to inventions  Christoph Bartneck and Matthias Rauterberg  in papers published in Nature and Technoetic Arts  have argued this emphasis on discoveries has moved the Nobel Prize away from its original intention of rewarding the greatest contribution to society  138  139   edit  Specially distinguished laureates Maria Sk odowska Curie  one of four people who have received the Nobel Prize twice  Physics and Chemistry   edit  Multiple laureates Four people have received two Nobel Prizes  Maria Sk odowska Curie received the Physics Prize in 1903 for the discovery of radioactivity and the Chemistry Prize in 1911 for the isolation of pure radium  140  making her the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences  Linus Pauling won the 1954 Chemistry Prize for his research into the chemical bond and its application to the structure of complex substances  Pauling also won the Peace Prize in 1962 for his anti nuclear activism  making him the only laureate of two unshared prizes  John Bardeen received the Physics Prize twice  in 1956 for the invention of the transistor and in 1972 for the theory of superconductivity  141 Frederick Sanger received the prize twice in Chemistry  in 1958 for determining the structure of the insulin molecule and in 1980 for inventing a method of determining base sequences in DNA  142  143  Two organisations have received the Peace Prize multiple times  The International Committee of the Red Cross received it three times  in 1917 and 1944 for its work during the world wars  and in 1963
