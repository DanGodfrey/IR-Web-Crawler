fixture in the Kentucky Bluegrass region  It is generally accepted that the historic Native American tribes who hunted in what is now Kentucky referred to the region as Catawba  or some similar variant  There is also a tradition that some tribes referred to the area as  The Dark and Bloody Ground   citation needed  Some have said that the land was described in this way to Daniel Boone by a native Chief  According to The Kentucky Blue Book  citation needed Dragging Canoe  a young Cherokee chief opposed to selling ancestral hunting grounds  warned the whites that they were purchasing a  dark and bloody ground   The origin of Kentucky s modern name  variously spelled Cane tuck ee  Cantucky  Kain tuck ee  and Kentuckee before its modern spelling was accepted  5  comes from an Iroquois word meaning  meadow lands   referring to the buffalo hunting grounds in Central Kentucky s savanna  Members of the Haudenosaunee  the Iroquois Confederacy  were historically based in New York and Pennsylvania  They penetrated to this area of the Ohio River Valley and drove other tribes out in order to control more hunting land  In addition to buffalo  they trapped beaver for the lucrative fur trade with the French and English  long before European American settlement in this area  6   edit  Geography See also  List of Kentucky counties and Coal mining in Kentucky Kentucky is considered to be situated in the Upland South  It is infrequently included in the Midwest  7  8  A significant portion of eastern Kentucky is part of Appalachia  Kentucky borders seven states  from the Midwest and the Southeast  West Virginia lies to the east  Virginia to the southeast  Tennessee to the south  Missouri to the west  Illinois and Indiana to the northwest  and Ohio to the north and northeast  Only Missouri and Tennessee  both of which border eight states  touch more states  Kentucky s northern border is formed by the Ohio River and its western border by the Mississippi River  The official state borders are based on the courses of the rivers as they existed when Kentucky became a state in 1792  In several places  the rivers have changed courses away from the original borders  For instance  northbound travelers on US 41 from Henderson  after crossing the Ohio River  will be in Kentucky for about a half mile  800 m  longer on the north side  Ellis Park  a thoroughbred racetrack  is located in this small piece of Kentucky  Waterworks Road is part of the only land border between Indiana and Kentucky  9  Kentucky is the only U S  state to have a non contiguous part existing as an exclave surrounded by other states  Fulton County  in the far west corner of the state  includes Kentucky Bend  This small part of Kentucky on the Mississippi River  bordered by Missouri and accessible via Tennessee  was created by the 1812 New Madrid Earthquake changing the course of the river  10   edit  Regions Kentucky s regions  click on image for color coding information   Kentucky can be divided into five primary regions  the Cumberland Plateau in the east  the north central Bluegrass region  the south central and western Pennyroyal Plateau  the Western Coal Fields and the far west Jackson Purchase  The Bluegrass region is commonly divided into two regions  the Inner Bluegrass the encircling 90 miles  145 km  around Lexington and the Outer Bluegrass the region that contains most of the Northern portion of the state  above the Knobs  Much of the outer Bluegrass is in the Eden Shale Hills area  made up of short  steep  and very narrow hills  This map is a rough depiction of the regions because it relies largely on county lines  as a result  the Inner Bluegrass appears larger than it is  and the Cumberland Plateau appears slightly smaller  The latter region is more commonly known in Kentucky as the East Kentucky Coal Field  Note the singular  these regions are not the sites of coal  fields  but one continuous field with many overlapping seams  the West Kentucky Coal Field is part of the Illinois Basin  Kentucky s Inner Bluegrass region features hundreds of horse farms The Jackson Purchase and western Pennyrile are home to several bald cypress tupelo swamps The East Kentucky Coal Field is known for its rugged terrain  edit  Climate Located within the southeastern interior portion of North America  Kentucky has a climate that can best be described as a

lake  in volume  east of the Mississippi River  Kentucky s 90 000 miles  140 000 km  of streams provides one of the most expansive and complex stream systems in the nation  Kentucky has both the largest artificial lake east of the Mississippi in water volume  Lake Cumberland  and surface area  Kentucky Lake   It is the only U S  state to be bordered on three sides by rivers the Mississippi River to the west  the Ohio River to the north  and the Big Sandy River and Tug Fork to the east  13  Its major internal rivers include the Kentucky River  Tennessee River  Cumberland River  Green

acres  153 km2  of state forest  and 82 Wildlife Management Areas  Kentucky has been part of two of the most successful wildlife reintroduction projects in United States history  In the winter of 1997  the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources began to re stock elk in the state s eastern counties  which had been extinct from the area for over 150 years  As of 2009  the herd had reached the project goal of 10 000 animals  making it the largest herd east of the Mississippi River  16  The state also stocked wild turkeys in the 1950s  Once extinct here  more wild turkeys thrive in Kentucky today than in any other eastern state  Hunters telechecked a record 29 006 birds taken during the 23 day season in Spring 2009  17   edit  Significant natural attractions Red River Gorge is

Main article  History of Kentucky See also  Kentucky in the American Civil War  Kentucky Historical Society  and Hatfield McCoy feud What is now the state was inhabited by varying cultures of Native Americans from at least 1000 BC to about 1650 AD  particularly along the waterways and in areas of game  Bison roamed in the region  By the time that European and colonial explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in greater number in the mid 18th century  there were no major Native American settlements in the region  The Iroquois had controlled much of the Ohio River valley for hunting from their bases in what is now New York  The Shawnee from the northwest and Cherokee from the south also sent parties into the area regularly for hunting  As more settlers entered the area  warfare broke out because the American Indians considered the settlers to be encroaching on their traditional hunting grounds  23  Today the Southern Cherokee Nation of Kentucky is a state recognized tribe  According to a 1790 U S  government report  1 500 Kentucky settlers had been killed in Indian raids since the end of the Revolutionary War  24  In an attempt to end such raids into the state  Clark led an expedition of 1 200 drafted men against Shawnee towns on the Wabash River in 1786  one of the first actions of the Northwest Indian War  25  After the American Revolution  the counties of Virginia beyond the Appalachian Mountains became known as Kentucky County  26  Eventually  the residents of Kentucky County petitioned for a separation from Virginia  Ten constitutional conventions were held in the Constitution Square Courthouse in Danville between 1784 and 1792  In 1790  Kentucky s delegates accepted Virginia s terms of separation  and a state constitution was drafted at the final convention in April 1792  On June 1  1792  Kentucky became the fifteenth state to be admitted to the union  Isaac Shelby  a military veteran from Virginia  was elected the first Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky  27  Central Kentucky  the Bluegrass region  was the center of the greatest slaveholding  as planters cultivated tobacco and hemp  and also were noted for their quality livestock  During the nineteenth century  Kentucky slaveholders began to sell surplus slaves to the Deep South  with Louisville becoming a major slave market and departure port for slaves being transported downriver  It was one of the border states during the American Civil War  28  Although frequently described as never having seceded  representatives from several counties met at Russellville calling themselves the  Convention of the People of Kentucky  and passed an Ordinance of Secession on November 20  1861  29  They established a Confederate government of Kentucky with its capital in Bowling Green  30  Though Kentucky was represented by the central star on the Confederate battle flag  31  the Russellville Convention did not represent the majority of residents  Kentucky officially remained  neutral  throughout the war due to Union sympathies of many of the Commonwealth s citizens  In a revival of the  Lost Cause  that has exceeded the support it gained during the war  some contemporary people observe Confederate Memorial Day on Confederate President Jefferson Davis  birthday  June 3 and participate in Confederate re enactments  32  33  Designed by the Washington Monument s architect Robert Mills in 1845  the U S  Marine Hospital in Louisville is considered the best remaining antebellum hospital in the United States The Black Patch Tobacco Wars  a vigilante action  occurred in the area in the early 20th century  As result of the tobacco industry monopoly  tobacco farmers in the area were forced to sell their tobacco at low prices  Many local farmers and activists united to refuse to sell tobacco to the tobacco industry  A vigilante wing  the  Night Riders   terrorized farmers who sold their tobacco at the low prices demanded by the tobacco corporations  They burned several tobacco warehouses  notably in Hopkinsville and Princeton  In the later period of their operation  they were known to physically assault farmers who broke the boycott  The Governor declared martial law and deployed the Kentucky Militia to end the Black Patch Tobacco Wars  On January 30  1900  Governor William Goebel  flanked by two bodyguards and walking to the State Capitol in downtown Frankfort  was mortally wounded by an assassin  Goebel was contesting the election of 1899  which William S  Taylor was initially believed to have won  For several months  J  C  W  Beckham  Goebel s running mate  and Taylor fought over who was the legal governor  until the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in May in favor of Beckham  After fleeing to Indiana  Taylor was indicted as a co conspirator in Goebel s assassination  Goebel is the only governor of a U S  state to have been assassinated while in office  34   edit  Law and government Kentucky is one of four U S  states to officially use the term commonwealth  which it inherited from Virginia  Kentucky is also one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd numbered years  the others are Louisiana  Mississippi  New Jersey  and Virginia   Kentucky holds elections for these offices every 4 years in the years preceding Presidential election years  Thus  the last year when Kentucky elected a Governor was 2011  the next gubernatorial election will occur in 2015  with future gubernatorial elections to take place in 2019  2023  2027  etc  See also  List of Governors of Kentucky

Statutes  KRS   were enacted in 1942 to better organize and clarify the whole of Kentucky law  35  The statutes are enforced by local police  sheriffs and deputy sheriffs  and constables and deputy constables  Unless they have completed a police academy elsewhere  these officers are required to complete training at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training Center on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University  36  Additionally  in 1948  the Kentucky General Assembly established the Kentucky State Police  making it the 38th state to create a force whose jurisdiction extends throughout the given state  37  Kentucky is one of 36 states in the United States that sanctions the death penalty for certain crimes  Those convicted of capital crimes after March 31  1998 are always executed by lethal injection  those convicted before this date may opt for the electric chair  38  Only three people have been executed in Kentucky since the U S  Supreme Court re instituted the practice in 1976  The most notable execution in Kentucky  however  was that of Rainey Bethea on August 14  1936  Bethea was publicly hanged in Owensboro for the rape and murder of Lischia Edwards  39  Irregularities with the execution led to this becoming the last public execution in the United States  40  Kentucky has been on the front lines of the debate over displaying the Ten Commandments on public property  In the 2005 case of McCreary County v  ACLU of Kentucky  the U S  Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that a display of the Ten Commandments in the Whitley City courthouse of McCreary County was unconstitutional  41  Later that year  Judge Richard Fred Suhrheinrich  writing for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of ACLU of Kentucky v  Mercer County  wrote that a display including the Mayflower Compact  the Declaration of Independence  the Ten Commandments  the Magna Carta  The Star Spangled Banner  and the national motto could be erected in the Mercer County courthouse  42  Kentucky has also been known to have unusually high political candidacy age laws  especially compared to surrounding states  The origin of this is unknown  but it has been suggested it has to do with the commonwealth tradition   edit  Politics This section requires expansion  Further information  Political party strength in Kentucky Presidential

slightly toward the Democratic Party  although it was never included among the  Solid South   In 2006  57 05  of the state s voters were officially registered as Democrats  36 55  registered Republican  and 6 39  registered with some other political party  44  Despite this  the state often supports Republican candidates for federal offices  From 1964 through 2004  Kentucky voted for the eventual winner of the election for President of the United States  In the 2008 election  however  the state lost its bellwether status when John McCain  who won Kentucky  lost the national popular and electoral vote to Barack Obama  McCain carried Kentucky 57 to 41    The Commonwealth supported the previous three Democratic candidates elected to the White House  all elected from Southern states  Lyndon B  Johnson  Texas  in 1964  Jimmy Carter  Georgia  in 1976  and Bill Clinton  Arkansas  in 1992 and 1996  In presidential elections  the state has become a Republican stronghold  supporting that party s presidential candidates by double digit margins in 2000  2004 and 2008  At the state level and in most local areas  the Democratic Party is the dominant party  citation needed  Voter
