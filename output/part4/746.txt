of Flight In March 1910 William E  Boeing bought Heath s shipyard in Seattle  Washington  on the Duwamish River  which later became his first airplane factory  5  Boeing was incorporated in Seattle by William Boeing  on July 15  1916  as  Pacific Aero Products Co    Boeing  who studied at Yale University  worked initially in the timber industry  where he became wealthy and acquired knowledge about wooden structures  This knowledge would prove invaluable in his subsequent design and assembly of airplanes  The company stayed in Seattle to take advantage of the local supply of Spruce wood  6  William Boeing founded his company a few months after the June 15 maiden flight of one of the two  B amp W  seaplanes built with the assistance of George Conrad Westervelt  a U S  Navy engineer  Boeing and Westervelt decided to build the B amp W seaplane after having flown in a Curtiss  Boeing bought a Glenn Martin  Flying Birdcage  pontoon airplane  So called because of all the guywires holding it together  and was taught to fly by Glenn Martin himself  Boeing soon crashed the Birdcage  When Martin informed Boeing that replacement parts would not become available for months  hot tempered Boeing blew up  He angrily told his friend Cdr  G C  Westervelt that they could build a better airplane and build it faster  Westervelt agreed  They soon produced the B amp W Flying Boat  7  Many of Boeing s early planes were seaplanes  The first Boeing airplane  the B amp W Model 1 float plane  was assembled in a lakeside hangar located on the northeast shore of Seattle s Lake Union  On May 9  1917  the company became the  Boeing Airplane Company   In late 1917  the US entered World War I and Boeing knew that the US Navy needed seaplanes for training  So Boeing shipped two new Model Cs to Pensacola  Florida where the planes were flown for the Navy  The Navy liked the Model C so much that they ordered fifty more  8  The Boeing Company moved its operations to a larger former shipbuilding facility known as Boeing Plant 1  located on the Lower Duwamish Waterway  Boeing s original logo When World War I ended in 1918  a large surplus of cheap  used military planes flooded the commercial airplane market  and this prevented aircraft companies like Boeing from selling any new airplanes  Because of this  many airplane companies went out of business  but other companies  including Boeing  started selling other products  Boeing built dressers  counters  and furniture  along with flat bottom boats called Sea Sleds  8  In 1919 the Boeing B 1 made its first flight  It was a flying boat that accommodated one pilot and two passengers and mail  Over the course of eight years  it made international airmail flights from Seattle  Washington to Victoria  British Columbia  9  On May 24  1920  the Boeing Model 8 made its first flight  It was the first plane to fly over Mount Rainier  10  In 1923  Boeing began a competition against Curtiss for a contract to develop a pursuit fighter for the U S  Army Air Service  Although Curtiss finished its design first and was awarded the contract  Boeing continued to develop its PW 9 fighter  That plane  along with the Boeing P 12  F4B fighter  11  made Boeing a leading manufacturer of fighters over the course of the next decade  In 1925  Boeing built its Model 40 mail plane for the US government to use on airmail routes  In 1927  an improved version of this plane was built  the Model 40A  The 40A won the U S  Post Office s contract to deliver mail between San Francisco and Chicago  The 40A also had a passenger cabin that accommodated two passengers  12  That same year  Boeing created an airline named Boeing Air Transport  which merged a year later with Pacific Air Transport and the Boeing Airplane Company  The first airmail flight for the airline was on July 1  1927  12  The company changed its name to United Aircraft and Transport Corporation in 1929 and acquired Pratt  amp  Whitney  Hamilton Standard Propeller Company  and Chance Vought  United Aircraft then purchased National Air Transport in 1930  On July 27  1929  the 12 passenger Boeing 80 biplane made its first flight  With three engines  it was Boeing s first plane built with the sole intention of being a passenger transport  An upgraded version  the 80A  carrying eighteen passengers  made its first flight in September 1929  12   edit  1930s and 1940s In 1930  the Monomail  a low wing monoplane that carried mail  was built  Built entirely out of metal  it was very fast and aerodynamic  and it also had retractable landing gear  In fact  its design was so revolutionary that the engines and propellers of the time could not handle the plane  By the time controllable pitch propellers were developed  Boeing was building its Model 247 airliner  Two Monomails were built  The second one  the Model 221  had a 6 passenger cabin  13  14  In 1933 the revolutionary Boeing 247 was introduced  the first truly modern airliner  The 247 was an all metal low wing monoplane that was much faster  safer  and easier to fly than other passenger aircraft  For example  it was the first twin engine passenger aircraft that could fly on one engine  In an era of unreliable engines  this vastly improved flight safety  Boeing built the first sixty aircraft exclusively for its own United Airlines subsidiary s operations  This badly hurt competing airlines  and was typical of the anti competitive corporate behavior that the US government sought to prohibit at the time  The Air Mail Act of 1934 prohibited airlines and manufacturers from being under the same corporate umbrella  so the company split into three smaller companies   Boeing Airplane Company  United Airlines  and United Aircraft Corporation  the precursor to United Technologies  As a result  William Boeing sold off his shares and left Boeing  Claire Egtvedt  who had become Boeing s president in 1933  became the chairman as well  He believed the company s future was in building bigger planes  15  Work began in 1936 on Boeing Plant 2 to accommodate the production of larger modern aircraft  Shortly after  an agreement with Pan American World Airways  Pan Am  was reached  to develop and build a commercial flying boat able to carry passengers on transoceanic routes  The first flight of the Boeing 314 Clipper was in June 1938  It was the largest civil aircraft of its time  with a capacity of 90 passengers on day flights  and of 40 passengers on night flights  One year later  the first regular passenger service from the US to the UK was inaugurated  Subsequently other routes were opened  so that soon Pan Am flew with the Boeing 314 to destinations all over the world  In 1938  Boeing completed work on its Model 307 Stratoliner  This was the world s first pressurized cabin transport aircraft  and it was capable of cruising at an altitude of 20 000 feet  6 100 m    above most weather disturbances  Boeing 377 Stratocruiser During World War II  Boeing built a large number of B 17 and B 29 bombers  Many of the workers were women whose husbands had gone to war  In the beginning of March 1944  production had been scaled up in such a manner that over 350 planes were built each month  To prevent an attack from the air  the manufacturing plants had been covered with greenery and farmland items  During these years of war the leading aircraft companies of the US cooperated  The Boeing designed B 17 bomber was assembled also by Lockheed Aircraft Corp  and Douglas Aircraft Co   while the B 29 was assembled also by Bell Aircraft Co  and by Glenn L  Martin Company  After the war  most orders of bombers were canceled and 70 000 people lost their jobs at Boeing  The company aimed to recover quickly by selling its Stratocruiser  the Model 377   a luxurious four engine commercial airliner developed from the B 29  However  sales of this model were not as expected and Boeing had to seek other opportunities to overcome the situation  The company successfully sold military derivatives of the Stratocruiser  such as the C 97 adapted for troop transportation and the KC 97 for aerial refueling   edit  1950s The Boeing 707  1964 Boeing developed military jets such as the B 47 Stratojet and B 52 Stratofortress bombers in the late 1940s and into the 1950s  During the early 1950s  Boeing used company funds to develop the 367 80 jet airliner demonstrator that led to the KC 135 Stratotanker and Boeing 707 jetliner  In the mid 1950s technology had advanced significantly  which gave Boeing the opportunity to develop and manufacture new products  One of the first was the guided short range missile used to intercept enemy aircraft  By that time the Cold War had become a fact of life  and Boeing used its short range missile technology to develop and build an intercontinental missile  In 1958  Boeing began delivery of its 707  the United States  first commercial jet airliner  in response to the British De Havilland Comet  French Sud Aviation Caravelle and Soviet Tupolev Tu 104  which were the world s first generation of commercial jet aircraft  With the 707  a four engine  156 passenger airliner  the US became a leader in commercial jet manufacture  A few years later  Boeing added a second version of this aircraft  the 720  which was slightly faster and had a shorter range  Boeing was a major producer of small turbine engines during the 1950s and 1960s  The engines represented one of the company s major efforts to expand its product base beyond military aircraft after World War II  Development on the gasoline turbine engine started in 1943 and Boeing s gas turbines were designated models 502  520  540  551 and 553  Boeing built 2 461 engines before production ceased in April 1968  Many applications of the Boeing gas turbine engines were considered to be firsts  including the first turbine powered helicopter and boat  16   edit  1960s The 707 and 747 formed the backbone of many major airline fleets through the end of the 1970s  Vertol Aircraft Corporation was acquired by Boeing in 1960  17  and was reorganized as Boeing s Vertol division  The twin rotor CH 47 Chinook  produced by Vertol  took its first flight in 1961  This heavy lift helicopter remains a work horse vehicle up to the present day  In 1964  Vertol also began production of the CH 46 Sea Knight  In December 1960  Boeing announced the model 727 jetliner  which went into commercial service about three years later  Different passenger  freight and convertible freighter variants were developed for the 727  The 727 was the first commercial jetliner to reach 1000 sales  and a few years later the 1500 mark was reached  Boeing won a contract in 1961 to manufacture the S IC stage of the Saturn V rocket  manufactured at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans  Louisiana  Boeing Everett Factory in 2011 In 1966  Boeing president William M  Allen asked Malcolm T  Stamper to spearhead production of the new 747 airplane on which the company s future was riding  This was a monumental engineering and management challenge  and included construction of the world s biggest factory in which to build the 747 at Everett  Washington  a plant which is the size of 40 football fields  18  In 1967  Boeing introduced another short  and medium range airliner  the twin engine 737  It has become since then the best selling commercial jet aircraft in aviation history  The 737 is still being produced  and continuous improvements are made  Several versions have been developed  mainly to increase seating capacity and range  The roll out ceremonies for the first 747 100 took place in 1968  at the massive new factory in Everett  about an hour s drive from Boeing s Seattle home  The aircraft made its first flight a year later  The first commercial flight occurred in 1970  The 747 has an intercontinental range and a larger seating capacity than Boeing s previous aircraft  Boeing also developed hydrofoils in the 1960s  The screw driven USS High Point  PCH 1  was an experimental submarine hunter  The patrol hydrofoil USS Tucumcari  PGH 2  was more successful  Only one was built  but it saw service in Vietnam and Europe before running aground in 1972  Its innovative waterjet citation needed  and fully submersed flying foils were the model for the later Pegasus class patrol hydrofoils and the model 929 Jetfoil ferries in the 1980s  The Tucumcari and later boats were produced in Renton  While the Navy hydrofoils were withdrawn by the end of the 1980s  the swift and smooth Boeing Jetfoils are still in service in Asia  TurboJET 929 100  Jetfoil   edit  1970s In the beginning of the 1970s  Boeing faced a new crisis  The Apollo program  in which Boeing had participated significantly during the preceding decade  was almost entirely canceled  Once more  Boeing hoped to compensate with sales of its commercial airliners  At that time  however  there was a heavy recession in the airlines industry so that Boeing did not receive any orders for more than a year  Boeing s bet for the future  the new 747  was delayed in production by three months because of problems with its Pratt  amp  Whitney engines  Another problem was that in 1971  the U S  Congress decided to stop the financial support for the development of the supersonic 2707  Boeing s answer to the British French Concorde  forcing the company to discontinue the project  The company had to reduce the number of employees from over 80 000 to almost half  only in the Seattle area  In January 1970  the first 747  a four engine long range airliner  flew its first commercial flight  This famous aircraft completely changed the way of flying  with its 450 passenger seating capacity and its upper deck  Boeing has delivered nearly 1 400 747s  The 747 has undergone continuous improvements to keep it technologically up to date  Larger versions have also been developed by stretching the upper deck  As of 2010  the 747 is still being produced  with its newest version being the 747 8  Boeing launched three Jetfoil 929 100 hydrofoils that were acquired in 1975 for service in the Hawaiian Islands  When the service ended in 1979 the three hydrofoils were acquired by Far East Hydrofoil for service between Hong Kong and Macau  19  During the 1970s  Boeing also developed the US Standard Light Rail Vehicle which was used in San Francisco  Boston and Morgantown  WV   edit  1980s The narrow body Boeing 757 replaced the 707 and 727 In 1983  the economic situation began to improve  Boeing assembled its 1 000th 737 passenger airliner  During the following years  commercial aircraft and their military versions became the basic equipment of airlines and air forces  As passenger air traffic increased  competition was harder  mainly from Airbus  a European newcomer in commercial airliner manufacturing  Boeing had to offer new aircraft  and developed the single aisle 757  the larger  twin aisle 767  and upgraded versions of the 737  An important project of these years was the Space Shuttle  to which Boeing contributed with its experience in space rockets acquired during the Apollo era  Boeing participated also with other products in the space program  and was the first contractor for the International Space Station program  During the decade several military projects went into production  including Boeing support of the stealth B 2 bomber  As part of an industry team led by Northrop  Boeing built the outboard portion of the B 2 stealth bomber wing  the aft center fuselage section  landing gears  fuel system and weapons delivery system  At its peak in 1991  the B 2 was the largest military program at Boeing  employing about 10 000 people  The same year  the National Aeronautic Association of the USA awarded the B 2 design team the Collier Trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in America  The first B 2 rolled out of the bomber s final assembly facility in Palmdale  Calif   in November 1988 and it flew for the first time on July 17  1989  20  The Avenger air defense system and a new generation of short range missiles also went into production  During these years  Boeing was very active in upgrading existing military equipment and developing new ones  Boeing also contributed to wind power development with the experimental MOD 2 Wind Turbines for NASA and US DOE  and the MOD 5B for Hawaii  21   edit  1990s Air France 777 300ER Boeing was one of seven competing companies  that bid for the Advanced Tactical Fighter  Boeing agreed to team with General Dynamics and Lockheed  so that all three companies would participate in the development if one of the three companies design was selected  The Lockheed design was eventually selected and developed into the F 22 Raptor  22  In April 1994  Boeing introduced the most modern commercial jet aircraft at the time  the twin engine 777  with a seating capacity of approximately 300 to 370 passengers in a typical three class layout  in between the 767 and the 747  The longest range twin engined aircraft in the world  the 777 was the first Boeing airliner to feature a  fly by wire  system and was conceived partly in response to the inroads being made by the European Airbus into Boeing s traditional market  This aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using CAD techniques  23  The 777 was also the first airplane to be certified for 180 minute ETOPS at entry into service by the FAA  24  Also in the mid 1990s  the company developed the revamped version of the 737  known as the 737  Next Generation   or 737NG  It has since become the fastest selling version of the 737 in history  and on April 20  2006 sales passed those of the  Classic 737   with a follow up order for 79 aircraft from Southwest Airlines  In 1995 Boeing announced that the headquarters complex on East Marginal Way South would be demolished instead of being upgraded to match new seismic standards  Boeing scheduled demolition of the facility in 1996 and moved the headquarters to an adjacent building  25  In 1997 Boeing s headquarter was located on East Marginal Way South  by King County Airport  in Seattle  26  In 1996  Boeing acquired Rockwell s aerospace and defense units  The Rockwell business units became a subsidiary of Boeing  named Boeing North American  Inc  In August 1997  Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas in a US 13 billion stock swap under the name The Boeing Company  However this name had actually been Boeing s official name previously adapted on May 21  1961  27  Following the merger  the McDonnell Douglas MD 95 was renamed the Boeing 717  and the production of the MD 11 was limited to the freighter version  Boeing introduced a new corporate identity with completion of the merger  incorporating the Boeing logo type and a stylized version of the McDonnell Douglas symbol  which was derived from the Douglas Aircraft logo from the 1970s  Scott Hamilton heavily criticized the CEO and his deputy  Philip M  Condit and Harry Stonecipher  for thinking of their personal benefit first  and with it causing the problems hitting Boeing many years later  Instead of investing the huge cash reserve to build new airplanes  they initiated a program to buy back own stock for more than US 10 billion  28  importance    edit  2000s Boeing s headquarters in Chicago  Formerly the headquarters of Morton Salt International Space Station In September 2001  Boeing moved its corporate headquarters from Seattle to Chicago  Chicago  Dallas and Denver   vying to become the new home of the world s largest aerospace concern   all had offered packages of multimillion dollar tax breaks  29  Its offices are located in the Fulton River District  Chicago just outside the Loop  Chicago  2  On October 10  2001  Boeing lost to its rival Lockheed Martin in the fierce competition for the multi billion dollar Joint Strike Fighter contract  Boeing s entry  the X 32  was rejected in favor of Lockheed s X 35 entrant  Boeing continues to serve as the prime contractor on the International Space Station and has built several of the major components  After several decades of success  Boeing lost ground to Airbus and subsequently lost its lead in the airliner market in 2003  Multiple Boeing projects were pursued and then canceled  notably the Sonic Cruiser  a proposed jetliner that would travel just under the speed of sound  cutting intercontinental travel times by as much as 20 percent  It was launched in 2001 along with a new advertising campaign to promote the company s new motto   Forever New Frontiers   and to rehabilitate its image  However  the plane s fate was sealed by the changes in the commercial aviation market following the September 11 attacks and the subsequent weak economy and increase in fuel prices  Subsequently  Boeing streamlined production and turned its attention to a new model  the Boeing 787 Dreamliner  using much of the technology developed for the Sonic Cruiser  but in a more conventional aircraft designed for maximum efficiency  The company also launched new variants of its successful 737 and 777 models  The 787 proved to be highly popular choice with airlines  and won a record number of pre launch orders  With delays to Airbus  A380 program several airlines threatened to switch their A380 orders to Boeing s new 747 version  the 747 8  30  Airbus s response to the 787  the Airbus A350  received a lukewarm response at first when it was announced as an improved version of the A330  and then gained significant orders when Airbus promised an entirely new design  The 787 has encountered delays in coming to production  with the first flight not occurring until late 2009  more than two years late  Production will be increased to 10 Boeing 787s per month by 2013  31  In 2004  Boeing ended production of the 757 after 1 050 were produced  More advanced  stretched versions of the 737 were beginning to compete against the 757  and the new 787 3 filled much of the top end of the 757 market  Also that year  Boeing announced that the 717  the last civil aircraft to be designed by McDonnell Douglas  would cease production in 2006  The 767 was in danger of cancellation as well  with the 787 replacing it  but orders for the freighter version extended the program  In May 2005  Boeing announced its intent to form a joint venture  United Launch Alliance with its competitor Lockheed Martin  The new venture will be the largest provider of rocket launch services to the US government  The joint venture gained regulatory approval and completed the formation on December 1  2006  32  On August 2  2005  Boeing sold its Rocketdyne rocket engine division to Pratt  amp  Whitney  On May 1  2006  Boeing announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to purchase Dallas  Texas based Aviall  Inc  for  1 7 billion and retain  350 million in debt  Aviall  Inc  and its subsidiaries  Aviall Services  Inc  and ILS formed a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing Commercial Aviation Services  BCAS   33  On August 18  2007  NASA announced that Boeing would be the manufacturing contractor for the liquid fueled upper stage of the Ares I rocket  The stage  based on both Apollo Saturn and Space Shuttle technologies  will be constructed at NASA s Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans  the same site where Boeing constructed the massive S IC stage of the Saturn V rocket in the 1960s   edit  Unethical conduct In May 2003  the US Air Force announced it would lease 100 KC 767 tankers to replace the oldest 136 of its KC 135s  In November 2003  responding to critics who argued that the lease was more expensive than an outright purchase  the DoD announced a revised lease of 20 aircraft and purchase of 80  In December 2003  the Pentagon announced the project was to be frozen while an investigation of allegations of corruption by one of its former procurement staffers  Darleen Druyun  who began employment at Boeing in January  was begun  The fallout of this resulted in the resignation of Boeing CEO Philip M  Condit and the termination of CFO Michael M  Sears  34 Harry Stonecipher  former McDonnell Douglas CEO and Boeing COO  replaced Condit on an interim basis  Druyun pleaded guilty to inflating the price of the contract to favor her future employer and to passing information on the competing Airbus A330 MRTT bid  In October 2004  she was sentenced to nine months in jail for corruption  fined  given three years of supervised release and 150 hours of community service  In March 2005  the Boeing board forced President and CEO Harry Stonecipher to resign  Boeing said an internal investigation revealed a  consensual  relationship between Stonecipher and a female executive that was  inconsistent with Boeing s Code of Conduct  and  would impair his ability to lead the company   35 James A  Bell served as interim CEO  in addition to his normal duties as Boeing s CFO  until the appointment of Jim McNerney as the new Chairman  President  and CEO on June 30  2005   edit  Industrial espionage In June 2003  Lockheed Martin sued Boeing  alleging that the company had resorted to industrial espionage in 1998 to win the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle  EELV  competition  Lockheed claimed that the former employee Kenneth Branch  who went to work for McDonnell Douglas and Boeing  passed 25 000 proprietary documents to his new employers  Lockheed argued that these documents allowed Boeing to win 21 of the 28 tendered military satellite launches  In July 2003  Boeing was penalized  with the Pentagon stripping  1 billion worth of contracts away from the company and awarding them to Lockheed Martin  Furthermore  the company was forbidden to bid for rocket contracts for a twenty month period  which expired in March 2005  In early September 2005  it was reported that Boeing was negotiating a settlement with the U S  Department of Justice in which it would pay up to  500 million to cover this and the Darleen Druyun scandal  36   edit  The 92 EU US Agreement notes Until the late 1970s the US had an almost de facto monopoly in the Large Civil Aircraft  LCA  sector  The Airbus consortium  created in 1969  started competing effectively in the 1980s  At that stage the US became concerned about the European competition and the alleged subsidies paid by the European governments for the developments of the early models of the Airbus family  This became a major issue of contention  as the European side was equally concerned by subsidies accruing to US LCA manufacturers through NASA and Defense programs  The EU and the US started bilateral negotiations for the limitation of government subsidies to the LCA sector in the late 1980s  Negotiations were concluded in 1992 with the signature of the EC US Agreement on Trade in Large Civil Aircraft which imposes disciplines on government support on both sides of the Atlantic which are significantly stricter than the relevant WTO rules  Notably  the Agreement regulates in detail the forms and limits of government support  prescribes transparency obligations and commits the parties to avoiding trade disputes  37   edit  Subsidy disputes In 2004 the EU and the US agreed to discuss a possible revision of the 1992 EU US Agreement provided that this would cover all forms of subsidies including those used in the US  and in particular the subsidies for the Boeing 787  the first new aircraft to be launched by Boeing for 14 years  October 2004  the US began legal proceedings at the World Trade Organization by requesting WTO consultations on European launch investment to Airbus  The US also unilaterally withdrew from the 1992 EU US Agreement  38  In October 2004  Boeing filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization  WTO   claiming that Airbus had violated a 1992 bilateral accord when it received what Boeing deems as  unfair  subsidies from several European governments  Airbus retaliated by filing another complaint  contesting that Boeing had also violated the accord when it received tax breaks from the U S  Government  Moreover  the E U  also complained that the investment subsidies from Japanese airlines violated the accord  On January 11  2005  Boeing and Airbus agreed that they would attempt to find a solution to the dispute outside of the WTO  However  in June 2005  Boeing and the United States government reopened the trade dispute with the WTO  claiming that Airbus had received illegal subsidies from European governments  Airbus has also retaliated against Boeing  reopening the dispute and also accusing Boeing of receiving subsidies from the US government  39  On September 15  2010  the World Trade Organization ruled that Boeing had received billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies  40  Boeing responded that the ruling was a fraction of the size of the ruling against Airbus and would require few changes in its operations  41   edit  2010s Boeing s Wichita plant  Boeing has a large work force Wichita  Kansas  On November 17  2011  it was reported that Lion Air has committed to ordering 201 Boeing 737MAX and 29 737 900ER airliners  This order  when finalized is worth  21 7 billion at list prices  This would be larger than any of Boeing s previous commercial aircraft sales  The deal includes options for a further 150 airliners  42  43  On January 5  2012 Boeing announced plans to close its facilities in Wichita  Kansas with 2 160 workers before 2014  more than 80 years after it was established  Boeing had employed as many as 40 000 people there  44  45   edit  Recent product development  edit  Commercial airplanes The Boeing 787 Dreamliner on its first flight Boeing has achieved several consecutive launches  beginning with the formal launch of the 787 for delivery to All Nippon Airways and Air New Zealand  Rollout of the first 787 occurred on July 8  2007  with the first flight taking place on December 15  2009  Boeing also received the launch contract from the US Navy for the P 8 Poseidon Multimission Maritime Aircraft  an anti submarine warfare patrol aircraft  It has also received some orders for the 737 AEW amp C  Wedgetail  aircraft  Boeing launched the 777 Freighter in May 2005 with an order from Air France  The freighter variant is based on the  200LR  Other customers include FedEx  Emirates Airline  and Air Atlanta Icelandic  Boeing has achieved above projected orders for its 787 Dreamliner  outselling the rival Airbus A350  Boeing officially announced in November 2005 that it would produce a larger variant of the 747  the 747 8  in two models  commencing with the Freighter model for two cargo carriers with firm orders for the aircraft  The second model  dubbed the Intercontinental  would be produced for passenger airlines that Boeing expected would place orders in the near future  Both models of the 747 8 would feature a lengthened fuselage  new  advanced engines and wings  and the incorporation of other technologies developed for the 787  Boeing has also introduced new extended range versions of the 737  These include the 737 700ER and 737 900ER  The 737 900ER is the latest and will extend the range of the 737 900 to a similar range as the successful 737 800 with the capability to fly more passengers  due to the addition of two extra emergency exits  The record breaking 777 200LR Worldliner  presented at the Paris Air Show 2005  The 777 200LR Worldliner embarked on a well received global demonstration tour in the second half of 2005  showing off its capacity to fly farther than any other commercial aircraft  On November 10  2005  the 777 200LR set a world record for the longest non stop flight  The plane  which departed from Hong Kong traveling to London  took a longer route  which included flying over the U S  It flew 11 664 nautical miles  21 601 km  during its 22 hour 42 minute flight  It was flown by Pakistan International Airlines pilots and PIA was the first airline to fly the 777 200LR Worldliner  On August 11  2006  Boeing announced an agreement to form a joint venture with the large Russian titanium producer  VSMPO Avisma for the machining of titanium forgings  The forgings will be used on 787 program  46  On December 27  2007 Boeing and VSMPO Avisma created a joint venture Ural Boeing Manufacturing and signed a contract on titanium products deliveries until 2015  with Boeing planning to invest  27 billion in Russia over the next 30 years  47   edit  Defense and other Realizing that increasing numbers of passengers have become reliant on their computers to stay in touch  Boeing introduced Connexion by Boeing  a satellite based Internet connectivity service that promised air travelers unprecedented access to the World Wide Web  The company debuted the product to journalists in 2005  receiving generally favorable reviews  However  facing competition from cheaper options  such as cellular networks  it proved too difficult to sell to most airlines  In August 2006  after a short and unsuccessful search for a buyer for the business  Boeing chose to discontinue the service  48  49  Boeing also developed the Boeing KC 767 aerial refueling tanker  Italy ordered four KC 767s in December 2002  with the first one scheduled to be delivered in November 2008  Boeing and Italy are negotiating on the penalty for the late deliveries  Boeing stated the delay is due to such factors as design changes  expanded US flight testing  greater than expected challenges to software integration  and the complexity of getting the tanker ready for certification by the Federal Aviation Administration  50  Boeing s late delivery of a tanker to Japan in 2007 incurred a penalty  well under  5 million  according to Boeing  50  Boeing delivered the third aircraft to Japan in March 2009 and the last aircraft was delivered in January 2010  51  52  In February 2011  Boeing received a contract for 179 KC 46 US Air Force tankers at a value of  35 billion  53  The KC 46 tankers are based on the KC 767  Graphic representation of the XM1202 Mounted Combat System vehicle Boeing jointly with Science Applications International Corporation  SAIC   were the prime contractors in the U S  military s Future Combat Systems program  54  The FCS program was canceled in June 2009 with all remaining systems swept into the BCT Modernization program  55  Boeing works jointly with SAIC in the BCT Modernization program like the FCS program but the U S  Army will play a greater role in creating baseline vehicles and will only contract others for accessories  Defense Secretary Robert M  Gates  shift in defense spending to  make tough choices about specific systems and defense priorities based solely on the national interest and then stick to those decisions over time  56  hit Boeing especially hard  because of their heavy involvement with canceled Air Force projects  57  In 2010 The Boeing Company completed its acquisition of Argon ST Inc  Argon ST  based in Fairfax  Va   develops C4ISR  Command  Control  Communications  Computers  Intelligence  Surveillance  and Reconnaissance  and combat systems  Boeing on June 30  2010 announced its intent to acquire Argon ST as part of the company s strategy to expand its capabilities to address the C4ISR  cyber and intelligence markets  58   edit  Future concepts In May 2006  four concept designs being examined by Boeing were outlined in The Seattle Times based on corporate internal documents  59  The research aims in two directions  low cost airplanes  and environmental friendly planes  Codenamed after the well known Muppets a design team known as the Green Team concentrated primarily on reducing fuel usage  All four designs illustrated rear engine layouts   Fozzie  employs open rotors and would offer a lower cruising speed   Beaker  has very thin  long wings  with the ability to partially fold up to facilitate easier taxiing   Kermit Kruiser  has forward swept wings over which are positioned its engines  with the aim of lowering noise below due to the reflection of the exhaust signature upward   Honeydew  with its delta wing design  resembles a marriage of the flying wing concept and the traditional tube fuselage  As with most concepts  these designs are only in the exploratory stage intended to help Boeing evaluate the potentials of such radical technologies  59   edit  Environment  edit  Environmental record Researchers at the University of Massachusetts had listed Boeing as the thirteenth largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States based on 2002 data  60  although data from 2008 shows that they have dropped off the list  61  According to the Center for Public Integrity  the United States Environmental Protection Agency has linked Boeing to more than twenty Superfund toxic waste sites  62  In 2006  the UCLA Center for Environmental Risk Reduction released a study showing that Boeing s Santa Susana Field Laboratory  in the Simi Hills of eastern Ventura County in Southern California  had been contaminated with toxic and radioactive waste  The study found that air  soil  groundwater  and surface water at the site all contained radionuclides  toxic metals  and dioxins  air and water additionally contained perchlorate  TCE  and hydrazines  while water showed the presence of PCBs as well  63  Clean up studies and lawsuits are in progress  64  65   edit  Jet biofuels Main articles  Aviation biofuel and Algae fuel The airline industry is responsible for about 11 percent of greenhouse gases emitted by the U S  transportation sector  66  Aviation s share of the greenhouse gas emissions is poised to grow  as air travel increases and ground vehicles use more alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel  66  Boeing estimates that biofuels could reduce flight related greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent  66  The solution would be blending algae fuels with existing jet fuel  66  Boeing executives said the company is informally collaborating with leading Brazilian biofuels maker Tecbio  Aquaflow Bionomic of New Zealand and other fuel developers around the world  So far  Boeing has tested six fuels from these companies  and will probably have gone through 20 fuels  by the time we re done evaluating them   66  Boeing is joining other aviation related members in the Algal Biomass Organization  ABO   67  Air New Zealand and Boeing are researching the jatropha plant to see if it is a sustainable alternative to conventional fuel  68  A two hour test flight using a 50 50 mixture of the new biofuel with Jet A 1 in the number one position Rolls Royce RB 211 engine of 747 400 ZK NBS  was successfully completed on December 30  2008  The engine was then removed to be scrutinised and studied to identify any differences between the Jatropha blend and regular Jet A1  No effects to performances were found  On August 31  2010  Boeing worked with the United States Air Force to test the Boeing C 17 running on 50  JP 8  25  Hydro treated Renewable Jet fuel and 25  of a Fischer Tropsch fuel with successful results  69   edit  Electric propulsion Boeing has stated that for the subsonic concept  hybrid electric engine technology is a clear winner  Hybrid electric propulsion has the potential to shorten takeoff distance and reduce noise  70   edit  Political contributions  federal contracts  advocacy In both 2009 and 2008 Boeing was second on the list of Top 100 US Federal Contractors  with contracts totalling  22 billion and  23 billion respectively  71  72  Since 1995  the company has agreed to pay  1 6 billion to settle 39 instances of misconduct  including  615 million in 2006 in relation to illegal hiring of government officials and improper use of proprietary information  73  74  Boeing s 2010 lobbying expenditure by the third quarter was  13 2 million  2009 total   16 9 million   75  76  In the 2008 presidential election  Barack Obama  was by far the biggest recipient of campaign contributions from Boeing employees and executives  hauling in  197 000   five times as much as John McCain  and more than the top eight Republicans combined   77  The company is a member of the U S  Global Leadership Coalition  a Washington D C  based coalition of over 400 major companies and NGOs that advocates for a larger International Affairs Budget  which funds American diplomatic and development efforts abroad  78  A series of cables show how US diplomats and senior politicians intervene on behalf of Boeing to help boost the company s sales  79  In 2007 and 2008 the company benefited from over  10 billion of long term loan guarantees  helping finance the purchase of their commercial aircraft in countries including Brazil  Canada  Ireland and the United Arab Emirates  from the Export Import Bank of the United States  some 65  of the total loan guarantees the bank made in the period  80  In December 2011  the non partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Boeing for spending  52 29 million on lobbying and not paying taxes during 2008 2010  instead getting  178 million in tax rebates  despite making a profit of  9 7 billion  laying off 14 862 workers since 2008  and increasing executive pay by 31  to  41 9 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives  81   edit  Divisions The two
