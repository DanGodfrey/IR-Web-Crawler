Tanzania   United Kingdom   United States v t e To tax  from the Latin taxo   I estimate   is to impose a financial charge or other levy upon a taxpayer  an individual or legal entity  by a state or the functional equivalent of a state such that failure to pay is punishable by law  Taxes are also imposed by many subnational entities  Taxes consist of direct tax or indirect tax  and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent  often but not always unpaid labour   A tax may be defined as a  pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property owners to support the government       a payment exacted by legislative authority   1  A tax  is not a voluntary payment or donation  but an enforced contribution  exacted pursuant to legislative authority  and is  any contribution imposed by government       whether under the name of toll  tribute  tallage  gabel  impost  duty  custom  excise  subsidy  aid  supply  or other name   1  Contents 1 Overview 1 1 Tax rates 2 Purposes and

External links  edit  Overview Pieter Brueghel the Younger  The tax collector  1640 The legal definition and the economic definition of taxes differ in that economists do not consider many transfers to governments to be taxes  For example  some transfers to the public sector are comparable to prices  Examples include tuition at public universities and fees for utilities provided by local governments  Governments also obtain resources by creating money  e g   printing bills and minting coins   through voluntary gifts  e g   contributions to public universities and museums   by imposing penalties  e g   traffic fines   by borrowing  and by confiscating wealth  From the view of economists  a tax is a non penal  yet compulsory transfer of resources from the private to the public sector levied on a basis of predetermined criteria and without reference to specific benefit received  In modern taxation systems  taxes are levied in money  but  in kind and corv e taxation are characteristic of traditional or pre capitalist states and their functional equivalents  The method of taxation and the government expenditure of taxes raised is often highly debated in politics and economics  Tax collection is performed by a government agency such as Canada Revenue Agency  the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  in the United States  or Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs  HMRC  in the United Kingdom  When taxes are not fully paid  civil penalties  such as fines or forfeiture  or criminal penalties  such as incarceration  2  may be imposed on the non paying entity or individual   edit  Tax rates Main article  Tax rate Taxes are most often levied as a percentage  called the tax rate  An important distinction when talking about tax rates is to distinguish between the marginal rate and the effective  average  rate  The effective rate is the total tax paid divided by the total amount the tax is paid on  while the marginal rate is the rate paid on the next dollar of income earned  For example  if income is taxed on a formula of 5  from  0 up to  50 000  10  from  50 000 to  100 000  and 15  over  100 000  a taxpayer with income of  175 000 would pay a total of  18 750 in taxes  Tax calculation  0 05 50 000     0 10 50 000     0 15 75 000    18 750 The  effective rate  would be 10 7   18 750 175 000   0 107 The  marginal rate  would be 15    edit  Purposes and effects Money provided by taxation has been used by states and their functional equivalents throughout history to carry out many functions  Some of these include expenditures on war  the enforcement of law and public order  protection of property  economic infrastructure  roads  legal tender  enforcement of contracts  etc    public works  social engineering  and the operation of government itself  Governments also use taxes to fund welfare and public services  A portion of taxes also go to pay off the state s debt and the interest this debt accumulates  These services can include education systems  health care systems  pensions for the elderly  unemployment benefits  and public transportation  Energy  water and waste management systems are also common public utilities  Colonial and modernizing states have also used cash taxes to draw or force reluctant subsistence producers into cash economies  Governments use different kinds of taxes and vary the tax rates  This is done to distribute the tax burden among individuals or classes of the population involved in taxable activities  such as business  or to redistribute resources between individuals or classes in the population  Historically  the nobility were supported by taxes on the poor  modern social security systems are intended to support the poor  the disabled  or the retired by taxes on those who are still working  In addition  taxes are applied to fund foreign aid and military ventures  to influence the macroeconomic performance of the economy  the government s strategy for doing this is called its fiscal policy  see also tax exemption   or to modify patterns of consumption or employment within an economy  by making some classes of transaction more or less attractive  A nation s tax system is often a reflection of its communal values or and the values of those in power  To create a system of taxation  a nation must make choices regarding the distribution of the tax burden who will pay taxes and how much they will pay and how the taxes collected will be spent  In democratic nations where the public elects those in charge of establishing the tax system  these choices reflect the type of community that the public wishes to create  In countries where the public does not have a significant amount of influence over the system of taxation  that system may be more of a reflection on the values of those in power  All large businesses incur administrative costs in the process of delivering revenue collected from customers to the suppliers of the goods or services being purchased  Taxation is no different  the resource collected from the public through taxation is always greater than the amount which can be used by the government  The difference is called compliance cost  and includes for example the labour cost and other expenses incurred in complying with tax laws and rules  The collection of a tax in order to spend it on a specified purpose  for example collecting a tax on alcohol to pay directly for alcoholism rehabilitation centres  is called hypothecation  This practice is often disliked by finance ministers  since it reduces their freedom of action  Some economic theorists consider the concept to be intellectually dishonest since  in reality  money is fungible  Furthermore  it often happens that taxes or excises initially levied to fund some specific government programs are then later diverted to the government general fund  In some cases  such taxes are collected in fundamentally inefficient ways  for example highway tolls  Some economists  especially neo classical economists  argue that all taxation creates market distortion and results in economic inefficiency  They have therefore sought to identify the kind of tax system that would minimize this distortion  Since governments also resolve commercial disputes  especially in countries with common law  similar arguments are sometimes used to justify a sales tax or value added tax  Others  e g  libertarians  argue that most or all forms of taxes are immoral due to their involuntary  and therefore eventually coercive violent  nature  The most extreme anti tax view is anarcho capitalism  in which the provision of all social services should be voluntarily bought by the person s  using them   edit  Proportional  progressive  regressive  and lump sum An important feature of tax systems is the percentage of the tax burden as it relates to income or consumption  The terms progressive  regressive  and proportional are used to describe the way the rate progresses from low to high  from high to low  or proportionally  The terms describe a distribution effect  which can be applied to any type of tax system  income or consumption  that meets the definition  A progressive tax is a tax imposed so that the effective tax rate increases as the amount to which the rate is applied increases  The opposite of a progressive tax is a regressive tax  where the effective tax rate decreases as the amount to which the rate is applied increases  This effect is commonly produced where means testing is used to withdraw tax allowances or state benefits  In between is a proportional tax  where the effective tax rate is fixed  while the amount to which the rate is applied increases  A lump sum tax is a tax that is a fixed amount  no matter the change in circumstance of the taxed entity  The terms can also be used to apply meaning to the taxation of select consumption  such as a tax on luxury goods and the exemption of basic necessities may be described as having progressive effects as it increases a tax burden on high end consumption and decreases a tax burden on low end consumption  3  4  5   edit  Direct and indirect Main articles  Direct tax and Indirect tax Taxes are sometimes referred to as  direct taxes  or  indirect taxes   The meaning of these terms can vary in different contexts  which can sometimes lead to confusion  An economic definition  by Atkinson  states that     direct taxes may be adjusted to the individual characteristics of the taxpayer  whereas indirect taxes are levied on transactions irrespective of the circumstances of buyer or seller   6  According to this definition  for example  income tax is  direct   and sales tax is  indirect   In law  the terms may have different meanings  In U S  constitutional law  for instance  direct taxes refer to poll taxes and property taxes  which are based on simple existence or ownership  Indirect taxes are imposed on events  rights  privileges  and activities  7  Thus  a tax on the sale of property would be considered an indirect tax  whereas the tax on simply owning the property itself would be a direct tax   edit  Kinds of taxes The Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD  publishes an analysis of tax systems of member countries  As part of such analysis  OECD developed a definition and system of classification of internal taxes  8  generally followed below  In addition  many countries impose taxes  tariffs  on the import of goods   edit  Taxes on income  edit  Income tax Main article  Income tax Many jurisdictions tax the income of individuals and business entities  including corporations  Generally the tax is imposed on net profits from business  net gains  and other income  Computation of income subject to tax may be determined under accounting principles used in the jurisdiction  which may be modified or replaced by tax law principles in the jurisdiction  The incidence of taxation varies by system  and some systems may be viewed as progressive or regressive  Rates of tax may vary or be constant  flat  by income level  Many systems allow individuals certain personal allowances and other nonbusiness reductions to taxable income  Personal income tax is often collected on a pay as you earn basis  with small corrections made soon after the end of the tax year  These corrections take one of two forms  payments to the government  for taxpayers who have not paid enough during the tax year  and tax refunds from the government for those who have overpaid  Income tax systems will often have deductions available that lessen the total tax liability by reducing total taxable income  They may allow losses from one type of income to be counted against another  For example  a loss on the stock market may be deducted against taxes paid on wages  Other tax systems may isolate the loss  such that business losses can only be deducted against business tax by carrying forward the loss to later tax years   edit  Capital gains tax Main article  Capital gains tax Most jurisdictions imposing an income tax treat capital gains as part of income subject to tax  Capital gain is generally gain on sale of capital assets  i e   those assets not held for sale in the ordinary course of business  Capital assets include personal assets in many jurisdictions  Some jurisdictions provide preferential rates of tax or only partial taxation for capital gains  Some jurisdictions impose different rates or levels of capital gains taxation based on the length of time the asset was held   edit  Corporate tax Main article  Corporate tax Corporate tax refers to income  capital  net worth  or other taxes imposed on corporations  Rates of tax and the taxable base for corporations may differ from those for individuals or other taxable persons   edit  Social security contributions Many countries provide publicly funded retirement or health care systems  9  In connection with these systems  the country typically requires employers and or employees to make compulsory payments  10  These payments are often computed by reference to wages or earnings from self employment  Tax rates are generally fixed  but a different rate may be imposed on employers than on employees  11  Some systems provide an upper limit on earnings subject to the tax  A few systems provide that the tax is payable only on wages above a particular amount  Such upper or lower limits may apply for retirement but not health care components of the tax   edit  Taxes on payroll or workforce Unemployment and similar taxes are often imposed on employers based on total payroll  These taxes may be imposed in both the country and sub country levels  12   edit  Taxes on property Recurrent  property taxes  may be imposed on immovable property  real property  and some classes of movable property  In addition  recurrent taxes may be imposed on net wealth of individuals or corporations  13  Many jurisdictions impose estate tax  gift tax or other inheritance taxes on property at death or gift transfer  Some jurisdictions impose taxes on financial or capital transactions   edit  Property tax Main article  Property tax A property tax  or millage tax  is an ad valorem tax levy on the value of property that the owner of the property is required to pay to a government in which the property is situated  Multiple jurisdictions may tax the same property  There are three general varieties of property  land  improvements to land  immovable man made things  e g  buildings  and personal property  movable things   Real estate or realty is the combination of land and improvements to land  Property taxes are usually charged on a recurrent basis  e g   yearly   A common type of property tax is an annual charge on the ownership of real estate  where the tax base is the estimated value of the property  For a period of over 150 years from 1695 a window tax was levied in England  with the result that one can still see listed buildings with windows bricked up in order to save their owners money  A similar tax on hearths existed in France and elsewhere  with similar results  The two most common type of event driven property taxes are stamp duty  charged upon change of ownership  and inheritance tax  which is imposed in many countries on the estates of the deceased  In contrast with a tax on real estate  land and buildings   a land value tax is levied only on the unimproved value of the land   land  in this instance may mean either the economic term  i e   all natural resources  or the natural resources associated with specific areas of the Earth s surface   lots  or  land parcels    Proponents of land value tax argue that it is economically justified  as it will not deter production  distort market mechanisms or otherwise create deadweight losses the way other taxes do  14  When real estate is held by a higher government unit or some other entity not subject to taxation by the local government  the taxing authority may receive a payment in lieu of taxes to compensate it for some or all of the foregone tax revenue  In many jurisdictions  including many American states   there is a general tax levied periodically on residents who own personal property  personalty  within the jurisdiction  Vehicle and boat registration fees are subsets of this kind of tax  The tax is often designed with blanket coverage and large exceptions for things like food and clothing  Household goods are often exempt when kept or used within the household  15  Any otherwise non exempt object can lose its exemption if regularly kept outside the household  15  Thus  tax collectors often monitor newspaper articles for stories about wealthy people who have lent art to museums for public display  because the artworks have then become subject to personal property tax  15  If an artwork had to be sent to another state for some touch ups  it may have become subject to personal property tax in that state as well  15   edit  Inheritance tax Main article  Inheritance tax Inheritance tax  estate tax  and death tax or duty are the names given to various taxes which arise on the death of an individual  In United States tax law  there is a distinction between an estate tax and an inheritance tax  the former taxes the personal representatives of the deceased  while the latter taxes the beneficiaries of the estate  However  this distinction does not apply in other jurisdictions  for example  if using this terminology UK inheritance tax would be an estate tax   edit  Expatriation tax Main article  Expatriation tax An Expatriation Tax is a tax on individuals who renounce their citizenship or residence  The tax is often imposed based on a deemed disposition of all the individual s property  One example is the United States under the American Jobs Creation Act  where any individual who has a net worth of  2 million or an average income tax liability of  127 000 who renounces his or her citizenship and leaves the country is automatically assumed to have done so for tax avoidance reasons and is subject to a higher tax rate  16   edit  Transfer tax Main article  Transfer tax Historically  in many countries  a contract needed to have a stamp affixed to make it valid  The charge for the stamp was either a fixed amount or a percentage of the value of the transaction  In most countries the stamp has been abolished but stamp duty remains  Stamp duty is levied in the UK on the purchase of shares and securities  the issue of bearer instruments  and certain partnership transactions  Its modern derivatives  stamp duty reserve tax and stamp duty land tax  are respectively charged on transactions involving securities and land  Stamp duty has the effect of discouraging speculative purchases of assets by decreasing liquidity  In the United States transfer tax is often charged by the state or local government and  in the case of real property transfers  can be tied to the recording of the deed or other transfer documents   edit  Wealth  net worth  tax Main article  Wealth tax Some countries  governments will require declaration of the tax payers  balance sheet  assets and liabilities   and from that exact a tax on net worth  assets minus liabilities   as a percentage of the net worth  or a percentage of the net worth exceeding a certain level  The tax may be levied on  natural  or legal  persons   An example is France s ISF   edit  Taxes on goods and services  edit  Value added tax  Goods and Services Tax  Main article  Value added tax A value added tax  VAT   also known as Goods and Services Tax  G S T   Single Business Tax  or Turnover Tax in some countries  applies the equivalent of a sales tax to every operation that creates value  To give an example  sheet steel is imported by a machine manufacturer  That manufacturer will pay the VAT on the purchase price  remitting that amount to the government  The manufacturer will then transform the steel into a machine  selling the machine for a higher price to a wholesale distributor  The manufacturer will collect the VAT on the higher price  but will remit to the government only the excess related to the  value added   the price over the cost of the sheet steel   The wholesale distributor will then continue the process  charging the retail distributor the VAT on the entire price to the retailer  but remitting only the amount related to the distribution mark up to the government  The last VAT amount is paid by the eventual retail customer who cannot recover any of the previously paid VAT  For a VAT and sales tax of identical rates  the total tax paid is the same  but it is paid at differing points in the process  VAT is usually administrated by requiring the company to complete a VAT return  giving details of VAT it has been charged  referred to as input tax  and VAT it has charged to others  referred to as output tax   The difference between output tax and input tax is payable to the Local Tax Authority  If input tax is greater than output tax the company can claim back money from the Local Tax Authority   edit  Sales taxes Main article  Sales tax Sales taxes are levied when a commodity is sold to its final consumer  Retail organizations contend that such taxes discourage retail sales  The question of whether they are generally progressive or regressive is a subject of much current debate  People with higher incomes spend a lower proportion of them  so a flat rate sales tax will tend to be regressive  It is therefore common to exempt food  utilities and other necessities from sales taxes  since poor people spend a higher proportion of their incomes on these commodities  so such exemptions make the tax more progressive  This is the classic  You pay for what you spend  tax  as only those who spend money on non exempt  i e  luxury  items pay the tax  A small number of U S  states rely entirely on sales taxes for state revenue  as those states do not levy a state income tax  Such states tend to have a moderate to large amount of tourism or inter state travel that occurs within their borders  allowing the state to benefit from taxes from people the state would otherwise not tax  In this way  the state is able to reduce the tax burden on its citizens  The U S  states that do not levy a state income tax are Alaska  Tennessee  Florida  Nevada  South Dakota  Texas  17  Washington state  and Wyoming  Additionally  New Hampshire and Tennessee levy state income taxes only on dividends and interest income  Of the above states  only Alaska and New Hampshire do not levy a state sales tax  Additional information can be obtained at the Federation of Tax Administrators website  In the United States  there is a growing movement 18  for the replacement of all federal payroll and income taxes  both corporate and personal  with a national retail sales tax and monthly tax rebate to households of citizens and legal resident aliens  The tax proposal is named FairTax  In Canada  the federal sales tax is called the Goods and Services tax  GST  and now stands at 5   The provinces of British Columbia  Saskatchewan  Manitoba  and Prince Edward Island also have a provincial sales tax  PST   The provinces of Nova Scotia  New Brunswick  Newfoundland  amp  Labrador  and Ontario have harmonized their provincial sales taxes with the GST Harmonized Sales Tax  HST   and thus is a full VAT  The province of Quebec collects the Quebec Sales Tax  QST  which is based on the GST with certain differences  Most businesses can claim back the GST  HST and QST they pay  and so effectively it is the final consumer who pays the tax   edit  Excises Main article  Excise Unlike an ad valorem  an excise is not a function of the value of the product being taxed  Excise taxes are based on the quantity  not the value  of product purchased  For example  in the United States  the Federal government imposes an excise tax of 18 4 cents per U S  gallon  4 86  L  of gasoline  while state governments levy an additional 8 to 28 cents per U S  gallon  Excises on particular commodities are frequently hypothecated  For example  a fuel excise  use tax  is often used to pay for public transportation  especially roads and bridges and for the protection of the environment  A special form of hypothecation arises where an excise is used to compensate a party to a transaction for alleged uncontrollable abuse  for example  a blank media tax is a tax on recordable media such as CD Rs  whose proceeds are typically allocated to copyright holders  Critics charge that such taxes blindly tax those who make legitimate and illegitimate usages of the products  for instance  a person or corporation using CD R s for data archival should not have to subsidize the producers of popular music  Excises  or exemptions from them  are also used to modify consumption patterns  social engineering   For example  a high excise is used to discourage alcohol consumption  relative to other goods  This may be combined with hypothecation if the proceeds are then used to pay for the costs of treating illness caused by alcohol abuse  Similar taxes may exist on tobacco  pornography  etc   and they may be collectively referred to as  sin taxes   A carbon tax is a tax on the consumption of carbon based non renewable fuels  such as petrol  diesel fuel  jet fuels  and natural gas  The object is to reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere  In the United Kingdom  vehicle excise duty is an annual tax on vehicle ownership   edit  Tariff Main article  Tariff An import or export tariff  also called customs duty or impost  is a charge for the movement of goods through a political border  Tariffs discourage trade  and they may be used by governments to protect domestic industries  A proportion of tariff revenues is often hypothecated to pay government to maintain a navy or border police  The classic ways of cheating a tariff are smuggling or declaring a false value of goods  Tax  tariff and trade rules in modern times are usually set together because of their common impact on industrial policy  investment policy  and agricultural policy  A trade bloc is a group of allied countries agreeing to minimize or eliminate tariffs against trade with each other  and possibly to impose protective tariffs on imports from outside the bloc  A customs union has a common external tariff  and the participating countries share the revenues from tariffs on goods entering the customs union   edit  Other taxes  edit  License fees Occupational taxes or license fees may be imposed on businesses or individuals engaged in certain businesses  Many jurisdictions impose a tax on vehicles   edit  Poll tax Main article  Poll tax A poll tax  also called a per capita tax  or capitation tax  is a tax that levies a set amount per individual  It is an example of the concept of fixed tax  One of the earliest taxes mentioned in the Bible of a half shekel per annum from each adult Jew  Ex  30 11 16  was a form of poll tax  Poll taxes are administratively cheap because they are easy to compute and collect and difficult to cheat  Economists have considered poll taxes economically efficient because people are presumed to be in fixed supply  However  poll taxes are very unpopular because poorer people pay a higher proportion of their income than richer people  In addition  the supply of people is in fact not fixed over time  on average  couples will choose to have fewer children if a poll tax is imposed  19  not in citation given  The introduction of a poll tax in medieval England was the primary cause of the 1381 Peasants  Revolt  Scotland was the first to be used to test the new poll tax in 1989 with England and Wales in 1990  The change from a progressive local taxation based on property values to a single rate form of taxation regardless of ability to pay  the Community Charge  but more popularly referred to as the Poll Tax   led to widespread refusal to pay and to incidents of civil unrest  known colloquially as the  Poll Tax Riots    edit  Other Some types of taxes have been proposed but not actually adopted in any major jurisdiction  These include  Bank tax Financial transaction taxes including currency transaction taxes  edit  Descriptive labels given some taxes  edit  Ad valorem Main article  Ad valorem An ad valorem tax is one where the tax base is the value of a good  service  or property  Sales taxes  tariffs  property taxes  inheritance taxes  and value added taxes are different types of ad valorem tax  An ad valorem tax is typically imposed at the time of a transaction  sales tax or value added tax  VAT   but it may be imposed on an annual basis  property tax  or in connection with another significant event  inheritance tax or tariffs   An alternative to ad valorem taxation is an excise tax  where the tax base is the quantity of something  regardless of its price   edit  Consumption tax Main article  Consumption tax Consumption tax refers to any tax on non investment spending  and can be implemented by means of a sales tax  consumer value added tax  or by modifying an income tax to allow for unlimited deductions for investment or savings   edit  Environmental tax See also  Ecotax  Gas Guzzler Tax  and Polluter pays principle This includes natural resources consumption tax  greenhouse gas tax  Carbon tax    sulfuric tax   and others  The stated purpose is to reduce the environmental impact by repricing   edit  Fees and effective taxes Governments may charge user fees  tolls  or other types of assessments in exchange of particular goods  services  or use of property  These are generally not considered taxes  as long as they are levied as payment for a direct benefit to the individual paying  20  Such fees include  Tolls  a fee charged to travel via a road  bridge  tunnel  canal  waterway or other transportation facilities  Historically tolls have been used to pay for public bridge  road and tunnel projects  They have also been used in privately constructed transport links  The toll is likely to be a fixed charge  possibly graduated for vehicle type  or for distance on long routes  User fees  such as those charged for use of parks or other government owned facilities  Ruling fees charged by governmental agencies to make determinations in particular situations  Some scholars refer to certain economic effects as taxes  though they are not levies imposed by governments  These include  Inflation tax  the economic disadvantage suffered by holders of cash and cash equivalents in one denomination of currency due to the effects of expansionary monetary policy 21  Financial repression  Government policies such as interest rate caps on government debt  financial regulations such as reserve requirements and capital controls  and barriers to entry in markets where the government owns or controls businesses  22   edit  History  edit  Taxation levels Egyptian peasants seized for non payment of taxes   Pyramid Age  The first known system of taxation was in Ancient Egypt around 3000 BC   2800 BC in the first dynasty of the Old Kingdom  23  The earliest and most widespread form of taxation was the corv e and tithe  The corv e was forced labour provided to the state by peasants too poor to pay other forms of taxation  labour in ancient Egyptian is a synonym for taxes   24  Records from the time document that the pharaoh would conduct a biennial tour of the kingdom  collecting tithes from the people  Other records are granary receipts on limestone flakes and papyrus  25  Early taxation is also described in the Bible  In Genesis  chapter 47  verse 24   the New International Version   it states  But when the crop comes in  give a fifth of it to Pharaoh  The other four fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children   Joseph was telling the people of Egypt how to divide their crop  providing a portion to the Pharaoh  A share  20   of the crop was the tax  Later  in the Persian Empire  a regulated and sustainable tax system was introduced by Darius I the Great in 500 BC  26  the Persian system of taxation was tailored to each Satrapy  the area ruled by a Satrap or provincial governor   At differing times  there were between 20 and 30 Satrapies in the Empire and each was assessed according to its supposed productivity  It was the responsibility of the Satrap to collect the due amount and to send it to the emperor  after deducting his expenses  the expenses and the power of deciding precisely how and from whom to raise the money in the province  offer maximum opportunity for rich pickings   The quantities demanded from the various provinces gave a vivid picture of their economic potential  For instance  Babylon was assessed for the highest amount and for a startling mixture of commodities  1 000 silver talents and four months supply of food for the army  India  a province fabled for its gold  was to supply gold dust equal in value to the very large amount of 4 680 silver talents  Egypt was known for the wealth of its crops  it was to be the granary of the Persian Empire  and  later  of the Roman Empire  and was required to provide 120 000 measures of grain in addition to 700 talents of silver  This was exclusively a tax levied on subject peoples  Persians and Medes paid no tax  but  they were liable at any time to serve in the army  27  The Rosetta Stone  a tax concession issued by Ptolemy V in 196 BC and written in three languages  led to the most famous decipherment in history the cracking of hieroglyphics   28  In India  Islamic rulers imposed jizya  a poll tax on non Muslims  starting in the 11th century  It was abolished by Akbar  Numerous records of government tax collection in Europe since at least the 17th century are still available today  But taxation levels are hard to compare to the size and flow of the economy since production numbers are not as readily available  however  Government expenditures and revenue in France during the 17th century went from about 24 30 million livres in 1600 10 to about 126 86 million livres in 1650 59 to about 117 99 million livres in 1700 10 when government debt had reached 1 6 billion livres  In 1780 89  it reached 421 50 million livres  29  Taxation as a percentage of production of final goods may have reached 15  20  during the 17th century in places such as France  the Netherlands  and Scandinavia  During the war filled years of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century  tax rates in Europe increased dramatically as war became more expensive and governments became more centralized and adept at gathering taxes  This increase was greatest in England  Peter Mathias and Patrick O Brien found that the tax burden increased by 85  over this period  Another study confirmed this number  finding that per capita tax revenues had grown almost sixfold over the eighteenth century  but that steady economic growth had made the real burden on each individual only double over this period before the industrial revolution  Average tax rates were higher in Britain than France the years before the French Revolution  twice in per capita income comparison  but they were mostly placed on international trade  In France  taxes were lower but the burden was mainly on landowners  individuals  and internal trade and thus created far more resentment  30  Taxation as a percentage of GDP in 2003 was 56 1  in Denmark  54 5  in France  49 0  in the Euro area  42 6  in the United Kingdom  35 7  in the United States  35 2  in Ireland  and among all OECD members an average of 40 7   31  32   edit  Forms of taxation In monetary economies prior to fiat banking  a critical form of taxation was seigniorage  the tax on the creation of money  Other obsolete forms of taxation include  Scutage  which is paid in lieu of military service  strictly speaking  it is a commutation of a non tax obligation rather than a tax as such but functioning as a tax in practice  Tallage  a tax on feudal dependents  Tithe  a tax like payment  one tenth of one s earnings or agricultural produce   paid to the Church  and thus too specific to be a tax in strict technical terms   This should not be confused with the modern practice of the same name which is normally voluntary   Feudal  aids  a type of tax or due that was paid by a vassal to his lord during feudal times  Danegeld  a medieval land tax originally raised to pay off raiding Danes and later used to fund military expenditures  Carucage  a tax which replaced the danegeld in England  Tax farming  the principle of assigning the responsibility for tax revenue collection to private citizens or groups  Socage  a feudal tax system based on land rent  Burgage  a feudal tax system based on land rent  Some principalities taxed windows  doors  or cabinets to reduce consumption of imported glass and hardware  Armoires  hutches  and wardrobes were employed to evade taxes on doors and cabinets  In some circumstances  taxes are also used to enforce public policy like congestion charge  to cut road traffic and encourage public transport  in London  In Tsarist Russia  taxes were clamped on beards  Today  one of the most complicated taxation systems worldwide is in Germany  Three quarters of the world s taxation literature refers to the German system  citation needed  There are 118 laws  185 forms  and 96 000 regulations  spending  3 7 billion to collect the income tax  Today  governments in more advanced economies in  i e  Europe and North America  tend to rely more on direct taxes  while developing economies  i e  India and several African countries  rely more on indirect taxes   edit  Economic effects In economic terms  taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government of a nation  The side effects of taxation and theories about how best to tax are an important subject in microeconomics  Taxation is almost never a simple transfer of wealth  Economic theories of taxation approach the question of how to maximize economic welfare through taxation   edit  Tax incidence Main article  Tax incidence See also  Effect of taxes and subsidies on price Law establishes from whom a tax is collected  In many countries  taxes are imposed on business  such as corporate taxes or portions of payroll taxes   However  who ultimately pays the tax  the tax  burden   is determined by the marketplace as taxes become embedded into production costs  Economic theory suggests that the economic effect of tax does not necessarily fall at the point where it is legally levied  For instance  a tax on employment paid by employers will impact on the employee  at least in the long run  The greatest share of the tax burden tends to fall on the most inelastic factor involved the part of the transaction which is affected least by a change in price  So  for instance  a tax on wages in a town will  at least in the long run  affect property owners in that area  Diagram illustrating taxes effect Depending on how quantities supplied and demanded vary with price  the  elasticities  of supply and demand   a tax can be absorbed by the seller  in the form of lower pre tax prices   or by the buyer  in the form of higher post tax prices   If the elasticity of supply is low  more of the tax will be paid by the supplier  If the elasticity of demand is low  more will be paid by the customer  and  contrariwise for the cases where those elasticities are high  If the seller is a competitive firm  the tax burden is distributed over the factors of production depending on the elasticities thereof  this includes workers  in the form of lower wages   capital investors  in the form of loss to shareholders   landowners  in the form of lower rents   entrepreneurs  in the form of lower wages of superintendence  and customers  in the form of higher prices   To show this relationship  suppose that the market price of a product is  1 00  and that a  0 50 tax is imposed on the product that  by law  is to be collected from the seller  If the product has an elastic demand  a greater portion of the tax will be absorbed by the seller  This is because goods with elastic demand cause a large decline in quantity demanded for a small increase in price  Therefore in order to stabilize sales  the seller absorbs more of the additional tax burden  For example  the seller might drop the price of the product to  0 70 so that  after adding in the tax  the buyer pays a total of  1 20  or  0 20 more than he did before the  0 50 tax was imposed  In this example  the buyer has paid  0 20 of the  0 50 tax  in the form of a post tax price  and the seller has paid the remaining  0 30  in the form of a lower pre tax price   33   edit  Reduced economic welfare Most taxes have side effects that reduce economic welfare  either by mandating unproductive labor  compliance costs  or by creating distortions to economic incentives  deadweight loss and perverse incentives    edit  Cost of compliance Although governments must spend money on tax collection activities  some of the costs  particularly for keeping records and filling out forms  are borne by businesses and by private individuals  These are collectively called costs of compliance  More complex tax systems tend to have higher compliance costs  This fact can be used as the basis for practical or moral arguments in favor of tax simplification  such as the FairTax or OneTax  and some flat tax proposals    edit  Deadweight costs of taxation In the absence of negative externalities  the introduction of taxes into a market reduces economic efficiency by causing deadweight loss  In a competitive market the price of a particular economic good adjusts to ensure that all trades which benefit both the buyer and the seller of a good occur  The introduction of a tax causes the price received by the seller to be less than the cost to the buyer by the amount of the tax  This causes fewer transactions to occur  which reduces economic welfare  the individuals or businesses involved are less well off than before the tax  The tax burden and the amount of deadweight cost is dependent on the elasticity of supply and demand for the good taxed  Most taxes including income tax and sales tax can have significant deadweight costs  The only way to avoid deadweight costs in an economy that is generally competitive is to refrain from taxes that change economic incentives  Such taxes include the land value tax  34  where the tax is on a good in completely inelastic supply  a lump sum tax such as a poll tax  head tax  which is paid by all adults regardless of their choices  Arguably a windfall profits tax which is entirely unanticipated can also fall into this category   edit  Perverse incentives Complexity of the tax code in developed economies offer perverse tax incentives  The more details of tax policy there are  the more opportunities for legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion  These not only result in lost revenue  but involve additional costs  for instance  payments made for tax advice are essentially deadweight costs because they add no wealth to the economy  Perverse incentives also occur because of non taxable  hidden  transactions  for instance  a sale from one company to another might be liable for sales tax  but if the same goods were shipped from one branch of a corporation to another  no tax would be payable  To address these issues  economists often suggest simple and transparent tax structures which avoid providing loopholes  Sales tax  for instance  can be replaced with a value added tax which disregards intermediate transactions   edit  Reduced production If a tax is paid on outsourced services that is not also charged on services performed for oneself  then it may be cheaper to perform the services oneself than to pay someone else   even considering losses in economic efficiency  35  36  For example  suppose jobs A and B are both valued at  1 on the market  And suppose that because of your unique abilities  you can do job A twice over  100  extra output  in the same effort as it would take you to do job B  But job B is the one that you need done right now  Under perfect division of labor  you would do job A and somebody else would do job B  Your unique abilities would always be rewarded  Income taxation has the worst effect on division of labor in the form of barter  Suppose that the person doing job B is actually interested in having job A done for him  Now suppose you could amazingly do job A four times over  selling half your work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill  The other half of the work you do for somebody who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill  You re left with one unit of job B  but only if you were 400  as productive doing job A  In this case of 50  tax on barter income  anything less than 400  productivity will cause the division of labor to fail  In summary  depending on the situation a 50  tax rate can cause the division of labor to fail even where productivity gains of up to 300  would have resulted  Even a mere 30  tax rate can negate the advantage of a 100  productivity gain  37   edit  Increased economic welfare  edit  Pigovian taxes The existence of a tax can increase economic efficiency in some cases  If there is a negative externality associated with a good  meaning that it has negative effects not felt by the consumer  then a free market will trade too much of that good  By taxing the good  the government can increase overall welfare as well as raising revenue  This type of tax is called a Pigovian tax  after economist Arthur Pigou  Possible Pigovian taxes include those on polluting fuels  like petrol   taxes on goods which incur public healthcare costs  such as alcohol or tobacco   and charges for existing  free  public goods  like congestion charging  are another possibility   edit  Reduced inequality In theory  progressive taxation may have the effect of reducing economic inequality  This effect occurs even when the tax revenue isn t redistributed   edit  Views on taxation  edit  Support for taxation Main article  Social contract Every tax  however  is  to the person who pays it  a badge  not of slavery  but of liberty    Adam Smith  1776   Wealth of Nations 38  According to most political philosophies  taxes are justified as they fund activities that are necessary and beneficial to society  Additionally  progressive taxation can be used to reduce economic inequality in a society  According to this view  taxation in modern nation states benefit the majority of the population and social development  39  A common presentation of this view  paraphrasing various statements by Oliver Wendell Holmes  Jr  is  Taxes are the price of civilization   40  It can also be argued that in a democracy  because the government is the party performing the act of imposing taxes  society as a whole decides how the tax system should be organized  41  The American Revolution s  No taxation without representation  slogan implied this view  For traditional conservatives  the payment of taxation is justified as part of the general obligations of citizens to obey the law and support established institutions  The conservative position is encapsulated in perhaps the most famous adage of public finance   An old tax is a good tax   42  Conservatives advocate the  fundamental conservative premise that no one should be excused from paying for government  lest they come to believe that government is costless to them with the certain consequence that they will demand more government  services     43 Social democrats generally favor higher levels of taxation to fund public provision of a wide range of services such as universal health care and education  as well as the provision of a range of welfare benefits  44  As argued by Tony Crosland and others  the capacity to tax income from capital is a central element of the social democratic case for a mixed economy as against Marxist arguments for comprehensive public ownership of capital  citation needed  Many libertarians recommend a minimal level of taxation in order to maximize the protection of liberty  citation needed  Compulsory taxation of individuals  such as income tax  is often justified on grounds including territorial sovereignty  and the social contract  Defenders of business taxation argue that it is an efficient method of taxing income that ultimately flows to individuals  or that separate taxation of business is justified on the grounds that commercial activity necessarily involves use of publicly established and maintained economic infrastructure  and that businesses are in effect charged for this use  45 Georgist economists argue that all of the economic rent collected from natural resources  land  mineral extraction  fishing quotas  etc   is unearned income  and belongs to the community rather than any individual  They advocate a high tax  the  Single Tax   on land and other natural resources to return this unearned income to the state  but no other taxes   edit  Opposition to taxation Main articles  Tax noncompliance and Taxation as theft Because payment of tax is compulsory and enforced by the legal system  some political philosophies view taxation as theft  or as slavery  or as a violation of property rights   or tyranny  accusing the government of levying taxes via force and coercive means  46 Voluntaryists  individualist anarchists  objectivists  anarcho capitalists  and libertarians see taxation as government aggression  see zero aggression principle   The view that democracy legitimizes taxation is rejected by those who argue that all forms of government  including laws chosen by democratic means  are fundamentally oppressive  According to Ludwig von Mises   society as a whole  should not make such decisions  due to methodological individualism  47  Libertarian opponents of taxation claim that governmental protection  such as police and defense forces might be replaced by market alternatives such as private defense agencies  arbitration agencies or voluntary contributions  48 Walter E  Williams  professor of economics at George Mason University  stated  Government income redistribution programs produce the same result as theft  In fact  that s what a thief does  he redistributes income  The difference between government and thievery is mostly a matter of legality   49  Taxation has also been opposed by communists and socialists  Karl Marx assumed that taxation would be unnecessary after the advent of communism and looked forward to the  withering away of the state   In socialist economies such as that of China  taxation played a minor role  since most government income was derived from the ownership of enterprises  and it was argued by some that taxation was not necessary  50  While the morality of taxation is sometimes questioned  most arguments about taxation revolve around the degree and method of taxation and associated government spending  not taxation itself   edit  Theories on taxation  edit  Laffer curve Main article  Laffer curve In economics  the Laffer curve is a theoretical representation of the relationship between government revenue raised by taxation and all possible rates of taxation  It is used to illustrate the concept of taxable income elasticity  that taxable income will change in response to changes in the rate of taxation   The curve is constructed by thought experiment  First  the amount of tax revenue raised at the extreme tax rates of 0  and 100  is considered  It is clear that a 0  tax rate raises no revenue  but the Laffer curve hypothesis is that a 100  tax rate will also generate no revenue because at such a rate there is no longer any incentive for a rational taxpayer to earn any income  thus the revenue raised will be 100  of nothing  If both a 0  rate and 100  rate of taxation generate no revenue  it follows from the extreme value theorem that there must exist at least one rate in between where tax revenue would be a maximum  The Laffer curve is typically represented as a graph which starts at 0  tax  zero revenue  rises to a maximum rate of revenue raised at an intermediate rate of taxation and then falls again to zero revenue at a 100  tax rate  One potential result of the Laffer curve is that increasing tax rates beyond a certain point will become counterproductive for raising further tax revenue  A hypothetical Laffer curve for any given economy can only be estimated and such estimates are sometimes controversial  The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics reports that estimates of revenue maximizing tax rates have varied widely  with a mid range of around 70   51   edit  Optimal tax Main article  Optimal tax Most governments take revenue which exceeds that which can be provided by non distortionary taxes or through taxes which give a double dividend  Optimal taxation theory is the branch of economics that considers how taxes can be structured to give the least deadweight costs  or to give the best outcomes in terms of social welfare  The Ramsey problem deals with minimizing deadweight costs  Because deadweight costs are related to the elasticity of supply and demand for a good  it follows that putting the highest tax rates on the goods for which there is most inelastic supply and demand will result in the least overall deadweight costs  Some economists sought to integrate optimal tax theory with the social welfare function  which is the economic expression of the idea that equality is valuable to a greater or lesser extent  If individuals experience diminishing returns from income  then the optimum distribution of income for society involves a progressive income tax  Mirrlees optimal income tax is a detailed theoretical model of the optimum progressive income tax along these lines  Over the last years the validity of the theory of optimal taxation was discussed by many political economists  Canegrati  2007  demonstrated that if we move from the assumption that governments do not maximise the welfare of society but the probability of winning elections  the tax rates in equilibrium are lower for the most powerful groups of society  instead of being the lowest for the poorest as in the optimal theory of direct taxation developed by Atkinson and Joseph Stiglitz  See Canegrati s formulae   edit  See

fraction of their income in cash  they are much less likely to receive the newly created monies before the market has adjusted with inflated prices  and more often have fixed incomes  wages or pensions  Some argue that inflation is a regressive consumption tax  Also see Andr s Erosa and Gustavo Ventura   On inflation as a regressive consumption tax   Some who   claim there are systemic effects of an expansionary monetary policy  which are also definitively taxing  imposing a financial charge on some as a result of the policy  Because the effects of monetary expansion or counterfeiting are never uniform over an entire economy  the policy influences capital transfers in the market  creating economic bubbles where the new monies are first introduced  Economic bubbles increase market instability  and therefore increase investment risk  creating the conditions common to a recession  This particular tax can be understood to be levied on future generations that would have benefited from economic growth  and it has a 100  transfer cost  so long as people are not acting against their interests  increased uncertainty benefits no one   One example of a strong
