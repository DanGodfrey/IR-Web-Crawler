USPS com Full eagle logo  used in various versions from 1970 to 1993 The United States Postal Service  also known as USPS  the Post Office or U S  Mail  is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for providing postal service in the United States  It is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the United States Constitution  The USPS traces its roots to 1775 during the Second Continental Congress  where Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general  The cabinet level Post Office Department was created in 1792 from Franklin s operation and transformed into its current form in 1971 under the Postal Reorganization Act  The USPS employs over 574 000 workers and operates over 218 000 vehicles  2  It is the 2nd largest civilian employer in the United States  2  The USPS is the operator of the largest vehicle fleet in the world  3  The USPS is legally obligated to serve all Americans  regardless of geography  at uniform price and quality  The USPS has exclusive access to letter boxes marked  U S  Mail  and personal letterboxes in the United States  but still competes against private package delivery services  such as UPS and FedEx  On December 5  2011 the USPS announced it will close more than half of its mail processing centers  eliminate 28 000 jobs and end overnight delivery of first class mail  This will close down 252 of its 461 processing centers  On December 13  2011 the USPS agreed to delay the closing of 252 mail processing centers as well as 3 700 local post offices until mid May 2012  4  The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006  PAEA   HR 6407   enacted on December 20  2006  obligates the USPS to prefund 75 years  worth of future health care benefit payments to retirees within a ten year time span   a requirement to which no other government organization is subject  The USPS has not directly received taxpayer dollars since the early 1980s with the minor exception of subsidies for costs associated with the disabled and overseas voters  Revenue in the 2000s has been dropping sharply due to declining mail volume  5  prompting the postal service to look to other sources of revenue

pony logo used by the U S  Post Office Department before the creation of the USPS The first postal service in America arose in February 1692  when a grant from King William  amp  Queen Mary empowered Thomas Neale  to erect  settle and establish within the chief parts of their majesties  colonies and plantations in America  an office or offices for the receiving and dispatching letters and pacquets  and to receive  send and deliver the same under such rates and sums of money as the planters shall agree to give  and to hold and enjoy the same for the term of twenty one years   7  The United States Post Office  USPO  was created in Philadelphia under Benjamin Franklin on Wednesday  July 26  1775  by decree of the Second Continental Congress  Based on the Postal Clause in Article One of the United States Constitution  empowering Congress  To establish post offices and post roads   it became the Post Office Department  USPOD  in 1792  Until 1971  it was part of the Presidential cabinet and the Postmaster General was the last person in the United States presidential line of succession  The Post Office Department was enlarged during the tenure of President Andrew Jackson  As the Post Office expanded  difficulties were experienced due to a lack of employees and transportation  The Post Office s employees at that time were still subject to the so called  spoils  system  where faithful political supporters of the executive branch were appointed to positions in the post office and other government corporations as a reward for their patronage  These appointees rarely had prior experience in postal service and mail delivery  This system of political patronage was replaced in 1883  after passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act  8  Ten years before waterways were declared post roads in 1823  the Post Office used steamboats to carry mail between post towns where no roads existed  citation needed  Once it became clear that the postal system in the United States needed to expand across the entire country  the use of the railroad to transport the mail was instituted in 1832  on one line in Pennsylvania  9  All railroads in the United States were designated as post routes  after passage of the Act of July 7  1838  Mail service by railroad increased rapidly thereafter  10    Benjamin Franklin   George Washington   The First U S  Postage Stamps Issued 1847 The first stamp issues were authorized by an act of Congress and approved on March 3  1847  11  The earliest known use of the Franklin 5c is July 7  1847  while the earliest known use of the Washington 10c is July 2  1847  Remaining in postal circulation for only a few years  these issues were declared invalid for Postage on July 1  1851  12  An Act of Congress provided for the issuance of stamps on March 3  1847  and the Postmaster General immediately let a contract to the New York City engraving firm of Rawdon  Wright  Hatch  and Edson  The first stamp issue of the U S  was offered for sale on July 1  1847  in NYC  with Boston receiving stamps the following day and other cities thereafter  The 5 cent stamp paid for a letter weighing less than 1 oz  28 g  and travelling less than 300 miles  the 10 cent stamp for deliveries to locations greater than 300 miles  or twice the weight deliverable for the 5 cent stamp  In 1847  the U S  Mail Steamship Company acquired the contract to carry the U S  mails from New York  with stops in New Orleans and Havana  to the Isthmus of Panama for delivery in California  The same year  the Pacific Mail Steamship Company had acquired the right to transport mail under contract from the United States Government from the Isthmus of Panama to California  In 1855  William Henry Aspinwall completed the Panama Railway  the first transcontinental railroad  providing service from the east coast across the Isthmus to California in three weeks for the mails  passengers and goods  and remained an important route until the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869  Railroad companies greatly expanded mail transport service after 1862  and the Railway Mail Service was inaugurated in 1869  9  Rail cars designed to sort and distribute mail while rolling were soon introduced  9  RMS employees sorted mail  on the fly  during the journey  and became some of the most skilled workers in the postal service  An RMS sorter had to be able to separate the mail quickly into compartments based on its final destination  before the first destination arrived  and work at the rate of 600 pieces of mail an hour  They were tested regularly for speed and accuracy  13  The advent of rural free delivery in the U S  in 1896  and the inauguration of parcel post service in 1913 greatly increased the volume of mail shipped nationwide  and motivated the development of more efficient postal transportation systems  14  From January 1  1911  until July 1  1967  the United States Postal Service operated the United States Postal Savings System  An Act of Congress of June 25  1910  established the Postal Savings System in designated Post Offices  effective January 1  1911  The legislation aimed to get money out of hiding  attract the savings of immigrants accustomed to the postal savings system in their native countries  provide safe depositories for people who had lost confidence in banks  and furnish more convenient depositories for working people  The law establishing the system directed the Post Office Department to redeposit most of the money in the system in local banks  where it earned 2 5 percent interest  The system paid 2 percent interest per year on deposits  The half percent difference in interest was intended to pay for the operation of the system  Certificates were issued to depositors as proof of their deposit  Depositors in the system were initially limited to hold a balance of  500  but this was raised to  1 000 in 1916 and to  2 500 in 1918  The initial minimum deposit was  1  In order to save smaller amounts for deposit  customers could purchase a 10 cent postal savings card and 10 cent postal savings stamps to fill it  The card could be used to open or add to an account when its value  together with any attached stamps  amounted to one or more dollars  or it could be redeemed for cash  At its peak in 1947  the system held almost  3 4 billion in deposits  with more than four million depositors using 8 141 postal units  15  On August 12  1918  the Post Office Department took over air mail service from the U S  Army Air Service  USAAS   Assistant Postmaster General  Otto Praeger  appointed Benjamin B  Lipsner to head the civilian operated Air Mail Service  One of Lipsner s first acts was to hire four pilots  each with at least 1 000 hours flying experience  paying them an average of  4 000 per year  The Post Office Department used mostly World War I military surplus de Havilland DH 4 aircraft  During 1918  the Post Office hired an additional 36 pilots  In its first year of operation  the Post Office completed 1 208 airmail flights with 90 forced landings  Of those  53 were due to weather and 37 to engine failure  By 1920  the Air Mail service had delivered 49 million letters  16  Domestic air mail became obsolete in 1975  and international air mail in 1995  when the USPS began transporting First Class mail by air on a routine basis  The Post Office was one of the first government departments to regulate obscene materials on a national basis  When the U S  Congress passed the Comstock laws of 1873  it became illegal to send through the U S  mail any material considered obscene  indecent or which promoted abortion issues  contraception  or alcohol consumption  17  The Postal Reorganization Act signed by President Richard Nixon on August 12  1970  replaced the cabinet level Post Office Department with the independent United States Postal Service  The Act took effect on July 1  1971  On May 11  2009  the price of a First Class Mail stamp rose to 44 cents  18  On January 22  2012  the price rose to 45 cents   edit  Current operations USPS service delivery truck The United States Postal Service employs some 574 000 workers  making it the second largest 3  civilian employer in the United States  the federal government being the first   following only Wal Mart  19  clarification needed  In a 2006 U S  Supreme Court decision  the Court noted   Each day  according to the Government s submissions here  the United States Postal Service delivers some 660 million pieces of mail to as many as 142 million delivery points   20  As of 2011  the USPS operates 31 000 post offices and locations in the U S   and delivers 177 billion pieces of mail annually  3  The USPS operates the largest civilian vehicle fleet in the world  with an estimated 218 684 vehicles  the majority of which are the easily identified Chevrolet Grumman LLV  Long Life Vehicle   and the newer Ford Utilimaster FFV  Flex Fuel Vehicle   originally also referred to as the  CRV   Carrier Route Vehicle   3  For every penny increase in the national average price of gasoline  the USPS spends an extra  8 million per year to fuel its fleet  21  The number of gallons of fuel used in 2009 was 444 million  at a cost of US 1 1 billion  3  The fleet is notable in that many of its vehicles are right hand drive  an arrangement intended to give drivers the easiest access to roadside mailboxes  Some Rural Letter Carriers use personal vehicles  Standard postal owned vehicles do not have license plates  These vehicles are identified by a seven digit number displayed on the front and rear  Fleet of post office vehicles at the James Griffith Station in Spring Branch  Houston The Department of Defense and the USPS jointly operate a postal system to deliver mail for the military  this is known as the Army Post Office  for Army and Air Force postal facilities  and the Fleet Post Office  for Navy  Marine Corps and Coast Guard postal facilities    edit  Five year plans In October 2008  the Postal Service released Vision 2013  22  a five year plan required by law starting in 1993  23  One planned improvement is the introduction of the Intelligent Mail Barcode  which will allow pieces of mail to be tracked through the delivery system  as competitors like UPS and FedEx currently do   edit  Revenue decline Declining mail volume is a symptom of the weak national economy citation needed   particularly related to the financial and housing industries  and to trends toward the use of electronic mail  First Class mail volume  which is protected by legal monopoly  peaked in 2001 24  and has declined 29  from 1998 to 2008  due to the increasing use of email and the World Wide Web for correspondence and business transactions  25  Lower volume means lower revenues to support the fixed commitment to deliver to every address once a day  six days a week  In response  the USPS has increased productivity each year from 2000 to 2007  26  through increased automation  route re optimization  and facility consolidation  25  Despite these efforts  the organization saw an  8 5 billion budget shortfall in 2010  27  and has been losing money at a rate of about  3 billion per quarter in 2011  28  To cut costs  the U S  Postal Service proposes to close as many as 3 700 small post offices and replacing some of them as  village post offices  to offer the most basic mail services at lower costs inside such places as grocery stores and drugstores with signs    Village Post Office    in the window since August 2011  The Postal Service will pay Mini mart about  2 000 a year  One benefit of the new policy is service hours which are longer than the old post office  29  The closure of half of all mail processing centers in the first half of 2012 will result an overall slowing of delivery and the elimination of next day delivery for First Class mail  30  Of related significance is the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006  PAEA   which obligates the USPS to prefund 75 years worth of future health care benefit payments to retirees within a ten year time span   a requirement to which no other government organization is subject  Thus  in addition to the weak economy and the diversion of mail to electronic means  the mandates of PAEA have had a considerable impact on Postal Service finances  As a consequence  it has been charged that the US Postal Service budget crisis of 2011 is  in essence  an artificial one  26  31  32  There are those who believe that readjustments and closing  will be a mess   may not obtain projected savings  will cause severe dislocations  and will run afoul of obligations under various collective bargaining agreements  33   edit  Governance and organization USPS headquarters at L Enfant Plaza in Washington  D C  The Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service sets policy  procedure  and postal rates for services rendered  and has a similar role to a corporate board of directors  Of the eleven members of the Board  nine are appointed by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate  see 39 U S C    202   The nine appointed members then select the United States Postmaster General  who serves as the board s tenth member  and who oversees the day to day activities of the service as Chief Executive Officer  see 39 U S C     202 203   The ten member board then nominates a Deputy Postmaster General  who acts as Chief Operating Officer  to the eleventh and last remaining open seat  The USPS is often mistaken for a government owned corporation  e g   Amtrak  because it operates much like a business  but as noted above  it is legally defined as an  independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States    39 U S C    201  as it is controlled by Presidential appointees and the Postmaster General  As a quasi governmental agency  it has many special privileges  including sovereign immunity  eminent domain powers  powers to negotiate postal treaties with foreign nations  and an exclusive legal right to deliver first class and third class mail  Indeed  in 2004  the U S  Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision that the USPS was not a government owned corporation  and therefore could not be sued under the Sherman Antitrust Act  34  The U S  Supreme Court has also upheld the USPS s statutory monopoly on access to letter boxes against a First Amendment freedom of speech challenge  it thus remains illegal in the U S  for anyone  other than the employees and agents of the USPS  to deliver mailpieces to letter boxes marked  U S  Mail   35  The Postal Service also has a Mailers  Technical Advisory Committee and local Postal Customer Councils  which are advisory and primarily involve business customers  36   edit  Universal service obligation and monopoly status This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  See talk page for details  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   November 2011  Article I  section 8  Clause 7 of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to establish post offices and post roads  which has been interpreted as a de facto Congressional monopoly over the delivery of mail  Accordingly  no other system for delivering mail   public or private   can be established  absent Congress s consent  citation needed  Congress has delegated to the Postal Service the power to decide whether others may compete with it  and the Postal Service has allowed an exception to its monopoly for extremely urgent letters  The mission of the Postal Service is to provide the American public with trusted universal postal service at affordable prices  While not explicitly defined  the Postal Service s universal service obligation  USO  is broadly outlined in statute and includes multiple dimensions  geographic scope  range of products  access to services and facilities  delivery frequency  affordable and uniform pricing  service quality  and security of the mail  While other carriers may claim to voluntarily provide delivery on a broad basis  the Postal Service is the only carrier with a legal obligation to provide all the various aspects of universal service at affordable rates  Proponents of universal service principles claim that since any obligation must be matched by the financial capability to meet that obligation  the postal monopoly was put in place as a funding mechanism for the USO  and it has been in place for over a hundred years  It consists of two parts  the Private Express Statutes  PES  and the mailbox access rule  The PES refers to the Postal Service s monopoly on the delivery of letters  and the mailbox rule refers to the Postal Service s exclusive access to customer mailboxes  Proponents of universal service principles further claim that eliminating or reducing the PES or mailbox rule would have an impact on the ability of the Postal Service to provide affordable universal service  If  for example  the PES and the mailbox rule were to be eliminated  and the USO maintained  then either billions of dollars in tax revenues or some other source of funding would have to be found  As the operating environment of the Postal Service continues to change  additional flexibilities will likely be necessary to fulfill the USO  Some proponents of universal service principles suggest that private communications that are protected by the veil of government promote the exchange of free ideas and communications  This separates private communications from the ability of a private organization or company motivated by profit to corrupt  Security for the individual is in this way protected by the United States Post Office  maintaining confidentiality and anonymity  as well as government employees being much less likely to be instructed by superiors to engage in nefarious action related to communications between persons  organizations or competitors in all nature of associations  It is seen by some as a dangerous step to extract the universal service principle from the post office  as the untainted nature of private communications is preserved as assurance of the protection of individual freedom of privacy  Critics of universal service principles include several professional economists advocating for the privatization of the mail delivery system  or at least a relaxation of the universal service model that currently exists  37  Rick Geddes argued in 2000  38  First  basic economics implies that rural customers are unlikely to be without service under competition  they would simply have to pay the true cost of delivery to them  which may or may not be lower than under monopoly  Second  basic notions of fairness imply that the cross subsidy should be eliminated  To the extent that people make choices about where they live  they should assume the costs of that decision  Third  there is no reason why the government monopoly is necessary to ensure service to sparsely populated areas  The government could easily award competitive contracts to private firms for that service  Fourth  early concerns that rural residents of the United States would somehow become isolated without federally subsidized mail delivery today are simply unfounded      Once both sender and receiver have access to a computer  the marginal cost of sending an electronic message is close to zero  However  as the recent notice of a termination of mail service to residents of the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness indicates  mail service has been contracted to private firms such as Arnold Aviation for many decades  KTVB TV reported  39    We cannot go out every week and pick up our mail    it s impossible   said Heinz Sippel   Everyone gets their mail  Why can t we   said Sue Anderson  Getting mail delivered  once a week  by airplane is not a luxury  it s a necessity for those who live in Idaho s vast wilderness   those along the Salmon and Selway rivers  It s a service that s been provided to them for more than half a century   mostly by Ray Arnold of Arnold Aviation  The decision was reversed  U S  Postmaster General John Potter indicated that acceptable service to back country customers could not be achieved in any other fashion than continuing an air mail contract with Arnold Aviation to deliver the mail   40  The Postal Act of 2006 required the Postal Regulatory Commission  PRC  to submit a report to the President and Congress on universal postal service and the postal monopoly in December 2008  The report must include any recommended changes  The Postal Service report supports the requirement that the PRC is to consult with and solicit written comments from the Postal Service  In addition  the Government Accountability Office is required to evaluate broader business model issues by 2011  On October 15  2008  the Postal Service submitted a report 41  to the PRC on its position related to the Universal Service Obligation  USO   It said no changes to the USO and restriction on mailbox access were necessary at this time  but increased regulatory flexibility was required to ensure affordable universal service in the future  Obligations of the USO include uniform prices  quality of service  access to services  and six day delivery to every part of the country  To assure financial support for these obligations  the postal monopoly provides the Postal Service the exclusive right to deliver letters and restricts mailbox access solely for mail  The report argued that eliminating or reducing either aspect of the monopoly  would have a devastating impact on the ability   to provide the affordable universal service that the country values so highly   Relaxing access to the mailbox would also pose security concerns  increase delivery costs  and hurt customer service  according to the Post Office  The report notes  It is somewhat misleading to characterize the mailbox rule as a  monopoly   because the enforcement of 18 U S C    1725 leaves customers with ample alternative means of delivering their messages  Customers can deliver their messages either by paying postage  by placing messages on or under a door or a doormat  by using newspaper or non postal boxes  by telephoning or emailing  by engaging in person to person delivery in public areas  by tacking or taping their notices on a door post  or by placing advertisements in local newspapers  These methods are comparable in efficacy to communication via the mailbox  The Postal Service said that the USO should continue to be broadly defined and there should be no changes to the postal monopoly  Any changes would have far reaching effects on customers and the trillion dollar mailing industry   A more rigidly defined USO would   ultimately harm the American public and businesses   according to the report  which cautions that any potential change must be studied carefully and the effects fully understood  During hearings held earlier this year  the PRC also heard from mailers  mailing associations  and postal unions and management associations  Comments generally indicated that changes are not currently needed   edit  Competitors USPS Terminal Annex building in Los Angeles FedEx and United Parcel Service  UPS  directly compete with USPS express mail and package delivery services  making nationwide deliveries of urgent letters and packages  Due to the postal monopoly  they are not allowed to deliver non urgent letters and may not directly ship to U S  Mail boxes at residential and commercial destinations  However both companies have transit agreements with the USPS in which an item can be dropped off with either FedEx or UPS who will then provide shipment up to the destination post office serving the intended recipient where it will be transferred for delivery to the US Mail destination  including Post Office Box destinations  These services also deliver packages which are larger and heavier than USPS will accept  DHL Express was the third major competitor until February 2009  when it ceased domestic delivery operations in the United States  A variety of other transportation companies in the United States move cargo around the country  but either have limited geographic scope for delivery points  or specialize in items too large to be mailed  Many of the thousands of courier companies focus on same day delivery  for example  by bicycle messenger   edit  Alternative transmission methods The Post Office Department owned and operated the first public telegraph lines in the United States  starting in 1844 from Washington to Baltimore  and eventually extending to New York  Boston  Buffalo  and Philadelphia  In 1847 the telegraph system was privatized  except for a period during World War I  when it was used to accelerate the delivery of letters arriving at night  42  Between 1942 and 1945  V Mail   for  Victory Mail   service was available for military mail  Letters were converted into microfilm and reprinted near the destination  to save room on transport vehicles for military cargo  43  From 1982 to 1985 Electronic Computer Originated Mail was accepted for bulk mailings  Text was transmitted electronically to one of 25 post offices nationwide  The Postal Service would print the mail and put it in special envelopes bearing a blue ECOM logo  Delivery was assured within 2 days  44   edit  Law enforcement agencies  edit  Postal Inspection Service The United States Postal Inspection Service  USPIS  is one of the oldest law enforcement agencies in the U S  Founded by Benjamin Franklin  its mission is to protect the Postal Service  its employees  and its customers from crime and protect the nation s mail system from criminal misuse  45  Postal Inspectors enforce over 200 federal laws providing for the protection of mail in investigations of crimes that may adversely affect or fraudulently use the U S  Mail  the postal system or postal employees  The USPIS has the power to enforce the USPS monopoly by conducting search and seizure raids on entities they suspect of sending non urgent mail through overnight delivery competitors  According to the American Enterprise Institute  a private conservative think tank  the USPIS raided Equifax offices in 1993 to ascertain if the mail they were sending through Federal Express was truly  extremely urgent   It was found that the mail was not  and Equifax was fined  30 000  46  Lastly  the PIS oversees the activities of the Postal Police Force who patrol in and around selected high risk postal facilities in major metropolitan areas in the United States and its territories   edit  Office of Inspector General The United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General  OIG  was authorized by law in 1996  Prior to the 1996 legislation  the Postal Inspection Service performed the duties of the OIG  The Inspector General  who is independent of postal management  is appointed by and reports directly to the nine presidentially appointed  Senate confirmed members of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service  The primary purpose of the OIG is to prevent  detect and report fraud  waste and program abuse  and promote efficiency in the operations of the Postal Service  The OIG has  oversight  responsibility for all activities of the Postal Inspection Service   edit  Elements of addressing and preparing domestic mail All mailable articles  e g   letters  flats  machinable parcels  irregular parcels  etc   shipped within the United States must comply with an array of standards published in the USPS Domestic Mail Manual  DMM   47  Before addressing the mailpiece  one must first comply with the various mailability standards relating to attributes of the actual mailpiece such as  minimum maximum dimensions 48   amp  weight  acceptable mailing containers  proper mailpiece sealing closure  utilization of various markings  and restrictions relating to various hazardous  e g   explosives  flammables  etc    amp  restricted  e g   cigarettes  smokeless tobacco  etc   materials  as well as others articulated in   601 of the DMM  49  The USPS specifies the following key elements when preparing the face of a mailpiece  Proper Placement  The Delivery Address should be left justified and located roughly in the center of mailpiece s largest side  More precisely  on a letter size piece  the recommended address placement is within the optical character reader  OCR  read area  which is a space on the address side of the mailpiece defined by these boundaries  Left   1 2 inch  13 mm  from the left edge of the piece  Right   1 2 inch  13 mm  from the right edge of the piece  Top   2 3 4 inches  70 mm  from the bottom edge of the piece  Bottom   5 8 inch  16 mm  from the bottom edge of the piece  50  Preferred placement of a return address is in the upper left portion of the mailpiece on the side of the piece bearing postage  51  Finally  postage  e g   stamps  meter imprints  information based indicia  IBI   etc   is to be affixed in the upper right corner of the address side of the mail cover  It should be noted that any stamp indicia partly concealed or otherwise obscured by an overlapping stamp indicia may not be counted as valid postage  52  Delivery Address  party receiving mail   The mail piece must have the address of the intended recipient  visible and legible  only on the side of the mail piece bearing postage  Generally  the name of the addressee should be included above the address itself  A ZIP 4 code will facilitate delivery  53  Return Address  party sending mail   A return address tells the USPS where the sender wants the mail returned if it is undeliverable  Usage of a return address is required for most all postal services  e g   all parcel services  Priority Mail  Express Mail  Periodicals in envelopes or wrappers  Insured Mail  Registered Mail  etc    54  Postage Payment  All mailpieces must include appropriate valid postage  Postage payment may be in the form of stamps  stamped stationery  precanceled stamps  postage meter imprints  amp  PC Postage products   Postage Evidencing Systems    or permit imprint  indicia   55  Members of the U S  Congress  among others  have franking privileges  which require only a signature  Domestic first class mail costs 45  for envelopes  32  for post cards  and upwards  depending on the weight and dimensions of the letter and the class  Undeliverable mails that cannot be readily returned  including those without return addresses  are treated as dead mails at a Mail Recovery Center in Atlanta  Georgia or Saint Paul  Minnesota  Sticker promoting ZIP code use  The formatting of the address is as follows Line 1  Name of recipient Line 2  Street address or P O  Box Line 3  City  State  ISO 3166 2 US code or APO FPO code  and ZIP 4 code Example John Q  Public 789 UNIVERSAL DR PORTLAND  OR 97086 1234 The USPS maintains a list of proper abbreviations  56  The formatting of a return address is identical  Though some style manuals recommend using a comma between the city and state name when typesetting addresses in other contexts  for optimal automatic character recognition  the Post Office does not recommend this when addressing mail  The official recommendation is to use all upper case block letters with appropriate formats and abbreviations  and leave out all punctuation except for the hyphen in the ZIP 4 code  If the address is unusually formatted or illegible enough  it will require hand processing  delaying that particular item  The USPS publishes the entirety of their postal addressing standards  57  Customers can look up ZIP codes on usps com  and purchase postage if

Stamps with no value shown or denominated by a letter are also still valid  although the value depends upon the particular stamp  For some stamps issued without a printed value  the current value is the original value  But some stamps beginning in 1988 or earlier  including  Forever Stamps  that were issued beginning in April 2007  and all 1st class mail 1st ounce stamps beginning 2011 01 21  the

physical evidence of postage  or franking  to mailed matter  Postage meters are regulated by a country s postal authority  for example  in the United States  the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation  support  and use of postage meters  A postage meter imprints an amount of postage  functioning as a postage stamp  a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one  The meter stamp serves as proof of payment and eliminates the need for adhesive stamps   edit  PC postage In addition to using standard stamps  postage can now be printed in the form of an electronic stamp  or e stamp  from a personal computer using a system called Information Based Indicia  This online PC Postage method relies upon application software on the customer s computer contacting a postal

Formerly  USPS International services 76  were categorized as Airmail  Letter Post   Economy  Surface  Parcel Post  Airmail Parcel Post  Global Priority  Global Express  and Global Express Guaranteed Mail  The former Airmail  Letter Post  is now First Class Mail International  77  78  and includes small packages weighing up to four pounds  1 8 kg   Economy Parcel Post was discontinued for international service  while Airmail Parcel Post was replaced by Priority Mail International  Priority Mail International Flat Rate packaging in various sizes was introduced  with the same conditions of service previously used for Global Priority  Global Express is now Express Mail International  while Global Express Guaranteed is unchanged  The international mailing classes with a tracking ability are Express  Express Guaranteed  and Priority  except that tracking is not available for Priority Mail International Flat Rate Envelopes or Priority Mail International Small Flat Rate Boxes   79  One of the major changes in the new naming and services definitions is that USPS supplied mailing boxes for Priority and Express mail are now allowed for international use  These services are offered to ship letters and packages to almost every country and territory on the globe  Ironically  the USPS provides much of this service by contracting with a private parcel service  FedEx  80  On May 14  2007  the USPS canceled all outgoing international surface mail  sometimes known as  sea mail   from the United States  citing increased costs and reduced demand due to competition from airmail services such as FedEx and UPS  81  The decision has been criticized by the Peace Corps and military personnel overseas  as well as independent booksellers and other small businesses who rely on international deliveries  The USPS provides an M bag 82  service for international shipment of printed matter  83  previously surface M bags existed  but with the 2007 elimination of surface mail  only airmail M bags remain  84  The term  M bag  is not expanded in USPS publications  M bags are simply defined as  direct sacks of printed matter     sent to a single foreign addressee at a single address   83  however  the term is sometimes referred to informally as  media bag   as the bag can also contain  discs  tapes  and cassettes   in addition to books  for which the usual umbrella term is  media   some also refer to them as  mail bags   Military mail is billed at domestic rates when being sent from the United States to a military outpost  and is free when sent by deployed military personnel  The overseas logistics are handled by the Military Postal Service Agency in the Department of Defense  85  Outside of forward areas and active operations  military mail First Class takes 7 10 days  Priority 10 15 days  and Parcel Post about 24 days  70   edit  Airline and rail division The United States Postal Service does not directly own or operate any aircraft or trains  The mail and packages are flown on airlines with which the Postal Service has a contractual agreement  The contracts change periodically  Depending on the contract  aircraft may be painted with the USPS paint scheme  citation needed  Contract airlines have included  UPS  Emery Worldwide  Ryan International Airlines  FedEx Express  Rhoades Aviation  American Airlines  United Airlines  and Express One International  The Postal Service also contracts with Amtrak to carry some mail between certain cities such as Chicago and Minneapolis   Saint Paul  The last air delivery route in the continental U S   to residents in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness  was scheduled to be ended in June 2009  The weekly bush plane route  contracted out to an air taxi company  had in its final year an annual cost of  46 000  or  2400 year per residence  over ten times the average cost of delivering mail to a residence in the United States  86  This decision has been reversed by the U S  Postmaster General  87   edit  Sorting and delivery process Mail Flow through National Infrastructure Processing of standard sized envelopes and cards is highly automated  including reading of handwritten addresses  Mail from individual customers and public postboxes is collected by mail carriers into plastic tubs  The tubs are taken to a Processing and Distribution Center  P amp DC   There are approximately 275 such centers across the United States  which sort mail for a given region  typically a radius of around 200 miles  and connect with the national network for interregional mail  88  At the P amp DC  mail is emptied into hampers which are then automatically dumped into a Dual Pass Rough Cull System  DPRCS   As mail travels through the DPRCS  large items  such as packages and mail bundles  are removed from the stream  As the remaining mail enters the first machine for processing standard mail  the Advanced Facer Canceler System  AFCS   pieces that passed through the DPRCS but do not conform to physical dimensions for processing in the AFCS  i e  large envelopes or overstuffed standard envelopes  are automatically diverted from the stream  Mail removed from the DPRCS and AFCS is manually processed or sent to parcel sorting machines  In contrast to the previous system  which merely canceled and postmarked the upper right corner of the envelope  thereby missing any stamps which were inappropriately placed  the Advanced Facer Canceler System locates indicia  stamp or metered postage mark   regardless of the orientation of the mail as it enters the machine  and cancels it by applying a postmark  Detection of indicia enables the AFCS to determine the orientation of each mailpiece and sort it accordingly  rotating pieces as necessary so all mail is sorted right side up and faced in the same direction in each output bin  Mail is output by the machine into three categories  mail already affixed with a bar code and addressed  such as business reply envelopes and cards   mail with machine printed  typed  addresses  and mail with handwritten addresses  Additionally  machines with a recent Optical Character Recognition  OCR  upgrade have the capability to read the address information  including handwritten  and sort the mail based on local or outgoing ZIP codes  Mail with typed addresses goes to a Multiline Optical Character Reader  MLOCR  which reads the ZIP Code and address information and prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelope  Mail  actually the scanned image of the mail  with handwritten addresses  and machine printed ones that are not easily recognized  goes to the Remote Bar Coding System  It also corrects spelling errors and  where there is an error  omission  or conflict in the written address  identifies the most likely correct address  When it has decided on a correct address  it prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelopes  similarly to the MLOCR system  RBCS also has facilities in place  called Remote Encoding Centers  that have humans look at images of mail pieces and enter the address data  The address data is associated with the image via an ID Tag  a fluorescent Barcode printed by mail processing equipment on the back of mail pieces  If a customer has filed a change of address card and his or her mail is detected in the mailstream with the old address  the mailpiece is sent to a machine that automatically connects to a Computerized Forwarding System database to determine the new address  If this address is found  the machine will paste a label over the former address with the current address  The mail is returned to the mailstream to forward to the new location  Mail with addresses that cannot be resolved by the automated system are separated for human intervention  If a local postal worker can read the address  he or she manually sorts it out according to the ZIP code on the article  If the address cannot be read  mail is either returned to the sender  first class mail with a valid return address  or is sent to the Mail Recovery Center in Atlanta  Georgia  formerly known as Dead Letter Offices  originated by Benjamin Franklin in the 1770s citation needed   where it receives more intense scrutiny  including being opened to determine if any of the contents are a clue  If no valid address can be determined  the items are held for 90 days in case of inquiry by the customer  and if they are not claimed then they are either destroyed or auctioned off at the monthly Postal Service Unclaimed Parcel auction to raise money for the service  Once the mail is bar coded  it is automatically sorted by a Delivery Bar Code System that reads the bar code and determines the destination of the mailpiece to postal stations  Regional mail is trucked to the appropriate local post office or kept in the building for carrier routes served directly from the P amp DC  Out of region mail is trucked to the airport and then flown  usually as baggage on commercial airlines  to the airport nearest the destination station  At the destination P amp DC  mail is once again read by a DBCS which sorts the items into their local destinations  including grouping them by individual mail carrier  At the carrier route level  95  of letters arrive pre sorted  88  the remaining mail must be sorted by hand  The Post Office is working to increase the percentage of automatically sorted mail  including a pilot program to sort  flats   89   edit  Types of postal facilities Historic main post office in Tomah  Wisconsin  A typical post office station in the Spring Branch area of Houston  Texas Combined Post Office  Customs House  and Federal Court House in Galveston  Texas  Although its customer service centers are called post offices in regular speech  the USPS recognizes several types of postal facilities  including the following  A main post office  formerly known as a general post office  is the primary postal facility in a community  A station or post office station  a postal facility that is not the main post office  but that is within the corporate limits of the community  A branch or post office branch  a postal facility that is not the main post office and that is outside the corporate limits of the community  A classified unit  a station or branch operated by USPS employees in a facility owned or leased by the USPS  A contract postal unit  or CPU   a station or branch operated by a contractor  typically in a store or other place of business  90  A community post office  or CPO   a contract postal unit providing services in a small community in which other types of post office facilities have been discontinued  A finance unit  a station or branch that provides window services and accepts mail  but does not provide delivery  A processing and distribution center  P amp DC  or processing and distribution facility  formerly known as a General Mail Facility   a central mail facility that processes and dispatches incoming and outgoing mail to and from a designated service area   275 nationwide   88  An international service center  ISC   an international mail processing facility  There are only five such USPS facilities in the United States  located in Chicago  New York  Miami  Los Angeles and San Francisco  91  A sectional center facility  SCF   a P amp DC for a designated geographical area defined by one or more three digit ZIP code prefixes  A network distribution center  formerly known as a bulk mail center  BMC   a central mail facility that processes bulk rate parcels as the hub in a hub and spoke

receive images of problem mail pieces  those with hard to read addresses  etc   via secure Internet type feeds and manually type the addresses they can decipher  using a special encoding protocol  The mail pieces are then sprayed with the correct addresses or are sorted for further handling according to the instructions given via encoding  The total number of RECs is down from 55 in 1998 to just 5 centers in April 2009  In 2010  there will be just two remaining RECs open  in Salt Lake City  Utah and Wichita  Kansas  More closures will occur as computer software becomes more able to read most addresses  but a few centers are expected to remain open  see Evolutionary Network Development below   A 24 hour Automated Postal Center kiosk inside the Webster  Texas Main Post Office A village post office  VPO   a post office concept beginning in 2011  village post offices are an integral part of the USPS plan to close low volume post offices  Many of these will be replaced with village post offices that will fill the role of the post office within that zip code and be located in local business or government centers and operated by those entities as specified in the contract negotiated between the entity and USPS  92  While common usage refers to all types of postal facilities as  substations   the USPS Glossary of Postal Terms does not define or even list that word  90  Post Offices often share facilities with other governmental organizations located within a city s central business district  In those locations  often Courthouses and Federal Buildings  the building is

95  Temporary stations are also set up for applying pictorial cancellations   edit  Automated Postal Centers In 2004 the USPS began deploying Automated Postal Centers  APC   96  APCs are unattended kiosks that are capable of weighing  franking  and storing packages for later pickup as well as selling domestic and international postage stamps  Similarly  traditional vending machines are available at many post offices to purchase stamps  though these are being phased out in many areas  97  Due to increasing use of Internet services  as of June  2009  no retail post office windows are open 24 hours  overnight services are limited to those provided by an Automated Postal Center  98   edit  Evolutionary Network Development  END  program In February 2006  the USPS announced that they plan to replace the nine existing facility types with five processing facility types  99  Regional Distribution Centers  RDCs   which will process all classes of parcels and bundles and serve as Surface Transfer Centers  Local Processing Centers  LPCs   which will process single piece letters and flats and cancel mail  Destination Processing Centers  DPC   sort the mail for individual mail carriers  Airport Transfer Centers  ATCs   which will serve as transfer points only  and Remote Encoding Centers  RECs   Over a period of years  these facilities are expected to replace Processing  amp  Distribution Centers  Customer Service Facilities  Bulk Mail Centers  Logistic and Distribution Centers  annexes  the Hub and Spoke Program  Air Mail Centers  and International Service Centers  The

California USPS Ford Windstar used for residential delivery in Olympia  Washington  edit  Delivery days Until 1912  mail was delivered seven days a week  As the postal service grew in popularity and usage in the 19th century  local religious leaders noticed a decline in Sunday morning church attendance because of local post offices  doubling as gathering places  These leaders appealed to the government to intervene and close post offices on Sundays  100  101  Because of this intervention by the government  U S  Mail  with the exception of Express Mail  102  is not delivered on Sunday  except in a few towns in which the local religion has had an effect on the policy  such as Loma Linda  California  which has a significant Seventh day Adventist population 100  and where U S  Mail is delivered Sunday through Friday  with the exception of observed federal holidays  Saturday delivery was temporarily suspended in April 1957  because of lack of funds  but quickly restored  103  104  On January 28  2009  Postmaster General John E  Potter testified before the Senate 105  that  if the Postal Service could not readjust its payment toward the pre funding of retiree health benefits  as mandated by the Postal Accountability  amp  Enhancement Act of 2006  106  the USPS would be forced to consider cutting delivery to five days per week during June  July  and August  H R  22  addressing this issue  passed the House of Representatives and Senate and was signed into law on September 30  2009  However  PMG Potter has continued to unveil a plan to eliminate Saturday mail delivery  The universal service obligation 107  and six day delivery are upheld by Congressional language within Appropriations legislation  so a reduction in service would require action from the House and Senate  108  On June 10  2009  the NRLCA was contacted for its input on the USPS s current study of the impact of five day delivery along with developing an implementation plan for a five day service plan  A team of postal service headquarters executives and staff has been given a time frame of sixty days to complete the study  The current concept examines the impact of five day delivery with no business or collections on Saturday  with Post Offices with current Saturday hours remaining open  Chairman Jos  Serrano  D NY   of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government  which oversees language mandating six day service  said  While I understand the seriousness of the Postal Service s fiscal issues  I remain supportive of a six day delivery schedule  I will be in conversations in coming weeks with the senior postal leadership and the postal unions in an effort to avoid service cuts   On Thursday  April 15  2010  the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing to examine the status of the Postal Service and recent reports on short and long term strategies for the financial viability and stability of the USPS entitled  Continuing to Deliver  An Examination of the Postal Service s Current Financial Crisis and its Future Viability   At which  PMG Potter testified that by the year 2020  the USPS cumulative losses could exceed  238 billion  and that mail volume could drop 15 percent from 2009  109   edit  Direct delivery vs  customer pickup Originally  mail was not delivered to homes and businesses  but to post offices  In 1863   city delivery  began in urban areas with enough customers to make this economical  This required streets to be named  houses to be numbered  with sidewalks and lighting provided  and these street addresses to be added to envelopes  110  The number of routes served expanded over time  In 1891  the first experiments with Rural Free Delivery began in less densely populated areas  To compensate for high mail volume and slow long distance transportation which saw mail arrive at post offices throughout the day  deliveries were made multiple times a day  This ranged from twice for residential areas to up to seven times for the central business district of Brooklyn  New York  111  In the late 19th century  mail boxes were encouraged  saving carriers the time it took to deliver directly to the addressee in person  in the 1910s and 1920s  they were phased in as a requirement for service  110  In the 1940s  multiple daily deliveries began to be reduced  especially on Saturdays  By 1990  the last twice daily deliveries in New York City were eliminated  Today  mail is delivered once a day on site to most private homes and businesses  The USPS still distinguishes between city delivery  where carriers generally walk and deliver to mailboxes hung on exterior walls or porches  or to commercial reception areas  and rural delivery  where carriers generally drive   112  With  curbside delivery   mailboxes are at the ends of driveways  on the nearest convenient road   Central point delivery  is used in some locations  where several nearby residences share a  cluster  of individual mailboxes in a single housing  Some customers choose to use post office boxes for an additional fee  for privacy or convenience  This provides a locked box at the post office to which mail is addressed and delivered  usually earlier in the day than home delivery   Customers in less densely populated areas where there is no city delivery and who do not qualify for rural delivery may receive mail only through post office boxes  High volume business customers can also arrange for special pick up  113  114  Another option is the old style general delivery  for people who have neither post office boxes nor street addresses  Mail is held at the post office until they present identification and pick it up  Some customers receive free post office boxes if the USPS declines to provide door to door delivery to their location or a nearby box  115  People with medical problems can request door to door delivery  116 Homeless people are also eligible for post office boxes at the discretion of the local postmaster  or can use general delivery  117   edit  Special delivery From 1885 to 1997  a service called special delivery was available  which caused a separate delivery to the final location earlier in the day than the usual daily rounds   edit  Forwarding and holds Residential customers can fill out a form to forward mail to a new address  and can also send pre printed forms to any of their frequent correspondents  They can also put their mail on  hold   for example  while on vacation  The Post Office will store mail during the hold  instead of letting it overflow in the mailbox  These services are not available to large buildings and customers of a commercial mail receiving agency  118  where mail is subsorted by non Post Office employees into individual mailboxes   edit  Employment in the USPS A Rural Letter Carrier from Fort Myers  Florida The Postal Service is the nation s second largest civilian employer  2  As of 2011 update   it employed 574 000 personnel  divided into offices  processing centers  and actual post offices  2  The United States Postal Service is a Fortune 500 company  Labor unions representing USPS employees include  the National Association of Letter Carriers  NALC   which represents city letter carriers  the National Rural Letter Carriers  Association  NRLCA   which represents rural letter carriers  and the National Postal Mail Handlers Union  NPMHU   USPS employees are divided into three major crafts according to the work they engage in  Mail carriers  also referred to as mailmen or letter carriers  prepare and deliver mail and parcels  They are divided into two categories  City Letter Carriers  who are represented by the NALC  and Rural Letter Carriers  who are represented by the NRLCA  City carriers are paid hourly with the potential for overtime  City Carriers are also subject to  undertime  on a daily basis citation needed    Pivoting  is when a Carrier s assigned route will take less than 8 hours to complete  Management may  pivot  the Carrier to work on another route to fill that Carrier up to 8 hours  Pivoting is a tool postal management uses to redistribute and eliminate overtime costs  based on consultation with the Carrier about his her estimated workload for the day and mail volume projections from the DOIS  Delivery Operations Information System  computer program  City Carrier routes are adjusted and  or eliminated based on information  length  time  and overall workload  also controlled by this program  consultations with the Carrier assigned to the route  and a current PS
