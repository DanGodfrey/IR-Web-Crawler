center The Panama Canal  Spanish  Canal de Panam   is an 82 kilometre  51 mi  ship canal in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean  via the Caribbean Sea  to the Pacific Ocean  The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade  Work on the canal  which began in 1880  was completed in 1914  making it no longer necessary for ships to sail the lengthy Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America and to navigate the dangerous waters of the Strait of Magellan  One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken  the Panama Canal shortcut made it possible for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in half the time previously required  The shorter  faster  safer route to the U S  West Coast and to nations in and along the Pacific Ocean allowed those places to become more integrated with the world economy  Ownership of the territory that is now the Panama Canal was first Colombian  then French and then American before coming under the control of the Panamanian government in 1999  The Panama Canal has seen annual traffic rise from about 1 000 ships when it opened in 1914  to 14 702 vessels in 2008  the latter measuring a total of 309 6 million Panama Canal Universal Measurement System  PC UMS  tons  By 2008  more than 815 000 vessels had passed through the canal  many of them much larger than the original planners could have envisioned  the largest ships that can transit the canal today are called Panamax  1  The American Society of Civil Engineers has named the Panama Canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world  2  Contents 1 History 1 1 French construction  1881 1889 1 2 1890 1903 1 3 United States acquisition  1904 1 4 Isthmian Canal Commission 1 5 U S

History Satellite image showing location of Panama canal  Dense jungles are visible in green  Main article  History of the Panama Canal The earliest mention of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama dates to 1534  when Charles V  Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain  ordered a survey for a route through the Americas that would ease the voyage for ships traveling between Spain and Peru  Such a route would have given the Spanish a military advantage over the Portuguese  3  During an expedition from 1788 to 1793  Alessandro Malaspina outlined plans for its construction  4  Given the strategic location of Panama and the potential offered by its narrow isthmus separating two great oceans  other trade links in the area were attempted over the years  An ill fated Darien scheme was launched by the Kingdom of Scotland in 1698 to set up an overland trade route  but generally inhospitable conditions thwarted the effort  and it was abandoned in July  1699  5  In 1849  the discovery of gold in California created great interest in a crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans  Eventually  the Panama Railway was built to cross the isthmus  opening in 1855  This overland link became a vital piece of Western Hemisphere infrastructure  greatly facilitating trade and largely determining the later canal route  An all water route between the oceans was still seen as the ideal solution  and in 1855 William Kennish  a Manx born engineer working for the United States government  surveyed the isthmus and issued a report on a route for a proposed Panama Canal  6  His report was published in a book entitled The Practicality and Importance of a Ship Canal to Connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans  7  Encourgement for the idea of a canal was provided by the French success in building the Suez Canal   edit  French construction  1881 1889 In 1880  the first attempt to construct a sea level canal began under the leadership of Ferdinand de Lesseps  builder of the Suez Canal  with substantial financing and support from Paris  The French effort went bankrupt after reportedly spending USD  287 000 000  and was largely abandoned by 1890  The Suez Canal was built in a much more benign environment but still took 10 years to complete its 102 mile length  about twice that of the Panama Canal  The French  under Ferdinand de Lesseps  began construction on a sea level  i e   without locks  canal through what was then Colombia s province of Panama  on January 1  1880  The French rushed to begin work  with insufficient prior study of the geology and hydrology of the region  8  Excavation was conducted at such a steep angle that  in some years  rain induced landslides poured nearly as much material into the canal as had been removed  9  The cost and difficulty of building a canal in the rain soaked tropics through unstable mountains exceeded expectations  Health risks posed to workers in the mosquito infested Panamanian jungle  principally malaria and yellow fever  cost thousands of lives and caused unanticipated delays  Public health measures were ineffective because the role of the mosquito as a disease vector was then unknown  Accidents and disease cost about 22 000 workers their lives  These high death rates made it very difficult to maintain an experienced work force  Those French trained technical employees and engineers who remained healthy  often quickly returned to France after discovering the true work conditions  Even the hospitals contributed to the problem  with conditions that unintentionally provided breeding places for mosquitoes inside the unscreened wards  Added to this  the men who started and directed the project had little or no engineering training or experience  which contributed to grossly underestimating the difficulty they would encounter  as building the Panama Canal was a project of massive scale  The geology worked to defeat them as canals cut though mountains had to continually be widened  and their slopes reduced  to minimize landslides into the canal  Lack of field experience  such as with tropical downpours that caused steel equipment to rust rapidly  contributed more difficulty  10  In addition  there was the limited types of heavy duty engineering and electrical equipment available in this time period  Steam shovels had been invented but were still primitive  as were other types of heavy duty equipment  electrical generators  electrical motors and electrical distribution systems  etc  were still in their infancy  as Nikola Tesla had only just invented the alternating current  or  AC   motor in 1886  Beyond the hygienic and technical difficulties  financial mismanagement and political corruption also contributed to the French failure  Conditions were downplayed in France to avoid recruitment problems  8  but in 1893  after a great deal of work  the French scheme was abandoned  8  Disease and the sheer difficulty of building a sea level canal were ultimately insurmountable  A second French company was created in 1894  the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama  to finish the construction  A minimal workforce of a few thousand people was employed primarily to comply with the terms of the Colombian Panama Canal concession  to run the Panama Railroad  and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in salable condition  The company sought a buyer for these assets  with an asking price of USD 109 000 000   edit  1890 1903 At this time  various parties who   in the United States were interested in establishing a canal across the isthmus  with some favoring a route across Nicaragua  see Nicaragua Canal and Ecocanal  and others advocating the purchase of the French interests in Panama  A U S  engineering panel was commissioned to study the potential of building the canal and recommended a sea level canal to President Theodore Roosevelt  However  more extensive engineering studies favored a canal using a lock system to raise and lower ships from a large reservoir 85 feet  26 m  above sea level  This canal design was recommended to President Theodore Roosevelt by Chief Engineer John Frank Stevens and was agreed to by him  The 115 feet  35 m  high Gatun Dam  would create both the largest dam and the largest man made lake  Gatun Lake  in the world at that time  In the end  a canal that operated with an elevated reservoir and a system of three locks to raise ships above sea level to Gatun Lake  and then lower them on the opposite ocean with another set of three locks  was seen as much less expensive  faster to build  and more feasible in design than the original vision of a sea level canal  The water to fill and empty the locks would be taken from Gatun Lake by opening and closing enormous gates and valves and letting gravity propel the water from the lake  Gatun Lake would connect to the Pacific through the mountains at the Gaillard  Culebra  Cut  Eventually  in June 1902  the U S  Senate voted in favor of pursuing the Panamanian option  provided the necessary rights could be obtained   It is claimed that the vote was swayed by William Nelson Cromwell  11   On January 22  1903  the Hay Herran Treaty was signed by United States Secretary of State John M  Hay and Dr  Tom s Herr n of Colombia  It would have granted the United States a renewable lease in perpetuity from Colombia on the land proposed for the canal  12  This is often misinterpreted as the  99 year lease  because of misleading wording included in article 22 of the agreement  That wording refers to property within the purchased area  but does not pertain to control of the canal or the right of the United States to renew its lease indefinitely  13  The treaty was ratified by the U  S  Senate on March 14  1903  but the Senate of Colombia did not ratify it  Phillipe Bunau Varilla  chief engineer and significant shareholder of the French canal company  told U S  President Theodore Roosevelt and Hay of a possible revolt  and hoped that the United States would support Panamanian rebels who aimed to separate from Colombia  by providing U S  troops and money  Roosevelt changed tactics  promising support for the separation of Panama from Colombia  On November 2  1903  U S  warships blocked sea lanes for possible Colombian troops movements en route to put down the revolution  Dense jungles blocked Colombia s land routes  Reportedly  extensive bribes were paid to get the few Colombian troops stationed in Panama to lay down their arms  Panama declared their independence the next day  November 3  1903  The U  S  quickly recognized the new nation of Panama  On November 6  1903  Phillipe Bunau Varilla  Panama s ambassador to the United States  signed the Hay Bunau Varilla Treaty  granting rights to the United States to build and indefinitely administer the Panama Canal Zone and its defences  Although Bunau Varilla was serving as Panama s ambassador  he was a French citizen and was not officially authorized to sign treaties on behalf of Panama without Panamanian review  citation needed  This issue would later become a contentious diplomatic issue between Panama and the U S   edit  United States acquisition  1904 Construction work on the Gaillard Cut is shown in this photograph from 1907 In 1904  the United States  under President Theodore Roosevelt  bought the French equipment and excavations for US 40 million  paid the new country of Panama US 10 million plus more each year  and began work on the Panama Canal on May 4  1904   In 1921  the United States paid Colombia US 10 million  plus US 250 000 per annum for several years  and in return Colombia recognized Panama under the terms of the Thomson Urrutia Treaty   The United States purchase of the French concession for US 40 million included the Panama Railroad  Further  it was estimated that French excavation of about 30 000 000 cu yd  22 936 646 m3   primarily in the Gaillard Cut  then called the Culebra Cut   was of direct use to the U S  construction effort and was valued at about  1 00 per 1 cu yd  1 m3   or  30 000 000  The remaining usable French equipment  engineering surveys  etc  were valued at about  10 000 000 more  14   edit  Isthmian Canal Commission Main article  Isthmian Canal Commission The Isthmian Canal Commission  often known as the ICC  was a U S  government commission set up to oversee the construction of the Panama Canal in the early years of American involvement  Established in 1904  it was given control of the Panama Canal Zone over which the United States exercised sovereignty  1  The commission reported directly to Secretary of War William Howard Taft  It was initially composed of seven members  appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt  directed to avoid the inefficiency and corruption that had plagued the French 15 years earlier  On May 6  1904  President Theodore Roosevelt appointed John Findlay Wallace  formerly Chief Engineer and finally General Manager of the Illinois Central Railroad  as Chief Engineer of the Panama Canal Project  Wallace was paid a  25 000 annual salary the highest of any government employee at that time other than the President  In addition to the engineering and health problems Wallace faced many bureaucratic challenges from the Isthmian Canal Commission  ICC  who had to approve essentially every significant decision Wallace made in the Canal Zone  With engineers filling out more than 1 000 work request forms weekly  even the simplest tasks often took months to complete  In addition to  make dirt fly  as directed by Theodore Roosevelt he was forced to use the often dilapidated infrastructure and equipment left behind by the French when they sold their concession  15  The ICC was later reduced to three members on the recommendation of John Findlay Wallace  the Chief Engineer  Overwhelmed  Wallace resigned abruptly in June 1905  In 1906 when a new Chief Engineer John Frank Stevens was appointed  he wasn t a member of the Commission  He increasingly viewed the bureaucratic ICC as a serious hindrance and ended up bypassing the Commission and sending requests and demands straight to the Roosevelt Administration in Washington  In Washington  D C   Joseph Bucklin Bishop  an associate of Theodore Roosevelt and a strong editorial advocate for U S  participation in the Canal project  was appointed Executive Secretary of the Isthmian Canal Commission the following year  1905   Bishop was tasked with managing the Commission s day to day matters  but also with ensuring public support for the canal through public relations and by keeping the project s official history  Bishop s promised  10 000 annual salary was relentlessly criticized by Roosevelt s opponents in Congress  mostly because it was twice what each of them made  Opposition newspapers joined in the criticism  In the summer of 1907  when escalating allegations of cronyism surrounding Bishop s appointment threatened appropriations for Panama Canal construction  Taft  surely with Roosevelt s quiet assent  ordered Bishop out of Washington to Panama  where the partisan political heat would be less intense   I accept your decision without reluctance   Bishop informed Taft   and shall go to the Isthmus  not sadly but cheerfully   16  It would not be his first trip to Panama  In the fall of the previous year  Bishop had gone ahead to advance Roosevelt s historic inspection tour  the first time a sitting President had journeyed outside the U S  Joseph Bucklin Bishop would  except for month long summer breaks  remain on the isthmus for seven years  serving clandestinely at first as Theodore Roosevelt s  eyes and ears   He reported back on the  astonishing  progress that Army Corps of Engineers Colonel George Washington Goethals and his team were making excavating the  big ditch   building dams and locks  Before long  Bishop became Goethals s trusted aide  serving as his first line of defense against workers with complaints and grievances  But Bishop s greatest achievement in Panama would be as founding editor of The Canal Record  a weekly newspaper for the thousands of workers in Panama  His regular reports of cubic yards dug by rival work divisions  and the competitive baseball games they played  created a spirit of healthy competition that lifted worker morale and productivity  The  good news  of The Canal Record also built vital public support on newspaper editorial pages back home and in the halls of the United States Congress  where annual appropriations were required to keep the canal project moving forward   edit  U S  Panama Canal construction  1904 1914 Construction of locks on the Panama Canal  1913  For Panama Canal Pictures see  17   On May 6  1904  President Theodore Roosevelt appointed John Findlay Wallace  formerly Chief Engineer and finally General Manager of the Illinois Central Railroad  as Chief Engineer of the Panama Canal Project  Overwhelmed by the disease plagued country and forced to used often dilapidated French infrastructure and equipment as well as being frustrated by overly bureaucratic ICC Wallace resigned abruptly in June 1905  John Frank Stevens  a self educated engineer who had built the Northern Pacific Railroad  and the Chief Engineer of the Panama Canal from 1905 to 1907  successfully argued the case against the sea level canal  such the French had attempted  He convinced Theodore Roosevelt of the necessity and feasibility of a canal built with large dam and lake system with three double sets of locks to raise ships to the level of the reservoir and then lower them in locks at the other ocean  One of Stevens  primary achievements in Panama was in building and rebuilding the housing  cafeterias  hotels  water systems  repair shops  warehouses  and other infrastructure needed by the thousands of incoming workers  Stevens tried to provide accommodations where the incoming workers could work and reside in reasonable safety and comfort  Stevens began the recruitment effort to entice thousands of workers from the United States and other areas to come to the Canal zone to work  Initially  the reputation of the Canal Zone made recruiting labor difficult  The major inducements were wages ranging from  0 90 day for common laborers up to  8 00 day for steam shovel operators  a nine hour work day  three meals a day could be bought for as low as  0 30 day  subsidized housing  vacation and sick leave along with full medical coverage for nearly all  After a few years when it became clear that the Canal Zone was a reasonably safe place  for the time  to work with good wages and hours labor recruitment became much easier  Stevens saw to the Panama Railway s rebuilding and upgrading with modern heavy duty equipment  The railroad  starting in 1904  had to be comprehensively upgraded with heavy duty  double tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate new rolling stock of about 115 heavy duty locomotives and 2 300 dirt spoils railroad cars  The new Panama Railroad closely paralleled the canal where it could  and was moved and reconstructed where it interfered with canal work  In many places  the new Gatun Lake flooded over the original rail line and a new rail line had to be constructed above Lake Gatun s waterline by raising the track with massive dirt fills  using Gaillard Cut  etc  excavated materials   or by building bridges  Building the Lake Gatun reservoir would require less excavation by expensive steam shovels and allow more excavation work that could be done with less expensive dredges  The dredges could excavate material at a cost of about  0 25 0 50 cu yd  roughly half the cost of the shovels  The construction of a Panama Canal with locks still required the excavation of more than an additional 170 000 000 cu yd  129 974 326 m3  of material over the 30 000 000 cu yd  22 936 646 m3  excavated by the French  The lock canal and Lake Gatun lessened the amount of excavation to be done for an elevated canal vs  a sea level canal by roughly one half and saved several US 100 millions of dollars and years of time  Where necessary  in Lake Gatun  a ship channel could be reasonably cheaply dredged deeper  Colonel William C  Gorgas  formerly Chief Sanitation Officer in Havana under Dr  Walter Reed  was appointed Chief Sanitation Officer of the Canal construction project in 1904  Dr  Carlos Finlay had postulated in 1881 that mosquitoes may be key to transmitting the diseases of yellow fever and malaria  After the Spanish American War  1898   Finlay s theory was confirmed by Dr  Walter Reed of the U S  Army Medical Corps while in Havana Cuba in 1900   See also  Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal   Implementing the recommendations of Walter Reed and Dr  William Gorgas  Stevens also built proper housing with screens for canal workers and oversaw investment in extensive sanitation projects including extensive city water systems and mosquito abatement programs to minimize the spread of deadly mosquito spread diseases particularly malaria and yellow fever  The sanitation and mosquito abatement projects involved identifying and isolating patients with yellow fever or malaria  fumigation of buildings by burning sulfur or pyrethrum to kill mosquitoes  spraying insect breeding areas with oil and larvicide  paving roads in Panamanian towns to minimize stagnant water  mosquito netting over beds  introduction of window screens  installing city wide water systems to minimize or eliminate the often stagnant water in cisterns storing drinking water  elimination of stagnant water in open containers  draining swamps  etc  Even with all this effort  about 5 600 workers died of disease and accidents during the U S  construction phase of the canal  After two years of extensive sanitation and mosquito abatement work involving thousands of workers and millions of dollars the mosquito spread diseases were nearly eliminated  Extensive work also involving thousands and costing millions was done on preparing the infrastructure needed by the workers and their equipment  After the upgrading the Panama Railroad other preliminary preparation work were completed the construction of an elevated canal with locks began in earnest  Chief Engineer John Frank Stevens envisioned this work as essentially a massive earth moving project requiring using a new and expanded Panama Railway as efficiently as possible  Stevens previous work as Chief Engineer of the Northern Pacific Railroad where they had built several 1 000 miles  1 600 km  of track had prepared Stevens well for this task  Much of the excavated material was used to build part of the Gatun Dam and the new elevated railroad required to get across Gatun Lake  In addition to hauling the thousands of workers  millions of tons of supplies  equipment and spoils from the canal construction the railroad had to continue to carry its usual extensive loads of commercial freight and passengers to and from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans  Stevens resigned in 1907 as the work changed to primarily canal and lock construction  President Roosevelt in 1907 appointed U S  Army Colonel George Washington Goethals of the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to succeed him as Chief Engineer on the Panama Canal construction project  Colonel Goethals was a strong  United States Military Academy trained leader and civil engineer  experienced with dams  locks and canals  Col  Goethals  Chief Engineer from 1907 to 1914  divided the engineering and excavation work into three divisions Atlantic  Center and Pacific  The Atlantic division  under Major William L  Sibert  was responsible for construction of the massive breakwater at the entrance to Limon Bay  the Gatun locks and their 3 5 miles  5 6 km  approach channel  and the immense Gatun Dam  The Pacific Division  under Sydney B  Williamson  the only civilian member of this high level team   was similarly responsible for the Pacific 4 8 km  3 0 mi  breakwater in Panama Bay  the approach channel to the locks  and the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks and their associated dams and resrvoirs  The Central division  under Major David du Bose Gaillard of the United States Army Corps of Engineers was assigned one of the most difficult parts excavating the Gaillard Cut  then called the Culebra Cut  through the continental divide to connect Gatun Lake to the Pacific Panama Canal locks  18  To build a usable ship channel through the Galliard Cut involved excavating a wide  V  shaped trench through the often unstable mountains to get a stable 300 feet  91 m  wide ship channel  The Pacific end of the Gaillard Cut is about 8 miles  13 km  from the Pedro Miguel lock  The water in the cut has about 300 feet  91 m  wide ship channel and has a water level of about 85 feet  26 m  and a bottom of channel depth of about 40 feet  12 m  above sea level  Building Gatun Dam and Lake Gatun together with six double sets of ship locks reduced the amount of earth that needed to be excavated in the Galliard cut by about 85 feet  26 m  in depth by about 13 miles  21 km  long and a variable  V  shaped cut of 300 feet  91 m  to 2 600 feet  790 m  in width  cutting roughly in half the material that had to be removed by using an elevated canal design  In addition  the dam and lake provided a way to tame the often wild seasonal fluctuation of water levels in the Chagres River  the main source of water of Lake Gatun  The height of Lake Gatun is kept fairly constant by allowing excess water to go over the spillway near the Gatun Locks in the rainy season and the lake water effluent that does not pass through the locks or over the spillway generates hydroelectric power year round  There were about 102 new large railroad mounted steam shovels purchased and brought in from the United States  These shovels were used primarily used on the Culebra Cut and the lock building projects  These steam shovels were some of the largest in the world when they were introduced in 1906  The excavated material was broken up by explosives and then the loosened dirt was scooped up by steam shovels mounted on one set of railroad tracks which loaded the loose earth onto spoils railroad cars mounted on parallel tracks   See  Marion Steam shovel in action mounted on caterpillar tracks YouTube  19   The spoils cars were then hauled out by locomotives to a dump site or other site that needed back fill material  The Gatun Dam and Panama Railroad were two of the big users of this material  The interplay of getting required dirt cars in place to load as quickly as possible and the limitations on the available dirt cars  tracks  locomotives  etc  meant the average steam shovel only worked about fifty percent of the time in a nine hour day  Some of this down time was used for maintenance  repairs and re coaling the shovels  The Bucyrus company made 70 of the 102 steam shovels  used  The Marion Power Shovel Company built the remaining 32 shovels  Marion was acquired by Bucyrus in 1997 and the combined company was acquired by Caterpillar Inc  in a deal costing US 8 8 billion completed on July 8  2011  A Marion steam shovel excavating the Panama Canal in 1908 Most of the cars carrying the dirt spoils were wooden flat cars lined with steel floors that used a crude but effective unloading device  the Lidgerwood system  The railroad cars had only one closed side  and steel aprons bridged the spaces between the cars  The dirt was piled high up against the closed side of the car  The train moved forward as the cars were filled until all its cars were filled  A typical train had twenty such dirt cars arranged as one long gondola car  On arrival of the train at one of the approximately 60 different dumping grounds  a three ton steel plow was put on the last car  or a car carrying the plow was attached as the last car  and a huge winch with a braided steel cable stretching the length of all cars was attached to the engine  The winch  powered by the train s steam engine  pulled the plow the length of the dirt loaded train by winching up the steel cable  The plow scraped the dirt off the railroad cars  allowing the entire train load of dirt cars to be unloaded in about ten minutes or less  The plow and winch were then detached for use on another spoils train  Another plow  mounted on the side of a steam engine  then plowed the dirt spoils away from the track  20  When the fill got large enough  the track was relocated on top of the old fill to allow almost continuous unloading of new fill with a minimum amount of effort  William Bierd  former head of the Panama Railroad  developed techniques to pick up large sections of track and their attached ties  intact  when the steam shovels or dirt trains needed to move to a new section  A dozen men using steam powered cranes could relocate a mile of track a day this way  because there was no need to disassemble and rebuilt each section of track work that previously had taken up to 600 men  This allowed the tracks used by both the steam shovels and dirt trains to be quickly moved to wherever they needed to go  While constructing the Gaillard Cut  about 160 loaded dirt trains went out of the cut daily and returned empty  at a rate of one train about every one and a half minutes  The railroads  steam shovels  enormous steam powered cranes  giant hydraulic rock crushers  cement mixers  dredges  and pneumatic power drills used to drill holes for explosives  about 30 000 000 pounds  14 000 000 kg  were used  were some of the new  in 1906  pieces of construction equipment used to construct the canal  Nearly all this equipment was manufactured by new  extensive machine building technology developed and built in the United States  The giant hydraulic rock crushers supplied by the Joshua Hendy Iron Works were used to grind up rock needed for the cement work and quicken the pace of construction and large Ellicott Dredges of Baltimore  Maryland speeded up some of the various dredging projects  21  The first Ellicott Dredge delivered was a steam driven  900 hp  670 kW   20 inch suction dredge used to help dig canal channels and fill Gatun Dam with dredged up slurry  In 1941  Ellicott Dredges also built the dredge MINDI  a 10 000 hp  7 500 kW   28 inch cutter suction dredge still operating in the Panama Canal  Arch rivals General Electric and Westinghouse provided much of the electrical controls  motors  generators etc  The Panama Canal project had one of the largest and most extensive electrical installations in the world early in the 1900s  They use over 1000 electric motors with an installed capacity of about 28 000 horsepower to control their locks  valves  etc  from a central location 22  23  In addition  the canal used large refrigeration systems for making ice  The Panama Canal Locks used essentially no pumps but relied on giant electrical valves and gates to control the flow of water from Lake Gatun into and out of the locks through water tunnels the size of railroad tunnels  The Americans as fast as possible replaced or upgraded the old unusable French equipment with new construction equipment that was designed for a much larger and faster scale of work to quicken the pace of construction  earth cuts and fills  The technology succeeded in excavating many times the material that was moved with the original 1851 1855 railroad construction done essentially by hand and black powder explosives  Unusable French equipment was dug out of the jungle and sold as scrap  President Roosevelt had some of brass in the former French machinery minted into medals for all workers who spent at least two years on the construction to commemorate their contribution to the building of the canal  These medals featured Roosevelt s likeness on the front  the name of the recipient on one side  and the worker s years of service  as well as a picture of the Culebra Cut on the back  24  SS Kroonland at the Culebra Cut while transiting the Panama Canal on 2 February 1915  The building of the canal was completed in 1914 401 years after Panama was first crossed by Vasco N  ez de Balboa  One of several new innovation was the four to eight electrical powered  mule engines  on each side of the locks that were attached to each ship to stabilize their passage through the locks as they are guided through by canal pilots  In the end  the engineers and workers minimized the mosquito threat  moved  rebuilt and expanded the Panama Railroad  excavated over 200 000 000 cu yd  152 910 972 m3  of earth  built the world s largest  then  dam and a lake  poured about 2 000 000 cu yd  1 529 110 m3  of concrete creating a spillway at Gatun Lake to control its height  and formed three sets of double 110 feet  34 m  by 1 000 feet  300 m  ship s locks  then the largest concrete pour in the world  This was supported by an extensive buildup of U S  built  then modern  heavy duty excavation and construction equipment  and one of the world s earliest and most extensive electrical systems  used to power and control the flow of water into the locks and spillway  The U S  spent almost  375 000 000  roughly equivalent to  8 600 000 000 now 25    including  12 000 000 to build facilities used to guard the canal  to finish the project  This was  by far  the largest American engineering project of that or any previous era The canal was formally opened on August 15  1914 with the passage of the cargo ship SS Ancon  26  Coincidentally  this was also the same month that fighting in World War I  the Great War  began in Europe  The advances in hygiene resulted in a relatively low death toll during the American construction  still  about 5 600 workers died during this period  1904 1914   This brought the total death toll for the construction of the canal to around 27 500  27   edit  Later developments By the 1930s it was seen that water supply would be an issue for the canal  this prompted the building of the Madden Dam across the Chagres River above Gatun Lake  The dam  completed in 1935  created Madden Lake  later Alajuela Lake   which acts as additional water storage for the canal  28  In 1939  construction began on a further major improvement  a new set of locks for the canal  large enough to carry the larger warships which the United States was building at the time and had planned to continue building  The work proceeded for several years  and significant excavation was carried out on the new approach

tense  Many Panamanians felt that the Canal Zone rightfully belonged to Panama  student protests were met by the fencing in of the Zone and an increased military presence there  31  Unrest culminated in riots on Martyr s Day  January 9  1964  when approximately 20 Panamanians and 3 5 U S  soldiers were killed  A decade later  in 1974  negotiations toward a settlement began and resulted in the Torrijos Carter Treaties  On September 7  1977  the treaty was signed by President of the United States Jimmy Carter and Omar Torrijos  defacto leader of Panama  This mobilized the process of granting the Panamanians free control of the canal so long as Panama signed a treaty guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of the canal  The treaty led to full Panamanian control effective at noon on December 31  1999  and the Panama Canal Authority  ACP  assumed command of the waterway  The Panama Canal remains one of the chief revenue sources for Panama  Before this handover  the government of Panama held an international bid to negotiate a 25 year contract for operation of the container shipping ports located at the canal s Atlantic and Pacific outlets  The contract was not affiliated with the ACP or Panama Canal operations and was won by the firm Hutchison Whampoa  a Hong Kong based shipping concern whose owner is Li Ka shing   edit  Layout USS Missouri passes through the canal in 1945 While the Pacific Ocean is west of the isthmus and the Atlantic to the east  the direction of the 8  to 10 hour canal passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic is from southeast to northwest  This is because of an anomaly in the shape of the isthmus at the point the canal occupies  The Bridge of the Americas  Spanish  Puente de las Am ricas  at the Pacific side is about a third of a degree east of the Col n end on the Atlantic side  32  The canal consists of artificial lakes  several improved and artificial channels  and three sets of locks  An additional artificial lake  Alajuela Lake  known during the American era as Madden Lake   acts as a reservoir for the canal  The layout of the canal as seen by a ship passing from the Pacific end to the Atlantic is as follows  33  From the buoyed entrance channel in the Gulf of Panama  Pacific side   ships travel 13 2 km  8 2 mi  up the channel to the Miraflores locks  passing under the Bridge of the Americas  The two stage Miraflores lock system  including the approach wall  is 1 7 km  1 1 mi  long  with a total lift of 16 5 meters  54 ft  at mid tide  The artificial Miraflores Lake is the next stage  1 7 km  1 1 mi  long  and 16 5 meters  54 ft  above sea level  The single stage Pedro Miguel lock  which is 1 4 km  0 87 mi  long  is the last part of the ascent with a lift of 9 5 meters  31 ft  up to the main level of the canal  The Gaillard  Culebra  Cut slices 12 6 km  7 8 mi  through the continental divide at an altitude of 26 meters  85 ft   and passes under the Centennial Bridge  The Chagres River  R o Chagres   a natural waterway enhanced by the damming of Lake Gat n  runs west about 8 5 km  5 3 mi   merging into Lake Gatun  Gatun Lake  an artificial lake formed by the building of the Gatun Dam  carries vessels 24 2 km  15 0 mi  across the isthmus  The Gat n locks  a three stage flight of locks 1 9 km  1 2 mi  long  drop ships back down to sea level  A 3 2 km  2 0 mi  channel forms the approach to the locks from the Atlantic side  Lim n Bay  Bah a Lim n   a huge natural harbour  provides an anchorage for some ships awaiting passage  and runs 8 7 km  5 4 mi  to the outer breakwater  Thus  the total length of the canal is 77 1 km  47 9 mi   Map of this section s coordinates from GoogleMap of this section s coordinates from Bing Export this section s coordinates as KML Export this section s

Panama Canal Locks Miter lock gate at Gat n Lock gate at Miraflores The size of the locks determines the maximum size of a ship that can pass through them  Because of the importance of the canal to international trade  many ships are built to the maximum size allowed  These are known as Panamax vessels  A Panamax cargo ship typically has a DWT of 65 000 80 000 tonnes  but its actual cargo is restricted to about 52 500 tonnes because of the 41 2 feet  12 6 m  draft restrictions within the canal  34  The longest ship ever to transit the canal was the San Juan Prospector  now Marcona Prospector  an ore bulk oil carrier that is 973 ft  296 57 m  long  with a beam of 106 ft  32 31 m   35  Initially the locks at Gatun had been designed to be 28 5 meters  94 ft  wide  In 1908  the United States Navy requested that width be increased to at least 36 meters  118 ft   which would allow the passage of U S  naval ships  Eventually a compromise was made and the locks were built 33 53 meters  110 0 ft  wide  Each lock is 320 meters  1 050 ft  long with the walls ranging in thickness from 15 meters  49 ft  at the base to 3 meters  9 8 ft  at the top  The central wall between the parallel locks at Gat n is 18 meters  59 ft  thick and stands in excess of 24 meters  79 ft  high  The steel lock gates measure an average of 2 meters  6 6 ft  thick  19 5 meters  64 ft  wide and 20 meters  66 ft  high  36  It is the size of the locks  specifically the Pedro Miguel Locks  along with the height of the Bridge of the Americas at Balboa  that determine the Panamax metric and limit the size of ships that may use the canal  The 2006 Third lock lane project will create larger locks  allowing bigger ships to transit through deeper and wider channels  The allowed dimensions of ships will increase by 25  in length  51  in beam  and 26  in draft  as defined by New Panamax metrics  37   edit  Tolls Roll on roll off Ships  such as this one pictured here at Miraflores locks  are among the largest ships to pass through the canal  Tolls for the canal are decided by the Panama Canal Authority and are based on vessel type  size  and the type of cargo carried  38  For container ships  the toll is assessed on the ship s capacity expressed in twenty foot equivalent units or TEUs  One TEU is the size of a container measuring 20 feet  6 1 m  by 8 feet  2 44 m  by 8 5 feet  2 6 m   Effective May 1  2009  this toll is US 72 00 per TEU  A Panamax container ship may carry up to 4 400 TEU  The toll is calculated differently for passenger ships and for container ships carrying no cargo   in ballast    As of May 1  2009  2009  05 01  update   the ballast rate is US 57 60 per TEU  Passenger vessels in excess of 30 000 tons  PC UMS   known popularly as cruise ships  pay a rate based on the number of berths  that is  the number of passengers that can be accommodated in permanent beds  The per berth charge is currently  92 for unoccupied berths and  115 for occupied berths  Started in 2007  this fee has greatly increased the tolls for such ships  39  Passenger vessels of less than 30 000 tons  or with less than 33 tons per passenger  are charged on the same  per ton  schedule as freighters  40  Most other types of vessel pay a toll per PC UMS net ton  in which one  ton  is actually a volume of 100 cubic feet  2 83 m3    The calculation of tonnage for commercial vessels is quite complex   As of fiscal year 2008 update   this toll is US 3 90 per ton for the first 10 000 tons  US 3 19 per ton for the next 10 000 tons  US 3 82 per ton for the next 10 000 tons  and US 3 76 per ton thereafter  As with container ships  a reduced toll is charged for freight ships  in ballast   Small vessels up to 583 PC UMS net tons when carrying passengers or cargo  or up to 735 PC UMS net tons when in ballast  or up to 1 048 fully loaded displacement tons  are assessed minimum tolls based upon their length overall  according to the following table citation needed   Length of vessel Toll Up to 15 240 meters  50 ft  US 1 300 More than 15 240 meters  50 ft  up to 24 384 meters  80 ft  US 1 400 More than 24 384 meters  80 ft  up to 30 480 meters  100 ft  US 1 500 More than 30 480 meters  100 ft  US 2 400 The most expensive regular toll for canal passage to date was to the cruise ship Coral Princess  which paid US 380 500  citation needed  The least expensive toll was 36 cents to American adventurer Richard Halliburton  who swam the canal in 1928  41  The average toll is around US 54 000  The highest fee for priority passage charged through the Transit Slot Auction System was US 220 300  paid on August 24  2006 by the Panamax tanker Erikoussa  42  bypassing a 90 ship queue waiting for the end of maintenance works on the Gatun locks  thus avoiding a seven day delay  The normal fee would have been just US 13 430  43   edit  Current issues Panorama of Pacific entrance of the canal  Left  Pacific and Puente de las Americas  Bridge of Pan American Highway   far right  Miraflores locks  In the 97 years since its opening  the canal continues to enjoy great success  Even though world shipping and the size of ships themselves has changed markedly since the canal was designed  it continues to be a vital link in world trade  carrying more cargo than ever before  with fewer overhead costs  citation needed  Nevertheless  the canal faces a number of potential concerns   edit  Efficiency and maintenance Opponents to the Torrijos Carter Treaties  1977  feared that efficiency and maintenance would suffer following the U S  withdrawal from the Panama Canal Zone  however  this does not appear to have been the case  Capitalizing on practices developed during the American administration  canal operations are improving under Panamanian control  44  Canal Waters Time  CWT   the average time it takes a vessel to navigate the canal  including waiting time  is a key measure of efficiency  according to the ACP  since 2000  it has oscillated between 20 and 30 hours  The accident rate has also not changed appreciably in the past decade  varying between 10 and 30 accidents each year across approximately 14 000 total annual transits  45  46  47  An official accident is one in which a formal investigation is requested and conducted  Increasing volumes of imports from Asia  which previously landed on the U S  west coast ports  are now passing through the canal to the American east coast  48  The total number of ocean going transits increased from 11 725 in 2003 to 13 233 in 2007  falling to 12 855 in 2009   the Canal s fiscal year runs from October to September   49  This has been coupled with a steady rise in average ship size and in the numbers of Panamax vessels passing through the canal  so that the total tonnage carried rose from 227 9 million PC UMS tons in fiscal year 1999 to a record high of 312 9 million tons in 2007  falling to 299 1 million tons in 2009  32  49  50  Despite the reduction in total transits due to the negative impact of vessel size  e g   the inability of large vessels to pass each other in the Gaillard Cut   this represents significant overall growth in canal capacity  A bucket dredge works to deepen and widen the canal  The Panama Canal Authority  ACP  has invested nearly US 1 billion in widening and modernizing the canal  with the aim of increasing capacity by 20   51  The ACP cites a number of major improvements  including the widening and straightening of the Gaillard Cut to reduce restrictions on passing vessels  the deepening of the navigational channel in Gatun Lake to reduce draft restrictions and improve water supply  and the deepening of the Atlantic and Pacific entrances to the canal  This is supported by new equipment  such as a new drill barge and suction dredger  and an increase of the tug boat fleet by 20   In addition  improvements have been made to the operating machinery of the canal  including an increased and improved tug locomotive fleet  the replacement of more than 16 km of locomotive track  and new lock machinery controls  Improvements have been made to the traffic management system to allow more efficient control over ships in the canal  52  In December 2010  record breaking rains caused a 17 hour closure of the canal  this was the first closure since the American invasion of Panama in 1989  53  54  The rains also caused an access road to the Centenario bridge to collapse  55  56  57  58   edit  Capacity The canal is presently handling more vessel traffic than had ever been envisioned by its builders  In 1934 it was estimated that the maximum capacity of the canal would be around 80 million tons per year  59  as noted above  canal traffic in 2009 reached 299 1 million tons of shipping  The water that is used to raise and lower vessels in the Canal is fed by gravity from Gatun Lake  pictured above  into each set of locks  To improve capacity  a number of improvements have been imposed on the current canal system  These improvements aim to maximise the possible use of current locking system  60  Implementation of an enhanced locks lighting system  Construction of two tie up stations in Gaillard Cut  Gaillard Cut widening from 192 to 218 metres  630 to 715 ft   Improvements to the tugboat fleet  Implementation of the carousel lockage system in Gatun locks  Development of an improved vessel scheduling system  Deepening of Gatun Lake navigational channels from 10 4 to 11 3 metres  34 to 37 ft  PLD  Modification of all locks structures to allow an additional draft of about 0 30 metres  0 98 ft   Deepening of the Pacific and Atlantic entrances  Construction of a new spillway in Gatun  for flood control  These improvements will enlarge the capacity from 280 290 million PCUMS  2008  to 330 340 PCUMS  2012    edit  Competition Despite having enjoyed a privileged position for many years  the canal is increasingly facing competition from other quarters  Because canal tolls are expected to rise  some critics 61  have suggested that the Suez Canal may become a viable alternative for cargo en route from Asia to the U S  east coast  citation needed  The Panama Canal  however  continues to serve more than 144 of the world s trade routes and the majority of canal traffic comes from the  All Water Route   the route from Asia to the U S  East and Gulf Coasts via the Panama Canal   citation needed  The increasing rate of melting of ice in the Arctic Ocean has led to speculation that the Northwest Passage or Arctic Bridge may become viable for commercial shipping at some point in the future  This route would save 9 300 km  5 800 mi  on the route from Asia to Europe compared with the Panama Canal  possibly leading to a diversion of some traffic to that route  However  such a route is beset by unresolved territorial issues and would still hold significant problems owing to ice  62   edit  Water issues Gatun locks showing the  mule  locomotives at work Gatun Lake is filled with rainwater  and the lake accumulates excess water during wet months  The water is lost to the oceans at a rate of 101 000 m3  26 700 000 US gal  22 200 000 imp gal  per downward lock cycle  Since a ship will have to go upward to Lake Gatun first and then descend  a single passing will cost double the amount  but the same waterflow cycle can be used for another ship passing in the opposite direction  The ship s submerged volume is not relevant to this amount of water  41  63  During the dry season  when there is less rainfall  there is also a shortfall of water in Gatun Lake  citation needed  As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development  the ACP has developed an environmentally and socially sustainable program for expansion  which will protect the aquatic and terrestrial resources of the canal watershed  After completion  expansion will guarantee the availability and quality of water resources by using water saving basins at each new lock  These water saving basins will diminish water loss and preserve freshwater resources along the waterway by reusing water from the basins into the locks  Each lock chamber will have three water saving basins  which will reuse 60 percent of the water in each transit  There are a total of nine basins for each of the two lock complexes  and a total of 18 basins for the entire project  citation needed  The Pacific side sea level is about 20 centimeters  8 inches  higher than that of the Atlantic side due to differences in ocean conditions such as water densities and weather conditions  64   edit  The future As demand is rising for efficient global shipping of goods  the canal is positioned to be a significant feature of world shipping for the foreseeable future  However  changes in shipping patterns particularly the increasing numbers of larger than Panamax ships will necessitate changes to the canal if it is to retain a significant market share  It is anticipated that by 2011  37  of the world s container ships will be too large for the present canal  and hence a failure to expand would result in a significant loss of market share  The maximum sustainable capacity of the present canal  given some relatively minor improvement work  is estimated at between 330 and 340 million PC UMS tons per year  it is anticipated that this capacity will be reached between 2009 and 2012  Close to 50  of transiting vessels are already using the full width of the locks  65  An enlargement scheme similar to the 1939 Third Lock Scheme  to allow for a greater number of transits and the ability to handle larger ships  has been under consideration for some time  66  has been approved by the government of Panama  67  and is in progress  with completion expected in 2014  68  The cost is estimated at US 5 25 billion  and the project will double the canal s capacity to allow more traffic and the passage of longer and wider ships  This proposal to expand the canal was approved in a national referendum by approximately 80  on October 22  2006  69   edit  Third set of locks project Main article  Panama Canal expansion project The current plan is for two new flights of locks to be built parallel to  and operated in addition to  the old locks  one to the east of the existing Gat n locks  and one south west of Miraflores locks  each supported by approach channels  Each flight will ascend from ocean level direct to the Gat n Lake level  the existing two stage ascent at Miraflores   Pedro Miguel will not be replicated  The new lock chambers will feature sliding gates  doubled for safety  and will be 427 meters  1 400 ft  long  55 meters  180 ft  wide  and 18 3 meters  60 ft  deep  This will allow the transit of vessels with a beam of up to 49 meters  160 ft   an overall length of up to 366 meters  1 200 ft  and a draft of up to 15 meters  50 ft   equivalent to a container ship carrying around 12 000 containers  each twenty feet  6 1 m  in length  TEU   The new locks will be supported by new approach channels  including a 6 2 km  3 9 mi  channel at Miraflores from the locks to the Gaillard Cut  skirting Miraflores Lake  Each of these channels will be 218 meters  715 ft  wide  which will require post Panamax vessels to navigate the channels in one direction at a time  The Gaillard Cut and the channel through Gat n Lake will be widened to no less than 280 meters  918 ft  on the straight portions and no less than 366 meters  1 200 ft  on the bends  The maximum level of Gat n Lake will be raised from 26 7 meters  87 5 ft  to 27 1 meters  89 ft   Each flight of locks will be accompanied by nine water reutilization basins  three per lock chamber   each basin being approximately 70 meters  230 ft  wide  430 meters  1410 ft  long and 5 50 meters  18 ft  deep  These gravity fed basins will allow 60  of the water used in each transit to be reused  the new locks will consequently use 7  less water per transit than each of the existing lock lanes presently use  The deepening of Gat n Lake  and the raising of its maximum water level  will also provide significant extra water storage capacity  These measures are intended to allow the expanded canal to operate without the construction of new reservoirs  The estimated cost of the project is US 5 25 billion  The project is designed to allow for an anticipated growth in traffic from 280 million PC UMS tons in 2005 to nearly 510 million PC UMS tons in 2025  The expanded canal will have a maximum sustainable capacity of approximately 600 million PC UMS tons per year  Tolls will continue to be calculated based on vessel tonnage  and will not depend on the locks used  The new locks are expected to open for traffic in 2015  The present locks  which will be 100 years old by that time  will then be able to give engineers greater access for maintenance  and are projected to continue operating indefinitely  65  An article in the February 2007 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine describes the plans for the canal  focusing on the engineering aspects of the expansion project  70  There is also a follow up article in the February 2010 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine  71  On September 3  2007  thousands of Panamanians stood across from Para so Hill in Panama to witness a huge initial explosion and launch of the Expansion Program  The first phase of the project will be dry excavations of the 218 meter  715 ft  wide trench connecting the Culebra Cut with the Pacific coast  removing 47 million cubic meters of earth and rock  72   edit  Building the new canal It was announced in July 2009  that the Belgian dredging company Jan De Nul  together with a consortium of contractors consisting of the Spanish Sacyr Vallehermoso  the Italian Impregilo and the Panamanian company Grupo Cusa  had been awarded the contract to build the six new locks  The contract will result in  100 million in dredging works over the next few years for the Belgian company  and a great deal of work for the company s construction division  The design of the locks is a carbon copy of the Berendrecht Lock  which is 68m wide and 500m long  making it the largest lock in the world  Completed in 1989 by the Port of Antwerp  which De Nul helped build  the company still has engineers and specialists who were part of that project  73   edit  Rival

Pacific Ocean  permitting ship transit in both directions  At the time it was formed Gatun Lake was the largest man made lake in the world  The impassable rain forest around Gatun Lake has been the best defense of the Panama Canal  Today these areas have endured practically unscathed by human interference and are one of the few accessible areas on earth that various native Central American animal and plant species can be observed undisturbed in their natural habitat  World famous Barro Colorado Island  which was established for scientific study when the lake was formed and is today operated by the Smithsonian Institution  is the largest island on Gatun Lake  Many of the most important ground breaking scientific and biological discoveries of the tropical animal and plant kingdom originated here  Lake Gatun encompasses approximately 180 square miles  470 km2   a vast tropical ecological zone part of the Atlantic Forest Corridor and Eco tourism on Gatun Lake has become a worthwhile industry for Panamanians  Gatun Lake also serves to provide the millions of gallons of water necessary to operate the Panama Canal locks each time a ship passes through and provides drinking water for Panama City and Col n  Fishing is one of the primary recreational pursuits on Gatun Lake  It is suspected by whom   that the Cichla Pleiozona species of Peacock Bass was introduced by accident to Gatun Lake by a renowned Panamanian aquarist and doctor who   in 1958  citation needed  Locally called Sargento these peacock bass are not a native game fish of Panama but originate from the Amazon  Rio Negro and Orinoco river basins of South America where they are called Tucanare or Pavon and are considered a premier game fish  Since 1958 the Cichla Pleiozona species of Peacock
