by the United States Environmental Protection Agency   EPA  in 2005  The award was to recognize Fortune 500 companies which provided employees with excellent commuter benefits to help reduce traffic and air pollution  72  The birthplace of IBM  Endicott  suffered pollution for decades  however  IBM used liquid cleaning agents in circuit board assembly operation for more than two decades  and six spills and leaks were recorded  including one leak in 1979 of 4 100 gallons from an underground tank  These left behind volatile organic compounds in the town s soil and aquifer  Trace elements of volatile organic compounds have been identified in Endicott s drinking water  but the levels are within regulatory limits  Also  from 1980  IBM has pumped out 78 000 gallons of chemicals  including trichloroethane  freon  benzene and perchloroethene to the air and allegedly caused several cancer cases among the townspeople  IBM Endicott has been identified by the Department of Environmental Conservation as the major source of pollution  though traces of contaminants from a local dry cleaner and other polluters were also found  Despite the amount of pollutant  state health officials could not verify whether air or water pollution in Endicott has actually caused any health problems  According to city officials  tests show that the water is safe to drink  73  Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co   Ltd   TOK  and IBM are collaborating to establish new  low cost methods for bringing the next generation of solar energy products  called CIGS  Copper Indium Gallium Selenide  solar cell modules  to market  Use of thin film technology  such as CIGS  has great promise in reducing the overall cost of solar cells and further enabling their widespread adoption  74  75  IBM is exploring four main areas of photovoltaic research  using current technologies to develop cheaper and more efficient silicon solar cells  developing new solution processed thin film photovoltaic devices  concentrator photovoltaics  and future generation photovoltaic architectures based upon nanostructures such as semiconductor quantum dots and nanowires  76   edit  Company logo and nickname The company used the  globe  logo until 1946  when it began using an acronym based logo  IBM s current  8 bar  logo was designed in 1972 by graphic designer Paul Rand  77  It was a general replacement for a 13 bar logo that first appeared in the public on the 1966 release of the TSS 360  Logos designed in the 1970s tended to be sensitive to the technical limitations of photocopiers  which were then being widely deployed  A logo with large solid areas tended to be poorly copied by copiers in the 1970s  so companies preferred logos that avoided large solid areas  The 1972 IBM logos are an example of this tendency  With the advent of digital copiers in the mid 1980s this technical restriction had largely disappeared  at roughly the same time  the 13 bar logo was abandoned for almost the opposite reason   it was difficult to render accurately on the low resolution digital printers  240 dots per inch  of the time  Big Blue is a nickname for IBM  There are several theories explaining the origin of the name  One theory  substantiated by people who worked for IBM at the time  is that IBM field representatives coined the term in the 1960s  referring to the color of the mainframes IBM installed in the 1960s and early 1970s   True Blue  was a term used to describe a loyal IBM customer  and business writers later picked up the term  78  79  Another theory suggests that Big Blue simply refers to the Company s logo  A third theory suggests that Big Blue refers to a former company dress code that required many IBM employees to wear only white shirts and many wore blue suits  78  80  In any event  IBM keyboards  typewriters  and some other manufactured devices have played on the  Big Blue  concept  using the color for enter keys and carriage returns  IBM has also used blue logos since 1947  making blue the defining color of the company s corporate design  which might be another  more plausible reason for the term  citation needed   edit  See also Information technology portal Companies
