Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  and the Department of Children And Families  DCF  define child maltreatment as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm  potential for harm  or threat of harm to a child  2  Child abuse can occur in a child s home  or in the organizations  schools or communities the child interacts with  There are four major categories of child abuse  neglect  physical abuse  psychological emotional abuse  and child sexual abuse  Different jurisdictions have developed their own definitions of what constitutes child abuse for the purposes of removing a child from his her family and or prosecuting a criminal charge  According to the Journal of Child Abuse and Neglect  child abuse is  any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death  serious physical or emotional harm  sexual abuse or exploitation  an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm   3  A person who feels the need to abuse or neglect a child may be described as a  pedopath   4  Contents 1 Types 1 1 Physical abuse 1 2 Child sexual abuse 1 3 Psychological emotional

External links  edit  Types Child abuse can take several forms  5  The four main types are physical  sexual  psychological  and neglect  6  A Coordinated Response to Child Abuse and Neglect  The Foundation for Practice   Office on Child Abuse and doctor   There are many effects of child neglect  such as children not being able to interact with other children around them  7  The continuous refusal of a child s basic needs is considered chronic neglect  8   edit  Physical abuse Main article  Physical abuse Some humans service professionals claim that cultural norms that sanction physical punishment are one of the causes of child abuse  and have undertaken campaigns to redefine such norms  9   edit  Child sexual abuse Main article  Child sexual abuse Child sexual abuse  CSA  is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent abuses a child for sexual stimulation  10  11  Forms of CSA include asking or pressuring a child to engage in sexual activities  regardless of the outcome   indecent exposure of the genitals to a child  displaying pornography to a child  actual sexual contact against a child  physical contact with the child s genitals  viewing of the child s genitalia without physical contact  or using a child to produce child pornography  10  12  13 Selling the sexual services of children may be viewed and treated as child abuse with services offered to the child rather than simple incarceration  14  Effects of child sexual abuse include guilt and self blame  flashbacks  nightmares  insomnia  fear of things associated with the abuse  including objects  smells  places  doctor s visits  etc    self esteem issues  sexual dysfunction  chronic pain  addiction  self injury  suicidal ideation  somatic complaints  depression  15 post traumatic stress disorder  16 anxiety  17  other mental illnesses  including borderline personality disorder 18  and dissociative identity disorder  18  propensity to re victimization in adulthood  19 bulimia nervosa  20  physical injury to the child  among other problems  21  Approximately 15  to 25  of women and 5  to 15  of men were sexually abused when they were children  22  23  24  25  26  Most sexual abuse offenders are acquainted with their victims  approximately 30  are relatives of the child  most often brothers  fathers  mothers  uncles or cousins  around 60  are other acquaintances such as friends of the family  babysitters  or neighbours  strangers are the offenders in approximately 10  of child sexual abuse cases  22  In over one third of cases  the perpetrator is also a minor  see child on child sexual abuse   27   edit  Psychological emotional abuse Main article  Emotional abuse Out of all the possible forms of abuse  emotional abuse is the hardest to define  It could include name calling  ridicule  degradation  destruction of personal belongings  torture or killing of a pet  excessive criticism  inappropriate or excessive demands  withholding communication  and routine labeling or humiliation  28  Victims of emotional abuse may react by distancing themselves from the abuser  internalizing the abusive words  or fighting back by insulting the abuser  Emotional abuse can result in abnormal or disrupted attachment development  a tendency for victims to blame themselves  self blame  for the abuse  learned helplessness  and overly passive behavior  28   edit  Prevalence According to the  American  National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse  in 1997 neglect represented 54  of confirmed cases of child abuse  physical abuse 22   sexual abuse 8   emotional maltreatment 4   and other forms of maltreatment 12   29  A UNICEF report on child wellbeing 30  stated that the United States and the United Kingdom ranked lowest among industrial nations with respect to the wellbeing of children  It also found that child neglect and child abuse were far more common in single parent families than in families where both parents are present  citation needed  In the USA  neglect is defined as the failure to meet the basic needs of children including housing  clothing  food and access to medical care  Researchers found over 91 000 cases of neglect in one year  from October 2005 to 30 September 2006  using information from a database of cases verified by protective services agencies  2  Neglect could also take the form of financial abuse by not buying the child adequate materials for survival  31  The U S  Department of Health and Human Services reports that for each year between 2000 and 2005   female parents acting alone  were most likely to be perpetrators of child abuse  32  Race and ethnicity of victims in 2010  44 8  of all victims were White  21 9  were African American  and 21 4  were Hispanic  33   edit  Fatalities A child abuse fatality  when a child s death is the result of abuse or neglect  or when abuse and or neglect are contributing factors to a child s death  In the United States  1 730 children died in 2008 due to factors related to abuse  this is a rate of 2 per 100 000 U S  children  34  Child abuse fatalities are widely recognized as being under counted  it is estimated that between 60 85  of child fatalities due to maltreatment are not recorded as such on death certificates  Younger children are at a much higher risk for being killed  as are African Americans  Girls and boys  however  are killed at similar rates  Caregivers  and specifically mothers  are more likely to be the perpetrators of a child abuse fatality  than anyone else  including strangers  relatives  and non relative caregivers citation needed   Family situations which place children at risk include moving  unemployment  having non family members living in the household  A number of policies and programs have been put into place to try to better understand and to prevent child abuse fatalities  including  safe haven laws  child fatality review teams  training for investigators  shaken baby syndrome prevention programs  and child abuse death laws which mandate harsher sentencing for taking the life of a child  35  unreliable source   verification needed   edit  Causes Child abuse is a complex phenomenon with multiple causes  36  Understanding the causes of abuse is crucial to addressing the problem of child abuse  37  Parents who physically abuse their spouses are more likely than others to physically abuse their children  38  However  it is impossible to know whether marital strife is a cause of child abuse  or if both the marital strife and the abuse are caused by tendencies in the abuser  38  Children resulting from unintended pregnancies are more likely to be abused or neglected  39  40  In addition  unintended pregnancies are more likely than intended pregnancies to be associated with abusive relationships  41  and there is an increased risk of physical violence during pregnancy  42  They also result in poorer maternal mental health  42  and lower mother child relationship quality  42  Substance abuse can be a major contributing factor to child abuse  One U S  study found that parents with documented substance abuse  most commonly alcohol  cocaine  and heroin  were much more likely to mistreat their children  and were also much more likely to reject court ordered services and treatments  43  Another study found that over two thirds of cases of child maltreatment involved parents with substance abuse problems  This study specifically found relationships between alcohol and physical abuse  and between cocaine and sexual abuse  44  Unemployment and financial difficulties are associated with increased rates of child abuse  45  In 2009 CBS News reported that child abuse in the United States had increased during the economic recession  It gave the example of a father who had never been the primary care taker of the children  Now that the father was in that role  the children began to come in with injuries  46  A 1988 study of child murders in the US found that children are 100 times more often killed by a  non biological parent  e g  step parent  co habitee or boyfriend girlfriend of a biological parent   than by a biological parent  47  An evolutionary psychology explanation for this is that using resources in order to take care of another person s biological child is likely not a good strategy for increasing reproductive success  47  See also Infanticide  zoology   More generally  stepchildren have a much higher risk of being abused which is sometimes referred to as the Cinderella effect   edit  Effects There are strong associations between exposure to child abuse in all its forms and higher rates of many chronic conditions  The strongest evidence comes from the Adverse Childhood Experiences  ACE s  series of studies which show correlations between exposure to abuse or neglect and higher rates in adulthood of chronic conditions  high risk health behaviors and shortened lifespan  48  A recent publication  Hidden Costs in Health Care  The Economic Impact of Violence and Abuse  49  makes the case that such exposure represents a serious and costly public health issue that should be addressed by the healthcare system  Child abuse is a major life stressor that has consequences involving the mental health of an adult but  the majority of studies examining the negative consequences of abuse have been focused on adolescences and young adults  citation needed  It has been identified that childhood sexual abuse is a risk factor for the development of substance related problems during adolescence and adulthood  citation needed  The early experiences of child abuse can trigger the development of an internalizing disorder  such as anxiety and depression  For example  adults with a history of some form of child abuse  whether sexual abuse  physical abuse  or neglect  have more chances of developing depression then an adult who has never been abused  citation needed  Child abuse can also cause problems with the neurodevelopment of a child  citation needed  Research by whom   shows that abused children often develop deficits with language  deregulation of mood  behaviour and also social emotional disturbances  These risks are elevated when child abuse is combined with traumatic events and or fetal alcohol exposure  citation needed   edit  Psychological effects Children who have a history of neglect or physical abuse are at risk of developing psychiatric problems  50  51  or a disorganized attachment style  52  53  54  Disorganized attachment is associated with a number of developmental problems  including dissociative symptoms  55  as well as anxiety  depressive  and acting out symptoms  56  57  A study by Dante Cicchetti found that 80  of abused and maltreated infants exhibited symptoms of disorganized attachment  58  59  When some of these children become parents  especially if they suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder  PTSD   dissociative symptoms  and other sequelae of child abuse  they may encounter difficulty when faced with their infant and young children s needs and normative distress  which may in turn lead to adverse consequences for their child s social emotional development  60  61  Despite these potential difficulties  psychosocial intervention can be effective  at least in some cases  in changing the ways maltreated parents think about their young children  62  Victims of childhood abuse  it is claimed  also suffer from different types of physical health problems later in life  Some reportedly suffer from some type of chronic head  abdominal  pelvic  or muscular pain with no identifiable reason  63  Even though the majority of childhood abuse victims know or believe that their abuse is  or can be  the cause of different health problems in their adult life  for the great majority their abuse was not directly associated with those problems  indicating that sufferers were most likely diagnosed with other possible causes for their health problems  instead of their childhood abuse  63  The effects of child abuse vary  depending on the type of abuse  A 2006 study which   found that childhood emotional and sexual abuse were strongly related to adult depressive symptoms  while exposure to verbal abuse and witnessing of domestic violence had a moderately strong association  and physical abuse a moderate one  For depression  experiencing more than two kinds of abuse exerted synergetically stronger symptoms  Sexual abuse was particularly deleterious in its intrafamilial form  for symptoms of depression  anxiety  dissociation  and limbic irritability  clarification needed  Childhood verbal abuse had a stronger association with anger hostility than any other type of abuse studied  and was second only to emotional abuse in its relationship with dissociative symptoms  citation needed  More generally  in the case of 23 of the 27 illnesses listed in the questionnaire of a French INSEE survey  some statistically significant correlations were found between repeated illness and family traumas encountered by the child before the age of 18 years  64  According to Georges Menahem  the French sociologist who found out these correlations by studying health inequalities  these relationships show that inequalities in illness and suffering are not only social  Health inequality also has its origins in the family  where it is associated with the degrees of lasting affective problems  lack of affection  parental discord  the prolonged absence of a parent  or a serious illness affecting either the mother or father  that individuals report having experienced in childhood  citation needed   edit  Physical effects Rib fractures in an infant secondary to child abuse Children who are physically abused are likely to receive bone fractures  particularly rib fractures  65  and may have a higher risk of developing cancer  66  Children who experience child abuse  amp  neglect are 59  more likely to be arrested as juveniles  28  more likely to be arrested as adults  and 30  more likely to commit violent crime  67  The immediate physical effects of abuse or neglect can be relatively minor  bruises or cuts  or severe  broken bones  hemorrhage  or even death   In some cases the physical effects are temporary  however  the pain and suffering they cause a child should not be discounted  Meanwhile  the long term impact of child abuse and neglect on physical health is just beginning to be explored  The long term effects can be  Shaken baby syndrome  Shaking a baby is a common form of child abuse that often results in permanent neurological damage  80  of cases  or death  30  of cases   68  Damage results from intracranial hypertension  increased pressure in the skull  after bleeding in the brain  damage to the spinal cord and neck  and rib or bone fractures  Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  2007   Impaired brain development  Child abuse and neglect have been shown  in some cases  to cause important regions of the brain to fail to form or grow properly  resulting in impaired development  De Bellis  amp  Thomas  2003   These alterations in brain maturation have long term consequences for cognitive  language  and academic abilities  Watts English  Fortson  Gibler  Hooper   amp  De Bellis  2006   NSCAW found more than three quarters of foster children between 1 and 2 years of age to be at medium to high risk for problems with brain development  as opposed to less than half of children in a control sample  ACF OPRE  2004a   Poor physical health  Several studies have shown a relationship between various forms of household dysfunction  including childhood abuse  and poor health  Flaherty et al   2006  Felitti  2002   Adults who experienced abuse or neglect during childhood are more likely to suffer from physical ailments such as allergies  arthritis  asthma  bronchitis  high blood pressure  and ulcers  Springer  Sheridan  Kuo   amp  Carnes  2007   69  On the other hand  there are some children who are raised in child abuse  but who manage to do unexpectedly well later in life regarding the preconditions  Such children have been termed dandelion children  as inspired from the way that dandelions seem to prosper irrespective of soil  sun  drought  or rain  70  Such children  or currently grown ups  are of high interest in finding factors that mitigate the effects of child abuse   edit  Prevention Unintended conception increases the risk of subsequent child abuse  and large family size increases the risk of child neglect  40  Thus a comprehensive study for the National Academy of Sciences concluded that affordable contraceptive services should form the basis for child abuse prevention  40  71   The starting point for effective child abuse programming is pregnancy planning   according to an analysis for US Surgeon General C  Everett Koop  40  72  April has been designated Child Abuse Prevention Month in the United States since 1983  73  U S  President Barack Obama continued that tradition by declaring April 2009 Child Abuse Prevention Month  74  One way the Federal government of the United States provides funding for child abuse prevention is through Community Based Grants for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect  CBCAP   75  Resources for child protection services are sometimes limited  According to Hosin  2007    a considerable number of traumatized abused children do not gain access to protective child protection strategies   76  Briere  1992  argues that only when  lower level violence  of children ceases to be culturally tolerated will there be changes in the victimization and police protection of children  77   edit  Treatment A number of treatments are available to victims of child abuse  78 Dyadic developmental psychotherapy has been found to be an effective and evidence based treatment  79  It emphasizes the intersubjective sharing of experience  Trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy  first developed to treat sexually abused children  is now used for victims of any kind of trauma  It targets trauma related symptoms in children including post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   clinical depression and anxiety  It also includes a component for non offending parents  Several studies have found that sexually abused children undergoing TF CBT improved more than children undergoing certain other therapies  Data on the effects of TF CBT for children who experienced only non sexual abuse was not available as of 2006  78  Abuse focused cognitive behavioral therapy was designed for children who have experienced physical abuse  It targets externalizing behaviors and strengthens prosocial behaviors  Offending parents are included in the treatment  to improve parenting skills practices  It is supported by one randomized study  78  Dyadic developmental psychotherapy has been found to be an effective and evidence based treatment  79  It emphasizes the intersubjective sharing of experience  80  Child parent psychotherapy was designed to improve the child parent relationship following the experience of domestic violence  It targets trauma related symptoms in infants  toddlers  and preschoolers  including PTSD  aggression  defiance  and anxiety  It is supported by two studies of one sample  78  Other forms of treatment include group therapy  play therapy  and art therapy  Each of these types of treatment can be used to better assist the client  depending on the form of abuse they have experienced  Play therapy and art therapy are ways to get children more comfortable with therapy by working on something that they enjoy  coloring  drawing  painting  etc    The design of a child s artwork can be a symbolic representation of what they are feeling  relationships with friends or family  and more  Being able to discuss and analyze a child s artwork can allow a professional to get a better insight of the child  81   edit  Ethics One of the most challenging ethical dilemmas arising from child abuse relates to the parental rights of abusive parents or caretakers with regard to their children  particularly in medical settings  82  In the United States  the 2008 New Hampshire case of Andrew Bedner drew attention to this legal and moral conundrum  Bedner  accused of severely injuring his infant daughter  sued for the right to determine whether or not she remain on life support  keeping her alive  which would have prevented a murder charge  created a motive for Bedner to act that conflicted with the apparent interests of his child  82  83  84  Bioethicists Jacob M  Appel and Thaddeus Mason Pope recently argued  in separate articles  that such cases justify the replacement of the accused parent with an alternative decision maker  82  85  Child abuse also poses ethical concerns related to confidentiality  as victims may be physically or psychologically unable to report abuse to authorities  Accordingly  many jurisdictions and professional bodies have made exceptions to standard requirements for confidentiality and legal privileges in instances of child abuse  Medical professionals  including doctors  therapists  and other mental health workers typically owe a duty of confidentiality to their patients and clients  either by law and or the standards of professional ethics  and cannot disclose personal information without the consent of the individual concerned  This duty conflicts with an ethical obligation to protect children from preventable harm  Accordingly  confidentiality is often waived when these professionals have a good faith suspicion that child abuse or neglect has occurred or is likely to occur and make a report to local child protection authorities  This exception allows professionals to breach confidentiality and make a report even when the child or his her parent or guardian has specifically instructed to the contrary  Child abuse is also a common exception to Physician patient privilege  a medical professional may be called upon to testify in court as to otherwise privileged evidence about suspected child abuse despite the wishes of the child and his her family  86   edit  Organizations There are organizations at national  state  and county levels in the United States that provide community leadership in preventing child abuse and neglect  The National Alliance of Children s Trust Funds and Prevent Child Abuse America are two national organizations with member organizations at the state level  Many investigations into child abuse are handled on the local level by Child Advocacy Centers  Started over 25 years ago at what is now known as the National Children s Advocacy Center 87  in Huntsville  Alabama by District Attorney Robert  Bud  Cramer these multi disciplinary teams have met to coordinate their efforts so that cases of child abuse can be investigated quickly and efficiently  ultimately reducing trauma to the child and garnering better convictions  88  89  These Child Advocacy Centers  known as CACs  have standards set by the National Children s Alliance  90  Other organizations focus on specific prevention strategies  The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome focuses its efforts on the specific issue of preventing child abuse that is manifested as shaken baby syndrome  Mandated reporter training is a program used to prevent ongoing child abuse   edit  See also Abuse AMBER Alert Barnados Cinderella effect Complex post traumatic stress disorder Attachment
