History  edit  AT amp T breakup and NYNEX acquisition Bell Atlantic logo  1984 1997 Verizon was founded as Bell Atlantic Corporation  It was one of the seven  Baby Bells  that were formed as a result of the anti trust judgment against the American Telephone  amp  Telegraph Company  Bell Atlantic then inherited seven of the Bell Operating Companies from AT amp T  later known as AT amp T Corporation  following its breakup  Bell Atlantic s original roster of operating companies included  The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania New Jersey Bell Telephone Company The Diamond State Telephone Company The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Maryland The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Virginia The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of West Virginia Bell Atlantic originally operated in the U S  states of New Jersey  Pennsylvania  Delaware  Maryland  West Virginia  and Virginia  as well as Washington  D C  In 1994  Bell Atlantic became the first Regional Bell Operating Company to entirely drop the original names of its original operating companies  Operating company titles were simplified to  Bell Atlantic   state name   In 1996  CEO and Chairman Raymond W  Smith orchestrated Bell Atlantic s merger with NYNEX CEO Ivan G  Seidenberg  When it merged  it moved its corporate headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City where CEO s Smith and Seidenberg shared Co CEO duties  NYNEX was consolidated into this name by 1997  Prior to its merger with GTE  Bell Atlantic traded on the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE  under the  BEL  symbol   edit  Verizon Wireless formation and GTE merger On September 21  1999  Bell Atlantic and UK based Vodafone AirTouch Plc  now Vodafone Group Plc  announced that they had agreed to create a new wireless business with a national footprint  a single brand and a common digital technology   composed of Bell Atlantic s and Vodafone s U S  wireless assets  Bell Atlantic Mobile  which was previously called Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile by 1997   AirTouch Cellular  PrimeCo Personal Communications  and AirTouch Paging   This wireless joint venture received regulatory approval in six months  and began operations as Verizon Wireless on April 4  2000  kicking off the new  Verizon  brand name  The final GTE logo prior to its merger with Bell Atlantic to form Verizon  Bell Atlantic acquired GTE on June 30  2000 and changed its name to Verizon Communications Inc  It was among the largest mergers in United States business history  It was the result of a definitive merger agreement  dated July 27  1998  between Bell Atlantic  based in New York City since the merger with NYNEX in 1996  and GTE  which was in the process of moving its headquarters from Stamford  Connecticut  to Irving  Texas  The Bell Atlantic GTE merger  priced at more than  52 billion at the time of the announcement  closed nearly two years later  following analysis and approvals by Bell Atlantic and GTE shareowners  27 state regulatory commissions and the Federal Communications Commission  FCC   and clearance from the United States Department of Justice and various international agencies  The merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE  to form Verizon Communications  became effective on June 30  2000  Verizon began trading on the NYSE under its new  VZ  symbol on Monday  July 3  2000  GTE s wireless operations became part of Verizon Wireless   creating what was initially the nation s largest wireless company before Cingular Wireless acquired AT amp T Wireless in 2004   when the Bell Atlantic GTE merger closed nearly three months later  Verizon then became the majority owner  55   of Verizon Wireless  Bell Atlantic s CEO Ivan Seidenberg and GTE s Charles Lee were co CEO s from 2000 to 2002 when Seidenberg became sole CEO  a position he held until July 2011 when he was succeeded by Lowell McAdam  6  Verizon shares were made a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average on April 8  2004  7  Verizon currently has 140 3 million land lines in service  With the MCI merger  it has more than 250 000 employees  Verizon serves customers throughout much of the United States  In late 2004  Verizon sold its 20 5  stake in Telus  a Canadian telecom  This was so that they could focus more on its own services  The stake came from GTE  which held stocks in BCTel  a Telus predecessor  8   edit  MCI acquisition On February 14  2005  Verizon agreed to acquire MCI Inc   formerly WorldCom  after fellow  Baby Bell  SBC Communications agreed to acquire former parent AT amp T Corporation just a few weeks earlier   That combined company took the AT amp T name   Media coverage has focused on several ways in which that acquisition  once completed  would benefit Verizon  including economies of scale derived from a potential productivity boost to be achieved via the elimination of thousands of jobs at the combined company  and access to the large base of business customers currently served by MCI  The real benefit to Verizon was the acquisition of long haul lines  The bulk of Verizon s business is concentrated in the eastern United States  This not only renders the company  effectively  a regional phone company  but also forced it to pay usage fees to long haul carriers  such as the former MCI and AT amp T  to complete calls for its customers whenever those calls go outside the Verizon  footprint   That need is obviated by the MCI acquisition and was key in the long term market position strategy  By January 6  2006  MCI was incorporated into Verizon with the name Verizon Business  Verizon  with MCI  was the largest telecommunications company in the United States based on sales of  75 11 billion  profits of  7 4 billion and assets of  168 13 billion  After its acquisition of BellSouth  AT amp T became the largest telecommunications company in the world in terms of assets and profits  9   edit  Divestitures Due to the rigorous climate and high costs  GTE Alaska was sold to Alaska Power and Telephone Company rather than be included in the Verizon merger  In 2002  Verizon sold GTE s former telephone operations in 3 states  Missouri and Alabama operations were sold to CenturyTel  which acquired Embarq in 2009 and became CenturyLink  and Kentucky operations were sold to Alltel  which later spun off its landline operations

and two new companies created for spinoff  New Communications of the Carolinas and New Communications of the Southwest  11  On July 1  2010  the transfer of these assets to Frontier took place  12   edit  Impact of changes in telephony The transition from land wire based telephony to wireless communications has been a major change driver for all vendors in the telephony space  including Verizon  As of August 2011 update   the profitability of the company s  wireline  business had slipped substantially below that of its mobile division and continued to degrade  a situation reflected in and used to directly support downward revisions to  wireline  worker compensation  potentially impacting on the order of 45 000 workers in the United States  13   edit  Operations South face of the

involved in several public controversies   edit  Tax dodging and lobbying In December 2011  the non partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Verizon for spending  52 34 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008 2010  instead getting  951 million in tax rebates  despite making a profit of  32 5 billion  having laid off 21 308 workers since 2008 and increasing executive pay by 167  to  20 3 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives  22  However  on February 24  2012  in its Form 10 K filed with the SEC 23   Verizon reported having paid more than  11 1 billion in taxes  including income  employment and property taxes  in 2009 2011  In addition  the company reported in the 10 K that most of the drop in employment since 2008 was due to a voluntary retirement offer

citizens to the National Security Agency  Verizon flatly denied turning over records to the government  but did not comment on whether MCI  which it had acquired in January  had done so  25  On October 12  2007  the company admitted in a letter to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce that it had turned over customer information to the FBI and other federal agencies of the U S  government approximately 94 000 times from January 2005 to September 2007  providing such information 720 times without being presented with a court order or warrant  26  In September 2007  Verizon Wireless initially refused to make their mobile phone network available to NARAL Pro Choice America for a program which allows people to sign up for pro choice text messages  on the grounds that they had the right to block  controversial or unsavory  messages  They subsequently reversed the decision   It was an incorrect interpretation of a dusty internal policy  that     was designed to ward against communications such as anonymous hate messaging and adult materials sent to children       Verizon has  great respect for this free flow of ideas   27   edit  Internet On February 4  2010  4chan started receiving reports from Verizon Wireless customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site s image boards  4chan administrators found that only traffic on port 80 to the
