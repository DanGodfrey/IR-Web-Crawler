edit  Original abilities When Peter Parker was bitten by a lethally irradiated spider  radioactive mutagenic enzymes in the spider s venom quickly caused numerous body wide changes  Immediately after the bite  he was granted his original powers  primarily superhuman strength  reflexes  and equilibrium  the ability to cling tenaciously to most surfaces  and a subconscious precognitive sense of danger  which he called a  spider sense   Several biologists on the History Channel s Spider Man Tech stated the effect of a radioactive spider bite  if any  would not be nearly enough to cause a mutation in a human body  However  they said the use of  genetically engineered  spiders from the live action movie and the Ultimate continuity was more plausible  Instead of radioactive venom  the bite would have to carry a powerful retro virus  similar to HIV  that would spread through the body by taking over neighboring cells and actually becoming ingrained in the person s DNA  They illustrated this by showing the results of an experiment where glow genes from deep sea Jelly fish were introduced into the embryos of lab mice  The resulting mice were born with the glow gene as a part of their own DNA and glowed light green whenever an ultraviolet light was shone on them  1  2   edit  Generally enhanced physiology Spider Man s overall metabolic efficiency has been greatly increased  and the composition of his skeleton  connective tissues  muscles  and nervous system has all been enhanced  Originally  Peter Parker wore glasses  but after the spider bite  his vision became 20 20  allowing him to see perfectly after his spectacles were broken by Flash Thompson  Spider Man is capable of healing injuries faster and more extensively than ordinary humans  though it is considerably inferior to the healing abilities of individuals such as Wolverine or The Hulk  However  Spider Man is capable of healing from injuries as severe as broken bones within a matter of hours  During a battle with a villain called the Masked Marauder  Spider Man is rendered completely blind  However  during a visit to an eye specialist  it is revealed that Spider Man is already healing only after mere hours of being blasted  After about 2 days  Spider Man s eyesight has recovered to perfection and his 20 20 vision is restored  although his eyes are sensitive for about a day after  shown when Carrion flashed a bright light in his face  Afterwards  his eyes are totally healed  Following the events of  The Other   Spider Man temporarily had some of his abilities increased  including his healing  During  Civil War    months after the events of  The Other   he is ambushed by the Rhino and is injured  However  he heals completely by the end of the issue without medical attention and mentions to Aunt May that he knew he had  always been a fast healer  but lately it seems even more so   Also during  Civil War   Spider Man is heavily beaten and drugged  suffering multiple fractures and blood loss by the Jack O  Lantern but his injuries heal almost completely by the next issue  However  like many superhuman powers  the effectiveness of Spider Man s abilities varies based on the author and the needs of the story  His accelerated metabolism increases his tolerance to drugs  meaning a larger dose is needed to cause the usual effect  and he can recover from the effects rapidly  During an encounter with the bee based villain Swarm  Spider Man is incapacitated by thousands of bee stings  but fully recovers in less than 24 hours  His resistance to other toxins varies  but is typically significantly higher than normal  However  Spider Man has normal human tolerance to the effects of alcoholic beverages and is rarely shown drinking  since it affects his balance  reflexes and coordination  In one battle with the Hobgoblin  3  he nearly loses his life after unknowingly consuming spiked punch at a party  Although he is still affected by disease and infection  his recovery time is typically shorter than that of an ordinary human  Spider Man s unique physiology even allows him to recover from the effects of vampirism  4  Spider Man is still vulnerable to disease  and has fallen ill due to flu many times  5  which affects the reliability of his powers  He also has certain susceptibility towards ethyl chloride  which is a commonly used pesticide against insects and arachnids  This chemical is used frequently as a weapon in Spider Slayer robots   edit  Possible mystical connection Ezekiel  who shares similar spider abilities  gained through an arcane ritual   makes Peter question the source of his powers  implying a mystical reason the spider chose to bite him  suggesting that the spider would have given him powers even without being exposed to radiation  Although Peter has noted that the radiation did slightly change the mutative effects that the spider had on his system   Though this was never proven  Spider Man has been tied to mystical forces before such as when he was mentioned in an ancient prophecy in connection to the sorcerer Dr  Strange and when the cosmic beings Lord Order and Master Chaos claimed credit for Peter Parker being the one bitten by the spider  Magical forces could also explain how Spider Man is able to psychically detect threats such as whether or not a person has a gun or if he is being followed  However  after Ezekial s death  Peter has chosen not to pursue this line of thought any further  noting that science and magic can be essentially two sides of the same coin  and reasoning that his scientific background has helped him for so long that there is no reason for him to shift focus   edit  Wall crawling Spider Man is capable of crawling on walls and ceilings  He has conscious control over this ability  and it is simple and instinctive for him to use he first uses it in Amazing Fantasy  15 before realizing he has the ability  Originally  Spider Man is able to stick to surfaces using his hands and feet  6  but later he is shown to be able to cling with his back  7  The strength of attraction between himself and the surface he is clinging to is considerable  with an upper limit of several tons per finger  If Spider Man does not willingly detach  but is pulled off by force  the surface usually breaks still attached to his body  However  it has been shown that a significant shock can cause him to lose control of his power and fall off a surface  If a surface is too slippery  he has problems sticking to it  if it is too fragile or crumbling  it is unable to support his weight  He can also use his clinging ability to lift or hold objects  for instance  he can catch a thrown ball simply by touching it with one fingertip  Spider Man is also able to jump against the walls and he can also sprint against a wall which helps him climb surfaces a lot faster  The ability works through thin layers of cloth  such as the fabric of his costume  but not through materials such as the soles of shoes  When Peter Parker needs to crawl without changing into the costume  he removes his shoes first  8  Spider Man s wall crawling ability has increased with time  most notably a backup in Amazing Spider Man  365 by Tom DeFalco  There DeFalco had Peter explain his abilities to Mary Jane and Peter revealed that every part of his body has gained or increased in attraction to other surfaces  and he can stick people or objects on his back  Over time he realized he could keep his mask firmly fixed to his face  previously used to prevent undesirable mask removal   protecting his secret identity  9  Kaine  the villainous clone of Spider Man  has shown the ability to use his wall crawling abilities in a more offensive manner  burning distinctive scars  known as the Mark of Kaine in the face of his victims  Later Spider Man himself uses a variation of the same ability to escape from The Green Goblin by making his fingertips cling to his face and tearing them away  digging five deep wounds in Norman s face  Despite the obvious offensive potential of such an ability  Peter claims that it is unlikely he will use it again  as it was a move born out of anger and desperation  10  In later events during the Grim Hunt arc  due to Peter s rage at Sasha Kravinoff over everything she put him and his  spider family  through  he uses his version of the Mark of Kaine on her  ripping the skin off her face in the shape of a hand print  proclaiming  This is from my brother   11  Spider Man s wall crawling abilities have been explained in several ways  Some notable explanations include  A panel of biologists and physicists on the History Channel s Spider Man Tech suggested the barbed hair on his fingertips  from the movie  could have the same effect as the miniature scopulae hairs on the ends of a spider s feet  Spiders are able to climb up seemingly impossible surfaces like glass because the scopulae interact with the glass s atoms causing a form of atomic static cling via the Van der Waals force  1  12  The Spider Man entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe states that Spider Man is able to enhance the flux of inter atomic attractive forces on surfaces he touches  increasing the coefficient of friction between that surface and himself  Bio electricity  Spider Girl s similar power is referred to by Reed Richards as  bio magnetism   but her ability is somewhat different   edit  Enemies able to cancel wall crawling ability Electro had a revelation during a battle about Spider Man s clinging ability and can disrupt this power somehow  claiming that it was based on some sort of electromagnetic bonding  It is ineffective after the events of  The Other   Many enemies  such as Stilt Man and Paste Pot Pete have used lubricants to prevent Spider Man from sticking  Many enemies have ripped Spider Man from a surface using strength but usually after the wall breaks from the strain  not from his powers failing  and pieces of the wall can still be seen clinging to his fingers and toes   edit  Enhanced Strength  amp  Endurance Early in his career  Spider Man was frequently said to have the proportional strength of a spider  but he can lift much more due to his human size  up to 10 tons  Since the events of  The Other  and  The Queen  story arcs  his strength has been increased to twice his original limits  During the Secret Invasion  Spider Man was shown to be able to knock a Tyranosaurus Rex unconscious in one punch  He has been shown to lift and throw objects such as a semi truck and to bend the steel of a screwdriver with one finger with ease  13  When in combat  Spider Man must pull his punches unless fighting someone of similar or greater durability and power  Otherwise  his blows would kill a normal person  14  Spider Man s bodily tissue is a great deal more durable and resistant to some types of injury than a normal human  However  Spider Man is far from invulnerable  While his body is tougher than an ordinary human  as seen several times in Spider Man 2  via falling from average web slinging height without sustaining significant injury   he can still be injured in ways comparable to an ordinary human  For example  Spider Man can be injured by bullets or knives composed of conventional material and from impacts of sufficient force  However  if injured  his accelerated metabolism is capable of repairing itself many times faster than an ordinary human  A doctor has told Spider Man that it would be impossible for a normal man to survive the punishment that he has endured  15  Spider Man can leap several stories vertically or the width of a city street  16  While his running speed has never been definitely established  he can run at superhuman speed for short sprints and has been shown to be easily capable of overtaking fast moving cars  but nearly always prefers using his weblines to travel  17   edit  Superhuman reflexes and agility Spider Man s agility and reflexes are far superior to those of an ordinary human  even those that represent the peak of human conditioning such as Captain America  The speed of his reflexes combined with his spider sense allows him to dodge almost any attack  even gunfire at point blank  18  Due to the events of  The Other   his reflexes are increased further  responding directly to his spider sense and instinct that can result in him lashing out at negligible threats  19  During the  Grim Hunt  storyline  he was able to dodge a bullet fired from a hunting rifle at point blank range  Aloysha Kravinoff noted that even Spider Man wasn t  supposed to be that fast   and the story implies that Spider Man s exceptional speed in that situation was a result of the intense grief and rage he was feeling at the time  20  Spider Man has the ability to maintain his equilibrium on any surface that he can stick to  For example  he can balance on one finger on a high wire  21  or stand upright on a wall  his body parallel to the ground  Additionally  he is able to flex his body like a contortionist  assuming postures that would be impossible or harmful for most normal humans  His tendons and connective tissues are at least twice as elastic as the average human being s  This ability is often demonstrated by the unusual poses Spider Man would assume while webslinging or dodging enemy attacks  Also  as an outcome of his spider reflexes  Peter has developed his own fighting style   edit  Spider sense Spider Man s  spider sense  manifests in a tingling feeling at the base of his skull  alerting him to personal danger in proportion to the severity of that danger  It appears to be a simultaneous  seemingly clairvoyant response to a wide variety of phenomena  Though the exact mechanism of this ability is unknown   though in Amazing Spider Man  1  he refers to it as an instinctive ability  his original spider sense clearly has at least two aspects in addition to sensing potential or immediate danger  A psychological awareness of his surroundings  similar to the radar sense of Daredevil  When he is temporarily blinded  22  Spider Man learns to emulate this ability and navigate without his eyesight  Even under normal conditions  his spider sense helps him navigate darkened rooms  instinctively avoiding obstacles or hazards  or potentially noisy or unstable floorboards  walls or ceilings that may betray his presence  In one comic  he is shown sensing how many fingers Mary Jane is holding up  An ability to detect certain radio frequencies  Spider Man s technical skill is such that he has designed spider tracers that broadcast a signal detectable by his spider sense  Using his spider sense to time his enhanced reflexes  Spider Man can casually dodge attacks up to and including automatic weapons fire  Even point blank  his spider sense has already warned him in enough time to get away like a precognitive sense  before he can even consciously think about his actions  However  he can ignore this instinct  His spider sense is sufficiently well linked to his reflexes  even before  The Other  storyline  that a threat can trigger them even when Spider Man is asleep or stunned  as in Amazing Spider Man  141  where a narcotic gas released by foe Mysterio caused him to lose his balance and fall from a building  Though barely conscious  a combination of spider sense and reflex caused his arm to seize a fire escape ladder  saving his life  When Spider Man swings across a city on his weblines  his spider sense guides his aim  allowing him to travel at high speeds hundreds of feet above street level with minimal concentration  confident his weblines will find secure anchor points  Spider Man s spider sense is directional and can guide him to or away from hidden weapons and disguised enemies  Sudden and extreme threats  such as the Beyonder observing Earth before the first Secret Wars  Thanos using the Infinity Gauntlet to destroy half of the sapient population of the universe  the Ultimate version of Venom  or the predatory Morlun  can cause his spider sense to react with painful intensity  Spider Man can also sense and dodge attacks directed randomly or by a computer  His spider sense has helped him preserve his secret identity since it alerts him to observers or cameras when changing into or out of his costume  The spider sense does not react to those whom Peter does not consider a threat  such as Aunt May  Contrary to this  his spider sense has warned him of people close to him when he does not wish to be seen  such as when he s partly in costume  Spider Man can choose to ignore his spider sense  and distraction or fatigue can force unawareness  Spider Man has used his spider sense to battle even the most skilled fighters in the Marvel Universe  While not being as trained as them in conventional fighting styles his spider sense and reflexes  provided with split second quickness and agility  allow him to dodge and counter  often with ease  After the  Disassembled  and  The Other  storylines  Spider Man gains the ability to feel vibrations and currents in the air or in his web lines  much like a real spider  He also develops a psychic connection to insects  spiders  and other arthropods  though this aspect of his powers may no longer be present  see below   The spider sense also allows Spider man to determine the source of the incoming attack  which gives him an advantage against enemies who are all over the place like Spot  As a result of the storyline  Revenge of the Spider Slayer   Spider Man loses his spider sense when he sets off a device that disabled Spencer Smythe s latest creations  ability to coordinate their attacks via a similar principle  23  As such  he starts taking Kung Fu lessons from Shang Chi  on Madame Web s advice  When his full powers are restored in the Spider Island storyline  his battle honed body granted him a new  refined form of Spider Sense  where Spider Man instead of blindly react to threats automatically draws upon Shang Chi s training  24   edit  Enemies people immune to the spider sense When deprived of his spider sense  Spider Man becomes vulnerable to surveillance and attack and traveling by web line requires most of his concentration  The Green Goblin developed a gas that temporarily deadened all of Spidey s powers  especially his spider sense  25  This same gas was later enhanced and used by Roderick Kingsley  in his guise as the villain Hobgoblin  26  Venom is undetectable to Spider Man s spider sense  27  due to the symbiote having been mentally linked to him  and for the most part  contains his DNA  This works against Spider Man in the sense that Venom attacking Spider Man is essentially Spider Man attacking himself  His descendant symbiotes  including Carnage 28  and Toxin  29  have inherited this trait to a lesser extent  In Secret Wars issue  8  Spider Man first comes in contact with the symbiote  His spider sense goes off but is quickly dampened as the symbiote flowed over Spider Man s body and established the mental link that allowed it to generate webbing and respond to Spider Man s thoughts  However  a clone of Spider Man  Ben Reilly was able to use his spider sense to anticipate the attacks of Venom  This may be related to the fact that the clone was created prior to Peter s bond with the symbiote  This suggests that it is Peter s spider sense that no longer responds to the symbiote due to acclimatization  rather than the symbiote having developed the ability to hide itself  This explanation would be the official reason Spider Man could not sense Venom in The Spectacular Spider Man animated series  Mysterio has developed a radar like device that can neutralize the sense  The clones Kaine  Ben Reilly  and Spidercide were also undetectable  and he is undetectable to their spider senses as well  As they share the same DNA  their spider senses recognize the others as  self   However  Spider Man was later able to use his Spider Sense  albeit it was previously tampered  stripped from him and later restored  all while receiving specific training to hone his battle effectiveness  against a further mutated Kaine  possibly because Kaine s DNA had been altered to a point where it was no longer identical to his own  24  Once Kaine is restored to normal  he is once again able to sneak up on Peter Parker in his civilian guise  though it s worth noting that he was acting peacefully at the time   30  Kraven the Hunter once used a jungle scent that dulled Spider Man s spider sense  The Jackal once succeeded in attacking Spider Man from behind  without triggering his spider sense  The Jackal explained it to be due to him always being Peter Parker s  Spider Man s alter ego  friend  meaning that the spider sense would not regard him as a threat enemy  The Jackal then took off his mask  revealing himself to be Dr  Miles Warren  one of Peter Parker s teachers  inapplicable  contrary to modern continuity   Iron Man has created a device that can send false spider sense signals  He has also incorporated the device into his armor to grant him his own version of the spider sense  However  this mechanism is apparently imperfect since Iron Man was unable to detect the presence of Vision  31  Certain Skrull agents are immune to the sense  Spider Man was unable to sense anything unusual about the agent posing as Elektra  This agent was also able to avoid detection by Wolverine s heightened sense of smell or Doctor Strange s mystical abilities  32  The Spot can attack Spider Man with his attacks coming out of  spots   since Spider Man s spider sense could not detect a threat coming from an alternate dimension  Ezekiel Sims was immune to Peter s spider sense because the two shared similar powers  but this also made Spider Man immune to Ezekiel s  Fogg of the criminal duo Knight and Fogg can confuse it by making it seem the danger is all around Spider Man rather than a specific threat  1  In one issue  May Parker  Aunt May  was able to hit Spider Man from behind without triggering his spider sense  The reasoning behind this is that Peter did not consider Aunt May to be a threat so his spider sense did not warn him when she struck him from behind   edit  Film In the Spider Man films  the spider sense is explained as reflexes  so fast it borders on precognition   often signified with a special sound  like a bell ringing once very slowly  and bullet time photography  In the first Spider Man film  the first time his spider sense triggers  he seems to become aware of every potential danger in his surroundings  even those that pose no real threat  such as a fly or a paper spitball  In the Spider Man 2 novelization  ISBN 2 265 07939 1   the spider sense is described as a general slowing down of his perception of time  e g  one second would feel like a minute   In Spider Man 3  the spider sense is never shown going off in Spider Man s head with its special sound like in the previous two movies  In a minor plot hole  when New Goblin first attacks Peter  it is clear Peter was unaware of the threat  however  this could also be due to Peter s  Spider sense  not considering Harry a threat due to their friendship   Peter is shown using the spider sense only once in the film  to dodge a pumpkin bomb thrown at him by Harry  Also  Eddie Brock as Venom  who is immune to the spider sense  manages to attack Spider Man by surprise  mocking Peter s inability to sense him with  Ooh  my spider sense is tingling  if you know what I m talking about    edit  Fighting style Spider Man has developed a unique fighting style that is nearly impossible for most other heroes to emulate or for most villains to defeat  Spider Man uses all of his powers simultaneously to overpower and overwhelm his foes  He also makes excellent use of his surroundings during battles  For example  he uses a webbed up fire extinguisher as a projectile in order to get distance between himself and Doctor Octopus  crushing arms  He is also never without a witty response or wise crack to throw at an enemy in order to distract  anger  or simply insult a foe  Spider Man s fighting style can best be described as an improvisational freestyle that functionally encompasses the usage of his strength  speed  flexibility  wits  intelligence  and his  spider sense   in order to work his strengths against his opponents  weaknesses  Spider Man is a cunning fighter  so much so that he manages to defeat enemies much more powerful than himself  A major examples of this is his defeat of Titania during the Secret Wars  outpacing her superior strength by focusing on hit and run attacks to catch her off guard  Another is his victory over Galactus  cosmic powered herald  Firelord  Yet another good example is how he once fought the combined efforts of DC s supervillain Mantis and the Marvel villain Juggernaut  both of whom are significantly more powerful than he is   This stems from the vast experience that he has accrued since his teen aged crime fighting years  During the events of  The Other   Peter is shown as receiving martial arts training from Captain America  As per Madame Web s instructions  Shang Chi is now teaching Kung Fu to Spider Man in order to compensate for the loss of his Spider Sense  Together with Shang Chi he devised a unique variant of Kung Fu   The Way of The Spider   which has significantly improved after his spider sense was reactivated   edit  Scientific knowledge Before the radioactive spider bite  Peter Parker was already a gifted academic student with considerable expertise in many fields  such as chemistry  biology  physics  engineering  and advanced technology  Through these skills he was able to create his artificial web fluid  his web shooters and other Spider man equipment  His scientific knowledge has often been used to defeat his adversaries when his powers are not sufficient enough  such as devising an antidote to the formula that originally turned Doctor Connors into the Lizard  creating various mixtures to dissolve the costumes of foes such as the Rhino and El Dorado  Though not described as an ultra high level super genius  his intellect has impressed and gained the respect of individuals such as Iron Man  Ant Man and Mr  Fantastic  During a recent confrontation with Doctor Octopus  who had used various cybernetic enhancements to enable his mind to take virtually complete control of New York  Spider Man s mind proved powerful enough to take control away from his enemy despite Doctor Octopus s scepticism that his mind could be strong enough to accomplish such a feat  33  Currently  Peter makes full use of his intellect at Horizon Labs  by reverse engineering the devices he uses as Spider Man  thereby creating products that Horizon Labs can market to the public   edit  Further mutations Man Spider  from Friendly Neighborhood Spider Man  9  Art by Mike Wieringo  On several occasions  Spider Man takes on more spider like forms at the extreme even transforming into a gigantic spider  When Peter tried to rid himself of his spider powers by using a formula  34  it backfires  he grows four extra arms instead  which extend from his sides  With help from Dr  Curt Connors  and a blood sample from Morbius  he is able to return to normal  For more details on this topic  see The Six Arms Saga  At one point  35  he is transformed by the Savage Land Mutates into a monstrous  predatory form that comes to be called  Man Spider   In this form  his normal human consciousness is submerged  and he attacks like an animal  However  his conscience is able  barely  to stop him from killing  He is transformed into Man Spider several other times  In Spider Man  The Animated Series  the  Six Arms Saga  was reinvented as the  Neogenic Nightmare   where the transformation was not caused by Peter s attempts to remove his powers  but as a result of his body mutating further from the original spider bite  After his attempts to ask Professor X and the X Men for help developing a cure meet with failure  although he was able to assist them in thwarting a monster created when an anti mutant scientist was exposed to a serum he d developed to remove mutant abilities   Spider Man turned to Doctor Crawford for aid  Unfortunately  his initial attempt at a cure resulted in him growing the four new arms  the accelerated mutation subsequently causing him to mutate into the Man Spider after fighting Punisher  a recently mutated Michael Morbius  and the NYPD  Thanks to the collaboration of Kraven the Hunter and the Punisher  Spider Man was cured of the mutation and returned to normal  When the Vulture attempted to drain Spider Man s youth and power in a later encounter  Doctor Connors reprogrammed the device that the Vulture was using to absorb the defective genome that had caused the mutation originally  resulting in the Vulture mutating into a Man Spider  though Vulture managed to get rid of the mutation somehow  and forever curing Spider Man of the defective genome  During the concluding  Spider Wars  storyline of the series  where Spider Man teamed up with multiple alternate versions of himself to save reality   one of his other selves was still dealing with the mutation crisis  completely transforming into the Man Spider during the mission before the Beyonder was able to use the last of his power to teleport Man Spider back to his home dimension  In the Avengers Disassembled crossover event  Spider Man encounters an enemy called the Queen  a woman capable of controlling insects  She triggers another transformation in him  first  he grows extra eyes and hair covering his body  second  he changes into a Man Spider like form  however  with his human mind still intact   and finally he transforms into a giant spider  In that form  he seems to die  but instead emerges in human form  but with enhanced powers   See below   Other transformations included the vicious Spider Lizard which occurred when Spider Man tried to cure Dr  Connors from the Lizard persona by using a portable Enervator  The machine made Peter absorb radioactive feedback and transferred the reptilian metamorphosis to him and granting him bulletproof skin  a powerful tail and reptilian fangs and claws  There was also the Spider Hulk mutation which granted the web slinger the powers and the easy temper of the green goliath by transferring energy from the Hulk  which was kept in a Bio Kinetic Energy Absorber made from a scientist trying to steal the Hulk s powers  to the web slinger  when the latter accidentally touched the device  In the What If  The Other  an alternate variation of the The Other storyline  Peter rejects the Spider and kills it  leaving him in a comatose state  The Venom symbiote abandons its current host  Mac Gargan  and bonds with Peter to become Poison  who combines the powers of Venom and Spider Man s enhanced powers  Peter was not the only one who suffered transferred mutations while wearing the Spider Man costume  Ben Reilly was transformed into the Spider Carnage when he was up against the powerful entity  because he had to bind with the alien in order to prevent its rampage   edit  Powers after  Disassembled  and  The Other  In addition to his original powers  Spider Man gains the following abilities after he fights the Queen in  Disassembled   36  and also after apparently dying at the hands of Morlun and being reborn   Spider Man  The Other   2005   It is apparent that his powers gained from  The Other  are only available because a voice inside him says that he is  embracing the Other   While he still has most of these extra powers  a few of them  most notably the ability to produce organic webbing  no longer seem to be present  for reasons that have yet to be revealed  Joe Queseda implied that the loss of these extra powers may be related to the One More Day storying  In an interview  he stated that  While we won t be making any direct references to  The Other   it s still a part of Spidey history  and it remains to be seen how Pete lost those powers   37  However  in the letters page of Amazing Spider Man  640  the editors stated that the powers were always temporary by nature   Those Other powers really only exhibited themselves under certain circumstances  They weren t extra powers Peter could call up whenever he wanted  so whether or not they ve disappeared for good is a story waiting to be told  That said  though  Peter still does remember the adventure where he got them  He hasn t forgotten   38   edit  Arthropod communication After Disassembled  Spider Man can mentally communicate with arthropods  at least insects and spiders   though he does not seem to be capable of controlling them like Ant Man  He can sense their presence  or glance at any spider and instantly know what kind it is  39  It is possible that this is an extension of his spider sense  Spider Man used this mental capacity to communicate with all of the Queen s followers  humans with an  insect gene   and learned how to deactivate a bomb  40  This power was rarely  if ever  used or referenced after Disassembled   edit  Biological webbing In  Disassembled   Spider Man develops the ability to shoot organic webbing from his wrists  after he recovered from being changed into a spider   and he stopped using his Web shooters which was a great advantage for him because it allowed him to stop being dependent on web cartridges which allowed him limited shots  Once  while fighting Iron Man  Spider Man supposedly  let loose   allowing his webbing to shoot out unrestrained  After he had stopped  he had generated enough webbing to completely encase Iron Man  and nearly fill the alley in which they were fighting with webbing  Since the start of the Brand New Day storyline  this power seems to have gone away  for reasons that are currently unknown  Spider Man s clone Kaine developed the ability to shoot organic webbing following his death and resurrection in Grim Hunt  11  This ability remained present even after the other mutations caused by his resurrection were reversed  41   edit  Night vision After  The Other   Spider Man develops night vision  allowing him to see in the dark to a limited degree  7   edit  Eyes  teeth  and stingers Overcome by rage in  The Other   Spider Man s spider side overruled his human qualities  His eyes turn glowing red  and he develops fanged teeth  night vision  and sharp stingers  42  The stingers were within his arms  protruding from his wrists  They are coated in a venom that inflicts temporary paralysis though the impalement itself could prove fatal  Spider Man cannot consciously control these stingers yet  so they are only triggered in overwhelming situations  Arrow claimed that the stingers will only come out when he is confronting or confronted by creatures who are associated with his mystical powers like Morlun or Ezekiel  which could explain why they ve been seen so rarely  43  Spider Man s clone Kaine appears to have undergone a similar transformation following his death and resurrection in Grim Hunt  as he has fangs  mandibles  and eight glowing red eyes  11  He was later restored to normal  though at the conclusion of Spider Island he grew a pair of stingers from his wrists identical to the ones Spider Man had during  The Other    24   edit  Spider mutation and cocoon During  Disassembled   Spider Man mutates into a giant spider  and then emerges from the spider s body with a new ability to communicate with arthropods and organic webbing  In  The Other   Spider Man seemingly dies and molts his damaged skin  He creates a cocoon  and emerges with all his bodily damage healed  lost teeth  broken bones  his lost eye  which Morlun had torn out and eaten   scars  and even lost tonsils  In the words of Tony Stark  Peter s  odometer s been reset   Since it was claimed in related issues that some species of spiders shed their skin once in a lifetime  this may be a one time occurrence  44  In  Grim Hunt   Spider Man s clone Kaine dies  only to return later under similar circumstances  11   edit  Powers after  Brand New Day   edit  Psychic blindspot Although not technically Spider Man s power  the worldwide mindwipe of Spider Man s identity as Peter Parker occurred sometime prior to the events of Brand New Day  Spider Man is aware that the whole world has forgotten his secret identity 45  and that he played a role in making it happen  When Norman Osborn confronts Peter in his apartment  as part of the New Ways To Die story arc  Peter thinks to himself   Ah  right  He doesn t remember anymore  He has no idea I m Spidey  Nobody does  Everything we did is still up and running  I m safe  46   Peter later describes it to Mister Fantastic as a  psychic blindspot   When confronted with any evidence which could lead to the realization that Spider Man is Peter Parker  those affected will be unable to  connect the dots   or they will come to the wrong conclusion  but will accept it as the right one  An example of this is shown in the comics when Norman Osborn discovers a camera at a fight scene that is taking pictures of Spider Man based on a tracking device in his suit  rather than assuming that Peter Parker is Spider Man taking pictures of himself  he assumes that Spider Man takes the pictures and uses Peter as his  agent  to collect the money for him  47  Another example is when Horizon Labs  Max Modell confronts Peter about his connection to Spider Man  and comes to the conclusion that Peter had created all of Spider Man s equipment  as he stated that having both the scientific knowledge and super powers in the same person pushes the limits of believability  23  If Spider Man were to be unmasked   or were to unmask himself   then the memories of affected people witnessing the incident would be restored  Mister Fantastic claims he can duplicate the  firewalls  for himself and the Fantastic Four  allowing Spider Man to tell them his identity  without fear of further compromising his secret  48  The psychic blindspot power s magnitude is high enough to fool even Daredevil s senses  49  who can normally identify people with the sound of their individual heartbeat rhythm or the scent of body odors  In Amazing Spider Man  600  Daredevil refused to know again Spider Man s identity  as the psychic blindspot power was enough to even fool his heightened senses  and thus he did not want to compromise that protection  The Black Cat  having learnt Mary Jane s ex boyfriend was Spider Man  was able to recall back when she was dating Flash Thompson that Mary Jane had a boyfriend at the time  but when prompted with the name  Peter    she dismissed it immediately due to the mechanics of the blindspot  50  It was hinted in The Amazing Spider Man  561 and The Amazing Spider Man  601 that Mary Jane is aware of Peter s dual identity  which is finally confirmed in  605  It was also shown that Kaine is immune to the psychic blindspot  as Kaine is in fact a clone of Spider Man  51  It was revealed in Spider Island that the Jackal also retains memory of Spider Man s secret identity  most like due to all the DNA samples he has collected from Spider Man and the clones he has created from them over the years  52  Given that Morlun and Steve Rogers were deceased during One More Day  it is unknown if they remember Spider Man s identity  It was revealed in Amazing Spider Man  640 and  641 that Peter went to Doctor Strange and begged him to make the world forget he was Spider Man  53  Doctor Strange in turn visited Tony Stark and Reed Richards via astral projection and convinced them to help him do so via a mix of magic and science in a similar fashion to how the world forgot who the Sentry was  The three decided that the sole person with the knowledge of Spider Man being Peter Parker would be Peter himself  and in Reed s words  have Tony infect the world with the mind purging virus storm via his Extremis system as the carrier  With a magic barrier in the shape of a sphere  Peter was to go in it  where he would be immune from the mind purge  but Peter decided at the last second to take Mary Jane inside as well  54  Due to the events of Spider Island where Peter publicly used his powers unmasked  albeit while claiming that he was one of the people infected by the  virus  that gave most of New York his abilities   55  he had unknowingly invalidated the spell that Dr  Strange had set up  thereby making it possible for others to deduce his secret identity again  although his past unmasking has still been erased from the world s memory  This was confirmed as Carlie Cooper breaks off her relationship with him after deducing his true connection to Spider Man due to her frustration at his lies  30   edit  Equipment Although he is usually of limited financial means  Spider Man develops personal equipment that plays an important role in his superhero career   edit  Artificial web shooters Spider Man s web shooters  from The Amazing Spider Man 259  Art by Ron Frenz  Spider Man s web shooters were perhaps his most distinguishing trait  after his costume  Peter had reasoned that a spider  even a human one  needed a web  Since the radioactive spider bite did not initially grant him the power to spin webs  he had instead found a way to produce them artificially  The wrist mounted devices fire an adhesive  webbing   see below  through a threaded adjustable nozzle  The trigger rests high in the palm and requires a double tap from the middle two fingers to activate  eliminating the chance of accidental discharge when forming a fist  56  To accomplish this his hands are often in a distinctive hand position when he fires them  resembling the sign for  I love you  in American Sign Language  reverting someone giving you the  Evil Eye  in Italian superstition or the horned hand heavy metal gesture   In order to fire the webbing  Spider Man s fingers must hit the sensor precisely  Spider Man must steadily replenish his webbing supply  reloading his web shooters with small cartridges of web fluid  which is stored under high pressure  In early stories  he carries his extra supplies in a utility belt worn under his costume  57  Later on  he equips the web shooters with a bracelet like carousel that automatically rotates a new cartridge into position as he empties them  When in use  a steel nipple in the carousel pierces the seal of the cartridge  and allows the fluid to travel through an air tight channel toward the nozzle  Pressing down on the palm trigger of the web shooter causes the valve in the nozzle to open wider  expelling the fluid out  Releasing the trigger causes the valves to close  cutting off the web line or fluid  If Spider Man creates any variation to his normal web formula that s too strong for the pinch valves to sever  he might end up being tangled up or tied to the object he attached his web to  This has happened on more than one occasion  His web shooters require constant maintenance and on more than one occasion suffer jams or malfunctions  Spider Man s web shooters require tremendous pressure to fire them  in most cases  Spider Man s enhanced strength   and the average human cannot activate the trigger without the use of a hammer or similar object  58  although in many cases  normal human strength is sufficient enough to activate them for the purposes of plot development  59  Occasionally  the web shooters are modified to expel other liquids  After he develops organic webbing  Spider Man gives the web shooters to his wife Mary Jane as a Valentine s Day present  after having them changed into bracelets  and weakening the pressure required  so that she can use the bracelets for self defense  60  This appears to have reversed at some point  as Spider Man is once again dependent on his web shooters since the start of the Brand New Day storyline  for unknown reasons  In the most recent issues  he has upgraded them to fire on voice command  Ben Reilly  as the Scarlet Spider and later as Spider Man  uses modified web shooters that can fire fast acting sedative  stinger  darts  and  impact webbing   balls of webbing that explode on impact and envelop the target  The impact webbing and stingers are activated by certain wrist movements  rather than using a double tap on a palm trigger  They use larger web cartridges than Peter s web shooters and worn on the outside of his costume  Spider Girl  Peter s alternate future daughter  uses modified versions of Ben s web shooters  Scientists from the History Channel s Spider Man Tech stated that logically  if web fluid were to exist  it would not be possible for Spider Man to store the necessary propellant and fluid in a small cartridge  as a result organic webbing would be more realistic as far as his webbing use is concerned  Emma Stone revealed that in the The Amazing Spider Man  Peter Parker will be inventing and shooting webs from web shooters instead of organic webbing in the previous films  The second trailer shows they will be more high tech than most versions   edit  Webbing Spider Man shooting his webbing  Shortly after getting his powers  Peter Parker  established early on as being extremely intelligent and creative  develops a special synthetic polymer adhesive that has spider web like properties  as well as wrist worn launching devices  see Web Shooters   Upon release  the webbing dries into an extremely tough  flexible  adhesive fiber  One account described a single strand as stronger than piano wire and it is perhaps as strong as real spider silk or Kevlar  Spider Man has used web shields on several occasions to protect himself from small caliber bullets   In Spider Man  The Ultimate Guide  one strand of webbing is described to be strong enough to bind the Hulk and hold him prisoner  but only if the Hulk were to hold still and let the webbing sufficiently dry  Also  according to recent volumes of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  the tensile strength of the webbing is equivalent to 120 lb  54 kg  per square millimeter in cross section and is comparable to nylon with extraordinary adhesive properties  Its exact composition is unknown  but after about an hour  the webbing breaks down  loses strength and eventually evaporates  61  since Spider Man never intended to hold his captives forever as well as to not leave any traces of web behind for detection trailing reasons  Furthermore its non durability never allows potential enemies to gain insight or advantage on one of Spider Man s most important assets  Spider Man can do many things with his webs  Firing a thin strand to a great height at a nearby tall building  then brachiating on this  webline   Doing this in rapid series allows Spider Man to quickly travel through well developed urban areas  His travel speed has not been officially stated  though the Sins Past storyline depicts his crossing the borough of Manhattan in under 11 minutes  because he has been able to travel by web since the age of fifteen  Peter Parker does not have a driver s license   62  During his web swinging travelling  Spider Man can reach 120 mph  190 km h   Firing a thicker  rope  of webbing  Spider Man can bind captured criminals  even those with superhuman strength  to be later picked up by police officers  Covering a small area with an extremely sticky blob  Spider Man can cover an opponent s eyes  blindfolding them  or smother a handgun or a small bomb  On one occasion  63  he told a criminal whose weapon and hand had been so covered   I should warn you about the tensile strength of my webbing  but considering your likely IQ  let s just say that if you pull that trigger again  the backfire will probably take your hand off  Kapeesh   Casting a large web across a street or alley to snare rapidly moving persons or vehicles  The longer Spider Man presses his two middle fingers in his palm to throw web  the thicker the web becomes as layers are being added on and on  Improvising small structures  such as parachutes  statues or dummies  baseball bats  full size operational gliders  trampolines  gloves  for fighting the likes of Electro   nets  water tight domes  for underwater breathing   bandages  slings  bulletproof shields  plugs  patches  and even hammocks  In his early adventures  Spider Man sometimes fired the fluid as a straight liquid to use its maximum adhesive strength  To defeat the Blob  he once intentionally broke a web cartridge  exposing the fluid to air  rather than channeling it through his webshooter  By exposing it to air  the web fluid immediately expanded  covering the Blob in a large mass of webbing  Though expanded  it did not appear to lose any of its strength  as it was able to contain the Blob until the police arrested him  Peter has also been seen using the impact webbing  Originally crafted from Ben Reilly  the impact webbing is a large ball of webbing that explodes on contact and covers the opponent in webbing from top to bottom  In some cases  like in Spider Man 2 and Spider Man 3 and some comics  Peter is able to let out a thick piece of web for a short time  creating a small projectile weapon  Spider Man can modify his webbing when anticipating combat with a specific threat  These modifications include non conductive webbing  typically for battling Electro   flame retardant webbing  against the Human Torch or out of control fires   stronger  yet less stable  webbing for dealing with Stegron s dinosaur army  and even acid webbing that can eat through the Rhino s tough hide  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  Organic webs In the  Disassembled  storyline  64  Parker undergoes a transformation that results in the ability to produce organic web fluid from his wrists  and is able to fire his webbing in much the same manner as his artificial web shooters  According to the new 2007 Spider Man handbook  Parker has grown spinnerets in his forearms that terminate in small pores at the junction of his wrists  By pressing down with his middle fingers to his palm  he causes the pores to open and the spinnerets to eject the organic fluid with a force equal to or greater than that of his web shooters  The effectiveness and amount of the new webbing is dependent upon his health and nutrition  The specific properties of this new organic webbing are unknown  but it can be safely assumed to be comparable to his artificially created web mixture  In some cases  it has shown to be of greater tensile strength and elasticity  Furthermore  according to the new handbook  the organic webbing takes a week to dissolve  After gaining this ability  he begins using the bio webbing instead of his traditional mechanical web shooters  The upper limit as to how much webbing he could produce at any one time has not been specified  though during Part 1 of the  One More Day  storyline  Peter actually produced enough webbing to immobilize and smother Iron Man s armor  In the subsequent Brand New Day storyline  Peter is shown to have his traditional web shooters and appears to have lost the ability to create organic webbing  for reasons that have yet to be revealed  Instead of having mechanical webshooters in the live action Spider Man movies  Spider Man grew spinnerets in his forearms  to give an explanation to the controversy from fans  this was explained by the producers  desire to make Peter Parker more realistic  as it was believed that  if he could create a substance that official government scientists could not create  it would distance himself from the average person citation needed   In the first Spider Man movie  Peter gains them simultaneously with his other powers  and never made use of artificial web shooters  although the film s novelization states that Peter made similar bracelets to help him aim his shots as his first attempts to web sling ends with him using all sorts of weird hand positions in an attempt to shoot web  missing his mark several times and smacking into a billboard the first time he successfully swung  One biologist on the History Channel s Spider Man Tech suggested that it would be more plausible for Spider Man to shoot webbing from the Submandibular gland beneath the tongue instead of from his forearms  1   edit  Animated Series In 1994 s Spider Man  The Animated Series  Parker explains that when he became Spider Man  he also became subconsciously aware that a combination of certain enzymes would create a strong  sticky fluid reminiscent of a spider s webbing  He then built web shooters as in the comics   edit  Spider tracers Spider Man uses small electronic  spider tracers  of his own design that allow him to track objects or individuals  Typically  Spider Man plants one on a departing enemy  or throws one to adhere to an escaping enemy  and then follows the target to their hideout for later attack  Spider Man sometimes also uses a launching device in his web shooters for better range and accuracy  A tracer s outer casing is shaped like a spider  with legs for aerodynamic flight  The tracers are small enough to remain unnoticed  in general  but sometimes a target finds a tracer and destroys it  In early stories  Spider Man uses a small electronic receiver to follow the signals of his tracers  but eventually he modifies the tracers to emit a signal he can follow with his spider sense so that he will be able to know whether or not he is in the proximity of the tracer  According to what he once said to Hank Pym  who noted that Peter may actually be smarter than him if he was able to design this at fifteen when Pym spent years developing similar technology for his helmet   65  he is able to sense the tracer within a 100 yard radius  The receiver  however  offers better range  Spider Man is unable to sense a tracer that had been taken out of Manhattan at one point  66  The receiver  however  allows him to follow it to the town of Scarsdale  New York  some 20 miles  32 km  away  It is not yet established if the changes to his spider sense documented in  The Other  storyline have affected Spider Man s ability to sense the tracers  Besides Spider Man  Daredevil can pick up the signal with his Radar Sense from the Spider Tracers due to his heightened sense of hearing being able to hear the signal  Unlike Spider Man  it is more difficult for Daredevil to follow the signal  as he must drown out all other sounds around him to maintain focus  67  In several stories  enemies use the tracers to lure him into a trap  Enemies with sufficient technical knowledge can reprogram the tracers into overloading his spider sense  making it hard for him to tell the difference between real danger and the tracer  68  Or they just attune it to his sixth sense and they can simply put to a target of their own  just like Tracer did in  The Other   His clone  Ben Reilly  can also pick up the signal from Peter s tracers  Ben also developed a modified version of the original tracer into a simpler  Micro Dot  form  Like Peter s  these devices can be fired from Ben s web shooters and can adhere to most surfaces  They fly like miniature Frisbees  May Parker s spider sense operates on a different frequency than her father s  requiring her to use the tracer device  as Peter s tracers do not trigger her spider sense  Following her rescue from an obsessed kidnapper  Mary Jane Watson wears an amplified version of a spider tracer in a necklace pendant  It carries a boosted signal so Spider Man can follow it over a longer distance  After the events of  Revenge Of The Spider Slayer   the Spider Tracers become useless since Spider Man can no longer pick up their signal due to the loss of his Spider Sense  69  However  in the  Road to Spider Island   from working with Horizon Labs  Spider Man made new and improved Spider Tracers with listening devices  GPS and camouflauge  70  Some further modifications include using them as weapons with one example of combating Hydro Man by freezing him solid with a cryogenic Spider Tracer  71  This particular advancement is then applied toward a medical transplant delivery system   edit  Utility belt and spider signal Spider Man keeps his regular field equipment in a utility belt that can carry extra web fluid cartridges  spider tracers  and his camera  The belt can hold up to 30 cartridges  each one being pressured to 300 psi  The belt s buckle contains a small but powerful light  which is filtered through a lens decorated with a stylized likeness of Spider Man s mask  This spider signal is mostly limited to intimidating weak nerved criminals and acting as a wide beam flashlight  It is sometimes used to call for help  as well  The signal is later used in The Spectacular Spider Man  At his job at Horizon Labs  Peter has upgraded his utility belt to hold cartridges of different types of webbing and his Spider Signal has a UV light setting for forensic analysis   edit  Camera Peter Parker gains employment as a freelance  and sometimes staff  photographer through most of his teen and young adult years  He sells pictures of himself in action as Spider Man  takes any assignments offered  or  sometimes  uses his powers to help him photograph special events where normal press access is limited or denied  for the New York newspaper The Daily Bugle  His first camera  originally his father s  has an extended rear metal plate that allows him to use his web to secure it to a wall or other fixed object without interfering with its functions  Typically  Spider Man positions the camera before intervening in a crime or emergency  Spider Man gradually improves on the camera s simple timer  including adding a motion sensor that triggered the camera whenever he  as Spider Man  moved in front of it  He has updated and replaced the camera  they are occasionally destroyed during battles  as necessary over the years  Partly due to the stinginess of Bugle editor publisher J  Jonah Jameson  Parker never earns much money as a freelancer  The Bugle  legal owner of his submitted work  eventually publishes a book of his photographic images  Webs  which helps improve his finances  He wins a Pulitzer Prize for his picture of the Sentry  but the Sentry s earlier adventures and their consequences are later wiped from human memory  probably including this award  Parker does  however  win other photography awards over the years  Peter Parker publicly reveals his secret identity during the Civil War crossover  The Bugle staff  particularly Jameson   are shocked to learn that Parker had been selling them photographs of himself for years and is taking legal action for the fraud  although due to the actions of the Scarlet Spiders  Peter Parker s identity as Spider Man was heavily questioned  In addition  the events of One More Day has retconned anyone knowing Peter Parker s identity as Spider Man  thus restoring the status quo of the early Spider Man comics  Peter Parker currently no longer uses his camera due to being discredited as a photographer during the events of  The Gauntlet  storyline   edit  Spider Mobile Corona Motors approaches Spider Man through the advertising agency Carter  amp  Lombardo  offering him use of a new nonpolluting motor they had invented and wished to promote  to be installed in a  Spider Mobile  of his design  72  Initially reluctant but tempted by the promised endorsement fees  Spider Man enlists the aid of Johnny Storm  aka the Human Torch  in creating the vehicle  a heavily customized dune buggy with web launchers and a spider signal  It debuted in The Amazing Spider Man  130  It proves useful for a time but is quickly wrecked  Spider Man having not yet learned to drive   The Tinkerer  with support from the Kingpin   salvages and modifies it further to allow it to drive itself and drive up walls  and he uses it against Spider Man  who barely manages to disable it  Spider Man returns the heavily damaged vehicle to Carter  amp  Lombardo  suspending it with webbing outside the window of their 14th story offices  73  Spider Man  who had never been enthused by the project  looks back on the entire affair with some regret  repeatedly calling the Spider Mobile  hokey   Most recently  the Spider Mobile made a brief cameo appearance  74  and an appearance in the flashback series Spider Man and Human Torch  It is revealed that the Spider Mobile had been donated to the Smithsonian Museum  75  However  it is also seen later in the 18th precinct s  superhuman evidence locker   76  which might suggest that the exhibit featuring the vehicle was discontinued  According to the flash forward featured in the  Old Man Logan  storyline starting in Wolverine  66  in a certain future a blind Hawkeye currently owns the Spider Mobile and has customized it with the aid of one of his ex wives  Hawkeye uses it to transport himself and Logan across the country to make a delivery  77   edit  Costumes  edit  Original red and blue costume Although the details change somewhat over the years  Spider Man s costume  with a few notable exceptions  remains fairly consistent  The standard is a form fitting spandex bodysuit  which from the waist down is blue  except for mid calf boots with a black web pattern on a red background  From the waist up  the fabric is a red and black web pattern  except for his back  sides  and insides of his upper arms  which are blue  There is a large red spider outline on his back  and a smaller black spider emblem on his chest  The back spider has changed over the years  featuring a spider with slightly smaller feet in the past  The mask has white one way mirror type lenses rimmed with black  the white portions of the mask s eyes sometimes  squint  when Peter has his eyes partly shut  Whether this is his mask actually changing in response to his eyelids moving  or artistic license  is not clear   In addition to covering his entire head  thereby leaving no distinguishing features  the mask also muffles his voice  making it unrecognizable  The boots are composed of a thin material that allows Spider Man s adhering ability to work through the soles of his feet  The boots  mask  and gloves can be folded up and stored inside a pocket while the remainder of his costume can be worn under his civilian clothes  Modernly  Spider Man has taken to making and wearing a bulletproof version of this costume  This standard costume varies in the details depending on the artist  he is sometimes depicted with  underarm webbing  connecting his arms to his torso  the eyes of his mask vary from barely larger than human eyes to extremely large  the blue portions of his costume vary from light blue to black  the usual standard is dark blue   and the density of the web design varies   edit  Black costume One of the most significant alterations to Spider Man s costume takes place during the Secret Wars crossover event  in which Spider Man begins to wear a black costume  After ruining his red and blue one in battle on Battleworld  the Hulk tells Spider Man about a machine operated simply by thinking of what kind of suit  weapon or equipment someone needs  When Spider Man thought of a new costume  the machine gave him a black sphere  When he touched it  Spider Man found himself covered in a new black costume  Later on in Secret Wars  12  Spider Man sees that other heroes are getting costumes from a different machine  not the one that he used  The costume first appears in Amazing Spider Man  vol  1   252  May 1984   several months before its origin is revealed in Secret Wars  8  This costume has a large white spider emblem on the chest and back and white organic web shooters on the backs of the hands  Unbeknownst to Spider man  the costume is actually an alien symbiote that was able to copy his abilities  The alien also learned the chemical composition of Spider Man s webbing  the frequency at which his spider sense operates  which allowed Venom to dampen Spider Man s sixth sense   and could also copy his ability to stick to walls  Because of this  Venom s powers are similar to Spider Man s  Also  having copied all of Spider Man s movements  the alien started sneaking back on to Peter s body after Peter had removed it and fallen asleep  It would then carry the unconscious body of Spider Man through a typical session of fighting street crime  albeit without speaking a word   Thus  for as long as he had the symbiote costume  Peter found himself inexplicably tired every morning  for though his mind slept  his body was getting no rest at night  Upon discovering the true nature of the costume  Peter rejects the creature by using high frequency sonics  Peter then creates a non living costume similar to the symbiote  but he stops wearing this costume  when Mary Jane is viciously attacked by Venom  the symbiote s new incarnation   choosing to toss it into a fire and go back to his red and blue suit  However  when forced to confront Morbius in the sewers  Peter has the costume remade for the benefit of stealth  An interview released by Marvel editor in chief Joe Quesada  via newsarama  and Spider Man editor Axel Alonso  CBR com  stated that Spider Man would be going back to his classic  Black  costume immediately after Civil War ends  Amazing Spider Man  539   February 2007   Marvel s February solicits confirm this  featuring Spider Man returning to his black costume across all of his titles  78  79  In Sensational Spider Man  vol  2   35  the Black Costume is first shown with underarm webbing like the original costume  A variation on the black costume is featured in the film Spider Man 3  It includes the webbing pattern from Spider Man s red and blue costume with a black coloring and a slightly altered spider symbol  both on his chest and back  The same costume is also worn by Venom  with the added details of Venom s signature teeth and a more muscular appearance  In The Spectacular Spider Man animated series  the black costume is initially identical to the red and blue webbed costume only entirely in black with silver webs  as in Spider Man 3  but gradually grows to resemble the one featured in the comics over the course of several episodes as Peter becomes more affected by its influence  Here it creates its own webbing by use of its own semi liquid composition  as well as being able to shrink to almost nothing due to said liquid properties  The game Marvel  Ultimate Alliance features Spider Man s black costume  or  Symbiote   as the second unlockable costume  The black costume stemmed from an idea submitted by a then 22 year old fan named Randy Schueller  after Marvel in 1982 had asked its readers for ideas for new Spider man stories  Schueller s idea was purchased by Jim Shooter for the sum of  220  Randy Schueller spelled out his involvement with the black costume and Marvel in an article at Comic Book Resources   2  One interesting theory is that Spider Man often embraces the black costume during moments of heightened emotional passion or fatigue  as during the Civil War events he wore it as a fear invoking costume before hunting Kraven s family with the black costume during events of the Grim Hunt  this perhaps illustrating the darker nature of Spider Man when overwhelmed with considerable force of emotional agony   edit  Wrestling In the film and the video game  the wrestling costume is first worn by Peter Parker for the wrestling match against Bone Saw McGraw  rather than simply wearing a bag over his head  as in the comic book  Although in the first movie Peter is shown designing his standard costume in a notebook  the outfit he wears to the wrestling match is much cruder and apparently hastily assembled  consisting of simply a long sleeved red t shirt with a home dyed spider and web design in black across the chest  red ski mask  blue sweat pants  and socks  The wrestling costume can be seen worn by Peter in Spider Man 3 in his flashbacks  In Ultimate Spider man  Peter wears a similar suit consisting of a red long sleeved shirt  black sweatpants  a black ski mask with sewn on red patches to mark the eyes  and swim goggles   edit  Extemporaneous substitutes When Spider Man first rids himself of the symbiote  he finds himself without clothing across town from his home  The Human Torch gives him an old Fantastic Four uniform  without boots   a paper bag to conceal his identity    and a  kick me  sign on his back  80  Years later he again uses a paper bag as an impromptu disguise prior to his new costumes being completed to conceal his identity after a bounty was placed on his head  calling himself the  Bombastic Bag Man   because the White Rabbit was attacking the city after capturing the Grizzly and the Gibbon and none of his other costumes were completed or available yet  81  The Bag Man costume returns once again in New Warriors  vol  4  when one child is dressed in the suit with other children in other super hero costumes  82  If he has no costume and Spider Man is needed  he will use webbing  street clothes  or whatever else is available to hide his identity  This costume also appeared as one of the Variant covers of  Spider Man  The Other   In Spider Girl  when fighting the super skrull Apex  Peter asked Johnny to loan him a costume  on the condition that it did not include a paper bag and a kick me sign  Johnny replied that he is offended that Peter thinks he would repeat the same gag  instead lending him an old  ill fitting Fantastic Four jumpsuit and one of Ben Grimm s metal helmets  In the 2010 video game Spider Man  Shattered Dimensions the  The Bombastic Bag Man  is a costume that can be used   edit  Captain Universe and Daredevil The Uni Power is an extra dimensional force that possesses an individual in a time of crisis  transforming that person into Captain Universe  Spider Man became Captain Universe for a short while beginning in The Spectacular Spider Man  158  during the  Acts of Vengeance  storyline  The Uni Power grants him cosmic level abilities and awareness and as a result  all of his natural spider powers are greatly enhanced  For example  Spider Man s strength was amplified to the point of being able to punch the Hulk into orbit  The efficiency of his spider sense is also enhanced to such a degree that the tingling becomes painful and responds to nearly everything  no matter how minor  He also gains telescopic vision  molecular manipulation capabilities  a high degree of resistance to physical injury  flight  and the power to manipulate great amounts of energy for a variety of purposes  With the Uni Power at his command  Spider Man is able to defeat the likes of Magneto and Graviton  Spider Man  however  does not become aware of the actual  possession  until much later on because of the powers being partially suppressed by a machine devised by one of Parker s teachers at Empire State University  In the aftermath of the Acts of Vengeance  the suppression is removed in time to battle and defeat the Tri Sentinel  Both Spider Man s costume and the traditional Captain Universe attire are merged into a single uniform after Spider Man gained awareness  Once the Tri Sentinel is destroyed  Spider Man loses the Captain Universe powers  On one occasion  Spider Man masquerades in Daredevil s costume in order to convince people that Daredevil and Matt Murdock are two different people  83  Recently  Spider Man has once again disguised himself as Daredevil when his costume winds up getting stolen by the daughter of Kraven   edit  Negative Zone and Alex Ross While traveling to the Negative Zone to rescue three children  Spider Man s suit transformed into a white and black suit that apparently did nothing other than change his appearance  84  On a second visit to the Negative Zone  Spider Man gained a version of his red and blue nano tech suit from the TV series Spider Man Unlimited  85  Also  Alex Ross created a specially designed suit with a different makeover for the live action movie  which was still in development at the time   For example  the costume design was more angular than the classic design  the spider insignias on his chest and back were more stylized  and identical to each other   the red boots were missing  and the areas that were typically blue in the classic design and even the eyepieces were black  This suit was used in the Spider Man 2 video game for PlayStation  and in the Spider Man the movie game for PS2 and on PSone it was available in two versions  the colored red and black version  and a sketch version in black and white  In Spider Man  Shattered Dimensions  the Negative Zone costume worn by Spider Man Noir is an alternate costume   edit  Ben Reilly s costumes Main article  Ben Reilly Benjamin  Ben  Reilly  also known as the Scarlet Spider  the second Spider Man and Spider Carnage  is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics Universe  He is a clone of Peter Parker  Spider Man   and is prominent in the Clone Saga  He first appeared in The Amazing Spider Man 149  October 1975   Ben Reilly was the first successful clone of Peter Parker created by the Jackal  as the first clone  Kaine  had suffered from clone degeneration which made him become unstable  Through arcane science  Ben is imprinted with Peter s memories and in their first encounter believed himself to be the original  After Peter Parker was captured by the Jackal  both Parker and Reilly found themselves in Spider Man costumes at Shea Stadium  and initially fought each other believing the other was the imposter  When realizing the stakes  they decided to team up in an attempt to save the Gwen Stacy clone and a captured Ned Leeds  In the process  the clone appeared to be killed in the explosion  and Parker  fearful of the consequences of a second body of  Peter Parker  turning up while he was still alive  dropped Reilly s body in a smokestack  Ben apparently survived and escaped from the smokestack  When he witnessed Parker and Mary Jane Watson in an embrace  decided to part on a nomadic life as if no one knew his existence  He dubbed himself the alias  Ben Reilly   using his Uncle Ben s first name and his Aunt May s maiden name  Ben Parker and May Reilly respectively  He took some old clothes Parker had intended to donate to charity  and he left New York deeply depressed  Five years later  Reilly discovers that May Parker is dying from a stroke  so he returns to New York  There  Reilly encounters Peter Parker  who has become bitter and angry following several tragedies  While they initially come to blows  they quickly begin working together  Soon after  Reilly dons a makeshift costume  and is dubbed the  Scarlet Spider  by the press  When Peter retired as Spider Man  Ben donned a new version of the Spider Man costume as he felt that the original version needed an update  coupled with the fact that he did not feel as though he was ready to shoulder the burdens of the original costume yet   edit  Protective wear On a few occasions  Spider Man has altered his costume for specific purposes  He uses a very short lived  silver colored armored suit in Web of Spider Man  100  developed at Empire State University Labs by the web slinger  The armor severely impairs his natural agility  though it renders him highly resistant to high caliber bullets  However  the armor is soon destroyed by acid  In The Amazing Spider Man  425  he creates an electrically insulated costume to fight Electro  He also previously fashioned another insulated costume from a rubber air mattress to protect himself from Electro in The Spectacular Spider Man  66  but that was a more of an ad hoc creation  which he crudely manufactured in an hour  It featured the classic red and blue colors  but not the web pattern or the spider emblem   edit  Identity Crisis Main article  Identity Crisis  Marvel Comics  In 1998  Parker created four distinct costumes during the  Identity Crisis  storyline  for the identities Dusk  Ricochet  Hornet  and Prodigy  Four other people later used these costumes and identities in the Slingers comic book series  The second Hornet and Dusk were killed  Prodigy was forcefully inducted into the Initiative  and Ricochet retired Joined the Loners   edit  Final costume Spider Man s final costume  Art by John Romita  Jr  In Amazing Spider Man  500  Peter has a mystical experience where he simultaneously experiences the beginning and the potential end of his career as Spider Man  This costume he wears in his final battle is utilitarian  consisting solely of a reversible jacket  mask and gloves  In Amazing Spider Man  502  Peter receives the design for this exact costume from Leo Zelinsky  The Super Hero Tailor  This was in response to his criticism that the hero s usual tight costume is unsanitary for his skin  threatening to cause athlete s foot all over his body  The costume reappeared as part of a possible dark future if Spider Man were to kill Kraven the Hunter during the end of the Grim Hunt storyline  86   edit  Stark Armor  Iron Spider  After Spider Man s newer powers developed in  The Other   Tony Stark  Iron Man  developed a new suit for Peter  which he began wearing in The Amazing Spider Man  529  Nicknamed the  Iron Spider  costume  it is red and gold  according to Marvel Editor In Chief Joe Quesada   Stark s design  Stark s color   The suit was designed by Quesada  based on a sketch by Chris Bachalo  87  The suit s appearance has had a mixed reception from fans  88  Supported by a system similar to that of Stark s classic Iron Man design  it features many gadgets  including three mechanical spider arms  or  waldoes   that can be used to see around corners  via cameras in the tips  and to manipulate objects indirectly  Stark describes them as too delicate to use in combat  yet Spider Man shortly afterward uses them to smash through the sensors in Titanium Man s helmet  Later on during the Civil War storyline  he uses them   reluctantly   during his fight with Captain America  Other features include short distance gliding capability  limited bulletproofing  built in fire police emergency scanner  audio visual amplification  including infrared and ultraviolet   cloaking device  carbon filters to keep out airborne toxins  and a short range GPS microwave communication system  It grants the ability to breathe under water  and can morph into different shapes due to its   smart  liquid metal  form  It can also  more or less disappear  when not needed due to reactions to neurological impulses as Tony Stark revealed  The new costume is able to look like other styles of costumes Spider Man has worn over the years or turn into his street clothes  Part of the costume can detach itself from Spider Man to cover an object too dangerous to touch  such as a radioactive asteroid  All these features are controlled by a computer system in the chest piece  The suit responds to mental control  89  The armor also has a secret override that can be activated by Iron Man in case of emergencies or if Spider Man ever switches sides  which he does in Civil War  5   However  unknown to Stark  Peter was already aware of the safety measure and had bypassed it with his own override  Password Surprise  Perhaps most sinister  Stark discovered a way to give his own Iron Man armor a  spider sense  based on Peter s  and the ability to give Spider Man s sense red herrings  Peter wore this suit as Spider Man s official costume until writer J  Michael Straczynski chose to revert to the older costume  It was used symbolically to show Peter s divided loyalties during the Civil War event at Marvel Comics  promotional images showing him with the Iron Spider costume alongside the pro registration heroes and in his classic costume on the anti registration side  In Civil War  6  Spider Man is in his classic costume  but he apparently put this costume away since he returned to his black outfit in early 2007  as seen in Civil War  7  Whether or not Spider Man still has this costume remains to be seen  The Stark armor costume has been duplicated and was used by three clones created out of the deceased MVP s genetic material in the Initiative who identify themselves as  Red Team   War Machine labels them Scarlet Spiders  It is unknown what new powers the team possesses  but they have been shown to be using some of the built in powers such as the cloaking device  communications  and waldoes which the original costume possessed  Avengers  The Initiative  3   One change is that there are now four waldoes  as opposed to three  These suits have the original s morphing ability  90  as well as web shooters  and wall crawling capability  91  Marvel  Ultimate Alliance features the  Iron Spidey  costume as Spider Man s final costume  however  it does not feature the Waldoes  The Wii version of Spider Man  Web of Shadows also features the Iron Spider outfit as an unlockable costume  Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 also features this costume as Peter s only Alternate Costume  but this time it includes the Waldoes and the gold parts are now white  This costume can only be unlocked by choosing Pro Registration  Spider Man  Shattered Dimensions also features the Iron Spider armor as an alternate suit for Spider Man 2099  92  In the trailer for the upcoming Ultimate Spider Man TV series  it shows this costume to be an alternate costume for Spider Man  equipped with energy repulsors that rival those of Iron Man   edit  Big Time  edit  Stealth suit After a disastrous battle with the new Hobgoblin  Phil Urich  in Amazing Spider Man  649 and  650  Peter develops a black costume with blue lights using new technology he created from his job at Horizon Labs  which he begins wearing in Amazing Spider Man  650 as part of the Big Time story arc  It is created with a  omni harmonic mesh  based on one of Henry Pym s theories  with wave bending technology to both light and sound with Peter adapting concepts he developed during his work with Tony Stark  It features several modes  the first which turns the lights on his costume neon green and gives him the ability to be invisible to both visual and audio means except from certain lens and frequencies so allies can see and communicate with him  The green lights on the costume are for the benefit of whoever needs to see him  while wearing the lens   along with himself  as otherwise he is invisible to his own eyes  The second mode  which turns the lights on his costume red  can cancel out all sonic based attacks on his person  A side effect of this is that it disrupts any attempt to communicate with Peter using sound  and vice versa  Using this principle  Peter developed new  lightweight noise reduction headphones at Horizon Labs  The costume contains a new type of weapon based similar in shape to his Spider Tracers  but created from Anti Metal  also known as Antarctic Vibranium   which can be fired from the top of his wrist at metal objects  causing them to dissolve  Peter can apparently carry a large number of these new Anti Metal spiders on his person without them causing harm to his own suit or webshooters  The suit appears as one of Spider Man s alternate costumes in the game Marvel vs  Capcom 3  Fate of Two Worlds created by Capcom  Having been loaned to Kaine for the fight against the Queen  the suit proved instrumental  as it allowed Kaine immunity against the Queen s sonic based attacks  The stealth suit is currently in Kaine s possession due to Madame Web advising him to hold onto it   edit  New Spider Armor Having lost his spider sense in Amazing Spider Man  654  Peter is shot while in the process of dodging automatic gunfire from the villain Massacre  Realising his new vulnerability  Peter pulls out a new black suit with the spider emblem in yellow  which he had been keeping in storage at Horizon Labs  The suit is designed to be bulletproof up to an unknown degree  but not impeding Spider Man s agility  It has been observed to prevent assault rifle and multiple sniper rifle fires from penetrating the armor  It comes equipped with magnetic webbing which can block all radio frequencies  such as remote control explosives  93  Apparently the suit is made of a lightweight  impact resistant polymer in which he applies to a motorcycle crash helmet at Horizon Labs  The new helmet is cheap  easy to mass produce  and has ten times the strength of a normal helmet   edit  Future Foundation Upon joining the Future Foundation as part of Johnny Storm s last request in his will  Spider Man is given a new white costume made from third generation unstable molecules which has several default color schemes which can be changed by mental control  This suits never gets dirty and allows him to change this costume to his classic red and blue or in civilian clothes  although in other Marvel titles  such as  The Avengers  or  The New Avengers   he uses always the white and black scheme  Because of this  now Peter uses this costume regularly  being the first change of regular suit since the Black Costume   edit  References   a b c Spider Man Tech   Process used to create
