religious names including Eretz Israel   the Land of Israel    Zion  and Judea  were considered and rejected  27  In the early weeks of independence  the government chose the term  Israeli  to denote a citizen of Israel  with the formal announcement made by Minister of Foreign Affairs Moshe Sharett  28  The name Israel has historically been used  in common and religious usage  to refer to the biblical Kingdom of Israel or the entire Jewish nation  29  According to the Hebrew Bible the name  Israel  was given to the patriarch Jacob  Standard Yisra el  Isr   l  Septuagint Greek           struggle with God  30   after he successfully wrestled with the angel of the Lord  31  Jacob s twelve sons became the ancestors of the Israelites  also known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel or Children of Israel  Jacob and his sons had lived in Canaan but were forced by famine to go into Egypt for four generations until Moses  a great great grandson of Jacob  32  led the Israelites back into Canaan in the  Exodus   The earliest archaeological artifact to mention the word  Israel  is the Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt  dated to the late 13th century BCE   33  The area is also known as the Holy Land  being holy for all Abrahamic religions including Judaism  Christianity  Islam and the Bah    Faith  Prior to the 1948 Israeli Declaration of Independence  the whole region was known by various other names including Southern Syria  Syria Palestina  Kingdom of Jerusalem  Iudaea Province  Coele Syria  Retjenu  Canaan and  particularly  Palestine  History Main article  History of Israel Antiquity Further information  History of ancient Israel and Judah  History of Israel  and History of Palestine Masada  a national symbol The notion of the  Land of Israel   known in Hebrew as Eretz Yisrael  or Eretz Yisroel   has been important and sacred to the Jewish people since Biblical times  According to the Torah  God promised the land to the three Patriarchs of the Jewish people  34  35  On the basis of scripture  the period of the three Patriarchs has been placed somewhere in the early 2nd millennium BCE  36  and the first Kingdom of Israel was established around the 11th century BCE  Subsequent Israelite kingdoms and states ruled intermittently over the next four hundred years  and are known from various extra biblical sources  37  38  39  40  Between the fall of the northern Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE and the Muslim conquests of the 7th century CE  a period of over 1500 years   the region came under Assyrian  Babylonian  Persian  Greek  Roman  Sassanid  and Byzantine rule  41  42  Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled after the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire in 132 CE  43  Nevertheless  there was a continuous small Jewish presence and Galilee became its religious center  44  45  The Mishnah and part of the Talmud  central Jewish texts  were composed during the 2nd to 4th centuries CE in Tiberias and Jerusalem  46  In 635 CE  the region  including Jerusalem  was conquered by the Arabs and was to remain under Muslim control for the next 1300 years  47  Control of the region transferred between the Umayyads  47 Abbasids  47  and Crusaders throughout the next six centuries  47  before being conquered by the Mamluk Sultanate  in 1260  48  In 1516  the region was conquered by the Ottoman Empire  and remained under Turkish rule until the 20th century  48  Zionism and the British mandate Further information  History of Zionism Aliyah to Israel Pre Zionist Aliyah The Return to ZionOld Yishuv Before 14 May

of Israel   49  though the amount of effort that should be spent towards such an aim was a matter of dispute  50  51  The hopes and yearnings of Jews living in exile were articulated in the Hebrew Bible  52  and is an important theme of the Jewish belief system  50  After the Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492  some communities settled in Palestine  53  During the 16th century  Jewish communities struck roots in the Four Holy Cities Jerusalem  Tiberias  Hebron  and Safed and in 1697  Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid led a group of 1 500 Jews to Jerusalem  54  In the second half of the 18th century  Eastern European opponents of Hasidism  known as the Perushim  settled in Palestine  55  56  57  The first wave of modern Jewish migration to Ottoman ruled Palestine  known as the First Aliyah  began in 1881  as Jews fled pogroms in Eastern Europe  58  Although the Zionist movement already existed in practice  Austro Hungarian journalist Theodor Herzl is credited with founding political Zionism  59  a movement which sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel  by elevating the Jewish Question to the international plane  60  In 1896  Herzl published Der Judenstaat  The State of the Jews   offering his vision of a future Jewish state  the following year he presided over the first World Zionist Congress  61  The Second Aliyah  1904 14   began after the Kishinev pogrom  some 40 000 Jews settled in Palestine  although nearly half of them later left  58  Both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly Orthodox Jews  62  although the Second Aliyah included socialist groups who established the kibbutz movement  63  During World War I  British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour sent a letter that stated  64  His Majesty s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people  and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object  it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non Jewish communities in Palestine  or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country   65  The Jewish Legion  a group primarily of Zionist volunteers  assisted in the British conquest of Palestine in 1917  Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led to the 1920 Palestine riots and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the Haganah  meaning  The Defense  in Hebrew   from which the Irgun and Lehi  or Stern Gang  paramilitary groups later split off  66  In 1922  the League of Nations granted Britain a mandate over Palestine under terms similar to the Balfour Declaration  67  The population of the area at this time was predominantly Arab and Muslim  with Jews accounting for about 11  of the population  68  The Third  1919 1923  and Fourth Aliyahs  1924 1929  brought an additional 100 000 Jews to Palestine  58  Finally  the rise of Nazism and the increasing persecution of Jews in the 1930s led to the Fifth Aliyah  with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews  This was a major cause of the Arab revolt of 1936 1939 and led the British to introduce restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine with the White Paper of 1939  With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust  a clandestine movement known as Aliyah Bet was organized to bring Jews to Palestine  58  By the end of World War II  the Jewish population of Palestine had increased to 33  of the total population  69  Independence and first years Further

Independence Hall Wikisource has original text related to this article  Israel After World War II  Britain found itself in fierce conflict with the Jewish community  as the Haganah joined Irgun and Lehi in an armed struggle against British rule  70  At the same time  thousands of Jewish Holocaust survivors and refugees from Europe sought a new life in Palestine  but were turned away or rounded up and placed in detention camps by the British  In 1947  the British government announced it would withdraw from the Mandate of Palestine  stating it was unable to arrive at a solution acceptable to both Arabs and Jews  71 A plan was proposed to replace the British Mandate with  Independent Arab and Jewish States  and a  Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem  administered by the United Nations  On 29 November 1947 the General Assembly adopted a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union as Resolution 181  II   72  The Jewish community accepted the plan  73  but the Arab League and Arab Higher Committee of Palestine rejected it  74  On 1 December 1947  the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a three day strike  and Arab bands began attacking Jewish targets  75  The Jews were initially on the defensive as civil war broke out  but gradually moved onto the offensive  76  The Palestinian Arab economy collapsed and 250 000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled  77  On 14 May 1948  the day before the expiration of the British Mandate  David Ben Gurion  the head of the Jewish Agency declared  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A JEWISH STATE IN ERETZ ISRAEL  TO BE KNOWN AS THE STATE OF ISRAEL  78  79  The only reference in the text of the Declaration to the borders of the new state is the use of the term  Eretz Israel  The following day  the armies of four Arab countries  Egypt  Syria  Lebanon and Iraq   attacked Israel  launching the 1948 Arab Israeli War  80  81  Saudi Arabia sent a military contingent to operate under Egyptian command  Yemen declared war but did not take military action  82  After a year of fighting  a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders  known as the Green Line  were established  83 Jordan annexed what became known as the West Bank and East Jerusalem  and Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip  The United Nations estimated that more than 700 000 Palestinians were expelled or fled from what would become Israel during the conflict  84  Israel was accepted as a member of the United Nations by majority vote on 11 May 1949  85  In the early years of the state  the Labor Zionist movement led by Prime Minister David Ben Gurion dominated Israeli politics  86  87  These years were marked by an influx of Holocaust survivors and Jews from Arab lands  many of whom faced persecution in and expulsion from their original countries  88  Consequently  the population of Israel rose from 800 000 to two million between 1948 and 1958  89  Between 1948 1970  approximately 1 151 029 Jewish refugees relocated to Israel  90  Some arrived as refugees with no possessions and were housed in temporary camps known as ma abarot  by 1952  over 200 000 immigrants were living in these tent cities  91  The need to solve the crisis led Ben Gurion to sign a reparations agreement with West Germany that triggered mass protests by Jews angered at the idea that Israel could accept monetary compensation for the Holocaust  92  In the 1950s  Israel was frequently attacked by Palestinian fedayeen  mainly from the Egyptian occupied Gaza Strip  93  In 1950 Egypt closed the Suez Canal to Israeli shipping and tensions mounted as armed clashes took place along Israel s borders  In 1956  Israel joined a secret alliance with Great Britain and France aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal  which the Egyptians had nationalized  see the Suez Crisis   Israel overran the Sinai Peninsula but was pressured to withdraw by the United Nations in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights in the Red Sea and the Canal  94  95  In the early 1960s  Israel captured Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and brought him to Israel for trial  96  The trial had a major impact on public awareness of the Holocaust  97  Eichmann remains the only person ever to be executed by an Israeli court  98  Conflicts and peace treaties Further information  Arab Israeli conflict  Israeli

Israel  and called for its destruction  11  99  By 1966  Israeli Arab relations had deteriorated to the point of actual battles taking place between Israeli and Arab forces  100  In 1967  Egypt expelled UN peacekeepers  stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since 1957  and announced a partial blockade of Israel s access to the Red Sea  In May 1967 a number of Arab states began to mobilize their forces  101  Israel saw these actions as a casus belli  On 5 June 1967  Israel launched a pre emptive strike against Egypt  Jordan  Syria and Iraq  In a Six Day War  Israeli military superiority was clearly demonstrated against their more numerous Arab foes  Israel succeeded in capturing the West Bank  the Gaza Strip  Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights  102  Jerusalem s boundaries were enlarged  incorporating East Jerusalem  and the 1949 Green Line became the administrative boundary between Israel and the occupied territories  In the Six Day War of 1967  Israel defeated the combined armies of Egypt  Jordan and Syria  Following the war  Israel faced much internal resistance from the Arab Palestinians  Most important among the various Palestinian and Arab groups was the Palestinian Liberation Organization  PLO   established in 1964  which initially committed itself to  armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland   103  104  In the late 1960s and early 1970s  Palestinian groups launched a wave of attacks 105  106  against Israel and Jewish targets around the world  107  including a massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich  On 6 October 1973  as Jews were observing Yom Kippur  the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched a surprise attack against Israel  The war ended on 26 October with Israel successfully repelling Egyptian and Syrian forces but suffering significant losses  108  An internal inquiry exonerated the government of responsibility for failures before and during the war  but public anger forced Prime Minister Golda Meir to resign  109  In July 1976 Israeli commandos carried out a daring mission which succeeded in rescuing 95 hostages who were being held by PLO guerillas at Entebbe International Airport close to Kampala  Uganda  The 1977 Knesset elections marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as Menachem Begin s Likud party took control from the Labor Party  110  Later that year  Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat made a trip to Israel and spoke before the Knesset in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state  111  In the two years that followed  Sadat and Menachem Begin signed the Camp David Accords  1978  and the Israel Egypt Peace Treaty  1979   112  Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over an autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  113  On 11 March 1978  a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the Coastal Road Massacre  in which 35 Israeli civilians were killed and 75 injured  Israel responded by launching an invasion of southern Lebanon to destroy the PLO bases south of the Litani River  Most PLO fighters withdrew  but Israel was able to secure southern Lebanon until a UN force and the Lebanese army could take over  However  the PLO soon resumed its policy of resistance to Israel  In the next few years the PLO infiltrated back south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border  Israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground  Meanwhile  Begin s government actively encouraged Israelis to settle in the occupied West Bank  leading to increasing friction with the Palestinians in that area  114  The Basic Law  Jerusalem  the Capital of Israel  passed in 1980  was believed by some to reaffirm Israel s 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree and reignited international controversy over the status of the city  However  there has never been an Israeli government act which defined what it considers to be the extent of the territory of Israel and no act which specifically included East Jerusalem therein  115  The position of the majority of UN member states is reflected in numerous resolutions declaring that actions taken by Israel to settle its citizens in the West Bank  and impose its laws and administration on East Jerusalem are illegal and have no validity  116  On 7 June 1981  the Israeli air force destroyed Iraq s sole nuclear power plant  which was under construction just outside Baghdad  Following a series of PLO attacks in 1982  Israel invaded Lebanon once again to destroy the bases from which the PLO launched attacks and missiles into northern Israel First Lebanon War  117  In the first six days of fighting  the Israelis destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians  An Israeli government inquiry   the Kahan Commission   would later hold Begin  Sharon and several Israeli generals as indirectly responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacres  In 1985 Israel responded to a PLO terrorist attack in Cyprus by bombing the PLO headquarters in Tunis  Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon in 1986  but maintained a borderland buffer zone in southern Lebanon until 2000  The First Intifada  a Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule  118  broke out in 1987 with waves of uncoordinated demonstrations and violence occurring in the occupied West Bank and Gaza  Over the following six years  the Intifada became more organised and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the Israeli occupation  More than a thousand people were killed in the violence  many of them stone throwing youths  119  Responding to continuing PLO guerilla raids into northern Israel  Israel launched another punitive raid into southern Lebanon in 1988  Amid rising tensions over the Kuwait crisis  Israeli border guards fired into a rioting Palestinian crowd near the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem  20 people were killed and some 150 injured  During the 1991 Gulf War  the PLO supported Saddam Hussein and Iraqi Scud missile attacks against Israel  Despite public outrage  Israel heeded US calls to refrain from hitting back and did not participate in that war  120  121  Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat shake hands at the signing of the Oslo Accords  with Bill Clinton behind them  1993 In 1992  Yitzhak Rabin became Prime Minister following an election in which his party called for compromise with Israel s neighbors  122  123  The following year  Shimon Peres on behalf of Israel  and Mahmoud Abbas for the PLO  signed the Oslo Accords  which gave the Palestinian National Authority the right to govern parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  124  The PLO also recognized Israel s right to exist and pledged an end to terrorism  125  In 1994  the Israel Jordan Treaty of Peace was signed  making Jordan the second Arab country to normalize relations with Israel  126  Arab public support for the Accords was damaged by the continuation of Israeli settlements 127  and checkpoints  and the deterioration of economic conditions  128  Israeli public support for the Accords waned as Israel was struck by Palestinian suicide attacks  129  Finally  while leaving a peace rally in November 1995  Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a far right wing Jew who opposed the Accords  130  At the end of the 1990s  Israel  under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu  withdrew from Hebron  131  and signed the Wye River Memorandum  giving greater control to the Palestinian National Authority  132 Ehud Barak  elected Prime Minister in 1999  began the new millennium by withdrawing forces from Southern Lebanon and conducting negotiations with Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and U S  President Bill Clinton at the 2000 Camp David Summit  During the summit  Barak offered a plan for the establishment of a Palestinian state  but Yasser Arafat rejected it  133  After the collapse of the talks and a controversial visit by Likud leader Ariel Sharon to the Temple Mount  the Second Intifada began  Sharon became prime minister in a 2001 special election  During his tenure  Sharon carried out his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the Gaza Strip and also spearheaded the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier  134  In July 2006  a Hezbollah artillery assault on Israel s northern border communities and a cross border abduction of two Israeli soldiers precipitated the month long Second Lebanon War  135  136  Two years later  in May 2008  Israel confirmed it had been discussing a peace treaty with Syria for a year  with Turkey as a go between  137  However  at the end of the year  Israel entered another conflict as a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel collapsed  The Gaza War lasted three weeks and ended after Israel announced a unilateral ceasefire  138  139  Hamas announced its own ceasefire  with its own conditions of complete withdrawal and opening of border crossings  Despite neither the rocket launchings nor Israeli retaliatory strikes having completely stopped  the fragile ceasefire remained in order  140  Geography and climate Main articles  Geography of Israel and Wildlife of Israel The Sea of Galilee and Tiberias  Forest around Ein Kerem  a village within Jerusalem s municipal boundaries Israel is at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea  bounded by Lebanon to the north  Syria to the northeast  Jordan to the east  and Egypt to the southwest  It lies between latitudes 29  and 34  N  and longitudes 34  and 36  E  The sovereign territory of Israel  excluding all territories captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War  is approximately 20 770 square kilometers  8 019 sq mi  in area  of which two percent is water  1  However Israel is so narrow that the exclusive economic zone in the Mediterranean is double the land area of the country  141  The total area under Israeli law  when including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights  is 22 072 square kilometers  8 522 sq mi   142  and the total area under Israeli control  including the military controlled and partially Palestinian governed territory of the West Bank  is 27 799 square kilometers  10 733 sq mi   143  Despite its small size  Israel is home to a variety of geographic features  from the Negev desert in the south to the mountain ranges of the Galilee  Carmel and toward the Golan in the north  The Israeli Coastal Plain on the shores of the Mediterranean is home to seventy percent of the nation s population  East of the central highlands lies the Jordan Rift Valley  which forms a small part of the 6 500 kilometer  4 039 mi  Great Rift Valley  Ramon Crater  a unique type of crater that can be found only in Israel and the Sinai peninsula The Jordan River runs along the Jordan Rift Valley  from Mount Hermon through the Hulah Valley and the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea  the lowest point on the surface of the Earth  144  Further south is the Arabah  ending with the Gulf of Eilat  part of the Red Sea  Unique to Israel and the Sinai Peninsula are makhteshim  or erosion cirques  145  The largest makhtesh in the world is Ramon Crater in the Negev  146  which measures 40 by 8 kilometers  25 by 5 mi   147  A report on the environmental status of the Mediterranean basin states that Israel has the largest number of plant species per square meter of all the countries in the basin  148  Temperatures in Israel vary widely  especially during the winter  The more mountainous regions can be windy  cold  and sometimes snowy  Jerusalem usually receives at least one snowfall each year  149  Meanwhile  coastal cities  such as Tel Aviv and Haifa  have a typical Mediterranean climate with cool  rainy winters and long  hot summers  The area of Beersheba and the Northern Negev has a semi arid climate with hot summers  and cool winter but with fewer rainy than the Mediterranean climate  The Southern Negev and the Arava areas have desert climate with very hot and dry summers  and mild winters with few days of rain  The highest temperature in the continent of Asia  53 7  C 128 7  F  was recorded in 1942 at Tirat Zvi kibbutz in the northern Jordan river valley  150  From May to September  rain in Israel is rare  151  152  With scarce water resources  Israel has developed various water saving technologies  including drip irrigation  153  Israelis also take advantage of the considerable sunlight available for solar energy  making Israel the leading nation in solar energy use per capita  practically every house uses solar panels for water heating   154  Four different phytogeographic regions exist in Israel  due to the country s location between the temperate and the tropical zones  bordering the Mediterranean Sea in the west and the desert in the east  For this reason the flora and fauna of Israel is extremely diverse  There are 2 867 known species of plants found in Israel  Of these  at least 253 species are introduced and non native  155  As of May 2007

consisting of Israeli citizens were established within each of them  Israel applied civilian law to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem  incorporating them into its sovereign territory and granting their inhabitants permanent residency status and the choice to apply for citizenship  In contrast  the West Bank has remained under military occupation  and Palestinians in this area cannot become citizens  The Gaza Strip is independent of Israel with no Israeli military or civilian presence  but Israel continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters  The Gaza Strip and the West Bank are seen by the Palestinians and most of the international community as the site of a future Palestinian state  174  175  The UN Security Council has declared the annexation of the Golan Heights and

The status of East Jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult hurdle in negotiations between Israeli governments and representatives of the Palestinians  as Israel views it as its sovereign territory  as well as part of its capital  Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242  which emphasises

occupied by Egypt from 1948 to 1967 and then by Israel after 1967  In 2005  as part of Israel s unilateral disengagement plan  Israel removed all of its settlers and forces from the territory  Israel does not consider the Gaza Strip to be occupied territory and declared it a  foreign territory   That view has been disputed by numerous international humanitarian organizations and various bodies of the United Nations  186  187  188  189  190  Following June 2007  when Hamas assumed power in the Gaza Strip  191  Israel tightened its control of the Gaza crossings along its border  as well as by
