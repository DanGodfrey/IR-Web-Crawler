Religious welfare groups  such as the Catholic League  have spoken out against the release of material which they and others found offensive  including vehement protests of the Miramax Films features Priest  1994  and Dogma  1999   1  Disney pushed back the release date for Dogma due to the controversy surrounding the movie  and eventually sold the distribution rights to Lions Gate Films  The ABC show Nothing Sacred  about a Jesuit priest  a book called Growing Up Gay  published by Disney owned Hyperion Press   the  unofficial  annual Gay and Lesbian Days at Disney theme parks  and similar issues spurred boycotts of Disney and its advertisers by the Catholic League  the Assemblies of God  and other conservative groups  1  2  3  The Southern Baptist Convention  SBC  and the American Family Association voted to boycott Disney over opposition to the Disney offering domestic partnership benefits to gay employees and over opposition to the ABC show Ellen  in which Ellen DeGeneres  character came out as a lesbian  Both boycotts were withdrawn in 2005  4  5  The company has been accused of human rights violations regarding the working conditions in factories that produce their merchandise  6  7  It has been criticized also by animal welfare groups  for their care of and procedures for wild animals at Disney s Animal Kingdom theme park  8  and for using purebred dogs in movies such as 101 Dalmatians  Animal rights groups claim movies with purebreds create an artificial demand for purebreds from people who may not be prepared or temperamentally suited for the animals  many of whom end up abandoned or surrendered to animal shelters or rescue groups  9  An environmental management plan for a zone of Great Guana Cay  in the Abaco Islands  criticized Disney for poor management of a 90 acre  36 4 ha  tract of the island  Disney partially developed but then abandoned the place  which was to have been a cruise ship resort called Treasure Island  The report  by the University of Miami and the College of the Bahamas  blames Disney for leaving hazardous materials  electrical transformers  and fuel tanks  and also for introducing invasive alien plants and insects that threaten the natural flora and fauna of the island  10   edit  Subliminal messages There are several conspiracy theories about Disney having sexual innuendo or references hidden in some of their animated movies  including The Lion King  The Little Mermaid  Aladdin  Who Framed Roger Rabbit  and Disney s original home video releases of The Rescuers  In 1995  a pro life lobby group  American Life League  ALL   alleged that several Disney films  including The Lion King  The Little Mermaid  and Aladdin contained subliminal messages and sexual imagery  11  12  The Lion King allegation was later denied by Tom Sito  a Disney animator and a writer for the film  who claimed that the letters written in the dust cloud actually spelled the initials  S F X   meaning  special effects   instead  it was interpreted by people who saw the dust message as the word  SEX   It was intended to be an easter egg signature from the animation department  and that the controversy that followed was entirely unintentional  13  In Aladdin  protests were raised regarding the scene when Aladdin is attacked by the tiger Rajah on the palace balcony  Aladdin quietly says  Come on    good kitty  take off and go     and the word  kitty  is overlapped by another  unidentifiable sound  most probably Rajah s snarl  Some people reported hearing  Good teenagers  take off your clothes   14  which they considered a subliminal reference to sexual promiscuity  Because of the controversy  Disney replaced the phrase with  Down  kitty  on the DVD release  15  In Who Framed Roger Rabbit a scene drew attention to viewers when Jessica Rabbit revealed what was under her dress in which nothing was drawn  This scene wasn t noticed until 1994 during the film s laserdisc release  This discovery caught the attention of major news media  16  In The Little Mermaid  King Triton lives in a castle of gold  along with his daughters  The castle is displayed in the artwork for the cover for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on home video in 1990  Close examination of the cover artwork  as well as the poster for the film  shows an oddly shaped structure on the castle  closely resembling a penis  Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident  resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork  The questionable object does not appear on the cover of the second releasing of the movie  There was also a widespread rumour in the early to mid 1990s that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a wedding scene  specifically the scene in which a brainwashed Prince Eric is about to marry Ursula the sea witch in disguise  17  18  19  The clergyman is a short man  dressed in Bishop s clothing  and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby legged man s knees  but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish  Because of the controversy  this scene was later altered in the film s 2006 Platinum Edition DVD release so that the clergyman is standing on a small platform box and that his knee is no longer visible underneath his robes  The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995  though she dropped the suit two months later  18  19  20  21  22  Main article  The Rescuers Controversy Disney s original home video releases of The Rescuers were recalled on January 8  1999 due to the discovery of two photographs of a topless woman in the background of two frames of the movie  23  The offending images were

surprising and unprecedented 43  of Disney s shareholders  predominantly rallied by former board members Roy Disney and Stanley Gold  withheld their proxies to re elect Eisner to the board  Disney s board then gave the chairmanship position to Mitchell  However  the board did not immediately remove Eisner as chief executive  On March 13  2005  Eisner announced that he would step down as CEO one year before his contract expired  On September 30  Eisner resigned both as an executive and as a member of the board of directors  and  severing all formal ties with the company  he waived his contractual rights to perks such as the use of a corporate jet and an office at the company s Burbank headquarters  Eisner s replacement was his longtime assistant  Robert Iger   edit  DisneyWar

  I just felt creatively the company was not going anywhere interesting  It was very stifling   But he retained a seat on the board of directors  His resignation from the board in 1984  which occurred in the midst of a corporate takeover battle  was the beginning of a series of developments that led to the replacement of company president and CEO Ronald William Miller  married to Walt s daughter Diane Marie Disney  by Michael Eisner and Frank Wells  Roy soon returned to the company as vice chairman of the board of directors and head of the animation department   edit  Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group  edit  Miramax Films Miramax has come under criticism for its editing  dubbing  and replacing the soundtracks of various foreign films it releases  One notable example is Iron Monkey  which though released subtitled  had its subtitles altered to remove the political context of the story  had scenes trimmed and changed for violence and pacing  and had the soundtrack changed  removing the famous Wong Fei Hung theme  Other films that they have altered in this way include Shaolin Soccer  Farewell My Concubine  theatrical release   The Thief and the Cobbler and Jet Li s Fist of Legend  Peter Biskind s book Down and Dirty Pictures details many of Weinstein s dishonest dealings with filmmakers  Under the Weinsteins  Miramax had a history of buying the rights to Asian films  only to sit on them without releasing them for some years  One example of this is Hero  a 2002 Chinese martial arts film  It languished in Miramax s vaults for two years before it was salvaged with the intervention of Quentin Tarantino  And sometimes Miramax purchased films only to never release them  An example of this is Tears of the Black Tiger  a Thai film  After changing the ending of the film  Tears of the Black Tiger sat in Miramax s vaults for five years until its rights were purchased by Magnolia Pictures in 2006  The  no cuts  policy was highlighted when Miramax co chairman Harvey Weinstein suggested editing the Japanese anime film Princess Mononoke to make it more marketable  In response  a Studio Ghibli producer sent an authentic katana with a simple message   No cuts   One reason for the delays and non releases of films was an accounting scheme the Weinsteins used to shift potential money losing films to future fiscal years and ensure they would receive annual bonuses from Disney  24  while trying to bar retailers from legally exporting authentic DVDs of the films  25  As a result of the Weinsteins  actions  a number of Asian producers who sold their distribution rights to the company refuse to do so for their subsequent films  citation needed  Defenders of the company point out that prior to Miramax most of the films purchased by the company would have had little to no chance of achieving U S  distribution other than by very small distributors with minimal marketing expertise and funds  They also state that the purpose of the company s aggressive re editing technique was always to try help the films find a broader American audience than they might otherwise find   I m not cutting for fun   Harvey Weinstein said in an interview   I m cutting for the shit to work  All my life I served one master  the film  I love movies    26  Miramax is also accused of ignoring their more artistic  less audience friendly films  especially when directors refuse to re cut them to make them less challenging  Dead Man  which director Jim Jarmusch refused to re cut  got a very limited release and critics have accused the Weinsteins of burying the film  Tarantino  among other directors working with Miramax  have happily re cut their films to the Weinsteins  liking   27  28  Miramax was parodied in the Kevin Smith film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back  2001   in which the studio attempted to adapt Jay and Silent Bob s comic book characters  Bluntman and Chronic  into a movie  thus resulting in the duo traveling to Hollywood to stop them from making the movie  According to Kevin Smith  this film is a direct response to the controversy surrounding his previous film  Dogma   edit  Pixar Pixar and Disney had disagreements after the production of Toy Story 2  Originally intended as a straight to video release  and thus not part of Pixar s three picture deal   the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production  Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three picture agreement  but Disney refused  29  Pixar s first five feature films have collectively grossed more than  2 5 billion  equivalent to the highest per film average gross in the industry  Though profitable for both  Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable  Pixar was responsible for creation and production  while Disney handled marketing and distribution  Profits and production costs were split 50 50  but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a distribution fee  The lack of story and sequel rights was perhaps the most onerous aspect to Pixar and set the stage for a contentious relationship  30  The two companies attempted to reach a new agreement in early 2004  The new deal would be only for distribution  as Pixar intended to control production and own the resulting film properties themselves  The company also wanted to finance their films on their own and collect 100 percent of the profits  paying Disney only the 10 to 15 percent distribution fee  31  More importantly  as part of any distribution agreement with Disney  Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their old agreement  including The Incredibles and Cars  Disney considered these conditions unacceptable  but Pixar would not concede  31  Disagreements between Steve Jobs and then Disney Chairman and CEO Michael Eisner made the negotiations more difficult than they otherwise might have been  They broke down completely in mid 2004  with Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney  32  Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors  After a lengthy hiatus  negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005  In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney  Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney dictated November time frame  but during the more lucrative early summer months  This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major releases during the Christmas shopping season  An added benefit of delaying Cars was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar Disney contract to see how things would play out between the two companies  33  Pending the Disney acquisition of Pixar in 2006  the two companies created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille  in case the acquisition fell through  to ensure that this one film would still be released through Disney s distribution channels   In contrast to the earlier Disney Pixar deal Ratatouille was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee   The completion of Disney s Pixar acquisition  however  nullified this distribution arrangement  34   edit  ABC Network On February 9  1996  The Walt Disney Company acquired Capital Cities ABC  and renamed the broadcasting group ABC  Inc   although the network also continues to use American Broadcasting Companies  such as on TV productions it owns  ABC s relationship with Disney dates back to 1953  when Leonard Goldenson pledged enough money so that the  Disneyland  theme park could be completed  ABC continued to hold Disney notes and stock until 1960  and also had first call on the  Disneyland  television series in 1954  With this new relationship came an attempt at cross promotion  with attractions based on ABC shows at Disney parks and an annual soap festival at Walt Disney World   The former president of ABC  Inc   Robert Iger  now heads Disney   In 1997  ABC aired a Saturday morning block called One Saturday Morning which changed to ABC Kids in 2002  It featured a 5 hour line up of children s shows  mostly cartoons  for children ages 5 12  but it was changed to a 4 hour line up in 2005  Since then  it was aimed for children more in the 10 16 range  Despite intense micro managing on the part of Disney management  the flagship television network was slow to turn around  In 1999  the network was able to experience a brief bolster in ratings with the hit game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire  A new national phenomenon  Survivor  on CBS persuaded the schedulers at ABC to change Millionaire s slot over to the Wednesday Time slot at 8 00 to kill Survivor before it got a ratings hold  The first results were promising for CBS  they lost by only a few ratings points  ABC tried to keep the strength running  so they tried an unprecedented strategy for Millionaire by airing the show four times a week during the next Fall season  in the process overexposing the show  as it appeared on the network sometimes five or six nights during a week  ABC s ratings fell dramatically as competitors introduced their own game shows and the public grew tired of the format  Alex Wallau took over as president in 2000  Despite the repeated overexposure of Millionaire and its switch to syndication  ABC continued to find some success in dramas such as The Practice  which gave birth to a successful spinoff  Boston Legal  in 2004   Alias  and Once and Again  ABC also had some moderately successful comedies including The Drew Carey Show  Spin City  Dharma  amp  Greg  According to Jim  My Wife and Kids and The George Lopez Show  Still one asset that ABC lacked in the early 2000s that most other networks had was popularity in reality television  ABC s briefly lived reality shows Are You Hot  and I m a Celebrity    Get Me Out of Here  proved to be an embarrassment for the network  By end of the 2003 2004 television season  ABC slumped to fourth place  becoming the first of the original  Big Three  networks to fall into such ratings   edit  Controversy  edit  ABC Daytime Main article  ABC Daytime When Megan McTavish returned as Head Writer of All My Children in July 2003  she faced criticism for a story that depicted the rape of a lesbian character  Bianca Montgomery  35  The show also faced opposition to its recent story of a transgender character in 2006  ABC Daytime scrapped a storyline on One Life to Live which was to depict a school shooting rampage the day the Virginia Tech massacre occurred on April 17  2007  36  The Writers Guild of America East filed arbitration suits against ABC Daytime  claiming that they violated the strike termination agreement by retaining replacement writers  those who choose Financial Core Status  who filled in during the strike on All My Children instead of bringing back the writers who had been on strike   The strike termination agreement does not allow the retention of replacement writers in lieu of allowing striking writers to return to their jobs   ABC Daytime  are clearly violating this agreement   said Ira Cure  senior counsel for the WGA East  in a statement   They have left us no other option but to file arbitrations to ensure that our members will be afforded their rights outlined under this agreement   Broadcasting  amp  Cable  Arbitration Suit Against ABC D In December 2008  Soap Opera Weekly Soap Opera Digest critic Marlena De Lacroix called ABC Daytime a  chauvinistic hellhole    2  In August 2009  Frons announced that the production of All My Children would move from New York City to Los Angeles by the end of the year  37  38   edit  ABC News Main article  ABC News On April 30  2004  Nightline host Ted Koppel read the names of the members of the United States Armed Forces who were killed in Iraq  This prompted controversy from conservatives who believed Koppel was making a political statement and from Sinclair Broadcasting Group  which felt that ABC was undermining the war effort in Iraq  Others  most notably the Washington Post television columnist  thought it was a ratings stunt for sweeps  and indeed Nightline was the highest rated program during that time period  and had about 30  more viewers than other Nightline programs that week  Sinclair stations did not air the program  Koppel repeated the format on May 28  2004  reading the names of service members killed in Afghanistan  and on May 30  2005  reading the names of all service members killed in Afghanistan or Iraq between the last program and the preparation of the program  This time  Sinclair stations aired the program as scheduled  In the wake of the job cuts  a significant controversy erupted online in May 2010 after it was announced the former VP of news coverage  Mimi Gurbst  was leaving the network to become a guidance counselor  39  A story in the New York Observer reported that Gurbst was a  cherished  mentor inside the news division  40  Reporters who closely follow TV news observed that a large number of current and former ABC News staffers went online to vigorously respond that Gurbst had helped perpetuate a negative culture with ABC News  41  42   edit  Dangerous Minds Main article  Dangerous Minds  TV series  Producers Andrew Schneider and Diane Frolov made a character based on real life former U S  Marine  teacher and author LouAnne Johnson do things that she herself thinks are unethical  inadvisable and silly  In one episode  the character LouAnne Johnson took her students to a strip club to organize a fundraiser for their school by participating in a hair war  The producers thought that this would make her cute and endearing  ignoring the fact that they wrote LouAnne into taking her underage students to a strip club  In another episode a black character threatens to shoot her teacher because LouAnne encourages his girlfriend to go to college  This never happened outside of the show and the real LouAnne Johnson knew that depicting African American males as violent was wrong and unrealistic  43   edit  The Path to 9 11 Wikinews has related news  ABC comes under fire for alleged partisan slant in 9 11 miniseries ABC aired the controversial two part miniseries The Path to 9 11 in the US on September 10  2006  at 8 p m  EDT and September 11  2006  at 8 p m  EDT  The extensive pre broadcast controversy over the film has included disputes over the accuracy of its dramatization of key events  as well as calls by historians and from former Clinton and Bush administration officials for ABC to re edit part of the film or not broadcast it at all  According to the official statement released by ABC on September 7  2006  the film is  a dramatization  not a documentary  drawn from a variety of sources  including The 9 11 Commission Report  other published materials  and from personal interviews  44    The main source of the controversy stems from portions of the film concerned with the Clinton administration in the 1990s  Critics say that certain dramatized scenes tend to suggest that blame for the events that took place on September 11  2001 lies with Clinton and his cabinet  One example cited is a scene in which then National Security Advisor  Sandy Berger  does not approve of the order to take out a surrounded Osama bin Laden and tells the squad in Afghanistan that they will have to do the job without official authorization and then hangs up the phone  According to Sandy Berger and others   including conservative author and Clinton critic Richard Miniter   this never happened  45 Screenwriter Cyrus Nowrasteh has now admitted that the abrupt hang up was not in the script and was improvised  46  American Airlines reportedly threatened to pull its advertising from ABC after this program aired  The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America named ABC its third annual  Misinformer of the Year  award in 2006  not only for the miniseries  but for the alleged conservative pandering of ABC News director Mark Halperin and for biased claims on news programs such as ABC World News and Good Morning America   edit  Alexis Debat Alexis Debat  a consultant for ABC for years and also a writer for The National Interest  resigned from ABC in June 2007 after the broadcasting company discovered that he did not have a Ph D  from the Sorbonne as he pretended  47  Furthermore  in September 2007  the French news media Rue 89 revealed that he had made at least two bogus interviews  one of Barack Obama and another of Alan Greenspan  both published in the French magazine Politique internationale  48  49  This in turn also led to his resignation from The National Interest  47  Debat had specialized in reports on terrorism and national security for the past six years  writing  for example  on the Jundallah Balochi and Sunni organization   47  50   edit  ABC contract dispute affecting WABC TV and WPVI On March 2  2010  WABC TV in New York along with Philadelphia sister station WPVI  carried in Mercer  Monmouth and Ocean counties  stated that they would pull their programming from Cablevision on March 7  2010  at midnight   unless a new payment structure is implemented for its network programming  Cablevision responded by citing WABC TV and WPVI s free  over the air accessibility  Cablevision spokesman Charles Scheuler stated  It is not fair for ABC Disney to hold Cablevision customers hostage by forcing them to pay what amounts to a new TV tax    51  The removal of both stations occurred on the weekend of the 82nd Academy Awards  which was scheduled to be one of ABC s largest yearly specials  and was projected to cause a devastating blow to advertisers for the Oscars and to Cablevision itself  On Sunday March 7  2010 at 12 01 a m  ET  both WABC and WPVI were removed from Cablevision leaving a black screen in their place  confirming the rumors that if a deal with Cablevision and ABC was not reached by midnight  the network and other Disney owned channels would go off the air  Cablevision began looping a public service announcement on each affected channel and forcing all of its customers  set top boxes to channel 1999  which was looping the same annnouncement  much like was done when Scripps Networks pulled their cable channels  programming  Besides providing certain details of the disagreement they stated that ABC shows could be watched online through TV websites such as Hulu  Also that day  Cablevision announced through e mail that their entire film catalog of on demand movies would be available without charge until midnight that evening as an apology to their customers  52  At 8 50 p m  that day  WABC and WPVI returned to Cablevision s programming  after a notification during the 82nd Academy Awards announced progression in  Work to complete our negotiations   and the return of ABC s programming during the negotiations   edit  Cable TV channels  edit  ABC Family Fox Family Worldwide Inc was sold to Disney for  2 9 billion on October 24  2001  The sale to Disney also included TV channel Fox Kids and Saban Entertainment  renamed BVS Entertainment   The entire network was officially renamed ABC Family on November 10  2001  53  54  55  56  The sale to Disney was considered one of the largest mistakes or problems occurring during the tenure of Michael Eisner  The failure was primarily due to the acquisition being done by the strategic planning department of Disney  without consulting anyone at ABC  The original plan was to use the channel to essentially show re runs of ABC programming  but this plan was completely impossible since ABC had no syndication rights to the majority of their own programs  During this time  the network did air same season repeats of Alias  Less Than Perfect  Life with Bonnie  and The Bachelor  almost all of which were Touchstone Television productions  The Bachelor is distributed by Time Warner s Telepictures   But in trying to change the focus of the channel  Disney also canceled several Fox Family series  like State of Grace  and cut back on the network s TV movies  which were among the few programs Fox Family was doing well with  The ratings tumbled further as the network became dependent on syndicated reruns and no original programs  save for original wrap around segments around Bachelor repeats  and children s programming    57  The next major plan was to reposition the channel to market it to college students  young women  or to a more hip audience under the name XYZ  a reverse reference to ABC  Disney soon found that the channel could never be renamed as such  The original sale from CBN to Fox Saban contained a stipulation that the channel contain the word  Family  in the name forever  no matter who owns the network  To create XYZ  the Family Channel would have had to cease to exist   terminating all existing cable TV contracts   and XYZ would have to be created as a new network  Cable companies would not be obligated to put XYZ in the spot vacated by the Family Channel  ABC scrapped the idea after discovering this clause  58  The name was revisited at one point in 2003  serving as a program block entitled  The XYZ    showing programs and movies aimed at the above groups  The network was also used as a buffer to burn off failed ABC series  such as All American Girl  which featured Spice Girl Geri Haliwell  59  Since 2006  the critics have gone after programming on ABC Family  Most feel the network has gone from family friendly to  too risqu    and shows like Greek and The Secret Life of the American Teenager are far too racy for  family viewers   Critics feel the executives at ABC Family are only after viewership numbers and are unconcerned about showing younger generations in questionable scenarios in series and film  Mostly where the main focus is on teenage pregnancy or underage drinking  60  It should be noted that despite the channel s name including the word  Family   the channel s programming content standards had changed several years earlier after the sale of the channel by International Family Entertainment  and the channel had been airing even some acquired series and movies that contain profanity  violence and sexual content or dialogue after the sale  particularly since being purchased by The Walt Disney Company  ABC Family does air parental advisory tags at the beginning of some TV 14 rated programs  such as That  70s Show and some episodes of The Secret Life of the American Teenager   edit  Disney Channel Disney Channel has come under heavy criticism ever since the network switched its broadcast from premium  more limited cable to more basic  widespread cable  Experts criticize the company for programming that has pulled away from the characters that the network s parent company  The Walt Disney Company was founded upon  Mickey Mouse  Donald Duck and Goofy  Other critics disapprove of the marketing strategy made by Anne Sweeney  the President of ABC Disney Television Group  61  which makes the programs on Disney Channel geared mainly towards pre teen and teenage girls  62  Disney Channel executives hoped to become more  boy friendly  in 2010  especially when Good Luck Charlie premiered and when Aaron Stone and Zeke and Luther joined the main program line up   edit  South Park parody The Jonas Brothers are parodied in South Park episode entitled  The Ring  and play a prominent role in the episode s plot  In a television column written before  The Ring  aired  Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post suggested creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were using the Jonas Brothers in the thirteenth season debut as a means of improving the show s ratings  Comedy Central executives  however  insisted Jonas Brothers fans do not fit into South Park s demographic of males between the ages 18 and 49  63  The Walt Disney Company  the Disney Channel and the Mickey Mouse cartoon character are also prominently featured  and spoofed  in the episode  64  even when Mickey Mouse says callous things or physically assaults people  he follows up most statements with the character s trademark high pitched  Ha ha   laugh  which in context comes off like a nervous tic  65  Reviewers and commentators have described  The Ring  as not just a parody of the Jonas Brothers  but also of the ethos of the Walt Disney Company  64  65  66  The episode portrays Disney as a corporation using the ruse of family friendly morals to disguise their primary motive  which is profit  reviewers and articles said this point is further illustrated by the use of Mickey Mouse  a cartoon symbol for the wholesome Disney image  as a foul mouthed  contemptuous  greedy  all powerful and violent character  64  65  Specifically  the episode targets Disney s marketing tactic of the band members pledging abstinence through purity rings  which the script suggests is used to subliminally sell sex to young girls  while simultaneously appeasing the ethical standards of their parents and taking advantage of their fearful desire to protect their daughters  as Mickey had said  Due to other speculation on the orientation and personal activities of the Jonas brothers  the episode continued to create a running gag on the effect of the Jonas brothers on young girls of the  tween  period  Often provoking the image that they too would become like Mickey Mouse  in most unwanted characteristics  The episode further illustrates the greed of corporate culture by portraying Mickey as capitalizing on religion for profit  while secretly mocking it in a particularly cruel tone   I ve made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now  And do you know why  Because Christians are fucking retarded  They believe in a talking dead guy   64   edit  ESPN Main article  Criticism of ESPN  edit  Walt Disney Parks and Resorts  edit  Al Lutz  Disney reports Beginning in the 1990s  Lutz often complained in his articles about a perceived decline in value and quality at Disney s theme parks  chiefly Disneyland and the neighboring park that opened in 2001  Disney California Adventure Park  67  citation needed  Much of his criticism was directed at Paul Pressler  the one time president of Disneyland who later was named chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts  and Cynthia Harriss  Pressler s successor as Disneyland s president  From 1996 2002  Lutz maintained a set of sarcastic Web pages called Promote Paul Pressler  68  citation needed   whose stated goal was  getting current Disneyland Resort President Paul Pressler promoted to a new job somewhere else within the Walt Disney Company   Lutz s July 2006 report on the alleged antics of Lindsay Lohan during a private party held at Disneyland for her 20th birthday 69  citation needed  drew a rebuke from a representative for the actress  who said reports of bad behavior were  complete bull   70  citation needed  This report brought Lutz  website  MiceAge  briefly into the spotlight  and established Lutz as a Disney watchdog in the mainstream media  In late 2007  mainstream media outlets including the New York Times  the Los Angeles Times  the Associated Press and foreign newspapers referenced claims made in two of Lutz  columns  One was about a planned refurbishment of the  it s a small world  attraction at Disneyland would modify the ride s boat and flume trough to accommodate boats capable of carrying heavier park guests  a claim Disney consistently has denied in subsequent media coverage  71  citation needed   edit  Walt Disney World College Program The Walt Disney World College Program is a U S  national internship program operated by The Walt Disney Company  located at the Walt Disney World Resort  The Walt Disney World College Program recruits students  18 years and older  and all majors for a semester long paid internship program working at the Walt Disney World Resort  Critics argue that Disney is using the program as a source of cheap labor  as interns do the same work as veteran employees  but at a significantly lower pay rate  72  In late 2007  a permanent Cast Member ran for president of the local union in Orlando  Part of his platform intended to get rid of the Disney College program  claiming that the program  imports thousands of low wage earners every year to work for Disney  depressing the local employment market and keeping wages down   Disney responded that the program is beneficial in the recruitment of cast members and that 8 000 workers out of 62 000 do not greatly impact operations  73  It has been criticised also for its lack of Union representation and denial of Insurance benefits by the company   edit  Disneyland Paris In May 1992  entertainment magazine The Hollywood Reporter reported that about 25  of Euro Disney s workforce   approximately 3 000 men and women   had resigned their jobs due to unacceptable working conditions  It also reported that the park s attendance was far behind expectations  Euro Disney S C A   the company that operates Disneyland Paris  responded in an interview with The Wall Street Journal  in which the company s president  Robert Fitzpatrick  claimed only 1 000 people had left their jobs  In response to the financial situation  Fitzpatrick ordered that the Disney MGM Studios Europe project would be put on hiatus until a further decision could be made  Prices at the resort s hotels were also reduced significantly  Despite these efforts  in May 1992 daily park attendance was around 25 000  some reports give a figure of 30 000  instead of the predicted 60 000  Euro Disney s stock price spiralled downwards and on July 23  1992  the Resort announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million French francs  During Euro Disney s first winter  hotel occupancy was such that it was decided to close Disney s Newport Bay Club hotel for the season  Initial hopes were that each visitor would spend around US 33 per day  but near the end of 1992  analysts reckoned spending to be around 12  lower  74  Efforts to improve attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro Disneyland theme park  in response to a presumed European demand  which began June 12  1993  75  In January 1994  Sanford Litvack  an attorney from New York City and former Assistant Attorney General during the Jimmy Carter presidency  was assigned to be Disney s lead negotiator regarding Euro Disney s future  On February 28  Litvack made an offer  without the consent of Eisner or Frank Wells  to split the debts between Euro Disney creditors and Disney  After the banks showed interest  Litvack informed Eisner and Wells  On March 14  the day before the annual shareholders meeting  the banks capitulated to Disney s demands  The creditor banks bought US 500 million worth of Euro Disney shares  forgave 18 months of interest and deferred interest payments for three years  The Walt Disney Company invested US 750 million into Euro Disney and granted a five year suspension of royalty payments  In June that same year  Saudi Arabian Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud cut a deal whereby the Walt Disney Company bought 51  of a new US 1 1 billion share issue  the rest being offered to existing shareholders at below market rates  with the Prince buying any that were not taken up by existing shareholders  up to a 24 5  holding    edit  Disney s Wide World of Sports Complex Main article  Disney s Wide World of Sports Complex A former baseball umpire and an architect alleged that they approached the Walt Disney Company in 1987 with plans for a sports complex  and that Wide World of Sports  which opened 10 years later  was heavily based on their designs  Disney claimed that  while the designs had some similarities  the complex was also similar to numerous other sporting facilities  and the concept of a sports park was too generic for any one group to claim ownership  The two men  represented in part by noted attorney Johnnie Cochran  sued Disney in Orange County civil court  In August 2000  a jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs with damages in the amount of  240 million  a fraction of the  1 5 billion sought  76  Disney appealed the judgment  and settled out of court in September 2002 for undisclosed terms  77   edit  Disney s Animal Kingdom Main article  Disney s Animal Kingdom Even in planning stages  various Florida based animal rights groups and PETA didn t like the idea of Disney creating a theme park where animals were held in captivity  The groups protested  and PETA tried to convince travel agents not to book trips to the park  78  A few weeks before the park opened  a number of animals died due to accidents  The United States Department of Agriculture viewed most of the cases and found no violations of animal welfare regulations  79  On opening day  the Orange County Sheriff s office sent about 150 deputies in fear that there may be a large protest  but only two dozen protesters showed up  The protest lasted two hours  and there were no arrests  80  One year after the park opened  The Animal Rights Foundation of Florida complained that a New Year s Eve fireworks show could upset the animals  A USDA inspector came to the park to find no problems with launching low noise fireworks half a mile away  81   edit  Disney California Adventure Park Disney California Adventure Park  originally named Disney s California Adventure Park until a name change in June  2010  was expected to draw large crowds when opened in 2001  A January 14  2001 Los Angeles Times article titled  The most Jam Packed Theme Park on Earth   stated  Senior Disney officials acknowledge that there will be days when California Adventure will have to turn patrons away  particularly in the first weeks after the park opens  during spring break and again in the summer   The actual attendance was not close to the size that Disney expected for the park back in 2001  82  The reasons for this has been speculated as  Bad word of mouth from early visitors discouraged future visitors  stating the park was lacking in Disney quality attractions  83  Hollywood Pictures Backlot had lack of focus on the restaurants  shops and attractions  Lack of rides for young children  The park s Californian theme was criticized as being redundant  seeing as the park itself was located in the same state it represented  Various tourist attractions and landmarks such as the Hollywood Sign and the beaches were located less than an hour away from the park  Fans criticized the Paradise Pier area of the park because many of the attractions in this area were generic rides that guests do not expect to find at a Disney park  This was ironic because Walt Disney originally created the neighboring Disneyland to provide a theme park experience unlike boardwalk piers and amusement parks of the era  and instead wanted to create a park where the entire family could enjoy themselves  With an estimated price tag of  600 million  the park was criticized for being built  on the cheap   with a small amount of attractions and minimal theming  84  Many guests complained that a single day admission ticket to Disney s California Adventure cost the same as a single day admission ticket to Disneyland Park  yet contained fewer attractions  shows  amp  entertainment  85  Disney s chief executive officer  Robert Iger went on record during the company s annual stockholder meeting on March 10  2006  when someone asked about a potential third park being built in Anaheim   We re still working to assure the second gate is successful   Iger said  referring to California Adventure   In the spirit of candor  we have been challenged   86  On October 17  2007  The Walt Disney Company announced a multi year   1 1 billion expansion plan for Disney s California Adventure Park  87  88  Current plans for the renovation and expansion are on display for park visitors inside the Blue Sky Cellar at the Golden Vine Winery  Disney listened to the public and several of the attractions which drew criticism from the public will be removed in the multi year  multi billion dollar redesign and expansion of Disney s California Adventure  Other rides will be redesigned or replaced with a larger focus on Disney characters and stories  On May 28  2010  it was announced through the Disney Parks Blog that the park would also be receiving a slight name change  to Disney California Adventure  as well as a new logo  The new name took effect on June 11  2010 appearing on park maps and banners  but was first used in a commercial promoting Disney s World of Color a few days prior  World of Color premiered on June 11  2010 as part of Disney s Summer Nighttastic  89   edit  Hong Kong Disneyland Main article  Hong Kong Disneyland  edit  Overcrowding problems Just before the grand opening  the park was criticised for underestimating the daily capacity limit  90  The problem became apparent on the charity preview day on 4 September 2005  when 30 000 locals visited the park  This event turned out to be a disaster  there were too many guests  Wait times at fast food outlets were at least 45 minutes in length  and wait times at rides were two hours in length  Although the community  and the park s biggest shareholder  the Hong Kong Government  put pressure on the park to lower the capacity  the park insisted on keeping the limit and only agreed to relieve the capacity problem by extending opening time by one hour or introducing more discounts during weekdays  However  the park said local visitors tend to stay in the park for about nine hours per visit  implying that the mentioned practices would do little to solve the problem citation needed   During Chinese New Year 2006  many visitors arrived at the park in the morning bearing valid tickets  but were refused entry  because the park was already at capacity  Disgruntled visitors attempted to force their way into the park or gain access by climbing over the barrier gates  91  Disneyland management was forced to revise their ticketing policy and designated future periods close to Chinese public holidays as  special days  during which admission would only be allowed through a date specific ticket   edit  Food safety panel Officers from the Food and Environmental Hygiene department  who were asked by Disney staff to take off their badges and caps in order to enter the park  left park visitors feeling very uneasy  The officers investigated a food poisoning case in the park s restaurants  92  The chairman of Legco s food Safety panel  Fred Li  described the incident as shocking  and called on the director of the department to take follow up action against Disney  Hong Kong Disneyland says what happened was inappropriate and has apologised for the incident  The Secretary for Justice has since said that the government did not have enough evidence to make a prosecution  thus dropping the case   edit  Fingerprinting As at other Disney theme parks  visitors to Hong Kong Disneyland have their finger biometrics scanned at the entry gate  Visitors are not warned of the policy beforehand  Scanning is done of all visitors older than 10 years of age  and is used to associate ticket media with the person using it  The company claims that  the 50 sample points from the surface of a guest s finger     do not contain sufficient information to recreate a fingerprint image   Nonetheless  forensic specialists note that the data collected are more than adequate to establish a positive identification  93   edit  Hong Kong Disneyland Resort Main article  Hong Kong Disneyland Resort  edit  Shark fin soup controversy Disney originally planned to serve shark fin soup  a traditional Chinese delicacy  at wedding banquets  94  Animal rights groups protested in June 2005  citing the declining shark population in global waters and the cruel methods sometimes used of cutting the fin and discarding the live sharks back into the water  At first  Disney removed shark fin soup from its menu but said it would still offer the soup if their clients insisted on having it served at their wedding  They said they would distribute leaflets about shark conservation to discourage the choice  95  However  after constant and continuous pressure from environmental groups and schoolchildren  96  shareholders concerned about the company s image  Disney announced on 24 June 2005 that shark fin soup will not be served at all  because  according to their press release   After careful consideration and a thorough review process  we were not able to identify an environmentally sustainable fishing source  leaving us no alternative except to remove shark s fin soup from our wedding banquet menu   97   edit  Other controversies Fish around Ma Wan died as a result of land reclamation  98  The official size of the entire development as released by the government was 1 26 km2  citation needed  Furthermore  the size of the first phase was reported to be only 700 000 m2  However the area of just the Disneyland theme park portion  is estimated to be between 152 100 and 187 200 m2  If it accommodates a maximum capacity of 34 000 visitors  the area per visitor would be 2 5 m2   The commercial area is divided into  Theme Park  325 700 m2 Hotels  165 300 m2 Parking and Transit Hub  171 900 m2 Inspiration Lake 300 000 m2  edit  Disney s PhotoPass Disney s PhotoPass is a professional photography service offered Disney theme parks  water parks  and resorts  Photographers positioned at locations in the theme parks  dining events at the resorts  and at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique at Downtown Disney are linked to a free card containing a unique serial number  Guests can view or purchase PhotoPass pictures at locations in the parks  generally near the park entrance  or online by registering the card s number  99  100  Customers have complained about the difference in advertised prices  particularly of Photo CD products  and the actual cost  Disney has responded that advertised specials apply only to products purchased at the parks and do not apply to the website  101   edit  Disney Consumer Products  edit  Disney Princess On December 24  2006  Peggy Orenstein published   What s Wrong With Cinderella   in the New York Times  In her article  Orenstein discussed her concerns about the effects of princess figures on young girls  Orenstein used the Disney Princesses specifically to present many of her points  Orenstein also noted the pervasive nature of princess related merchandise and that every facet of play has its princess equivalent  102  Other sources have also voiced concern that the franchise could possibly give young girls the wrong message  However  other parents say that their young daughters would eventually grow out of this phase  103   edit  Disney Villains The majority of Disney s villain characters are regarded as being age 55 or older  A study from Brigham Young University reviewed seventy years of Disney films  and discovered that 42  of the 93 characters reviewed reinforced negative stereotypes of elderly people by portraying those characters as evil  grumpy or sinister  The conclusion was that Disney was influencing children to have preconceived notions about all older adults  104   edit  Marvel Comics Page 16 of Captain America  602  March 2010  depicted an anti tax protest march in Idaho in which one participant held a sign reading  Tea Bag the Libs Before They Tea Bag You   with a caption containing the words of an off screen African American superhero  the Falcon  telling Captain America   I don t exactly see a black man from Harlem fitting in with a bunch of angry white folks   105  106  107  The cartoon drew the condemnation of the Michael Johns  a board member of the Nationwide Tea Party Coalition  106  Marvel Comics Editor in Chief Joe Quesada characterized the sign as inadvertent and as  something that we need to apologize for and own up to      108  Quesada explained that with a printing deadline looming  the comic s editor noticed that the protest group s signs on the original art were empty  and the editor  asked the letterer on the book to just fudge in some quick signs  The letterer in his rush     looked on the  net and started pulling slogans from actual signs   including a  Tea Bag  sign  Following the printing of the issue  Marvel staff  caught the mistake  and  spoke to the letterer   who  was mortified at his mistake and was truly sorry as he had no political agenda   Quesada said Marvel  removed the sign from the art files so that it no longer appears in future reprints of the title or collections  So  while the crowd protesting has nothing to do with the villains in the story  we in no way meant to say they were associated with the Tea Party movement      108   edit  Acquisition of Marvel Entertainment On August 31  2009  Disney announced that it will acquire Marvel Entertainment for four billion dollars  109  However  this led Marvel fans to angrily set up a backlash  contemplating that Marvel would become more Disney esque than being Marvel  Marvel fans also spread numerous rumors around on the Internet about Disney integrating characters from the Disney animated films into Marvel Comics superhero issues and even casting a star from the Disney Channel in future Marvel Studios films  Although Disney wishes to market to a young male demographic with this purchase  Disney has stated that the acquisition will neither affect any of Marvel s products in any way  nor will the nature of any Marvel characters or products will be transformed  The acquisition was completed on December 31  2009   edit  See also The Walt Disney Company Criticism of ESPN  edit  References   a
