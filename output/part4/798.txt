landings  codenamed Operation Neptune  were the landing operations of the Allied invasion of Normandy  in Operation Overlord  during World War II  The landings commenced on Tuesday  June 6  1944  D Day   beginning at 6 30 AM British Double Summer Time  GMT 2   In planning  D Day was the term used for the day of actual landing  which was dependent on final approval  The landings were conducted in two phases  an airborne assault landing of 24 000  According to new files released by the British  there were 24 500 paratroopers  500 of them being highly trained commandos   British  American  Canadian and Free French airborne troops shortly after midnight  and an amphibious landing 4  of Allied infantry and armoured divisions on the coast of France starting at 6 30 AM  There were also decoy operations under the codenames Operation Glimmer and Operation Taxable to distract the German forces from the real landing areas  5  Supreme Commander of the Allied expeditionary forces was General Dwight Eisenhower while overall command of ground forces  21st Army Group  was given to General Bernard Montgomery  The operation  planned by a team under Lieutenant General Frederick Morgan  was the largest amphibious invasion in world history and was executed by land  sea  and air elements under direct British command with over 160 000 6  troops landing on June 6  1944  195 700 7  Allied naval and merchant navy personnel in over 5 000 6  ships were involved  The invasion required the transport of soldiers and material from the United Kingdom by troop laden aircraft and ships  the

forces used codenames to refer to the planning and execution of specific military operations  Operation Overlord was the codename for the Allied invasion of northwest Europe  The assault phase of Operation Overlord was known as Operation Neptune  Operation Overlord began on D Day  June 6  1944  and ended on June 30  1944  By this time  the Allies had established a firm foothold in Normandy  Operation Overlord also began on D Day  and continued until Allied forces crossed the River Seine on August 19  1944   Just prior to the invasion  General Eisenhower transmitted a now historic message to all members of the Allied Expeditionary Force  It read  in part   You are about to embark upon the great crusade  toward which we have striven these many months   8  In his pocket was a statement  never used  to be read in case the invasion failed  9   edit  Weather Only a few days in each month were suitable for launching the operation  a day near the full Moon was needed both for illumination during the hours of darkness and for the spring tide  the former to illuminate navigational landmarks for the crews of aircraft  gliders and landing craft  and the latter to provide the deepest possible water to help safe navigation over defensive obstacles placed by the Germans in the surf on the seaward approaches to the beaches  A full moon occurred on June 6  Allied Expeditionary Force Supreme Commander Dwight D  Eisenhower had tentatively selected June 5 as the date for the assault  The weather was fine during most of May  but deteriorated in early June  On June 4  conditions were clearly unsuitable for a landing  wind and high seas would make it impossible to launch landing craft from larger ships at sea  and low clouds would prevent aircraft finding their targets  The Allied troop convoys already at sea were forced to take shelter in bays and inlets on the south coast of Britain for the night  It seemed possible that everything would have to be cancelled and the troops returned to their embarkation camps  which would be almost impossible  as the enormous movement of follow up formations into them was already proceeding   The next full moon period would be nearly a month away  At a vital meeting on June 5  Eisenhower s chief meteorologist  Group Captain J M  Stagg  forecast a brief improvement for June 6  Commander of all land forces for the invasion General Bernard Montgomery and Eisenhower s Chief of Staff General Walter Bedell Smith wished to proceed with the invasion  Commander of the Allied Air Forces Air Chief Marshal Leigh Mallory was doubtful  but the Allied Naval supremo Admiral Bertram Ramsay believed that conditions would be marginally favorable  On the strength of Stagg s forecast  Eisenhower ordered the invasion to proceed  As a result  prevailing overcast skies limited Allied air support  and no serious damage was done to the beach defences on Omaha and Juno  10  The Germans meanwhile took comfort from the existing poor conditions  which were worse over Northern France than over the Channel itself  and believed no invasion would be possible for several days  Some troops stood down  and many senior officers were away for the weekend  Field Marshal Erwin Rommel  for example  took a few days  leave to celebrate his wife s birthday  11  While dozens of division  regimental  and battalion commanders were away from their posts at war games  the Allied forces were attacking  citation needed   edit  Allied order of battle D day assault routes into Normandy The order of battle for the landings was precisely as follows  east to

the British and Canadian combat units  eight Australian officers were attached to the British forces as eyewitnesses  15  The nominally British air and naval support units included a large number of crew from Allied nations  including several RAF squadrons manned almost exclusively by overseas air crew  For instance  the Australian contribution to the operation included a regular Royal Australian Air Force  RAAF  squadron  nine Article XV squadrons and hundreds of personnel posted to RAF units and RN warships  16   edit  U S  First Army Omaha Beach V Corps  1st Infantry Division and 29th

dropping further west  in the middle part of the Cotentin  allowing the sea landing forces to their east easier access across the peninsula  and preventing the Germans from reinforcing the north part of the peninsula  The plans were later changed to move them much closer to the beachhead  as at the last minute the German 91st Air Landing Division was determined to be in the area  17  18  In total  the First Army contingent totalled approximately 73 000 men  including 15 600 from the airborne divisions  12   edit  German order of battle The military forces at the disposal of Nazi Germany reached its numerical peak during 1944  By D Day  157 German divisions were stationed in the Soviet Union  6 in Finland  12 in Norway  6 in Denmark  9 in Germany  21 in the Balkans  26 in Italy and 59 in France  Belgium and the Netherlands  19  However  these statistics are somewhat misleading since a significant number of the divisions in the east were depleted due to intensity of fighting  German records indicate that the average personnel complement was at about 50  in the spring of 1944  20   edit  German defences The German defences used an interlocking firing style  so they could protect areas that were receiving heavy fire  They had large bunkers  sometimes intricate concrete ones containing machine guns and large calibre weapons  Their defence also integrated the cliffs and hills overlooking the beaches  The defences were all built and refined over a four year period   edit  Atlantic Wall Main articles  Atlantic Wall and English Channel A map of the Atlantic Wall  shown in green    German Reich   Allies The Germans  first line of defence was the English Channel  a crossing which had confounded the Spanish Armada and Napoleon Bonaparte s Navy  Compounding the invasion efforts was the extensive Atlantic Wall  ordered by Hitler in his Directive 51  Believing that any forthcoming landings would be timed for high tide  Rommel had the entire wall fortified with tank top turrets and extensive barbed wire  and laid hundreds of thousands of mines to deter landing craft  The Allies chose to attack close to the sector boundary between the 7th and 15th German armies  on the extreme eastern flank of the former  to maximize the possible confusion of command responsibility during German reaction  The landings sector which was attacked was occupied by four German divisions   edit  Divisional areas 716th Infantry Division  Static  defended the Eastern end of the landing zones  including most of the British and Canadian beaches  This division  as well as the 709th  included Germans who were not considered fit for active duty on the Eastern Front  usually for medical reasons  and soldiers of various other nationalities  from conquered countries  often drafted by force  and former Soviet prisoners of war who had agreed to fight for the Germans rather than endure the harsh conditions of German POW camps  among them so called hiwis   These  volunteers  were concentrated in  Ost Bataillone   East Battalions  that were of dubious loyalty  352nd Infantry Division was a well trained and equipped formation defending the area between approximately Bayeux and Carentan  including Omaha beach  The division had been formed in November 1943 with the help of cadres from the disbanded 321st Division  which had been destroyed in the Soviet Union that same year  The 352nd had a number of troops who had seen action on the eastern front  Therefore  the 352nd already had significant fighting experience at holding a defensive position  The division was stationed at Omaha Beach  where by far the heaviest casualties of the invasion were suffered by the landing U S  forces  91st Air Landing Division  Luftlande air transported   Generalmajor Wilhelm Falley   comprising the 1057th Infantry Regiment and 1058th Infantry Regiment  This was a regular infantry division  trained  and equipped to be transported by air  i e  transportable artillery  few heavy support weapons  located in the interior of the Cotentin Peninsula  including the drop zones of the American parachute landings  The attached 6th Parachute Regiment  Oberstleutnant Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte  had been rebuilt as a part of the 2nd Parachute Division stationed in Brittany  709th Infantry Division  Static   Generalleutnant Karl Wilhelm von Schlieben   comprising the 729th Infantry Regiment  739th Infantry Regiment  both with four battalions  but the 729th 4th and the 739th 1st and 4th being Ost  these two regiments had no regimental support companies either   and 919th Infantry Regiment  This coastal defence division protected the eastern  and northern  including Cherbourg  coast of the Cotentin Peninsula  including the Utah beach landing zone  Like the 716th  this division comprised a number of  Ost  units who were provided with German leadership to manage them   edit  Adjacent divisional areas Other divisions occupied the areas around the landing zones  including  243rd Infantry Division  Static   Generalleutnant Heinz Hellmich   comprising the 920th Infantry Regiment  two battalions   921st Infantry Regiment  and 922nd Infantry Regiment  This coastal defence division protected the western coast of the Cotentin Peninsula  711th Infantry Division  Static   comprising the 731st Infantry Regiment  and 744th Infantry Regiment  This division defended the western part of the Pays de Caux  30th Mobile Brigade  Oberstleutnant Freiherr von und zu Aufsess   comprising three bicycle battalions   edit  Armoured reserves Rommel s defensive measures were also frustrated by a dispute over armoured doctrine  In addition to his two army groups  von Rundstedt also commanded the headquarters of Panzer Group West under General Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg  usually referred to as von Geyr   This formation was nominally an administrative HQ for von Rundstedt s armoured and mobile formations  but it was later to be renamed Fifth Panzer Army and brought into the line in Normandy  Von Geyr and Rommel disagreed over the deployment and use of the vital Panzer divisions  Rommel recognised that the Allies would possess air superiority and would be able to harass his movements from the air  He therefore proposed that the armoured formations be deployed close to the invasion beaches  In his words  it was better to have one Panzer division facing the invaders on the first day  than three Panzer divisions three days later when the Allies would already have established a firm beachhead  Von Geyr argued for the standard doctrine that the Panzer formations should be concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen  and deployed en masse against the main Allied beachhead when this had been identified  The argument was eventually brought before Hitler for arbitration  He characteristically imposed an unworkable compromise solution  Only three Panzer divisions were given to Rommel  too few to cover all the threatened sectors  The remainder  nominally under Von Geyr s control  were actually designated as being in  OKW Reserve   Only three of these were deployed close enough to intervene immediately against any invasion of Northern France  the other four were dispersed in southern France and the Netherlands  Hitler reserved to himself the authority to move the divisions in OKW Reserve  or commit them to action  On June 6  many Panzer division commanders were unable to move because Hitler had not given the necessary authorization  and his staff refused to wake him upon news of the invasion  The 21st Panzer Division  Generalmajor Edgar Feuchtinger  was deployed near Caen as a mobile striking force as part of the Army Group B reserve  However  Rommel placed it so close to the coastal defences that  under standing orders in case of invasion  several of its infantry and anti aircraft units would come under the orders of the fortress divisions on the coast  reducing the effective strength of the division  The other mechanized divisions capable of intervening in Normandy were retained under the direct control of the German Armed Forces HQ  OKW  and were initially denied to Rommel   edit  Coordination with the French Resistance The various factions and circuits of the French Resistance were included in the plan for Overlord  Through a London based headquarters which supposedly embraced all resistance groups   tat major des Forces Fran aises de l Int rieur  EMFFI   the British Special Operations Executive orchestrated a massive campaign of sabotage tasking the various Groups with attacking railway lines  ambushing roads  or destroying telephone exchanges or electrical substations  The resistance was alerted to carry out these tasks by means of the messages personnels  transmitted by the BBC in its French service from London  Several hundred of these were regularly transmitted  masking the few of them that were really significant  Francs tireurs and Allied paratroopers reporting on the situation during the Battle of Normandy in 1944  Among the stream of apparently meaningless messages broadcast by the BBC at 21 00 CET on June 5 were coded instructions such as Les carottes sont cuites   The carrots are cooked   and Les d s sont jet s   The dice have been thrown    21  One famous pair of these messages is often mistakenly stated to be a general call to arms by the Resistance  A few days before D Day  the  slightly misquoted  first line of Verlaine s poem  Chanson d Automne  was transmitted   Les sanglots longs des violons de l automne  22  23   Long sobs of autumn violins  alerted the resistance fighters of the Ventriloquist network in the Orl ans region to attack rail targets within the next few days  The second line   Bercent mon coeur d une langueur monotone    soothe my heart with a monotonous languor    transmitted late on June 5  meant that the attack was to be mounted immediately  Josef G tz  the head of the signals section of the German intelligence service  the SD  in Paris  had discovered the meaning of the second line of Verlaine s poem  and no fewer than fourteen other executive orders they heard late on June 5  His section rightly interpreted them to mean that an invasion was imminent or underway  and they alerted their superiors and all Army commanders in France  However  they had issued a similar warning a month before  when the Allies had begun invasion preparations and alerted the Resistance  but then stood down because of a forecast of bad weather  The SD having given this false alarm  their genuine alarm was ignored or treated as merely routine  Fifteenth Army HQ passed the information on to its units  Seventh Army ignored it  23  In addition to the tasks given to the Resistance as part of the invasion effort  the Special Operations Executive planned to reinforce the Resistance with three man liaison parties  under Operation Jedburgh  The Jedburgh parties would coordinate and arrange supply drops to the Maquis groups in the German rear areas  Also operating far behind German lines and frequently working closely with the Resistance  although not under SOE  were larger parties from the British  French and Belgian units of the Special Air Service brigade   edit  Naval activity Large landing craft convoy crosses the English Channel on 6 June 1944  Operation Neptune  as the naval part of the D Day invasion was known primarily as a Royal Navy affair  both in planning and execution  This is widely considered  a never surpassed masterpiece of planning   24  In overall command was Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay  who as Flag Officer Dover had controlled the evacuation of over 300 000 troops from Dunkirk four years earlier  He had also been responsible for the naval planning of the invasion of North Africa in 1942 and one of the two fleets carrying troops for the invasion of Sicily in the following year  The invasion fleet was drawn from eight different navies  comprising 6 939 vessels  1 213 warships  4 126 transport vessels  landing ships and landing craft   and 736 ancillary craft and 864 merchant vessels  Out of the 2 468 major landing vessels in the two task forces deployed on the June 6  1944 only 346 were American  Of the 23 cruisers covering the landings 17 were Royal Navy  In fact of the 16 warships covering the American Western beaches  Utah and Omaha  50  were British and Allied ships  There were 195 700 naval personnel involved  112 824  58   were British  Royal Navy   52 889  30   US and 4 988 Allied countries  12  The Allied Naval Expeditionary Force was divided into two Naval Task Forces  Western  Rear Admiral Alan G Kirk  and Eastern  Rear Admiral Sir Philip Vian   another veteran of the Italian landings   The warships provided cover for the transports against any enemy surface warships  submarines or aerial attack  and supported the landings with shore bombardment  These ships included the Allied Task Force  O   A small part of the naval operation was Operation Gambit  when British midget submarines supplied navigation beacons to guide landing craft   edit  Naval screen An important part of Neptune was the isolation of the invasion routes and beaches from any intervention by the German Navy   the Kriegsmarine  The responsibility for this was assigned to the Royal Navy s Home Fleet  There were two principal perceived German naval threats  The first was surface attack by German capital ships from anchorages in Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea  This did not materialise since  by mid 1944  the battleships were damaged  the cruisers were used for training  and the Kriegsmarine s fuel allocation had been cut by a third  In any case  the Royal Navy had strong forces available to repel any attempts  and the Kiel Canal area was mined  Operation Bravado  25  as a precaution  The second perceived major threat was that of U boats transferred from the Atlantic  Air surveillance from three escort carriers and RAF Coastal Command maintained a cordon well west of Land s End  Few U boats were spotted  and most of the escort groups were moved nearer to the landings  Further efforts were made to seal the Western Approaches against German naval forces from Brittany and the Bay of Biscay  Minefields were laid  Operation Maple  to force enemy ships away from air protection where they could be attacked by Allied destroyer flotillas  Again  enemy activity was minor  but on July 4th four German destroyers were either sunk or forced back to Brest  The Straits of Dover were closed by minefields  naval and air patrols  radar  and effective bombing raids on enemy ports  Local German naval forces were small but could be reinforced from the Baltic  Their efforts  however  were concentrated on protecting the Pas de Calais against expected landings there  and no attempt was made to force the blockade  The screening operation destroyed few German ships  but the objective was achieved  There were no U boat attacks against Allied shipping and few attempts by surface ships   edit  Bombardment The view from HMS Kelvin showing the wide variety of vessels deployed  Warships provided supporting fire for the land forces  During Neptune  it was given a high importance  using ships from battleships to destroyers and landing craft  For example  the Canadians at Juno beach had fire support many times greater than they had had for the Dieppe Raid in 1942  The old battleships HMS Ramillies and Warspite and the monitor HMS Roberts were used to suppress shore batteries east of the Orne  cruisers targeted shore batteries at Ver sur Mer and Moulineaux  eleven destroyers for local fire support  In addition  there were modified landing craft  eight  Landing Craft Gun   each with two 4 7 inch guns  four  Landing Craft Support  with automatic cannon  eight Landing Craft Tank  Rocket   each with a single salvo of 1 100 5 inch rockets  eight Landing Craft Assault  Hedgerow   each with twenty four bombs intended to detonate beach mines prematurely  Twenty four Landing Craft Tank carried Priest self propelled howitzers which also fired while they were on the run in to the beach  Similar arrangements existed at other beaches  Fire support went beyond the suppression of shore defences overlooking landing beaches and was also used to break up enemy concentrations as the troops moved inland  This was particularly noted in German reports  Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt reported that      The enemy had deployed very strong Naval forces off the shores of the bridgehead  These can be used as quickly mobile  constantly available artillery  at points where they are necessary as defence against our attacks or as support for enemy attacks  During the day their fire is skilfully directed by       plane observers  and by advanced ground fire spotters  Because of the high rapid fire capacity of Naval guns they play an important part in the battle within their range  The movement of tanks by day  in open country  within the range of these naval guns is hardly possible  26   edit  Naval losses The only naval contact during D Day occurred when four German torpedo boats reached the Eastern Task Force late in the afternoon and launched eighteen torpedoes  sinking the Norwegian destroyer Svenner off Sword beach but missing the battleships HMS Warspite and HMS Ramillies  After firing  the German vessels turned away and fled east into a smoke screen  Thanks to ULTRA  the Allies knew where the Germans channel through their own minefields  The only Allied losses to mines were the USS Corry off of Utah  USS PC 1261  a 173 foot patrol craft  three LCTs  and two LCIs  27   edit  The landings Twelfth United States Army Group situation map for 2400 hours  6 June 1944   edit  Air operations The success of the amphibious landings depended on the establishment of a secure lodgement from which to expand the beachhead to allow the build up of a well supplied force capable of breaking out  The amphibious forces were especially vulnerable to strong enemy counter attacks before the build up of sufficient forces in the beachhead could be accomplished  To slow or eliminate the enemy s ability to organize and launch counter attacks during this critical period  airborne operations were used to seize key objectives  such as bridges  road crossings  and terrain features  particularly on the eastern and western flanks of the landing areas  The airborne landings some distance behind the beaches were also intended to ease the egress of the amphibious forces off the beaches  and in some cases to neutralize German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of the beachhead  The U S  82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were assigned to objectives west of Utah Beach  The British 6th Airborne Division was assigned to similar objectives on the eastern flank  530 Free French paratroopers  from the British Special Air Service Brigade  were assigned to objectives in Brittany from June 5 to August  28  29   Operation Dingson  Operation Samwest  Operation Cooney   The Royal Air Force flew and supplied half of the aircraft deployed  Nearly half of the US gliders were the larger Airspeed Horsa  as they carried twice as much as the US equivalent  The RAF created a new command  the 2nd Tactical Air Force flying low level missions especially to support operations on the ground  30  As Eisenhower reported   The chief credit in smashing the enemy s spearhead  however  must go to the rocket firing Hawker Typhoon planes of the Second Tactical Air Force   31   edit  British airborne landings Main article  Operation Tonga The first Allied action of D Day was Operation Deadstick a glider assault at 00 16 on the bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne  These were the only crossings of the river and canal north of Caen around 7 kilometres  4 5 mi  from the coast  near B nouville and Ranville  For the Germans  the crossing provided the only route for a flanking attack on the beaches from the east  For the Allies  the crossing also was vital for any attack on Caen from the east  Destroyed British glider used during the landings  The tactical objectives of the British 6th Airborne Division were  a  to capture intact the bridges of the B nouville Ranville crossing   b  to defend the crossing against the inevitable armoured counter attacks   c  to destroy German artillery at the Merville battery  which threatened Sword Beach  and  d  to destroy five bridges over the Dives River to further restrict movement of ground forces from the east  Airborne troops  mostly paratroopers of the 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades  including the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion  began landing after midnight  June 6 and immediately encountered elements of the German 716th Infantry Division  At dawn  the Battle Group von Luck of the 21st Panzer Division counterattacked from the south on both sides of the Orne River  By this time the paratroopers had established a defensive perimeter surrounding the bridgehead  Casualties were heavy on both sides  but the airborne troops held  Shortly after noon  they were reinforced by commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade  By the end of D Day  reinforced by Operation Mallard the 6th Airborne had accomplished all of its objectives  For several days  both British and German forces took heavy casualties as they struggled for positions around the Orne bridgehead  For example  the German 346th Infantry Division broke through the eastern edge of the defensive line on June 10  Finally  British paratroopers overwhelmed entrenched panzergrenadiers in the Battle of Breville on June 12  The Germans did not seriously threaten the bridgehead again  6th Airborne remained on the line until it was evacuated in early September   edit  American airborne landings Main article  American airborne landings in Normandy U S  troops of the 3rd Armored Division examine a knocked out German StuG III with a dead German crewman slumped over gun barrel  The U S  82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions  numbering 13 000 paratroopers delivered by 12 troop carrier groups of the IX Troop Carrier Command  were less fortunate in completing their main objectives  To achieve surprise  the drops were routed to approach Normandy from the west  Numerous factors affected their performance  the primary of which was the decision to make a massive parachute drop at night  a tactic not used again for the rest of the war   As a result  45  of units were widely scattered and unable to rally  Efforts of the early wave of pathfinder teams to mark the landing zones were largely ineffective  and the Rebecca Eureka transponding radar beacons used to guide in the waves of C 47 Skytrains to the drop zones were the main component of a flawed system  Three regiments of 101st Airborne paratroopers were dropped first  between 00 48 and 01 40  followed by the 82nd Airborne s drops between 01 51 and 02 42  Each operation involved approximately 400 C 47 aircraft  Two pre dawn glider landings brought in anti tank guns and support troops for each division  On the evening of D Day two additional glider landings brought in two battalions of artillery and 24 howitzers to the 82nd Airborne  Additional glider operations on June 7 delivered the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment to the 82nd Airborne  and two large supply parachute drops that date were ineffective  After 24 hours  only 2 500 troops of the 101st and 2 000 of the 82nd were under the control of their divisions  approximating a third of the force dropped  The dispersal of the American airborne troops  however  had the effect of confusing the Germans and fragmenting their response  In addition  the Germans  defensive flooding  in the early stages  also helped to protect the Americans  southern flank  Paratroopers continued to roam and fight behind enemy lines for days  Many consolidated into small groups  rallied with NCOs or junior officers  and usually were a hodgepodge of men from different companies  battalions  regiments  or even divisions  The 82nd occupied the town of Sainte M re  glise early in the morning of June 6  giving it the claim of the first town liberated in the invasion   edit  Sword Beach Main article  Sword Beach British troops take cover after landing on Sword Beach  The assault on Sword Beach began at about 03 00 with an aerial bombardment of the German coastal defences and artillery sites  The naval bombardment began a few hours later  At 07 30  the first units reached the beach  These were the DD tanks of 13th 18th Hussars followed closely by the infantry of 8th Brigade  On Sword Beach  the regular British infantry came ashore with light casualties  They had advanced about 8 kilometres  5 mi  by the end of the day but failed to take some of the deliberately ambitious targets set by Montgomery  In particular  Caen  a major objective  was still in German hands by the end of D Day  and would remain so until mid July  central urban area cleared July 8 9  suburbs fully cleared by July 20 in Operation Atlantic  Battle for Caen  1st Special Service Brigade  under the command of Brigadier The Lord Lovat DSO  MC  went ashore in the second wave led by No 4 Commando with the two French Troops first  as agreed amongst themselves  The 1st Special Service Brigade s landing is famous for having been led by Piper Bill Millin  The British and French of No 4 Commando had separate targets in Ouistreham  the French  a blockhouse and the Casino  the British two German batteries which overlooked the beach  The blockhouse proved too strong for the Commandos  PIAT  Projector Infantry Anti Tank  weapons  but the Casino was taken with the aid of a Centaur tank  The British Commandos achieved both battery objectives only to find the gun mounts empty and the guns removed  Leaving the mopping up procedure to the infantry  the Commandos withdrew from Ouistreham to join the other units of their brigade  Nos 3  6 and 45   moving inland to join up with the 6th Airborne Division   edit  Juno Beach Main article  Juno Beach Canadian operations on D Day The Canadian forces that landed on Juno Beach faced 2 heavy batteries of 155 mm guns and 9 medium batteries of 75 mm guns  as well as machine gun nests  pillboxes  other concrete fortifications  and a seawall twice the height of the one at Omaha Beach  The first wave suffered 50  casualties  the second highest of the five D Day beachheads  The use of armour was successful at Juno  in some instances actually landing ahead of the infantry as intended and helping clear a path inland  32  Personnel of Royal Canadian Navy Beach Commando  W  landing on Mike Beach  Juno sector of the Normandy beachhead  6 June 1944  Despite the obstacles  the Canadians were off the beach within hours and beginning their advance inland  A single troop of four tanks managed to reach the final objective phase line  but hastily retreated  having out run its infantry support  In particular  two fortified positions at the Douvres Radar Station remained in German hands  and would for several days until captured by British commandos   and no link had been established with Sword Beach  By the end of D Day  30 000 Canadians had been successfully landed  and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had penetrated further into France than any other Allied force  despite having faced strong resistance at the water s edge and later counterattacks on the beachhead by elements of the German 21st and 12th SS Hitlerjugend  Hitler Youth  Panzer divisions on June 7 and June 8   edit  Gold Beach Main article  Gold Beach At Gold Beach  25 000 men were landed  under the command of Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey Commander of the British 2nd Army  The casualties were also quite heavy  around 400  partly because bad weather also the swimming Sherman DD tanks were delayed  and the Germans had strongly fortified a village on the beach  However  the 50th  Northumbrian  Infantry Division overcame these difficulties and advanced almost to the outskirts of Bayeux by the end of the day  With the exception of the Canadians at Juno Beach  no division came closer to its objectives than the 50th  No 47  RM  Commando was the last British Commando unit to land and came ashore on Gold east of La Hamel  Their task was to proceed inland then turn right  west  and make a 16 kilometre  10 mi  march through enemy territory to attack the coastal harbour of Port en Bessin from the rear  This small port  on the British extreme right  was well sheltered in the chalk cliffs and significant in that it was to be a prime early harbour for supplies to be brought in including fuel by underwater pipe from tankers moored offshore   edit  Omaha Beach Main article  Omaha Beach Survivors of a sunken troop transport wade ashore on Omaha Beach Elements of the 1st Infantry Division and 29th Infantry Division  US  faced the recently formed German 352nd Infantry Division  a mixed group of Russian  volunteers  and teenagers stiffened with a cadre of east front veterans  unusual in the fact that it was one of the few German divisions remaining with a full complement of three regiments albeit at reduced strength  fifty percent of its officers had no combat experience  However  Allied intelligence was unaware until two weeks before the planned invasion that the 100 km stretch of beach originally allocated to be defended by the 716th Infantry Division  static  had been cut into two parts in March  with the 716th moving to the  Caen Zone   and the 352nd taking over the  Bayeux Zone   thus doubling the complement of defenders  33  Omaha was also the most heavily fortified beach  with high bluffs defended by funneled mortars  machine guns  and artillery  and the pre landing aerial and naval bombardment of the bunkers proved to be ineffective  Difficulties in navigation caused the majority of landings to drift eastwards  missing their assigned sectors and the initial assault waves of tanks  infantry and engineers took heavy casualties  Of the 16 tanks that landed upon the shores of Omaha Beach only 2 survived the landing  The official record stated that  within 10 minutes of the ramps being lowered   the leading  company had become inert  leaderless and almost incapable of action  Every officer and sergeant had been killed or wounded       It had become a struggle for survival and rescue   Only a few gaps were blown in the beach obstacles  resulting in problems for subsequent landings  The heavily defended draws  the only vehicular routes off the beach  could not be taken and two hours after the first assault the beach was closed for all but infantry landings  Commanders  including General Omar Bradley  considered abandoning the beachhead  but small units of infantry  often forming ad hoc groups  supported by naval artillery and the surviving tanks  eventually infiltrated the coastal defences by scaling the bluffs between strongpoints  Further infantry landings were able to exploit the initial penetrations and by the end of the day two isolated footholds had been established  American casualties at Omaha on D Day numbered around 5 000 out of 50 000 men  most in the first few hours  while the Germans suffered 1 200 killed  wounded or missing  The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days  and the original D Day objectives were accomplished by D 3   edit  Pointe du Hoc Main article  Pointe du Hoc The massive concrete cliff top gun emplacement at Pointe du Hoc was the target of the 2nd Ranger Battalion  commanded by James Earl Rudder  The task was to scale the 30 meter  100 ft  cliffs under the cover of night  approximately at 5 30  one hour prior to the landings with ropes and ladders  and then attack and destroy the German coastal defence guns  which were thought to command the Omaha and Utah landing areas  The infantry commanders did not know that the guns had been moved prior to the attack  and they had to press farther inland to find them and eventually destroyed them  However  fortifications themselves were still vital targets as a single artillery forward observer based there could have called down accurate fire on the U S  beaches  The Rangers were eventually successful  and captured the fortifications  They then had to fight for two days to hold the location  losing more than 60  of their men  Afterwards they regrouped and continued Northeast to the rally point one mile from the gun emplacements on Pointe Du Hoc   edit  Utah Beach Main article  Utah Beach Landing craft approach the beach as smoke on the shore emanates from German positions  Casualties on Utah Beach  the westernmost landing zone  were the lightest of any beach  with 197 out of the roughly 23 000 troops that landed  The 4th Infantry Division troops landing at Utah Beach found themselves in the wrong positions because of a current that pushed their landing craft to the southeast  Instead of landing at Tare Green and Uncle Red sectors  they came ashore at Victor sector  which was lightly defended  and as a result  relatively little German opposition was encountered  The 4th Infantry Division was able to press inland relatively easily over beach exits that had been seized from the inland side by the 502nd and 506th Parachute Infantry Regiments of the 101st Airborne Division  This was partially by accident  because their planned landing was further down the beach  Brig  Gen  Theodore Roosevelt Jr  the Asst  Commander of 4th Division  upon discovering the landings were off course  was famous for stating  We will start the war from right here     By early afternoon  the 4th Infantry Division had succeeded in linking up with elements of the 101st  American casualties were light  and the troops were able to press inward much faster than expected  making it a near complete success   edit  War memorials and tourism The B ny sur Mer Canadian War Cemetery  The German War cemetery in La Cambe The beaches at Normandy are still referred to on maps and signposts by their invasion codenames  There are several vast cemeteries in the area  The American cemetery  in Colleville sur Mer  contains row upon row of identical white crosses and Stars of David  immaculately kept  commemorating the American dead  Commonwealth graves  in many locations  use white headstones engraved with the person s religious symbol and their unit insignia  The largest cemetery in Normandy is the La Cambe German war cemetery  which features granite stones almost flush with the ground and groups of low set crosses  There is also a Polish cemetery  Streets near the beaches are still named after the units that fought there  and occasional markers commemorate notable incidents  At significant points  such as Pointe du Hoc and Pegasus Bridge  there are plaques  memorials or small museums  The Mulberry harbour still sits in the sea at Arromanches  In Sainte M re  glise  a dummy paratrooper hangs from the church spire  On Juno Beach  the Canadian government has built the Juno Beach Information Centre  commemorating one of the most significant events in Canadian military history  In Caen is a large Museum for Peace  which is dedicated to peace generally  rather than only to the battle   edit  See also Normandy portal World War II portal List of Allied warships in the Normandy landings The Longest Day  the 1962 Oscar winning film dramatization of the event Saving Private Ryan
