Care Bears are characters created by American Greetings in 1981 for use on greeting cards  The original artwork for the cards was painted by artist Elena Kucharik  In 1983  Kenner turned the Care Bears into plush teddy bears  The Care Bears appeared in their own TV specials called The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings  1983  and The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine  1984   They also had their own television series from 1985 to 1988  in addition to three feature films  The Care Bears Movie  1985   Care Bears Movie II  A New Generation  1986   and The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland  1987   Each Care Bear comes in a different color and has a specialized insignia on its belly that represents its duty and personality  This insignia was known as their  tummy symbol   However  the movie Care Bears  Oopsy Does It  renamed them  belly badges   Adding to the Care Bear family are the  Care Bear Cousins   which feature a lion  rabbit  penguin  raccoon  and other such animals created in the same style as the teddy bears  In 2002  the bears were reintroduced with new toys  Made by Play Along Toys  the new toys offered features such as illuminated bellies upon touch  aerobic bears  and glow in the dark bears  As part of this comeback  the Bears have appeared in two computer animated movies  Care Bears  Journey to Joke a lot  2004  and The Care Bears  Big Wish Movie  2005   In 2007  the franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary  another relaunch took place  as well as the release of Care Bears  Oopsy Does It   As of 2011  Care Bears merchandise is still

American Greetings Corp  Jack Chojnacki  the co president of TCFC  introduced the first Care Bear to six businessmen three from AGC  and three from the toy company Kenner in February 1981  On the employees  reaction to the toy  Chojnacki recalled in early 1985   It had a high  aaaaaah  factor   1  Muriel Fahrion  the artist who helped create Strawberry Shortcake s look  was also among the franchise s first concept artists  2  Working with TCFC Creative VP Ralph Shaffer  Muriel designed the first six bears  creating the best selling greeting card themes for their belly graphics  Susan Trentel  Muriel s sister and doll designer of Strawberry Shortcake  designed the Care Bears plush  Once out of the concept stage children s book illustrator Elena Kucharik became the primary artist for the Care Bears creating hundreds of full color illustrations for cards  books and a myriad of licensed products  TCFC s creative team of artists and writers worked to create numerous characters in the line  which was a joint development by Those Characters From Cleveland and MAD  Marketing and Design Service of the toy group of General Mills   3  53 As they had done with Strawberry Shortcake  once titled  Project I   AGC called the Care Bears development  Project II  as they strove to make the character program secret until advertising was ready  At the start of the franchise  Care Bears was already established as its working title  4   edit  Launch and success On September 24  1982  the Care Bears franchise was launched in New York City before members of the area s Society of Security Analysts  5  Attending the event were American Greetings president Morry Weiss  and two employees of Those Characters from Cleveland  Jack Chojnacki and senior vice president Henry Lowenthal  5  Eventually  the characters were announced as a toyline for production by Parker Brothers and Kenner the following spring  as well as pre licensed characters and media stars  At that time  American Greetings touted their debut as  the biggest character launch in the history of retailing   6  On a US 5 6 million advertising budget 1  5  and a wholesale commitment worth US 122 5 million  5  American Greetings introduced the characters to the general public in February 1983  7  with an appearance at New York City s Toy Fair  8  26 licensees were involved upon launch  7  Among them was General Mills  5  a food company which owned the board game manufacturer Parker Brothers  9  In early 1983  Parker Brothers released six books featuring the Care Bears as part of its publishing division s first offerings  9  On television  the original ten Bears starred in their first syndicated special  Atkinson Film Arts  The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings  Kenner produced and sponsored it  3  52 In 1984  AGC introduced a spin off line  the Care Bear Cousins  another syndicated special  The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine  came out that same year  A miniseries based on the toys was distributed by Lexington Broadcast Services Company  3  52 A year later  the Bears and Cousins starred in their first film  The Care Bears Movie  produced by Nelvana Limited and released by The Samuel Goldwyn Company  It became the highest grossing animated film made outside the Disney market at the time of its release  10  Later that autumn  DIC Entertainment released an 11 episode television series in syndication  11  Professor Coldheart and Frostbite did not appear in the movie  but appeared semi regularly in the series with a new villain named Auntie Freeze  citation needed  In 1986  Nelvana returned to the franchise with a second movie  Care Bears Movie II  A New Generation  Released by Columbia Pictures  the film featured a new villain  Dark Heart  and introduced more of the Care Bears and Care Bears Cousins  Harmony Bear  True Heart Bear  and Noble Heart Horse  Later that year  a TV series titled The Care Bears Family  also from Nelvana  premiered on the U S  ABC network and Canada s Global  12  Lasting two seasons and consisting of over 70 episodes  this introduced the evil wizard No Heart and his sidekick Beastly  In the second season  No Heart s niece Shreeky was introduced  The Care Bears  third film  The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland  debuted in 1987  A TV special  Care Bears Nutcracker Suite  premiered on the Disney Channel in 1988  Over 40 million Care Bears were sold between 1983 and 1987  and during the decade  American Greetings printed over 70 million of their cards  In whole  the sales of their merchandise reached over  2 billion during the 1980s  13  14  This made them one of the most successful toylines of its time  alongside  My Little Pony  and  Transformers   according to whom    edit  Revivals In early 1991  Those Characters from Cleveland and Kenner embarked on a relaunch of the franchise  involving seven bears  One of the 1980s characters  Proud Heart Cat  was released as a bear and sported the symbol of a heart shaped American flag  15  The publishing company Random House released two tie in books  The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup  1991  by Bobbi Katz  16  17  and The Care Bears and the Whale Tale  1992  by Peggy Kahn  18  19  In 1999  the rights to the Care Bears franchise were bought by Jay Foreman  the president of Fort Lauderdale based Play Along Toys  for less than  1 million  he also planned to acquire fellow AGC property Strawberry Shortcake  20  Three years later  American Greetings relaunched the Care Bear brand as part of the Bears  20th anniversary celebration with a series of plush toys and movies  The artwork and design of the bears were changed for relaunch  Also  Funshine Bear s gender was changed from female to male  Champ Bear s colours were changed from tan to true blue  with his tummy symbol changed to a winner s cup with a star  and Share Bear s tummy symbol was changed from a milkshake with two straws to two lollipops crossed  The change to Share Bear s symbol stems from Play Along Toys  suggestion of the change on the grounds that sharing a milkshake may spread germs  Apart from that  many other minor changes were made to the designs  mostly involving lightening the colors of the bears and minor redesigns to the tummy symbols  In the midst of this revival  Play Along released brand new toys based on the newly redesigned Bears  sold at stores such as Wal Mart  Kmart  Toys  R  Us  Target  KB Toys  and Mervyns  21  The new merchandise included the Bears doing aerobics  Tenderheart Bear as a patient  casting the child that is playing with the toy as the doctor   Champ Bear as a fireman  and the Care Bears themselves as Cubs  22  Over 70 million 13 inch  330 mm  plush Bears have been sold since the re launch  23  In addition  Lionsgate Home Entertainment and subsidiary FHE Pictures  in association with Nelvana  have made two direct to DVD computer animated films  Care Bears  Journey to Joke a lot in 2004 and The Care Bears  Big Wish Movie in 2005  Various other music CDs featuring the bears and video games were also produced  New versions of the various cousins were produced  with Proud Heart being changed back into a cat  in a different color and the same symbol she had in the 1980s franchise   However the revival of the line was not as successful as that of the bears  revival  citation needed  Two of the Cousins  Treat Heart Pig and Noble Heart Horse  were never produced as 13 inch plushes in the 2000s  and the Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 relaunch of the franchise  In 2007  American Greetings relaunched Care Bears again  first with a series of dolls  then a new movie  Care Bears  Oopsy Does It  and immediately before with a new TV series Care Bears  Adventures in Care a lot  The animation and artwork is completely different from the originals giving the Care Bears have smaller body structures and redesigned tummy symbols  which are now called belly badges  Also  instead of Nelvana  the film and the animated series are produced by SD Entertainment  As part of the franchise s 25th anniversary celebrations  the Bears were redesigned by the AG Properties illustration team  as was the logo of the franchise  The line consists of fifteen of the thirty nine bears  as seen in Care Bears  Oopsy Does It    Five of the bears were chosen to be the focus of the franchise  Oopsy Bear  Cheer Bear  Funshine Bear  Grumpy Bear and Share Bear  The other bears include Wish Bear  True Heart Bear  Bedtime Bear  Tenderheart Bear  Love a lot Bear  Harmony Bear  Amigo Bear  Surprise Bear  Superstar Bear  Best Friend Bear  Play A Lot Bear  Heartsong Bear  Good Luck Bear and Hopeful Heart Bear  24  although the remaining 24 bears are also stated to have a release in the near future according to Play Along Toys  25  Their new theme song is performed by former Letters to Cleo member  Kay Hanley  and the music video premiered on Fox and Nickelodeon  23  In August 2007  they appeared in 20th Century Fox s theatrical release of Care Bears  Oopsy Does It   26  This was followed by the television series from SD Entertainment  Adventures in Care a lot  The series premiered on CBS  KEWLopolis block on September 15  2007  The Care Bears franchise was rebooted upon the 2007 relaunch  Prior plot devices like the Cloudmobiles  Caring Meter  the Cloud Keeper  and even Care a lot castle were not referred to or mentioned as of the new series  In its place is the gathering tree  which is where the Care Bears now gather to meet or hold festivities  Also  the Care Bears have  up until the point of the first direct to DVD release for the new franchise  Grizzle ly Adventures   never had humans visit Care a lot  and a new villain named Grizzle  who seeks to conquer Care a lot and nothing else  was introduced  A February 2007 article in the Wall Street Journal states that in the new version   they live in a village  centered on a big tree  with no castle in sight   23  However  the Caring Meter made its return in Grizzle y Adventures  and the second direct to DVD release of the franchise  Ups and Downs  included a passing remark regarding the Forest of Feelings  In addition  Care a lot castle reappeared in certain scenes in the new game for the V Smile Baby Infant Development System  Play Day  In late 2009  American Greetings announced that the Care Bears will be re imagined with the launch of a new series   Care Power Team   This re imagining  while re using the Adventures in Care a lot designs  will now have the bears sport  enhanced belly badges  and see the bears taking on emergencies  dated info  Soon after  a trio of new films appeared  Care Bears  Share Bear Shines  Care Bears  The Giving Festival and Care Bears  To the Rescue  citation needed  In July 2011  the card company announced that a new television series  the franchise s first in CGI  is in development and will premiere in 2012  27   edit  Characters and universe This section may be written from a fan s point of view  rather than a neutral point of view  Please clean it up to conform to a higher standard of quality  and to make it neutral in tone   October 2010  Main article  List of Care Bear characters Grumpy Bear in the Nelvana episode  Home Sweet Homeless  Wish Bear in  The Care Bears Movie  Cheer Bear from the Nelvana Care Bears cartoon episode  The Lost Gift  The franchise consists mainly of the Care Bears themselves  as well as the later additions the Care Bear Cousins  Both of them live in the Kingdom of Caring  which is made up of Care a lot  the home of the Care Bears proper  and the Forest of Feelings  home to the Care Bear Cousins   In 1989  Carole Ashkinaze of The Atlanta Journal Constitution referred to them as  the whimsical  late 20th century descendents  sic  of what we used to know as guardian angels  furry  friendly  adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen  Running against a Care Bear is like  well  running against the Easter Bunny   28  Accompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies  who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions in caring  and the Birds  who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and watch over them  A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper  the portly gentleman who maintains Care a lot  He only appeared in some of the franchise s early publications and on the DiC produced TV episodes  The Cloud Keeper was created by Barbara Bleser for General Mills  CPG   citation needed  The ten original Care Bears consisted of Bedtime Bear  Birthday Bear  Cheer Bear  Friend Bear  Funshine Bear  Good Luck Bear  Grumpy Bear  Love a lot Bear  Tenderheart Bear  and Wish Bear  Later on  additional bears joined them  as well as the Cousins  For the new 2007 TV series  Care Bears  Adventures in Care a lot  five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the show  As seen on the Care Bears website  they are Share Bear  Cheer Bear  Funshine Bear  Grumpy Bear  and the new bear introduced in the movie  Oopsy Bear who would frequently make a mess of things  However  the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series  The unofficial role of leader of the bears  as of the new series  was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear  The cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series  Some elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of King Arthur  For example  the name of the main characters  residence  Care a lot  is a play on King Arthur s legendary Camelot castle  The Care Bear Family sits around a heart shaped table  similar to the Round Table used by Arthur and his knights  In addition  Sir Lancelot s name inspired that of Love a lot Bear  4  Throughout the movies and series  various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions  On the first two specials and DiC television series  they battled against Professor Coldheart  his assistant Frostbite  and occasionally Auntie Freeze  in Nelvana s version  they faced Wizard No Heart  his bumbling assistant Beastly and his ill tempered niece Shreeky  and minor villains such as Dr  Fright and Sour Sam  In the movies  they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in The Care Bears Movie  Dark Heart in Care Bears Movie II  A New Generation  The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim  amp  Dumb in The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland  and the Rat King and Evil Vizier in Care Bears Nutcracker Suite  Following the 2002 revival  Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the movie Care Bears  Journey to Joke a lot  while The Care Bears  Big Wish Movie broke from tradition in which it did not have a villain  For the 2007 revival  The new movie  Care Bears  Oopsy Does It  introduced new villains  Grizzle and WingNut  who persists into the new TV series  Care Bears  Adventures in Care a lot   edit  Magic spells The Care Bears  ultimate weapon is the  Care Bear Stare   in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective tummy symbols  These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target s heart  The Care Bear Stare has several different looks  One has a beam coming from the tummy being made up of several replicated images of the symbol  Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Bears and or Cousins are involved  A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well  The movies Care Bears  Journey to Joke a lot and The Care Bears  Big Wish Movie do not feature the Care Bear stare  but it does return in Oopsy Does It   In the new series  Care Bears Adventures in Care a lot  the stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates  but is initiated by simply rubbing the symbol  In the original animated specials and the DiC series  the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase  Care Bears   prepare to stare   while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase  Care Bears Countdown   During the movies and the DiC series  the Care Bear Cousins call their weapon the  Care Bear Cousin Call   In the DiC series  the call looks identical to the Care Bear Stare and is often performed at the same time without it being referred to as the call  In the first movie  the Cousins  excluding Swift Heart Rabbit  simply made whatever animal noise is common to their species since they did not have any tummy symbols  those are later given to them by the Care Bears at the end of the movie  In the second movie  the Call looks like a musical score which radiates from their tummy symbols  By the start of the Nelvana series  the Care Bear Cousin Call was no longer used and the Cousins simply performed the Care Bear Stare  Although commonly used on villains  the stare and call have been also been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves  It was occasionally used in the DiC series to cure Care Bears and humans who were placed under the effects of Professor Coldheart s uncaring magic  It also occurred once in Adventures in Care a lot  when it was used to temporarily cheer Grumpy up in the episode  Tell Tale Tummy   In addition to the Care Bear Stare  the Care Bears can also use their tummy symbols to summon other assistance such as heart shaped balloons  cloud cars  rainbow bridges and sending out a distress signal   edit  Caring Meter Shown prominently in most of the Care Bears movies and TV episodes made in the 80s  the Caring Meter is typically in the dead center of Care a lot inside the Care Bears  main meeting hall  This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care a lot and on Earth  In the 1980s movies cartoons  it is shown as an un numbered clock like meter  In The Care Bears  Big Wish Movie  the meter is shown with a raincloud  less caring  side and a rainbow  more caring  side  Ideally  the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side  Whenever the Bears see the meter drop towards the raincloud side  they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on  caring missions  to try to get more people to care or for the Bears themselves to do caring deeds  If the meter drops near zero  Care a lot will suffer disasters  such as thunderstorms  buildings and rainbows crumbling  earlier movies  or the bright colors of Care a lot gradually turning into black and white  later movies   If the meter were to reach all the way to zero  there is no caring anywhere   then Care a lot would be gone forever  Initially  no mention was made of the Caring Meter in Care Bears  Oopsy Does It  and the first season of Adventures in Care a lot  With the release of Grizzle y Adventures  the franchise s first direct to DVD release  the Caring Meter has returned  and the Care Bears have begun to interact with humans once again   edit  Merchandise A gummi bear box with the early 2000s style Care Bears Apart from toys  books  greeting cards and animated media  the Care Bears have been prominently featured in merchandising as well  some of which includes gummy bears  party goods  cell phone covers  interior decoration sets  stationery  school supplies  stickers  clothing  accessories and many other goods  21  During the early 2000s relaunch  the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards  Claire s  and Spencer s Gifts  21  several Care Bears plushies came with a video tape featuring one or two episodes of Nelvana s Care Bears series  citation needed  When the franchise was introduced in the 1980s  a mistake was made while manufacturing the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear  blue  and Wish Bear  aqua  to swap colors  As soon as the mistake was discovered  the two bears returned into their appropriate hues  Later  a children s story was written explaining why the bears had switched tints  4  In his 1986 essay  The Shortcake Strategy  Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as  highly specialized  toys   So specializd  are they  that instead of being complex individual personalities  they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality   he stated   Together  they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real life medical unit   29   edit  Books Main article  List of Care Bears books Many children s books have been based on  and have featured  the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins  Some early publications include  Meet the Care Bear Cousins   based on the first movie    Sweet Dreams for Sally    The Witch Down the Street    The Trouble with Timothy   and  A Sister for Sam   All of these titles were published by toy makers Parker Brothers  who was a licensee of the characters  Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s  14  As of 2006  Scholastic Press has published books based on the Bears  first two CGI films  as well as the new toys  while Modern Publishing publishes a small number of activity and baby books featuring the bears for the toddler market  Publications International and Penny Candy Press are also known to have published a few sound books featuring the bears in the past  In Playing by Different Rules  a 1988 book chronicling the Parker Brothers General Mills merger  Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker s Care Bears books  along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake   were  in fact  little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner s projects and who knew  by 1984  how long the likes of these characters would remain popular   30   edit  Comics Between November 1985 and January 1989  the Care Bears appeared in a 20 issue comic book series published by Marvel s Star Comics  the books were drawn by DC Comics artist Howard Post  31  The November 13  1986 issue featured a crossover with another American Greetings property  the Madballs  32  During the same period  over in Britain the Care Bears also appeared in a comic book series published by Marvel UK with artwork by Harry Papadopoulus  The pereodic comics eventually were then bundled into hardcover Care Bear Annual books  some of these UK comic book issues also had stories and art from the US comic series   edit  Music Main article  List of Care Bears albums At the height of the  80s Care Bears craze  Kid Stuff Records released several LPs based on the franchise  These included  Introducing the Care Bears    The Care Bears Care For You    Adventures in Care a lot    The Care Bears  Birthday Party   and  The Care Bears  Christmas   all from 1983   and 1986 s  Friends Make Everything Better   released as a promotion with Trianimic   They released the soundtrack albums for the first two movies  The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children s music during their prime  14  All of the albums from 1983  except for  Birthday Party   featured writing  production  and performance credits from Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan  who were the lead singers of The Turtles  also known as Flo  amp  Eddie  former Mothers of Invention from Frank Zappa s 1970 1972 period   The soundtrack album from The Care Bears Movie featured songs by Carole King and John Sebastian  who sang lead for The Lovin  Spoonful  In the midst of the 2002 revival  Madacy Kids released brand new Care Bear CDs  In 2004  Meet the Care Bears  Care Bears Holiday Hugs  Care Bears Christmas Eve  and the Care Bears  Journey to Joke a lot soundtrack album came out  as well as Care Bears Nighty Night the following year  The cover of both Care Bears Holiday Hugs and Care Bears Nighty Night advertises another two CDs  called Care Bears Share A Smile and Care Bears Let s Be Friends  As of April 2008  Both Share A Smile and Let s Be Friends have been folded into a single album and released as a digital download from www Amazon com and www Walmart com  however it is at this date not available as a physical CD  This has caused some difficulties to international fans as Amazon com and Walmart com will not sell digital downloads to fans who reside outside North America   edit  Video games A screenshot of the Care Bears Play Day game A Care Bears game was planned for the Atari 2600 in 1983  33  It was preliminarily completed and ready for beta testing  but the project was canceled before testing could begin  The beta prototype subsequently disappeared into obscurity and the only known existing prototype to date is an early alpha of the game  No other games featuring the bears were ever made during the period  In 2004  the Bears starred in their first official game  Care a lot Jamboree for the PC  A few months later  another game featuring the Care Bears for the PC  Let s Have a Ball  was released  In the same year they were featured in Care Bears  A Lesson in Caring for the V Smile educational game console  In 2005  they appeared in Catch a Star  also for the PC  34  and Care Bears  Care Quest  for the Game Boy Advance   35  Like the movies  no game for any systems was produced in 2006  and no new game was released in time for the 2007 relaunch  However  in August 2008  a new game  Care Bears Play Day  was released for the V Smile Baby Infant Development System  finally breaking the two years of silence for the franchise on the gaming front   edit  Smart toys This section s tone or style may not reflect the formal tone used on Wikipedia  Specific concerns may be found on the talk page  See Wikipedia s guide to writing better articles for suggestions   October 2010  Various interactive smart toys with the Bears have been introduced by Play Along since the 2002 revival  One of them  Care Bears Share A Story  was introduced by Play Along in July 2005  The toy is based upon the same basic idea of a Teddy Ruxpin  The head  mouth and eyes of the Care Bear move around as a cartridge plays fairy tales such as Goldilocks and the Three Care Bears  Jack and the Beanstalk and the Three Little Pigs  A hardback book version of the story comes with it so the parent and child can read along as the story plays  36  The toy ships with the story Goldilocks and the Three Bears  and additional story cartridges and books are to be purchased separately  Also  apparently only Share Bear was ever made as such a toy  Additionally  Care Bears Sing along pals were also introduced  These Care Bears plush toys sing three different songs while their heads rock back and forth and could synchronize wirelessly with other singing Care Bears of the series to sing together in a group  the effective wireless coverage being three feet  although the range might deteriorate due to environmental conditions and remaining battery strength   While initially introduced in a rather large variety of designs  at the moment only the Share Bear  Cheer Bear and Funshine Bear models are still being made  with the physical appearance of the bears redesigned to match the 25th anniversary looks  Another Care Bear smart toy is the Care Bears Tenderheart Smart Check up  The toy comes with an interactive plush Tenderheart bear and various toy medical equipment  The interactive plush has soft touch points throughout the body and can be fully played with without the toy medical equipment  Lastly  there are a line of Care Bears smart toys that would play hide and seek with the owner  The line  called Hide  N Seek Care Bears  comes in two designs  Secret Bear and Surprise Bear  Both bear comes with a wireless handpiece  To play the toy  a third party  usually the parent  must partake in the game by hiding the bear  The child then has to find the bear  with the handpiece occasionally providing hints on how close the child is to the bear through audible instructions   edit  Live
