the 7th most extensive  the 35th most populous  and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States  Over two thirds of Nevada s people live in the Las Vegas metropolitan area  6  which contains its three largest incorporated cities  7  Nevada s capital is Carson City  Nevada is largely desert and semiarid  with much of it located within the Great Basin  Areas south of the Great Basin are located within the Mojave Desert  while Lake Tahoe and the Sierra Nevada mountains lie on the western edge  Approximately 86  of the state s land is owned by the US government under various jurisdictions  both civilian and military  8  The name Nevada is derived from the nearby Sierra Nevada mountains  which means  snow capped mountain range  in Spanish  The land comprising the modern state was inhabited by Native Americans of the Paiute  Shoshone  and Washoe tribes prior to European contact  9  It was subsequently claimed by Spain as a part of Alta California until the Mexican War of Independence brought it under Mexican control  The United States gained the territory in 1848 following its victory in the Mexican American War and the area was eventually incorporated as part of Utah Territory in 1850  The discovery of silver at the Comstock Lode in 1859 led to a population boom that was an impetus to the creation of Nevada Territory out of western Utah Territory in 1861  Nevada became the 36th state on October 31  1864  10  The establishment of legalized gambling and lenient marriage and divorce proceedings in the 20th century transformed Nevada into a major tourist destination  11  12  The tourism industry remains Nevada s largest employer  13  with mining continuing to be a substantial sector of the economy as Nevada is the fourth largest producer of gold in the world  14  Nevada is officially known as the  Silver State  due to the importance of silver to its history and economy  It is also known as the  Battle Born State  because it achieved statehood during the Civil War and the  Sagebrush State  for the native eponymous plant  Contents 1 Etymology and pronunciation 2 Geography 2 1 Climate 2 2 Vegetation 2 3 Counties 3 History 3 1 Before 1861 3 2

Mountain Formation on top of Wheeler Peak  the highest peak entirely within Nevada The name  Nevada  comes from the Spanish Nevada  ne  a a   meaning  snow covered   15  after the Sierra Nevada   snow covered mountains   mountain range  Nevadans normally pronounce the second syllable of their state name using the     vowel of  bad   Many from outside the Western United States pronounce it with the      vowel of  father   n  v  d    Although the latter pronunciation is closer to the Spanish pronunciation  it is not the pronunciation preferred by locals  Notably  George W  Bush made this faux pas during his campaign for the 2004 US Presidential Election  Vindication later came when President Bush campaigned at the Reno Sparks Convention Center on June 18  2004  The president opened his talk by proclaiming that  It s great to be here in  n   v d     emphasizing the correct  a    the crowd roared its approval when he light heartedly noted   You didn t think I d get it right  did ya   16  Bush subsequently carried the state in the election  Assemblyman Harry Mortenson has proposed a bill to recognize the alternate  quasi Spanish  pronunciation of Nevada  17   edit  Geography Digitally colored elevation map of Nevada Further information  List of Nevada counties Nevada is almost entirely within the Basin and Range Province  and is broken up by many north south mountain ranges  Most of these ranges have endorheic valleys between them  which belies the image portrayed by the term Great Basin  Pinyon Juniper woodlands cover most of the mountain ranges in the northeastern and central portions of the state  Sunrise over Reno Basin and Range scenery near Rachel Much of the northern part of the state is within the Great Basin  a mild desert that experiences hot temperatures in the summer and cold temperatures in the winter  Occasionally  moisture from the Arizona Monsoon will cause summer thunderstorms  Pacific storms may blanket the area with snow  The state s highest recorded temperature was 125  F  52  C  in Laughlin  elevation of 605 feet   184 metres  on June 29  1994  18  The coldest recorded temperature was  52  F   47  C  set in San Jacinto in 1972  in the northeastern portion of the state  18  The Humboldt River crosses from east to west across the northern part of the state  draining into the Humboldt Sink near Lovelock  Several rivers drain from the Sierra Nevada eastward  including the Walker  Truckee and Carson rivers  Mountains west of Las Vegas in the Mojave Desert The mountain ranges  some of which have peaks above 13 000 feet  4 000 m   harbor lush forests high above desert plains  creating sky islands for endemic species  The valleys are often no lower in elevation than 3 000 feet  910 m   The southern third of the state  where the Las Vegas area is situated  is within the Mojave Desert  The area receives less rain in the winter but is closer to the Arizona Monsoon in the summer  The terrain is also lower  mostly below 4 000 feet  1 200 m   creating conditions for hot summer days and cool to chilly winter nights  due to temperature inversion   Fly Geyser Nevada and California have by far the longest diagonal line  in respect to the cardinal directions  as a state boundary at just over 400 miles  640 km   This line begins in Lake Tahoe nearly 4 miles  6 4 km  offshore  in the direction of the boundary   and continues to the Colorado River where the Nevada  California  and Arizona boundaries merge 12 miles  19 km  southwest of the Laughlin Bridge  The largest mountain range in the southern portion of the state is the Spring Mountain Range  just west of Las Vegas  The state s lowest point is along the Colorado River  south of Laughlin  Nevada has 172 mountain summits with 2 000 feet  610 m  of prominence  Nevada ranks second in the US  behind Alaska  and ahead of California  Montana  and Washington  This makes Nevada the  Most Mountainous  state in the country  at least by this measure   edit  Climate Nevada is the driest state in the US  19  It is made up of mostly desert and semiarid climate regions  daytime summer temperatures sometimes may rise as high as 125  F  52  C  and nighttime winter temperatures may reach as low as  50  F   46  C   While winters in northern Nevada are long and fairly cold  the winter season in the southern part of the state tends to be of short duration and mild  Most parts of Nevada receive scarce precipitation during the year  Most rain falls on the lee side  east and northeast slopes  of the Sierra Nevada  The average annual rainfall per year is about 7 inches  18 cm   the wettest parts get around 40 inches  100 cm   Nevada s highest recorded temperature is 125  F  52  C  at Laughlin on June 29  1994 and the lowest recorded temperature is  50  F   46  C  at San Jacinto on January 8  1937  Nevada s 125  F  52  C  reading is the third highest temperature recorded in the U S  just behind Arizona s 128  F  53  C  reading and California s 134  F  57  C  reading   edit  Vegetation Nevada contains six biotic zones  alpine  sub alpine   Ponderosa Pine    pinion juniper    sagebrush  and  creosotebush   20   edit  Counties Nevada is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties  Carson City is officially a consolidated municipality  however  for many purposes under state law it is considered to be a county  As of 1919 there were 17 counties in the state  ranging from 146 to 18 159 square miles  380 to 47 030 km2   In 1969 Ormsby County was dissolved and the consolidated municipality of Carson City was created by the Legislature in its place co terminous with the old boundaries of Ormsby County  Nevada Counties County name County seat Year founded 2000 population Percent of total Area  mi   Percent

first major U S  deposit of silver ore in Comstock Lode under Virginia City  Nevada in 1859   edit  Separation from Utah Territory See also  Nevada in the American Civil War Nevada territory in 1861 On March 2  1861  the Nevada Territory separated from the Utah Territory and adopted its current name  shortened from Sierra Nevada  Spanish for  snowy range    The 1861 southern boundary is commemorated by Nevada Historical Markers 57 and 58 in Lincoln and Nye counties   edit  Statehood See also  Nevada in the American Civil War Eight days prior to the presidential election of 1864  Nevada became the 36th state in the union  Statehood was rushed to the date of October 31 to help ensure Abraham Lincoln s reelection on November 8 and post Civil War Republican dominance in Congress  21  as Nevada s mining based economy tied it to the more industrialized Union  Nevada is notable for being one of only two states to significantly expand its borders after admission to the Union  clarification needed  Nevada achieved its current southern boundaries on May 5  1866  when it absorbed the portion of Pah Ute County in the Arizona Territory west of the Colorado River  essentially all of present day Nevada south of the 37th parallel  The transfer was prompted by the discovery of gold in the area  and it was thought by officials that Nevada would be better able to oversee the expected population boom  This area includes most of what is now Clark County  In 1868 another part of the western Utah Territory  whose population was seeking to avoid Mormon dominance  was added to Nevada in the eastern part of the state  setting the current eastern boundary  Mining shaped Nevada s economy for many years  see Silver mining in Nevada   When Mark Twain lived in Nevada during the period described in Roughing It  mining had led to an industry of speculation and immense wealth  However  both mining and population declined in the late 19th century  However  the rich silver strike at Tonopah in 1900  followed by strikes in Goldfield and Rhyolite  again put Nevada s population on an upward trend   edit  Gambling and labor Gambling erupted once more following a recession in the early 20th century  helping to build the city of Las Vegas Unregulated gambling was commonplace in the early Nevada mining towns but was outlawed in 1909 as part of a nation wide anti gambling crusade  Because of subsequent declines in mining output and the decline of the agricultural sector during the Great Depression  Nevada again legalized gambling on March 19  1931  with approval from the legislature  Gov  Fred Balzar s signature enacted the most liberal divorce laws in the country and open gambling  The reforms came just eight days after the federal government awarded the  49 million construction contract for Boulder Dam  now Hoover Dam   22   edit  Nuclear testing The Nevada Test Site  65 miles  105 km  northwest of the city of Las Vegas  was founded on January 11  1951  for the testing of nuclear weapons  The site is composed of approximately 1 350 square miles  3 500 km2  of desert and mountainous terrain  Nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site began with a 1 kilotonne of TNT  4 2 TJ  bomb dropped on Frenchman Flat on January 27  1951  The last atmospheric test was conducted on July 17  1962  and the underground testing of weapons continued until September 23  1992  The location is known for having the highest concentration of nuclear detonated weapons in the U S  Over 80  of the state s area is owned by the federal government  The primary reason for this is that homesteads were not permitted in large enough sizes to be viable in the arid conditions that prevail throughout desert Nevada  Instead  early settlers would homestead land surrounding a water source  and then graze livestock on the adjacent public land  which is useless for agriculture without access to water  this pattern of ranching still prevails    edit  Demographics This article needs

increase of 92 909  or 3 5   from the prior year and an increase of 516 550  or 20 8   since the year 2000  This includes a natural increase since the last census of 81 661 people  that is 170 451 births minus 88 790 deaths  and an increase due to net migration of 337 043 people into the state  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 66 098 people  and migration within the country produced a net increase of 270 945 people  According to the 2006 census estimate  Nevada is the eighth fastest growing state in the nation  24  The center of population of Nevada is located in southern Nye County  25  In this county  the unincorporated town of Pahrump  located 60 miles  97 km  west of Las Vegas on the California state line  has grown 26 times in size from 1980 to 2000  In the year 2006  the town may have over 50 000 permanent residents  Las Vegas was America s fastest growing city and metropolitan area from 1960 to 2000  but has grown from a gulch of 100 people in 1900 to 10 000 by 1950 to 100 000 by 1970 to have 2 5 million in the metropolitan area in 2010  Nevada Population Density Map From about the 1940s until 2003  Nevada was the fastest growing state in the US percentage wise  Between 1990 and 2000  Nevada s population increased 66 3   while the USA s population increased 13 1   Over two thirds of the population of the state live in the Clark County Las Vegas metropolitan area  Henderson and North Las Vegas are among the USA s top 20 fastest growing cities of over 100 000  The rural community of Mesquite located 65 miles  105 km  northeast of Las Vegas was an example of micropolitan growth in the 1990s and 2000s  Other desert towns like Mercury and Searchlight on the outskirts of Las Vegas have seen some growth as well  Large numbers of new residents in the state originate from California  which led some locals to feel that their state is being  Californicated   26   edit  Human diversity This article needs additional

sections of Las Vegas   the Meadows   and Reno can be found  Many current African American Nevadans are newly transplanted residents from California  the Midwest  or the East Coast  Since the California Gold Rush of the 1850s brought thousands of Chinese miners to Washoe county  Asian Americans lived in the state  They were followed by a few hundred of Japanese farm workers in the late 19th century  By the late 20th century  many immigrants from China  Japan  Korea  the Philippines and recently from India and Vietnam came to the Las Vegas metropolitan area  The city now has one of America s most prolific Asian American communities  with a mostly Chinese and Taiwanese area known as  Chinatown  west of I 15 on Spring Mountain Boulevard  and an  Asiatown  shopping mall for Asian customers located at Charleston Avenue and Paradise Boulevard  Filipino Americans form the largest Asian American group in the state  with a population of more than 113 000  They comprise 56 5  of the

refounded on sin  beginning with prizefighting and easy divorce a century ago and later extending to gaming and prostitution   said the August 21  2010 issue of The Economist  33  The Bureau of Economic Analysis 34  35  estimates that Nevada s total state product in 2010 was  126 billion  Resort areas such as Las Vegas  Reno  Lake Tahoe  and Laughlin attract visitors from around the nation and world  In FY08 the total of 266 casinos with gaming revenue over  1m for the year  brought in revenue of  12 billion in gaming revenue  and  13 billion in non gaming revenue  A review of gaming statistics can be found at Nevada gaming area  The state s Per capita personal income in 2009 was  38 578  ranking nineteenth in the nation  36  As of August 2011  the state s unemployment rate is the worst in the nation at 13 4   37  Its agricultural outputs are cattle  hay  alfalfa  dairy products  onions  and potatoes  Its industrial outputs are tourism  mining  machinery  printing and publishing  food processing  and electric equipment  In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas  mining and cattle ranching are the major economic activities  By value  gold is by far the most important mineral mined  In 2004  6 800 000 ounces  190 000 000 g  of gold worth  2 84 billion were mined in Nevada  and the state accounted for 8 7  of world gold production  see Gold mining in Nevada   Silver is a distant second  with 10 300 000 ounces  290 000 000 g  worth  69 million mined in 2004  see Silver mining in Nevada   38  Other minerals mined in Nevada include construction aggregates  copper  gypsum  diatomite and lithium  Despite its rich deposits  the cost of mining in Nevada is generally high  and output is very sensitive to world commodity prices  As of January 1  2006  there were an estimated 500 000 head of cattle and 70 000 head of sheep in Nevada  39  Most of these animals forage on rangeland in the summer  with supplemental feed in the winter  Calves are generally shipped to out of state feedlots in the fall to be fattened for market  Over 90  of Nevada s 484 000 acres  196 000 ha  of cropland is used to grow hay  mostly alfalfa  for livestock feed  Further information  Nevada locations by per capita income The state sales tax in Nevada is variable depending upon the county  The minimum statewide tax rate is 6 85   with five counties  Elko  Esmeralda  Eureka  Humboldt  and Mineral  charging this minimum amount  All other counties assess various option taxes  making the combined state county sales taxes rate in one county as high as 8 1   which is the amount charged in Clark County  Sales tax in the other major counties  Carson at 7 475   Washoe at 7 725   The minimum Nevada sales tax rate

15 or more rooms   The state is ranked just below California  Texas  Florida  and New York in total number of rooms  but those states have much larger populations  Nevada has one hotel room for every 14 residents  far above the national average of one hotel room per 67 residents  41  Prostitution is legal in parts of Nevada in licensed brothels  but only counties with populations under 400 000 residents have the option to legalize it  Although prostitution employs roughly 300 women as independent contractors  and not a major part of the Nevada economy  it is a very visible endeavor  Of the 14 counties that are permitted to legalize prostitution under state law  about 8 have chosen to legalize brothels  State law prohibits prostitution in Clark County  which contains Las Vegas   and Washoe County  which contains Reno   However  prostitution is legal in Storey County  which is part of the Reno Sparks metropolitan area   edit  Largest employers The largest employers in the state

California  serving Elko  Winnemucca  Sparks  and Reno  Amtrak Thruway Motorcoaches also provide connecting service from Las Vegas to trains at Needles  California  Los Angeles  and Bakersfield  California  and from Stateline  Nevada  to Sacramento  California  Las Vegas has had no passenger train service since Amtrak s Desert Wind was discontinued in 1997  although there have been a number of proposals to re introduce service to either Los Angeles or Southern California  The Union Pacific Railroad has some railroads in the north and in the south  Greyhound Lines provides some bus service  U S  Route 50  also known as  The Loneliest Road in America  Interstate 15 passes through the southern tip of the state  serving Las Vegas and other communities  I 215 and spur route I 515 also serve the Las Vegas metropolitan area  Interstate 80 crosses through the northern part of Nevada  roughly following the path of the Humboldt River from Utah in the east and passing westward through Reno and into California  It has a spur route  I 580  Nevada also is served by several federal highways  US 6  US 50  US 93  US 95 and US 395  There are also 189 Nevada state highways  Nevada is one of a few states in the U S  that does not have a continuous interstate highway linking its two major population centers  Even the non interstate federal highways aren t contiguous between the Las Vegas and Reno areas  The state is one of just a few in the country to allow semi trailer trucks with three trailers what might be called a  road train  in Australia  But American versions are usually smaller  in part because they must ascend and descend some fairly steep mountain passes  RTC Transit is the public transit system in the Las Vegas metropolitan area  The agency is the largest transit agency in the state and operates a network of bus service across the Las Vegas Valley  including the use of The Deuce  double decker buses  on the Las Vegas Strip and several outlying routes  RTC RIDE operates a system of local transit bus service throughout the Reno Sparks metropolitan area  Other transit systems in the state include Carson City s JAC  Most other counties in the state do not have public transportation at all  Additionally  a four mile  6 km  monorail system provides public transportation in the Las Vegas area  The Las Vegas Monorail line services several casino properties and the Las Vegas Convention Center on the east side of the Las Vegas Strip  running near Paradise Road  with a possible future extension to McCarran International Airport  Several hotels also run their own monorail lines between each other  which are typically several blocks in length  McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas is the busiest airport serving Nevada  The Reno Tahoe International Airport  formerly known as the Reno Cannon International Airport  is the other major airport in the state   edit  Law and government  edit  Government A view of the Nevada State Legislative Building in Carson City Main article  Government of Nevada The government of Nevada is defined under the Constitution of Nevada as a democratic republic with three branches of government  the executive branch consisting of the Governor of Nevada and their cabinet along with the other elected constitutional officers  the legislative branch consisting of the Nevada Legislature which includes the Assembly and the Senate  and the judicial branch consisting of the Supreme Court of Nevada and lower courts  The Governor of Nevada is the chief magistrate of Nevada  44  the head of the executive department of the state s government  44  and the commander in chief of the state s military forces  45  The current Governor of Nevada is Brian Sandoval  a Republican  The Nevada Legislature is a bicameral body divided into an Assembly and Senate  Members of the Assembly serve for 2 years  and members of the Senate serve for 4 years  Both houses of the Nevada Legislature will be impacted by term limits starting in 2010  as Senators and Assemblymen women will be limited to a maximum of 12 years service in each house  by appointment or election which is a lifetime limit  a provision of the constitution which was recently upheld by the Supreme Court of Nevada in a unanimous decision  Each session of the Legislature meets for a constitutionally mandated 120 days in every odd numbered year  or longer if the Governor calls a special session  The Supreme Court of Nevada is the state supreme court  Original jurisdiction is divided between the District Courts  with general jurisdiction   and Justice Courts and Municipal Courts  both of limited jurisdiction   Incorporated towns in Nevada  known as cities  are given the authority to legislate anything not prohibited by law  A recent movement has begun to permit home rule in incorporated Nevada cities to give them more flexibility and fewer restrictions from the Legislature  Town Boards for unincorporated towns are limited local governments created by either the local county commission  or by referendum  and form a purely advisory role and in no way diminish the responsibilities of the county commission that creates them   edit  State agencies State departments and agencies  Attorney General Department of Business  amp  Industry Department of Conservation  amp  Natural Resources Consumer Health Assistance

 as the difficulties of living in a  barren desert  began to outweigh the lure of silver for many early settlers  Historian Lawrence Friedman has explained what happened next   Nevada  in a burst of ingenuity  built an economy by exploiting its sovereignty  Its strategy was to legalize all sorts of things that were illegal in California     after easy divorce came easy marriage and casino gaming  Even prostitution is legal in Nevada  in any county that decides to allow it  Quite a few of them do   47  With the advent of air conditioning for summertime use and Southern Nevada s mild winters  the fortunes of the state began to turn around  as it did for Arizona  making these two states the fastest growing in the Union   edit  Prostitution See also  Prostitution in Nevada Nevada is the only state where prostitution is legal  under the form of licensed brothels   Prostitution is specifically illegal by state law in the state s larger jurisdictions  which include Clark County  which contains Las Vegas   Washoe County  which contains Reno   and the independent city of Carson City  Otherwise  it is legal in those counties which specifically vote to permit it   edit  Divorce Nevada s early reputation as a  divorce haven  arose from the fact that  prior to the no fault divorce revolution in the 1970s  divorces were quite difficult to obtain in the United States  Already having legalized gaming and prostitution  Nevada continued the trend of boosting its profile by adopting one of the most liberal divorce statutes in the nation  This resulted in Williams v  North Carolina  317 U S  287  1942   in which the U S  Supreme Court ruled that North Carolina had to give  full faith and credit  to a Nevada divorce  Nevada s divorce rate tops the national average  48   edit  Taxes Nevada s tax laws also draw new residents and businesses to the state  Nevada has no personal income tax or corporate income tax  49  Since Nevada does not collect income data it cannot share such information with the federal government  the IRS  50  Nevada s state sales tax rate is 6 85 percent  Counties may impose additional rates via voter approval or through approval of the Legislature  therefore  the applicable sales tax will vary by county from 6 85 percent to 8 1 percent in Clark County  Clark County  which includes Las Vegas  imposes four separate county option taxes in addition to the statewide rate   0 25 percent for flood control  0 50 percent for mass transit  0 2 sales tax rate is 7 725 percent  due to county option rates for flood control  the ReTRAC train trench project  mass transit  and an additional county rate approved under the Local Government Tax Act of 1991  51  The lodging tax rate in unincorporated Clark County  which includes the Las Vegas Strip  is 12   Within the boundaries of the cities of Las Vegas and Henderson  the lodging tax rate is 13   Corporations such as Apple Inc  allegedly have set up investment companies and funds in Nevada to avoid paying taxes  52   edit  Incorporation Nevada also provides friendly environment for the formation of corporations  and many  especially California  businesspeople have incorporated their businesses in Nevada to take advantage of the benefits of the Nevada statute  Nevada corporations offer great flexibility to the Board of Directors and simplify or avoid many of the rules that are cumbersome to business managers in some other states  In addition  Nevada has no franchise tax   edit  Financial institutions Similarly  many U S  states have usury laws limiting the amount of interest a lender can charge  but federal law allows corporations to  import  these laws from their home state   edit  Drugs and alcohol Non alcohol drug laws are a notable exception to Nevada s otherwise libertarian principles  It is notable for having the harshest penalties for drug offenders in the country  Nevada remains the only state to still use mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines for marijuana possession  However  it is now a misdemeanor for possession of less than one ounce but only for persons age 21 and older  In 2006  voters in Nevada defeated attempts to allow possession of 1 ounce of marijuana  for personal use  without being criminally prosecuted   55  against legalization  45  in favor of legalization   However  Nevada is one of the states that allows for use of marijuana for medical reasons  though this remains illegal under federal law   Nevada has very liberal alcohol laws  Bars are permitted to remain open 24 hours  with no  last call   Liquor stores  convenience stores and supermarkets may also sell alcohol 24 hours per day  and may sell beer  wine and spirits   edit  Smoking Nevada voters enacted a smoking ban   the Nevada Clean Indoor Air Act   in November 2006 that became effective on December 8  2006  It outlaws smoking in most workplaces and public places  Smoking is permitted in bars  but only if the bar serves no food  or the bar is inside a larger casino  Smoking is also permitted in casinos  hotel rooms  tobacco shops  and brothels  53  However  some businesses do not obey this law and the government tends not to enforce it  54  Yet  in one case  they did prosecute an establishment called  Bilbo s   As of 2008  the trial was still pending  55   edit  Crime Nevada has been ranked as the most dangerous state in the U S  for five years in a row  just ahead of Louisiana 56  57  In 2006  the crime rate in Nevada was approximately 24  higher than the national average rate  Property crimes accounted for approximately 84 6  of the crime rate in Nevada which was 21  higher than the national rate  The remaining 20 3  were violent crimes and were approximately 45  higher than other states  58  In 2008  Nevada had the third highest murder rate  and the highest rate of robbery and motor vehicle theft  56   edit  Politics Presidential elections results Year Republican Democratic 2008 42 65  412 827 55 15  533 736 2004 50

noticeable divide between politics of northern and southern Nevada  The north has long maintained control of key positions in state government  even while the population of southern Nevada is larger than the rest of the state combined  The north sees the high population south becoming more influential and perhaps commanding majority rule  The south sees the north as the  old guard  trying to rule as an oligarchy  This has fostered some resentment  however  due to a term limit amendment passed by Nevada voters in 1994  and again in 1996  some of the north s hold over key positions will soon be forfeited to the south  leaving Northern Nevada with less power  Clark and Washoe counties home to Las Vegas and Reno  respectively have long dominated the state s politics  Between them  they cast 87 percent of Nevada s vote  and elect a substantial majority of the state legislature  The great majority of the state s elected officials are either from Las Vegas or Reno   edit  National politics Nevada has voted for the winner in every presidential election since 1912  except in 1976 when it voted for Gerald Ford over Jimmy Carter  This gives the state status as a political bellwether  Nevada supported Democrat Bill Clinton in the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections  Republican George W  Bush won in 2000 and 2004  and Democrat Barack Obama won the state in 2008  The state s U S  Senators are Democrat Harry Reid  the Senate Majority Leader  and Republican Dean Heller  The Governorship is held by Brian Sandoval  a Republican from Reno  Further information  Political party strength in

basketball program  which experienced its height of supremacy in the late 1980s and early 1990s  Coached by Jerry Tarkanian  the Runnin  Rebels became one of the most elite programs in the country  In 1990  UNLV won the Men s Division I Championship by defeating Duke 103 73  which set tournament records for most points scored by a team and largest margin of victory in the national title game  In 1991  UNLV finished the regular season undefeated  Forward Larry Johnson won several awards  including the Naismith Award  UNLV reached the Final Four yet again  but lost their national semifinal

Datum of 1988    The distinction of highest point in Nevada goes to the summit of Boundary Peak  so named because it is very near the Nevada California border  at the northern terminus of the White Mountains  However  Boundary Peak can be considered a subsidiary summit of Montgomery Peak  whose summit is in California  since the topographic prominence of Boundary Peak is only 253 feet  77 m   which falls under the often used 300 foot  91 m  cutoff for an independent peak  Also  Boundary Peak is less than 1 mile  1 6 km  away from its higher neighbor  Hence Boundary Peak can be described as not being wholly within Nevada  By contrast  the prominence of Wheeler Peak  13 063 feet  3 982 m   is quite large and in fact it is the twelfth largest in the contiguous United States  Wheeler Peak is the highest point in a radius of more than 200 square miles  520 km2  and is entirely within the state of Nevada     Table 2  Annual Estimates of the Population of Combined Statistical Areas  April
