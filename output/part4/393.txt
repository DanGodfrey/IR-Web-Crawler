of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide s list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002  2  He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character 3  and is the fifth most published comic book character in the world after Batman  Superman  Spider Man  and Wolverine  4  Donald Duck rose to fame with his comedic roles in animated cartoons  He first appeared in The Wise Little Hen  1934   but it was his second appearance in Orphan s Benefit which introduced him as a temperamental comic foil to Mickey Mouse  Throughout the next two decades Donald appeared in over 150 theatrical films  several of which were recognized at the Academy Awards  In the 1930s he typically appeared as part of a comic trio with Mickey and Goofy  He was given his own film series in 1937  starting with Don Donald  These films introduced Donald s girlfriend Daisy Duck and sometimes featured his three nephews Huey  Dewey  and Louie  After the 1956 film Chips Ahoy  Donald appeared primarily in educational films before eventually returning to theatrical animation in 1983 with Mickey s Christmas Carol  His most recent appearance in a theatrical film was 1999 s Fantasia 2000  Donald has also appeared in direct to video features such as Mickey s Once Upon a Christmas  1999  and The Three Musketeers  2004  as well as television programs such as DuckTales  1987 1990   Quack Pack  1996   and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse  2006 present   5  Beyond animation Donald is primarily known for his appearances in comics  both in newspaper strips and comic books  Donald was most famously drawn by Al Taliaferro  Carl Barks  and Don Rosa  Barks in particular is credited for greatly expanding the  duck universe   the world in which Donald lives  and creating many additional characters such as Donald s maternal uncle Scrooge McDuck  Today Donald is a very popular character in Europe  particularly in Scandinavian countries where his weekly magazine has remained the most popular comics publication for over 50 years  Disney comics  fandom is sometimes referred to as  Donaldism   a term which originated in Norway   Norwegian  Donaldisme  He has also made video game appearances  such as QuackShot  1991   Goin  Quackers  2000   and Kingdom Hearts  2002  6  7  Contents 1 Characterization 1 1 Personality 1 2 Phrases 1 3 Health 1 4 Rivalry with Mickey Mouse 1 5

temper  edit  Personality Donald s dominant personality trait is his short temper and  in contrast  his positive looks on life  Many Donald shorts start with Donald in a happy mood  without a care in the world  until something comes and spoils his day  His anger is a great cause of suffering in the duck s life  and he has on multiple occasions got in over his head and lost competitions because of it  There are times when he fights to keep his temper  and he has succeeded a few times  but he always returns to his well known  aggressive self at the end of the day  Donald s aggressive nature is a double edged sword however  and while it at times is a hindrance and even a handicap for him  it has also helped him in times of need  When faced against a threat of some kind  Donald may get frightened and even intimidated  mostly by Pete   but rather than getting scared  he gets mad and has taken up fights with ghosts  sharks  mountain goats and even the forces of nature  And  more often than not  Donald has come out on top  Donald can at times be a bit of a bully and a tease  especially against his nephews and Chip  n Dale  As animator Fred Spencer once wrote  The Duck gets a big kick out of imposing on other people or annoying them  but he immediately loses his temper when the tables are turned  In other words  he can dish it out  but he can t take it  8  However  there is seldom any malice in Donald s pranks  He is never out to hurt anyone  and if he ever goes too far in his pranks he is always very regretful  In Truant Officer Donald  for example  when he is tricked into believing he accidentally killed Huey  Dewey and Louie  he shows great remorse  blaming himself and willingly takes a kick handed out by one of the  angel  nephews  That is  of course  until he realizes he has been played a sap and directly loses his temper  Donald has also been shown to be a bit of a show off  He likes to brag  especially when he is very skilled at something  This has a tendency to get him into trouble  however  as he also tends to get in over his head  Still  Donald has proven that he is a Jack of all Trades and is  amongst other things  a good fisher and hockey player  Among his personality traits is his stubbornness and commitment  Even though Donald at times can be lazy  and he has stated many times that his favorite place is in the hammock  once he has committed to something he goes in for it 100   sometimes going to extreme measures to reach his goal   edit  Phrases Donald has a few memorable phrases that he occasionally comes out with in given situations   What s the Big Idea    is a common one  which Donald usually says when stumbling across other characters in the midst of planning some sort of retaliation or prank  and sometimes when certain things do not go as planned or do not work properly   Aw Phooey   is another memorable saying Donald makes  usually after giving up on a particular action or event  Another popular phrase Donald says  in particular to Daisy  is   Hiya  toots     Oh boy  oh boy  oh boy  is yet another common phrase Donald uses  usually when he s very excited about something   edit  Health A running gag in the Donald Duck comics is about his physical condition  Usually  some character close to Donald believes that because of his laziness  Donald needs to do some exercise  which annoys Donald  But  in spite of his apparent lazy condition  Donald proves that he is physically strong  as evidenced in one of his shorts  Sea Scouts  where Donald travels in a boat with his nephews  but a shark attacks the boat and Donald  after several misadventures  finally defeats the shark with a single punch   edit  Rivalry with Mickey Mouse Throughout his career  Donald has shown that he s jealous of Mickey and wants his job as Disney s greatest star  similar to the Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck rivalry  In most Disney theatrical cartoons  Mickey and Donald are shown as partners and have little to no rivalry  However by the time The Mickey Mouse Club aired on television  after Bugs vs  Daffy cartoons such as Rabbit Fire   it was shown that Donald always wanted the spotlight  One animated short that rivaled the famous Mickey Mouse March song was showing Huey  Dewey  and Louie as Boy Scouts and Donald as their Scoutmaster at a cliff near a remote forest and Donald leads them in a song mirroring the Mouseketeers theme  D O N A L D D U C K   Donald Duck   The rivalry would cause Donald some problems  in a 1988 TV special  where Mickey is cursed by a sorcerer to become unnoticed  the world believes Mickey to be kidnapped  Donald Duck is then arrested for the kidnapping of Mickey  as he is considered to be the chief suspect  due to their rivalry  However  Donald did later get the charges dismissed  due to lack of evidence  Walt Disney  in his Wonderful World of Color  would sometimes make reference to the rivalry  Walt  one time  had presented Donald with a gigantic birthday cake and commented how it was  even bigger than Mickey s   which pleased Donald  The clip was rebroadcast in November 1984 during a TV special honoring Donald s 50th birthday  with Dick Van Dyke substituting for Walt  The rivalry between Mickey and Donald has also been shown in Disney s House of Mouse  It was shown that Donald wanted to be the Club s founder and wanted to change the name from House of Mouse to House of Duck  However  in later episodes  Donald accepted that Mickey was the founder and worked with Mickey as a partner to make the club profitable  Mickey Mouse has failed to realize how much Donald does not like him at times  and always counts him as one of his best friends  Despite the rivalry  Donald seems to be an honest friend of Mickey s  and will be faithful to him in tough situations  such as working with Mickey and Goofy as a team akin to The Three Musketeers  In the Kingdom Hearts games  Donald is quite loyal to Mickey  even briefly leaving Sora to follow King Mickey s orders  The rivalry between Mickey and Donald is not unlike that of Warner Bros  characters Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck  and many animation fans have commented on the parallels present among the four characters  However  the main difference is that Bugs is aware of the fact that Daffy does not always like him  and takes advantage of it by playing tricks on the duck  In Who Framed Roger Rabbit Donald and Daffy have a dueling banjos contest with Pianos while the cartoon short Duck Amuck has Bugs making Daffy s cartoon life a living hell   edit  Nemesis Donald has enemies  as worse than Mickey Mouse  Chip and Dale  Humphrey the Bear  Spike The Bee  Mountain Lion Louie  Bootle Beetle  Witch Hazel  in Trick and Treat   Aracuan Bird and Baby Shelby  in Mickey Mouse Works   In the comics  are the Beagle Boys  Magica De Spell and Mr  Jones  In the videogame Donald Duck  Goin  Quackers  he saves Daisy from Merlock   edit  Donald in animation  edit  Early appearances For more details on this topic  see Donald Duck filmography  Donald Duck as he first appeared in The Wise Little Hen According to Leonard Maltin in his introduction to The Chronological Donald   Volume 1  Donald was created by Walt Disney when he heard Clarence Nash doing his  duck  voice while reciting  Mary had a little lamb   Mickey Mouse had lost some of his edge since becoming a role model for children and Disney wanted a character that could portray some of the more negative character traits he could no longer bestow on Mickey  Donald Duck first appeared in the 1934 cartoon The Wise Little Hen which was part of the Silly Symphonies series of theatrical cartoon shorts  The film s release date of June 9 is officially recognized by the Walt Disney Company as Donald s birthday 9  despite a couple in universe contradictions  10  Donald s appearance in the cartoon  as created by animator Dick Lundy  is similar to his modern look the feather and beak colors are the same  as is the blue sailor shirt and hat but his features are more elongated  his body plumper  and his feet smaller  Donald s personality is not developed either  in the short  he only fills the role of the unhelpful friend from the original story  Burt Gillett  director of The Wise Little Hen  citation needed  brought Donald back in his Mickey Mouse cartoon  Orphan s Benefit on August 11  1934  Donald is one of a number of characters who are giving performances in a benefit for Mickey s Orphans  Donald s act is to recite the poems Mary Had a Little Lamb and Little Boy Blue  but every time he tries  the mischievous orphans heckle him  leading the duck to fly into a squawking fit of anger  This explosive personality would remain with Donald for decades to come  Donald continued to be a hit with audiences  The character began appearing regularly in most Mickey Mouse cartoons  Cartoons from this period  such as the 1935 cartoon The Band Concert in which Donald repeatedly disrupts the Mickey Mouse Orchestra s rendition of The William Tell Overture by playing Turkey in the Straw are regularly hailed by critics as exemplary films and classics of animation  Animator Ben Sharpsteen also minted the classic Mickey  Donald  and Goofy comedy in 1935  with the cartoon Mickey s Service Station  In 1936  Donald was redesigned to be a bit fuller  rounder  and cuter  He also began starring in solo cartoons  the first of which was the January 9  1937 Ben Sharpsteen cartoon  Don Donald  This short also introduced a love interest of Donald s  Donna Duck  who evolved into Daisy Duck  11  Donald s nephews  Huey  Dewey and Louie  would make their first animated appearance a year later in the April 15  1938 film  Donald s Nephews  directed by Jack King  they had been earlier introduced in the Donald Duck comic strip by Al Taliaferro  see below   By 1938  at most  polls showed that Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse  12  Disney could  however  help Mickey regain popularity by redesigning him  giving him his most appealing design as production for the Fantasia segment  The Sorcerer s Apprentice  began in 1938  After his early appearances  he went on to become part of the famed trio Mickey  Donald  and Goofy  He appeared in many of the cartoons  including Moving Day   edit  Wartime Donald Donald worked in a Nazi factory in Der Fuehrer s Face  1943  Several of Donald s shorts during the war were propaganda films  most notably Der Fuehrer s Face  released on January 1  1943  In it  Donald plays a worker in an artillery factory in  Nutzi Land   Nazi Germany   He struggles with long working hours  very small food rations  and having to salute every time he sees a picture of the F hrer  Adolf Hitler   These pictures appear in many places  such as on the assembly line in which he is screwing in the detonators of various sizes of shells  In the end he becomes little more than a small part in a faceless machine with no choice but to obey until he falls  suffering a nervous breakdown  Then Donald wakes up to find that his experience was in fact a dream  At the end of the short Donald looks to the Statue of Liberty and the American flag with renewed appreciation  Der Fuehrer s Face won the 1942 Academy Award for Animated Short Film  Der Fuehrer s Face was also the first of two animated short films to be set during the War to win an Oscar  the other being Tom and Jerry s short film  The Yankee Doodle Mouse  Other notable shorts from this period include the Army shorts  seven films that follow Donald s life in the US Army from his drafting to his life in basic training under sergeant Pete to his first actual mission as a commando having to sabotage a Japanese air base  Titles in the series include  Donald Gets Drafted  May 1  1942  The Vanishing Private  September 25  1942  Sky Trooper  November 8  1942  Fall Out Fall In  April 23  1943  The Old Army Game  November 5  1943  Commando Duck  June 2  1944  Donald Gets Drafted also featured Donald having a physical examination before joining the army  According to it Donald has flat feet and is unable to distinguish between the colors green and blue  which is a type of color blindness  Also in this cartoon sergeant Pete comments on Donald s lack of discipline  Donald on the nose of a P 51 Mustang Thanks to these films  Donald graced the nose artwork of virtually every type of WWII Allied combat aircraft  from the L 4 Grasshopper to the B 29 Superfortress  citation needed  Donald also appears as a mascot such as in the Army Air Corps 309th Fighter Squadron 13  and the U S  Coast Guard Auxiliary  which showed Donald as a fierce looking pirate ready to defend the American coast from invaders  14  Donald also appeared as a mascot emblem for  415th Fighter Squadron  438th Fighter Squadron  479th Bombardment Squadron  531st Bombardment Squadron  He also appears as the mascot for the United States Air Force 319 Aircraft Maintenance Unit at Luke Air Force Base  He is seen wearing an old style pilots uniform with a board with a nail in it in one hand and a lightning bolt in the other hand  During World War II  Disney cartoons were not allowed to be imported into Occupied Europe owing to their propagandistic content  Since this cost Disney a lot of money  he decided to create a new audience for his films in South America  He decided to make a trip through various Latin American countries with his assistants  and use their experiences and impressions to create two feature length animation films  The first was Saludos Amigos  which consisted of four short segments  two of them with Donald Duck  In the first  he meets his parrot pal Jose Carioca  The second film was The Three Caballeros  in which he meets his rooster friend Panchito   edit  Post war animation Many of Donald s films made after the war recast the duck as the brunt of some other character s pestering  Donald is repeatedly attacked  harassed  and ridiculed by his nephews  by the chipmunks Chip  n Dale  or by other characters such as Humphrey the Bear  Spike the Bee  Bootle Beetle  the Aracuan Bird  Louie the Mountain Lion  or a colony of ants  In effect  the Disney artists had reversed the classic screwball scenario perfected by Walter Lantz and others in which the main character is the instigator of these harassing behaviors  rather than the butt of them  The post war Donald also starred in educational films  such as Donald in Mathmagic Land and How to Have an Accident at Work  both 1959   and made cameos in various Disney projects  such as The Reluctant Dragon  1941  and the Disneyland television show  1959   For this latter show  Donald s uncle Ludwig von Drake was created in 1961  Clarence Nash voiced Donald for the last time in Mickey s Christmas Carol  1983   making Donald the only character in the film to be voiced by his original actor  Since Nash s death in 1985  Donald s voice has been provided by Tony Anselmo  who was mentored by Nash  Anselmo s voice is heard for the first time in Who Framed Roger Rabbit   In this movie  Donald has a piano duel scene with the Warner Brothers duck Daffy Duck voiced by Mel Blanc and wins the duel with a cartoon cannon  Many fans call this confrontation between the 2 ducks as one of the greatest duels in animation history  Donald has since appeared in a lot of different television shows and  short  animated movies  He played roles in Mickey s Christmas Carol and The Prince and the Pauper and made a cameo appearance in A Goofy Movie NOTE During a Darkwing Duck episode a star is scorned and everyone thinks Darkwing is Donald  He later dresses up like Donald to sneak in with Goslyn dressed as Huey Donald had a rather small part in the animated television series DuckTales  There  Donald joins the Navy  and leaves his nephews Huey  Dewey  and Louie with their Uncle Scrooge  who then has to take care of them  Donald s role in the overall series was fairly limited  as he only ended up appearing in a handful of episodes  Some of the stories in the series were loosely based on the comics by Carl Barks  Donald made some cameo appearances in Bonkers  before getting his own television show Quack Pack  This series featured a modernized Duck family  Donald was no longer wearing his sailor suit and hat  but a Hawaiian shirt  Huey  Dewey  and Louie now are teenagers  with distinct clothing  voices  and personalities  Daisy Duck has lost her pink dress and bow and has a new hairdo  Oddly enough  no other family members  besides Ludwig von Drake  appear in Quack Pack  and all other Duckburg citizens are humans  and not dogs  He made a comeback as the star of the  Noah s Ark  segment of Fantasia 2000  as first mate to Noah  Donald musters the animals to the Ark and attempts to control them  He tragically believes that Daisy has been lost  while she believes the same of him  but they are reunited at the end  All this to Edward Elgar s Pomp and Circumstance Marches 1 4  In an alternate opening for the 2005 Disney film Chicken Little  Donald would have made a cameo appearance as  Ducky Lucky   This scene can be found on the Chicken Little DVD  Donald in Mickey Mouse Clubhouse  Donald also played an important role in Mickey Mouse Works and House of Mouse  In the latter show  he is the co owner of Mickey s night club  He is in the TV show Mickey Mouse Clubhouse as well   edit  Donald in comics Main article  Donald Duck in comics While Donald s cartoons enjoy vast popularity in the United States and around the world  his weekly and monthly comic books enjoy their greatest popularity in many European countries  especially Sweden  Denmark  Norway  Finland and Iceland  but also Germany  Italy  the Netherlands  and Greece  Most of them are produced and published by the Italian branch of the Walt Disney Company in Italy and by Egmont in Denmark  Norway  Finland and Sweden  In Germany  the comics are published by Ehapa which has since become part of the Egmont empire  Donald comics are also being produced in The Netherlands and France  Donald also has been appeared in Japanese comics published by Kodansha and Tokyopop  According to the INDUCKS  which is a database about Disney comics worldwide  American  Italian and Danish stories have been reprinted in the following countries  In most of them  publications still continue  Australia  Austria  Argentina  Belgium  Brazil  Bulgaria  Canada  the People s Republic of China  Colombia  Croatia  Czech Republic  Denmark  Faroe Islands   Egypt  Estonia  Finland  France  Germany  Greece  Guyana  Hungary  Iceland  India  Indonesia  Israel  Italy  Japan  Latvia  Lithuania  Mexico  the Netherlands  Norway  Philippines  Poland  Portugal  Romania  Russia  Saudi Arabia  Slovakia  Spain  Sweden  Thailand  Turkey  the United Kingdom  the United States  and the former Yugoslavia   edit  Early development Though a 1931 Disney publication called Mickey Mouse Annual mentioned a character named Donald Duck  the character s first appearance in comic strip format was a newspaper cartoon that was based on the short The Wise Little Hen and published in 1934  For the next few years  Donald made a few more appearances in Disney themed strips  and by 1936  he had grown to be one of the most popular characters in the Silly Symphonies comic strip  Ted Osborne was the primary writer of these strips  with Al Taliaferro as his artist  Osborne and Taliaferro also introduced several members of Donald s supporting cast  including his nephews  Huey  Dewey  and Louie  In 1937  an Italian publisher named Mondadori created the first Donald Duck story intended specifically for comic books  The eighteen page story  written by Federico Pedrocchi  is the first to feature Donald as an adventurer rather than simply a comedic character  Fleetway in England also began publishing comic book stories featuring the duck   edit  Developments under Taliaferro A daily Donald Duck comic strip drawn by Taliaferro and written by Bob Karp began running in the United States on February 2  1938  the Sunday strip began the following year  Taliaferro and Karp created an even larger cast of characters for Donald s world  He got a new St  Bernard named Bolivar  and his family grew to include cousin Gus Goose and grandmother Elvira Coot  Donald s new rival girlfriends were Donna and Daisy Duck  Taliaferro also gave Donald his very own automobile  a 1934 Belchfire Runabout  in a 1938 story   edit  Developments under Barks Carl Barks  1994  In 1942  Western Publishing began creating original comic book stories about Donald and other Disney characters  Bob Karp worked on the earliest of these  a story called  Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold   The new publisher meant new illustrators  however  Carl Barks and Jack Hannah  Barks would later repeat the treasure hunting theme in many more stories  Barks soon took over the major development of the comic book version of the duck as both writer and illustrator  Under his pen  the comic version of Donald diverged even further from his animated counterpart  becoming more adventurous  less temperamental  and more eloquent  Pete was the only other major character from the Mickey Mouse comic strip to feature in Barks  new Donald Duck universe  Barks placed Donald in the city of Duckburg  which he populated with a host of supporting players  including Neighbour Jones  1944   Uncle Scrooge McDuck  1947   Gladstone Gander  1948   the Beagle Boys  1951   Gyro Gearloose  1952   April  May and June  1953   Flintheart Glomgold  1956   Magica de Spell  1961   and John D  Rockerduck  1961   Many of Taliaferro s characters made the move to Barks  world as well  including Huey  Dewey  and Louie  Barks placed Donald in both domestic and adventure scenarios  and Uncle Scrooge became one of his favorite characters to pair up with Donald  Scrooge s popularity grew  and by 1952  the character had a comic book of his own  At this point  Barks concentrated his major efforts on the Scrooge stories  and Donald s appearances became more focused on comedy or he was recast as Scrooge s reluctant helper  following his rich uncle around the globe   edit  Further developments Dozens of writers continued to utilize Donald in their stories around the world  For example the Disney Studio artists  who made comics directly for the European market  Two of them  Dick Kinney  1917 1985  and Al Hubbard  1915 1984  created Donald s cousin Fethry Duck  The American artists Vic Lockman and Tony Strobl  1915 1991   who were working directly for the American comic books  created Moby Duck  Strobl was one of the most productive Disney artists of all time  and drew many stories which Barks wrote and sketched after his retirement  In the 1990s and early 2000s  these scripts were re drawn in a style closer to Barks  own by Dutch artist Daan Jippes  Italian publisher Mondadori created many of the stories that were published throughout Europe  They also introduced numerous new characters who are today well known in Europe  One example is Donald Duck s alter ego  a superhero called Paperinik in Italian  created in 1969 by Guido Martina  1906 1991  and Giovan Battista Carpi  1927 1999   Giorgio Cavazzano and Carlo Chendi created Umperio Bogarto  a detective whose name is an obvious parody on Humphrey Bogart  They also created O K Quack  an extraterrestrial Duck who landed on earth in a spaceship in the shape of a coin  He however lost his spaceship  and befriended Scrooge  and now is allowed to search through his moneybin time after time  looking for his ship  Romano Scarpa  1927 2005   who was a very important and influential Italian Disney artist  created Brigitta McBridge  a female Duck who is madly in love with Scrooge  Her affections are never answered by him  though  but she keeps trying  Scarpa also came up with Dickie Duck  the granddaughter of Glittering Goldie  Scrooge s possible love interest from his days in the Klondike  and Kildare Coot  a nephew of Grandma Duck  Italian artist Corrado Mastantuono created Bum Bum Ghigno  a cynical  grumpy and not too good looking Duck who teams up with Donald and Gyro a lot  The American artist William van Horn also introduced a new character  Rumpus McFowl  an old and rather corpulent Duck with a giant appetite and laziness  who is first said to be a cousin of Scrooge  Only later  Scrooge reveals to his nephews Rumpus is actually his half brother  Later  Rumpus also finds out  Working for the Danish editor Egmont  artist Daniel Branca  1951 2005  and script writers Paul Halas and Charlie Martin created Sonny Seagull  an orphan who befriends Huey  Dewey and Louie  and his rival  Mr  Phelps  One of the most productive Duck artist used to be Victor Arriagada Rios   deceased 2012  better known under the name Vicar  He had his own studio where he and his assistants drew the stories sent in by Egmont  With writer editors Stefan and Unn Printz P hlson  Vicar created the character Oona  a prehistoric duck princess who traveled to modern Duckburg by using Gyro s time machine  She stayed  and is still seen in occasional modern stories  The best known and most popular Duck artist of this time is American Don Rosa  He started doing Disney comics in 1987 for the American publisher Gladstone  He later worked briefly for the Dutch editors  but moved to work directly for Egmont soon afterwards  His stories contain many direct references to stories by Carl Barks  and he also wrote and illustrated a 12 part series of stories about the life of Scrooge McDuck  which won him two Eisner awards  Other important artists who have worked with Donald are Freddy Milton and Daan Jippes  who made 18 ten pagers which experts claim  were very difficult to separate from Barks  own work from the late 1940s  Japanese artist Shiro Amano worked with Donald on the graphic novel Kingdom Hearts based on the Disney SquareEnix videogame   edit  Donald Duck outside the

Sweden to supervise the merchandise distribution of Sagokonst  The Art of Fables   Hartman found a studio called L Atelj  Dekorat r  which produced illustrated cards that were published by Sagokonst  Since the Disney characters on the cards appeared to be exactly  on model   Hartman asked the studio to create a local version of the English language Mickey Mouse Weekly  In 1937 L Atelj  Dekorat r began publishing Musse Pigg Tidningen  Mickey Mouse Magazine   which had high production values and spanned 23 issues  most of the magazine s content came from local producers  while some material consisted of reprints from Mickey Mouse Weekly  The comic anthology ended in 1938  Hartman helped Disney establish offices in all Nordic countries before he left Disney in 1941  Donald became the most

themselves in Donald  Raittila cites that Donald attempts to retrieve himself from  all manner of unexpected and unreasonable scrapes using only his wits and the slim resources he can put his hands on  all of which meshes nicely with the popular image of Finland as driftwood in the crosscurrents of world politics   Finnish voters placing  protest votes  typically write  Donald Duck  as the

popular German translations of the comics created by The Good Duck Artist Carl Barks  Christian Pfeiler   former president of D O N A L D   a German acronym which stands for  German Organization for

birthday  Donald is the only popular film and television cartoon character to appear as a mascot for a major American university  a licensing agreement between Disney and the University of Oregon allows the school s sports teams to use Donald s image as its  Fighting Duck  mascot  In 1984  Donald Duck was named an honorary alumnus of the University of Oregon during his 50th birthday celebration  During a visit to the Eugene Airport  3 000 to 4 000 fans gathered for the presentation of an academic cap and gown to Donald  Thousands of area residents signed a congratulatory scroll for Donald  and that document is now part of Disney s corporate archives  In the 1940s  Donald was adopted as an unofficial mascot by Brazilian sports club Botafogo after Argentinean cartoonist Lorenzo Mollas  who was working in Brazil at the time  drew him with the club s soccer uniform  Mollas chose Donald because he complains and fights for his rights  like the club s managers at those years  and also because  being a duck  he does not lose his elegance while moving in the water  an allusion to rowing   He was eventually replaced so that the club would not have to pay royalties to Disney  Botafogo s current official mascot is  Manequinho   representing the Manneken Pis statue in front of the club s head office   but has since retained the status of unofficial mascot  Donald s name and image are used on numerous commercial products  one example being Donald Duck brand orange juice  introduced by Citrus World in 1940  Donald Duck was temporarily listed as a  hired  employee in the database of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development as late as 1978  Given a  99 999 salary   more than double the  47 500 take federal civil servants were legally limited to be paid at the time   the name was unchallenged by a computer intended to catch government payroll fraud  Picked as one of thirty fictitious names by the Government Accounting Office  the use of it was a test to see if the payroll system of the HUD could be manipulated to defraud the government  22  Donald Duck s head and neck  wearing a radio headset and wrapped in earphone wires with an expression of pain on his face and with crossed crutches below  was the nose art on Lieutenant Ted W  Lawson s B 25 Mitchell bomber  the Ruptured Duck  on the famous Doolittle Raid on Tokyo in 1942   In the 1950s  an early Mad Magazine parody of Mickey Mouse  called  Mickey Rodent   written by  Walt Dizzy   featured  Darnold Duck   whose quacky voice had to be  translated  for the readers  and who was shamed into finally wearing pants  Although Donald s military service has most been recognized as him in the US Army from his wartime cartoons  and to a lesser extent having Donald in the US Navy from Duck Tales   Walt Disney had authorized Donald to be used as a mascot for the US Coast Guard  The Coast Guard image shows a fierce looking Donald Duck dressed in a pirate s outfit  appearing vigilant against any potential threats to the coastal regions in the United States  This image is still often used on many Coast Guard bases and Coast Guard cutters today  Donald Duck is referred to in the song  The Village Green Preservation Society  by The Kinks   We are the Village Green Preservation Society  God save Donald Duck  vaudeville and variety     The reference is ironical  as the singer is lamenting the disappearance of perceived traditional English cultural artifacts  Donald Duck makes a cameo appearance in the cartoon sequence in 200 Motels  1971   In Sweden  a comic book artist named Charlie Christensen got into a legal dispute with Disney when his creation Arne Anka looked similar to Donald Duck  albeit Arne is a pessimistic drunkard   However Charlie made a mockery of the legal action  and staged a fake death for his character  which then had plastic surgery performed and reappeared as Arne X with a more crow like beak  He later purchased a strap on duck beak from a novelty gift shop  pointing out that  If Disney is planning to give me any legal action  all I have to do is remove my fake beak   In 1991  the Disney Corporation sued the Israeli caricaturist Dudu Geva for copyright infringement  claiming his character  Donald Dach  in the story  Moby Duck  was a ripoff of Donald  23  The Courts found in their favor and forced Geva to pay for the legal expenses and remove his book from the shelves  More mildly  the character Howard The Duck s original design was modified to include pants allegedly due to pressure from Disney  24  In 2005  Donald received his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6840 Hollywood Blvd 25  joining other fictional characters such as Mickey Mouse  Bugs Bunny  Woody Woodpecker  The Simpsons  Winnie the Pooh  Kermit the Frog  Big Bird  Godzilla and Snow White  Donald s fame has led Disney to license the character for a number of video games  such as the Kingdom Hearts series  where Donald is the court magician of Disney Castle  He accompanies Goofy and a young boy named Sora on a quest to find King Mickey Mouse  defeat the Heartless and Nobodies  and put an end to the evil Xehanort and Organization XIII  26  He is voiced by Tony Anselmo in the English version and K ichi Yamadera in the Japanese version  Italian Power Metal Band Trick or Treat have a song called  Like Donald Duck  in their debut album  Evil Needs Candy Too   2006   27  28  Asteroid 12410 was named after Donald Duck  29   edit  Appearances Main article  Donald Duck filmography  edit  Selected short films The Wise Little Hen
