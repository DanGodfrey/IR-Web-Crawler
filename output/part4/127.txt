Franks  One is that it is derived from the Proto Germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a francisca  29  Another proposed etymology is that in an ancient Germanic language  Frank means free as opposed to slave  History Main article  History of France See also  Military history of France  Economic history of France  and Territorial evolution of France Prehistory and antiquity Main articles  Prehistory of France  Gaul  and Roman Gaul One of the paintings of Lascaux which represents a horse  Dordogne  approximately 18 000 BC   The oldest traces of human life in what is now France date from approximately 1 800 000 years ago  30  Men were then confronted by a hard and variable climate  marked by several glacial eras which modified their framework of life and led them to a nomadic life of hunters gatherers  30  France counts a large number of decorated caves from the upper Paleolithic era  including one of the most famous and best preserved  Lascaux 30   Dordogne  approximately 18 000 BC   At the end of the Last glacial period  10 000 BC   the climate softened 30  and from approximately 7 000 BC  this part of Western Europe entered the Neolithic era and its inhabitants became sedentary  After a strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia  metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium  initially with the work of gold  copper and bronze  and later with iron  31  France counts numerous megalithic sites from the Neolithic period  including the exceptionally dense Carnac stones site in Brittany  c  3 300 BC   In 600 BC  Ionian Greeks  originating from Phocaea  founded the colony of Massalia  present day Marseille   on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea  making it the oldest city of France  32  33  At the same time  some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated some parts of the current territory of France  but this occupation spread in the rest of France only between the 5th and 3rd century BC  34  Gallic tribes before the Roman conquest  58 BC to 51 BC   Note that Southern Gaul was already under Roman control  yellow  in 59 BC  The concept of Gaul emerged at that time  it corresponds to the territories of Celtic settlement ranging between the Rhine  the Atlantic Ocean  the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean Sea  The borders of modern France are approximately the same as those of ancient Gaul  which was inhabited by Celtic Gauls  Gaul was then a prosperous country  of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to Greek and Roman influences  However  around 390 BC  the Gallic chieftain Brennus and his troops made their way to Italy through the Alps  defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia  and besieged and ransomed Rome  The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened and encouraged several subdued Italian tribes to rebel  One by one  over the course of the next 50 years  these tribes were defeated and brought back under Roman dominion  The Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC  when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome  But the Romans and the Gauls would maintain an adversarial relationship for the next several centuries and the Gauls would remain a threat in Italia  Around 125 BC  the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans  who called this region Provincia Romana   Roman Province    which over time evolved into the name Provence in French  35  Brennus  siege of Rome was still remembered by Romans  when Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC  36  The Maison Carr e was a temple of the Gallo Roman city of Nemausus  present day N mes  and is one of the best preserved vestiges of the Roman Empire  Gaul was divided by Augustus into Roman provinces  the principal ones being Gallia Narbonensis in the south  Gallia Aquitania in the south west  Gallia Lugdunensis in the center and Gallia Belgica in the north  37  Many cities were founded during the Gallo Roman period  including Lugdunum  present day Lyon   which is considered to be the capital of the Gauls  37  These cities were built in the traditional Roman style  with a forum  a theatre  a circus  an amphitheatre and thermal baths  The Gauls mixed with Roman settlers and eventually adopted Roman speech  Latin  from which the French language evolved  and Roman culture  The Roman polytheism merged with the Gallic paganism into the same syncretism  Around the 3rd century AD  Roman Gaul underwent a serious crisis with its  limes   fortified borders protecting the Empire  crossed on several occasions by Barbarians  38  The weakness of the central imperial power  at this time  led Gallo Roman leaders to proclaim the independence of the short lived Gallic Empire  38  which ended with the Battle of Ch lons in 274  which saw Gaul reincorporated in the Roman Empire  Nevertheless  the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century  which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul  39  In 312  the emperor Constantin I converted to Christianity  Christians  persecuted until then  multiplied across the entire Roman Empire  40  But  from the second half of the 4th century  the Barbarian Invasions started again  41  and Germanic tribes  such as the Vandals  Suebi and Alans crossed the Rhine and settled in Gaul  Spain and other parts of the collapsing Roman Empire  42  At the end of the Antiquity period  ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms  Early Francia  North   Alamannia  North East   Burgundia  East   Septimania  South   Visigothic Aquitania  South East   and a remaining Gallo Roman territory  known as the Kingdom of Syagrius  West   Simultaneously  Celtic Britons  fleeing the Anglo Saxon invasion of Britannia  settled the western part of Armorica  far West of Gaul   As a result  the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany  Celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region  Middle Ages to revolution Main articles  Francia  France in the Middle Ages  Absolute monarchy in France  Ancien R gime in France  Early modern France  and List of French monarchs Frankish expansion from the early Clovis I  kingdom  481  to the divisions of Charlemagne s Empire  843 870   The pagan Franks  from whom the ancient name of  Francie  was derived  originally settled the northern part of Gaul  but under Clovis I conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central Gaul  In 498  Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity  rather than Arianism  thus France was given the title  Eldest daughter of the Church   La fille a n e de l  glise  by the papacy  43  and the French kings would be called  the Most Christian Kings of France   Rex Christianissimus   The Franks embraced the Christian Gallo Roman heritage and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed Francia   Land of the Franks    The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages  except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where Germanic languages emerged  Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty  but his kingdom would not survive his death  The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs  so four kingdoms emerged from Clovis s  Paris  Orl ans  Soissons  and Rheims  The last Merovingian kings  sometimes referred as Rois fain ants   lazy kings    effectively lost power to their mayors of the palace  One mayor of the palace  Charles Martel  defeated a Muslim invasion force from Hispania at the Battle of Tours  732  and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms  His son  Pepin the Short  eventually seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty  Pippin s son  Charlemagne  reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across Western and Central Europe  Proclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing in earnest the French government s longtime historical association with the Roman Catholic Church  44  Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur  from his Palace of Aachen  The efficient administration of this immense empire was ensured by high level civil servants  carrying the  then non hereditary  titles of counts  in charge of a County   marquis  in charge of a March   dukes  military commanders   etc  Charlemagne s son  Louis I  emperor 814 840   kept the empire united  however  this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death  In 843  under the Treaty of Verdun  the empire was divided between Louis  three sons  with East Francia going to Louis the German  Middle Francia to Lothair I  and West Francia to Charles the Bald  Western Francia approximated the area occupied by  and was the precursor  to modern France  45  During the course of the 9th and 10th centuries  continually threatened by Viking invasions  France became a very decentralised state  the nobility s titles and lands became hereditary  and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen  Thus was established feudalism in France  Over time  some of the king s vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king  For example  after the Battle of Hastings in 1066  the Duke of Normandy added  King of England  to his titles  becoming both the vassal to  as Duke of Normandy  and the equal of  as king of England  to the king of France  Joan of Arc led the French army to several important victories during the Hundred Years  War which paved the way for the final victory  The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987  when Hugh Capet  Duke of France and Count of Paris  was crowned King of France  46  His descendants  the Direct Capetians  the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon  progressively unified the country through a series of wars  such as the Saintonge War  and dynastic inheritance into the Kingdom of France  French knights took an active part in many of the Crusades that were fought between 1095 and 1291 to restore Christian control over the Holy Land  Crusaders were so predominately French that the word  crusader  in the Arabic language is simply known as Al Franj or  The Franks  47  and Old French became the lingua franca of the Kingdom of Jerusalem  48  The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the south western area of modern day France  In the end  the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the kingdom of France  49  Later Kings expanded their territory to cover over half of modern continental France  including most of the North  Centre and West of France  Meanwhile  the royal authority became more and more assertive  centred around a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility  clergy  and commoners  Charles IV  The Fair  died without an heir in 1328  50  Under the rules of the Salic law adopted in 1316  the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kinship pass through the female line  50  Accordingly  the crown passed to Philip of Valois  a cousin of Charles  rather than through the female line to Charles  nephew  Edward  who would soon become Edward III of England  During the reign of Philip of Valois  the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power  50  The St  Bartholomew s Day massacre  1572  was the climax of the French Wars of Religion  which were brought to an end by the Edict of Nantes  1598   However  Philip s seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England and in 1337  on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death  51  England and France went to war in what would become known as the Hundred Years  War  52  The exact boundaries changed greatly with time  but French landholdings of the English Kings remained extensive for decades  With charismatic leaders  such as Joan of Arc and La Hire  strong French counterattacks won back all English continental territories  except Calais  which was captured in 1558 by the French  Like the rest of Europe  France was struck by the Black Death  Around 1340  France had a population of approximately 17 million  53  which by the end of the pandemic had declined by about one half  54  The French Renaissance saw a long set of wars  known as the Italian Wars  between the Kingdom of France and the powerful Holy Roman Empire  It also saw the first standardization of the French language  which would become the official language of France and the language of Europe s aristocracy  French explorers  such as Jacques Cartier or Samuel de Champlain  claimed lands in the Americas for France  paving the way for the expansion of the First French colonial empire  Louis XIV of France  the  sun king  was the absolute monarch of France and made France the leading European power  The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion  where  in the most notorious incident  thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St  Bartholomew s Day massacre of 1572  55  The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV s Edict of Nantes  which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots  Henry IV was later murdered by a Catholic fanatic and Huguenot rebellions persisted until the 18th century  Under Louis XIII  the energetic actions of Cardinal Richelieu reinforced the centralization of the state  the royal power and French dominance in Europe  foreshadowing the reign of Louis XIV  During Louis XIV s minority and the regency of Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin  a period of trouble known as the Fronde occurred in France  which was at that time at war with Spain  This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal power in France  The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV  By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles  Louis XIV s personal power became unchallenged  Remembered for his numerous wars  he made France the leading European power of the time  At this time  France possessed the largest population in Europe  see Demographics of France  and had tremendous influence over European politics  economy  and culture  French became the most used language in diplomacy  science  literature and international affairs  and remained so until the 20th century  56  In addition  France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas  Africa and Asia  Louis XIV also revoked the Edict of Nantes  forcing thousands of Huguenots to exile  Under Louis XV  France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years  War  which ended in 1763  Its continental territory kept growing  however  with notable acquisitions such as Lorraine  1766  and Corsica  1770   An unpopular king  Louis XV s weak rule  his ill advised financial  political and military decisions  and his debauchery discredited the monarchy and arguably led to the French Revolution 15 years after his death  57  58  Louis XVI  Louis XV s grandson  actively supported the Americans  who were seeking their independence from Great Britain  realized in the 1783 Treaty of Paris   The example of the American Revolution and the financial crisis which followed France s involvement in the war were two of the many contributing factors to the French Revolution  Much of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles  and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions  such as the discovery of oxygen  1778  and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers  1783   were achieved by French scientists in the 18th century  Famous French explorers  such as Bougainville and Lap rouse  took part in the European and American voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe  The Enlightenment philosophy  in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy and authority  undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the French Revolution  Monarchy to republic Main articles  France in the long nineteenth century and France in the twentieth century See also  French Revolution  Napoleonic era  and French colonial empire The Storming of the Bastille  on 14 July 1789  was the starting event of the French Revolution  After the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789  the absolute monarchy was abolished and France became a constitutional monarchy  Through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen  France established fundamental rights for French citizens and all men without exception  The Declaration affirms  the natural and imprescriptible rights of man  to  liberty  property  security and resistance to oppression   It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges by proclaiming an end to exemptions from taxation  freedom and equal rights for all men  and access to public office based on talent rather than birth  The monarchy was restricted  and all citizens were to have the right to take part in the legislative process  Freedom of speech and press were declared  and arbitrary arrests outlawed  The Declaration also asserted the principles of popular sovereignty  in contrast to the divine right of kings that characterized the French monarchy  and social equality among citizens  eliminating the privileges of the nobility and clergy  Napoleon I  Empereur des Fran ais  built a Great Empire across Europe  He helped to spread the French revolutionary ideals and his legal reforms had a major influence worldwide  While Louis XVI  as a constitutional king  enjoyed broad popularity among the population  his disastrous flight to Varennes seemed to justify the rumors that the king tied his hopes of political salvation to the dubious prospects of foreign invasion  The credibility of the king was deeply undermined and the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic became an ever increasing possibility  As European monarchies gathered against the new r gime  to restore the French absolute monarchy  the Duke of Brunswick  commanding general of the Austro Prussian Army  issued a Manifesto  in which he threatened the destruction of Paris if any harm should come to the king or his family  The foreign threat exacerbated France s political turmoil and deepened the passion and sense of urgency among the various factions and war was declared against Austria the 20 April 1792  Mob violences occurred during the insurrection of the 10 August 1792 59  and the following month  60  As a result of the spike in public violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy  the Republic was proclaimed on 22 September 1792  Louis XVI  and later his wife Marie Antoinette  was convicted of treason and guillotined in 1793  Facing increasing pressures from European monarchies  internal guerrilla wars and counterrevolutions  like the War in the Vend e or the Chouannerie   the young Republic fell into the Reign of Terror  Between 1793 and 1794  16 000 to 40 000 persons were executed  In Western France  the civil war between the Bleus  the  Blues   supporters of the Revolution  and the Blancs  the  Whites   supporters of the Monarchy  last from 1793 to 1796 and cost around 450 000 lives  200 000 Patriotes and 250 000 Vend ens   61  Both foreign armies and French counterrevolutionnaries were crushed and the French Republic survived  Furthermore  the French Republic extended greatly its boundaries and established  Sister Republics  in the surrounding countries  As the threat of a foreign invasion receded and that France became mostly pacified  the Thermidorian Reaction put an end to the Terror and to Robespierre s dictature  The abolition of slavery and the male universal suffrage  enacted during this radical phase of the revolution  were cancelled by subsequent governments  Animated map of the growth and decline of the French colonial empire  After a short lived governmental scheme  Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 and was appointed First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire  1804 1814 1815   As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic  changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars to Napoleon s French Empire  His armies conquered most of continental Europe  while members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms  These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms  such as the Metric system  the Napoleonic Code or the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen  After the catastrophic Russian campaign  Napoleon was finally defeated and the Bourbon monarchy restored  About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars  62  On the way to Verdun   They shall not pass  is a phrase which for all time will be associated with the heroic defense of Verdun  After his brief return from exile  Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo  the monarchy was re established  1815 1830   with new constitutional limitations  The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the civil uprising of 1830  which established the constitutional July Monarchy  which lasted until 1848  when the French Second Republic was proclaimed  in the wake of the 1848 European revolutions  The abolition of slavery and the male universal suffrage  both briefly enacted during the French Revolution were finally re enacted in 1848  In 1852  the president of the French Republic Louis Napol on Bonaparte  Napoleon I s nephew  was proclaimed emperor of the second Empire  as Napoleon III  He multiplied French interventions abroad  especially in Crimea  in Mexico and Italy  which resulted in the annexation of Savoy and Nice  Napoleon III was eventually unseated following defeat in the Franco Prussian war of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the Third Republic  Charles de Gaulle took an active part in all major events of the 20th century   a hero of World War I  leader of the Free French during World War II  he then became President  where he facilitated the decolonization  maintained France as a major power and overcame the May 1968 revolt  France had colonial possessions  in various forms  since the beginning of the 17th century to the 18th century  But in the 19th and 20th centuries  its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and culminated as the second largest in the world behind the British Empire  At its peak  between 1919 and 1939  the second French colonial empire extended over 12 347 000 square kilometres  4 767 000 sq mi  of land  Including metropolitan France  the total area of land under French sovereignty reached 12 898 000 square kilometres  4 980 000 sq mi  in the 1920s and 1930s  which is 8 6  of the world s land area  France was a member of the Triple Entente when World War I broke out  A small part of Northern France was occupied  but France and its allies eventually emerged victorious against the Central Powers  at a tremendous human and material cost  the first war left 1 4 million French soldiers dead  63  The interbellum phase was marked by intense international tensions an a variety of social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government  Annual leave  working time reduction  women in Government      Following the German Blitzkrieg campaign in World War II  metropolitan France was divided in an occupation zone in the north and Vichy France  a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany  in the south  64  The Allies and the French Resistance eventually emerged victorious from the Axis powers and French sovereignty was restored  The Fourth Republic was established after World War II and saw spectacular economic growth  les Trente Glorieuses   The universal suffrage was extended to women in 1944  France was one of the founding members of the NATO  1949   which was the Western counterpart of the Warsaw Pact system of collective defence  France attempted to regain control of French Indochina but was defeated by the Viet Minh at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954  Only months later  France faced a new conflict in Algeria  The debate over whether or not to keep control of Algeria  then home to over one million European settlers  65  wracked the country and nearly led to civil war  In 1958  the weak and unstable Fourth Republic gave way to the Fifth Republic  which contained a strengthened Presidency  66  In the latter role  Charles de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the war  The Algerian War was concluded with peace negotiations in 1962 that led to Algerian independence  France granted independence progressively to its colonies  the last one being Vanuatu in 1980  A vestige of the colonial empire are the French overseas departments and territories that include French Guiana  Martinique and French Polynesia  In the wake of a worldwide series of protests  the May 1968 revolt  although a political failure for the protesters  had an enormous social impact  In France  it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal  religion  patriotism  respect for authority  shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal  France has been at the forefront of the European Union member states seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to create a more unified and capable European Union political  defence  and security apparatus  67  Geography Main article  Geography of France See also  Outline of France Metropolitan French cities with

Ministry of the Environment  in 1971  75  Although France is one of the most industrialised and developed countries  it is ranked only seventeenth by carbon dioxide emissions  behind such less populous nations as Canada  Saudi Arabia or Australia  This situation results from the French government s decision to invest in nuclear power in 1974  after the 1973 oil crisis 76    which now accounts for 78  of France s electricity production 77  and explains why France pollutes less than comparable countries  78  79  Like all European Union members  France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20  of 1990 levels by the year 2020  80  in comparison the USA agreed to a cut of 4  of its emissions 81  whereas China stated it wanted to  reduce its carbon intensity by 40 45  by the year 2020   compared with 2005 levels   82  which means with a GDP growth of 8  yearly an augmentation of 80  81  to 250  83  of the Chinese carbon emissions by 2020  In 2009  the French carbon dioxide emissions per capita level is lower than the Chinese one  84  France was even set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 Euros per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted  85  The carbon tax would have brought in 4 3 billion Euros of revenue per year  86  However  6 months later  the plan for a carbon tax was abandoned for various reasons  one being that French companies would have a more difficult time competing with companies in neighboring countries who would not have to pay such steep taxes on carbon dioxide emissions  Instituting a carbon tax was also an unpopular political move for President Sarkozy  87  In 2010  a study at Yale and Columbia universities ranked France the most environmentally conscious nation of the G20  88  89  Forests account for 28 27  of the land area of

metropolitan France  one is the territorial collectivity of Corsica   and five are overseas regions  The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments 97  which are numbered  mainly alphabetically   This number is used in postal codes and vehicle number plates amongst others  The 101 departments are subdivided into 341 arrondissements which are  in turn  subdivided into 4 051 cantons  These cantons are then divided into 36 697 communes  which are municipalities with an elected municipal council  There also exist 2 588 intercommunal entities grouping 33 414 of the 36 697

territorial collectivities  meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive  Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions  However  this was not always the case  Until 1940  the arrondissements were also territorial collectivities with an elected assembly  but these were suspended by the Vichy regime and definitely abolished by the Fourth Republic in 1946

unitary semi presidential republic with strong democratic traditions  100  The constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on 28 September 1958  101  It greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to parliament  The executive branch itself has two leaders  the President of the Republic  currently Nicolas Sarkozy  who is head of state and is elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5 year term  formerly 7 years   102  and the Government  led by the president appointed Prime Minister  currently Fran ois Fillon  Nicolas Sarkozy has been the President of the French Republic since 2007 The French parliament is a bicameral legislature comprising a National Assembly  Assembl e Nationale  and a Senate  103  The National Assembly deputies represent local constituencies and are directly elected for 5 year terms  104  The Assembly has the power to dismiss the cabinet  and thus the majority in the Assembly determines the choice of government  Senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6 year terms  originally 9 year terms   and one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years starting in September 2008  105  The Senate s legislative powers are limited  in the event of disagreement between the two chambers  the National Assembly has the final say  106  The government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament  French politics are characterised by two politically opposed groupings  one left wing  centred around the French Socialist Party  and the other right wing  centred previously around the Rassemblement pour la R publique  RPR  and now its successor the Union for a Popular Movement  UMP   107  The executive branch is currently composed mostly of the UMP  Law Main article  Law of France The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen France uses a civil legal system  70  that is  law arises primarily from written statutes  judges are not to make law  but merely to interpret it  though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law   Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code  which was  in turn  largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV   In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society  As Guy Canivet  first president of the Court of Cassation  wrote about the management of prisons   Freedom is the rule  and its restriction is the exception  any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality  That is  Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed  and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy  French law is divided into two principal areas  private law and public law  Private law includes  in particular  civil law and criminal law  Public law includes  in particular  administrative law and constitutional law  However  in practical terms  French law comprises three principal areas of law  civil law  criminal law and administrative law  France does not recognize religious law  nor does it recognize religious beliefs or morality as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions  As a consequence  France has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws  the latter being abolished in 1791   However   offenses against public decency   contraires aux bonnes m urs  or disturbing public order  trouble   l ordre public  have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution  Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past  criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited    and to be applicable  laws must be officially published in the Journal Officiel de la R publique Fran aise  France is tolerant of the LGBT community  Since 1999  civil unions for homosexual couples are permitted  although same sex marriage is illegal in France  Laws sentencing racism  sexism or antisemitism are old and important  for instance  laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881  108  In 2010  France passed a law banning face veils in public  including those worn by Muslim women  Amnesty International has condemned the law as a violation of freedom of expression  109  In September two Muslim women were fined for wearing the niqab  an Islamic face covering veil   though they appealed the fines  110  Foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of France See also  European Union  Latin Union  Organisation internationale de la

Weights and Measures  121  In 1953  France received a request from the United Nations to pick a coat of arms that would represent it internationally  Thus the French emblem was adopted and is currently used on passports  122  Postwar French foreign policy has been largely shaped by membership of the European Union  of which it was a founding member  In the 1960s  France sought to exclude the British from the organisation  123  seeking to build its own standing in continental Europe  Since the 1960s  France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU  124  Since 1904  France has maintained an  Entente cordiale  with the United Kingdom  and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries  especially on a military level  French President Nicolas Sarkozy and United States President Barack Obama  before NATO summit  in Strasbourg  on 3 April 2009 France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  but under President de Gaulle  it excluded itself from the joint military command to avoid American domination of its foreign and security policies  125  However  as a result of Nicolas Sarkozy s  much criticised in France by the leftists and by a part of the right  126  127 pro American politics  France rejoined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009  In the early 1990s

Large tracts of fertile land  the application of modern technology  and EU subsidies have combined to make France the leading agricultural producer and exporter in Europe 170   representing alone 20  of the EU s agricultural production 171   and the world s third biggest exporter of agricultural products  172  Wheat  poultry  dairy  beef  and pork  as well as an internationally recognized processed foods are the primary French agricultural exports  Ros  wines are primarily consumed within the country  but champagne and Bordeaux wines are major exports  being known worldwide  EU agriculture subsidies to France have decreased for the last years  but still amounted to  8 billion in 2007  173  This same year  France sold 33 4 billion euros of transformed agricultural products  174  Agriculture is thus an important sector of France s economy   3 5  of the active population is employed in agriculture  171  whereas the total agri food industry made up 4 2  of French GDP in 2005  171  Labour market The French GDP per capita is similar to the GDP per capita of other comparable European countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom  175  GDP per capita is determined by  i  productivity per hour worked  which in France is the highest of the G8 countries in 2005  according to the OECD  176   ii  the number of hours worked  which is one the lowest of developed countries  177  and  iii  the employment rate  France has one of the lowest 15 64 years employment rates of the OECD countries  in 2004  only 69  of the French population aged 15 64 years were in employment  compared to 80  in Japan  79  in the UK  77  in the US  and 71  in Germany  178  La D fense  just outside Paris  is the largest business district in Europe  179  This gap is due to the very low employment rates at both age extremes  the employment rate of people aged 55 64 was 38 3  in 2007  compared to 46 6  in the EU15  180  for the 15 24 years old  the employment rate was 31 5  in 2007  compared to 37 2  in EU25  181  These low employment rates are explained by the high minimum wages which prevent low productivity workers   such as young people   from easily entering the labour market  182  ineffective university curricula that fail to prepare students adequately for the labour market  183  and  concerning the older workers  restrictive legislation on work and incentives for premature retirement  184  185  The unemployment rate decreased from 9  in 2006 to 7  in 2008 but remains one of the highest in Europe  186  187  In June 2009  the unemployment rate for France was 9 4   188  Shorter working hours and the reluctance to reform the labour market are mentioned as weak spots of the French economy in the view of the right  when the left mentions the lack of government policies fostering social justice  Liberal economists have stressed repeatedly over the years that the main issue of the French economy is an issue of structural reforms  in order to increase the size of the working population in the overall population  reduce the taxes  level and the administrative burden  Keynesian economists have different answers to the unemployment issue  and their theories led to the 35 hour workweek law in the 2000s  decade   which turned out to be a failure in reducing unemployment  Afterwards  between 2004 and 2008  the Government made some supply oriented reforms to combat unemployment but met with fierce resistance  189  especially with the contrat nouvelle embauche and the contrat premi re embauche which both were eventually repealed  190  The current Government is experiencing the revenu de solidarit  active to redress the negative effect of the revenu minimum d insertion on work incentive  191  Tourism Main article  Tourism in France The Palace

from Africa and 13 710 from Europe  215  In 2008  France granted citizenship to 137 000 persons  mostly to people from Morocco  Algeria and Turkey  216  Although it is illegal for the French state to collect data on ethnicity and race  a law with its origins in the 1789 revolution and reaffirmed in the constitution of 1958  some surveys  like the TeO   Trajectories and origins   survey conducted jointly by INED and INSEE in 2008  are allowed to do it  217  218  Before this survey  it was estimated that between three million 219  and six million 220  people are of North African ancestry while an estimated 2 5 million people are of Black African ancestry  221  222  It is currently estimated that 40  of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration the country has received  223  Between 1921 and 1935 about 1 1 million net immigrants came to France  224  An estimated 1 6 million European pieds noirs returned to France as the country s

is French  228  a Romance language derived from latin  Since 1635  the Acad mie fran aise is France s official authority on the usages  vocabulary  and grammar of the French language  although its recommendations carry no legal power  The French government does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications  In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic  the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as La Francophonie  The perceived threat from anglicisation has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France  Besides French  there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France  8 in the French metropolitan territory of continental Europe and 69 in the French overseas territories  From the 17th century to the mid 20th century  French served as the pre eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a lingua franca among the educated classes of Europe  229  The dominant position of French language in international affairs has only been challenged recently by English  since the emergence of the USA as a major power  56  230  231  As a result of France s extensive colonial ambitions between the 17th and 20th centuries  French was introduced to America  Africa  Polynesia  South East Asia  and the Caribbean  French is the second most studied foreign language in the world after English  232  and is a lingua franca in some regions  notably in Africa  The legacy of French as a living language outside Europe is mixed  it is nearly extinct in some former French colonies  Southeast Asia   while creoles  and pidgins based on French have emerged in the French departments in the West Indies and the South Pacific  French Polynesia   On the other hand  many former French colonies have adopted French as an official language  and the total number of French speakers is increasing  especially in Africa  It is estimated that between 300 million 233  and 500 million 234  people worldwide can speak French  either as a mother tongue or a second language  Religion Main article  Religion in France Notre Dame de Reims is the Roman Catholic cathedral where the kings of France were crowned until 1825  235  France is a secular country  and freedom of religion is a constitutional right  French religious policy is based on the concept of la cit   a strict separation of Church and State under which public life is kept completely secular  France was historically regarded as the  eldest daughter  of the Roman Catholic Church  The French Revolution saw a radical shift in the status of the Church with the launch of a brutal de Christianization campaign  After the back and forth of Catholic royal and secular republican governments over the 19th century  la cit  was established with the Jules Ferry laws of the 1880s and the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State  236  The French government does not keep statistics on religious adherence  nor on ethnicity or on political affiliation  However  some unofficial survey estimates exist  Roman Catholicism has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium  though it is not as actively practiced today as it once was  A survey by the Catholic newspaper La Croix found that whilst in 1965  81  of the French declared themselves to be Catholics  in 2009 this proportion was 64   Moreover  whilst 27  of the French went to Mass once a week or more in 1952  only 4 5  did so in 2006  15 2  attended Mass at least once a month  237  The same survey found that Protestants accounted for 3  of the population  an increase from previous surveys  and 5  adhered to other religions  with the remaining 28  stating that they had no religion  237  According to a January 2007 poll by the Catholic World News  238  only 5  of the French population attended church regularly  or 10  attend church services regularly among the respondents who did identify themselves as Catholics   The poll showed 239  51  identified as being Catholics  31  identified as being agnostics or atheists  another poll 240  sets the proportion of atheists equal to 27    10  identified as being from other religions or being without opinion  4  identified as Muslim  3  identified as Protestant  1  identified as Buddhist  1  identified as Jewish  Meanwhile  an independent estimate by the politologist Pierre Br chon in 2009 concluded that the proportion of Catholics had fallen to 42  while the number of atheists and agnostics had risen to 50   241  According to the Pewforum  In France  proponents of a 2004 law banning the wearing of religious symbols in schools say it protects Muslim girls from being forced to wear a headscarf  but the law also restricts those who want to wear headscarves   or any other  conspicuous  religious symbol  including large Christian crosses and Sikh turbans   as an expression of their faith  242  According to the most recent but in 2010 somewhat outdated Eurobarometer Poll 2005  243  34  of French citizens responded that  they believe there is a god   whereas 27  answered that  they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force  and 33  that  they do not believe there is any sort of spirit  god  or life force   One other study shows 32  of people in France declaring themselves to be atheists  and another 32  declaring themselves  sceptical about the existence of God but not an atheist   244  Estimates of the number of Muslims in France vary widely  According to the more than one decade old 1999 French census returns  there were 3 7 million people of  possible Muslim faith  in France  6 3  of the total population   In 2003  the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of Muslims to be between five and six million  8 10    245  246  The current Jewish community in France numbers around 600 000 according to the World Jewish Congress and is the largest in Europe  However  both the North American Jewish Data bank and the Vitual Jew Library put the estimates closer to 480 000 as of 2010 update   Since 1905 the French government has followed the principle of la cit   in which it is prohibited from recognising any specific right to a religious community  except for legacy statutes like that of military chaplains and the local law in Alsace Moselle   Instead  it merely recognises religious organisations  according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine  Conversely  religious organizations should refrain from intervening in policy making  Certain bodies of beliefs such as Scientology  Children of God  the Unification Church  or the Order of the Solar Temple are considered cults   sectes  in French   247  and therefore do not have the same status as religions in France  Secte is considered a pejorative

obesity  due mostly to the replacement of traditional healthy French cuisine by junk food in French eating habits  255  256  261  Nevertheless  the French obesity rate is far below that of the USA  for instance  obesity rate in France is the same that the American once was in the 1970s 256    and is still the lowest of Europe  258  261  but it is now regarded by the authorities as one of the main public health issues 262  and is fiercely fought  rates of childhood obesity are slowing in France  while continuing to grow in other countries  263  Education Main article  Education in France

schooling system in France is centralized  and is composed of three stages  primary education  secondary education  and higher education  The Programme for International Student Assessment  coordinated by the OECD  currently ranks France s education as the 25th best in the world  being neither significantly higher nor lower than the OECD average  267  Primary and secondary education are predominantly public  run by the Ministry of National Education  Higher education in France is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective Grandes  coles  such as Science Po Paris for Political studies  HEC Paris for Economics  Polytechnique and the  cole nationale sup rieure des mines de Paris that produces high profile engineers  or the  cole nationale d administration for careers in the great corps of the State  The Grandes  coles have been criticised for alleged elitism  268  nevertheless they have produced many if not most of France s high ranking civil servants  CEO  or politicians  Culture Main article  Culture of France Marianne  in painting by Eug ne Delacroix  La Libert  guidant le peuple  1830   France has been a center of cultural creation for centuries  Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time  and France is still recognized in the world for its rich cultural tradition  The successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation  and the creation of the Ministry of Culture in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public  The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation  granting subsidies to artists  promoting French culture in the world  supporting festivals and cultural events  protecting historical monuments  The French government also succeeded in maintaining a cultural exception to defend audiovisual products made in the country  France receives the highest number of tourists per year  largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory  It counts 1 200 museums welcoming more than 50 million people annually  269  The most important cultural sites are run by the government  for instance through the public agency Centre des monuments nationaux  which have around a hundred national historical monuments at charge  clarification needed  The 43 180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly residences  many castles  or ch teaux in French  and religious buildings  cathedrals  basilicas  churches  etc    but also statutes  memorials and

Mus e d Orsay   The origins of French painting were very much influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance  Jean Fouquet  the most famous medieval French painter  is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance at first hand  The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino  who both worked in France  Two of the most famous French artists of the time of Baroque era  Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain  lived in Italy  The 17th century was the period where French painting became proeminent and individualized itself through classicism  Louis XIV s prime minister Jean Baptiste Colbert founded in 1648 the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture to protect these artists  and in 1666 he created the still in activity French Academy in Rome to have direct relations with Italian artists  French painters developed the rococo style in the 18th century  as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style  the works of court endorsed artists Antoine Watteau  Fran ois Boucher and Jean Honor  Fragonard being the most representative in the country  The French Revolution brought great changes  as Napoleon I favoured painters of neoclassic style as Jacques Louis David and the highly influential Acad mie des Beaux Arts defined the style known as Academism  At this time France had become a center of artistic creation  the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements  at first Romanticism with Th odore G ricault and Eug ne Delacroix  and Realism with Camille Corot  Gustave Courbet and Jean Fran ois Millet  a style that eventually evolved into Naturalism  In the second part of the 19th century  France s influence over painting became even more important  with the development of new styles of painting like Impressionism and Symbolism  The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro   douard Manet  Edgar Degas  Claude Monet  Auguste Renoir  271  Second generation of impressionist style painters Paul C zanne  Paul Gauguin  Toulouse Lautrec and Georges Seurat were also at the avant guarde of artistic evolutions  272  as well as fauvist artists Henri Matisse  Andr  Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck  273  274  At the beginning of 20th century  Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and Spanish painter Pablo Picasso  living in Paris  Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris  like Vincent van Gogh  Marc Chagall  Amedeo Modigliani and Wassily Kandinsky  Many museums in France are entirely or partly devoted to painting works  A huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state owned Mus e du Louvre  such as Mona Lisa  also known as La Joconde  While the Louvre Palace has been for a long time a museum  the Mus e d Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station Gare d Orsay  in a major reorganization of national art collections  to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century  mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements   275  276  Modern works are presented in the Mus e National d Art Moderne  which moved in 1976 to the Centre Georges Pompidou  These three state owned museums welcome close to 17 million people a year  277  Other national museums hosting paintings include the Grand Palais  1 3 million visitors in 2008   but there are also many museums owned by cities  the most visited being the Mus e d Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris  0 8 million entries in 2008   which hosts contemporary works  277  Outside Paris  all the large cities have a Museum of Fine Arts with a section dedicated to European and French painting  Some of the finest collections are in Lyon  Lille  Rouen  Dijon  Rennes and Grenoble  Architecture Main article  French architecture Saint Louis  Sainte Chapelle represents the French impact on religious architecture  Technically speaking  there is no standard type of  French  architecture  although that has not always been true  Gothic architecture s old name was French architecture  or Opus Francigenum   278  The term  Gothic  appeared later as a stylistic insult and was widely adopted  The Gothic architecture was the first French style of architecture to be copied in all Europe  279  Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas  the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica  used as the royal necropolis   other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre Dame de Chartres and Notre Dame d Amiens  The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church  Notre Dame de Reims  280  Aside from churches  Gothic Architecture had been used for many religious palaces  the most important one being the Palais des Papes in Avignon  During the Middle Ages  fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers against their rivals  When King Philip II took Rouen from King John  for example  he demolished the ducal castle to build a bigger one  Fortified cities were also common  most French castles did not survive the passage of time  This is why Richard the Lionheart s Ch teau Gaillard was demolished  as well as the Ch teau de Lusignan  Some French castles that survived are Chinon  Ch teau d Angers  the massive Ch teau de Vincennes and the so called Cathar castles  Op ra Garnier  Paris  a symbol of the French Neo Baroque style Before the appearance of this architecture  France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe  with the exception of the Iberian Peninsula  which now consists of Spain and Portugal  which used Mooresque architecture   Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in France are the Saint Sernin Basilica in Toulouse  largest romanesque church in Europe 281   and the remains of the Cluniac Abbey  largely destroyed during the Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars   The world s most visited paid monument  282  the Eiffel Tower is an icon of both Paris and France  The end of the Hundred Years  War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture  It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy and Spain were invited to the French court  many residential palaces  inspired by the Italians  were built  but mainly in the Loire Valley  Such residential castles were the Ch teau de Chambord  the Ch teau de Chenonceau  or the Ch teau d Amboise  Following the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages  Baroque Architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style  However  in France  baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one  283  In the secular domain  the Palace of Versailles has many baroque features  Jules Hardouin Mansart was said by whom   to be the most influential French architect of the baroque era  with his famous dome  Les Invalides  Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as the Place Stanislas in Nancy  On the military architectural side  Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect  as a result  imitations of his works can be found all over Europe  the Americas  Russia and Turkey  284  285  After the Revolution  the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although neoclassicism was introduced in France prior to the revolution with such building as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse  Built during the French Empire the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie Madeleine represent this trend the best  286  Under Napoleon III  a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth  If extravagant buildings such as the neo baroque Palais Garnier were built  the urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous  citation needed  For example  Baron Haussmann rebuilt Paris  The architecture associated to this era is named Second Empire in English  the term being taken from the Second French Empire  At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France  the associated architect was Eug ne Viollet le Duc  In the late 19th century  Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges  such as Garabit viaduct  and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time  although he is best remembered for the iconic Eiffel Tower  In the 20th century  Swiss Architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France  More recently  French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles  The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building  The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers  as they are visible from afar  For instance  in Paris  since 1977  new buildings had to be under 37 meters  or 121 feet  287  France s largest financial district is La Defense  where a significant number of skyscrapers are located  288  Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges  an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct  Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel or Paul Andreu  Literature Main article  French literature French literary figures  Clockwise from top left  Moli re is the most played author in the Com die Fran aise  289 Victor Hugo is one of the most important French novelists and poets  and is sometimes seen as the greatest French writer of all time  290  19th century poet  writer  and translator Charles Baudelaire  20th century philosopher and novelist Jean Paul Sartre  The earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages  when what is now known as modern France did not have a single  uniform language  There were several languages and dialects and each writer used his own spelling and grammar  citation needed  Some authors of French mediaeval texts are unknown  such as Tristan and Iseult and Lancelot and the Holy Grail  Other authors are known  for example Chr tien de Troyes and Duke William IX of Aquitaine  who wrote in Occitan  Much mediaeval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the Matter of France  such as The Song of Roland and the various chansons de geste  The Roman de Renart  written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude  tells the story of the mediaeval character Reynard   the Fox   and is another example of early French writing  An important 16th century writer was Fran ois Rabelais  whose novel Gargantua and Pantagruel has remained famous and appreciated until now  Michel de Montaigne was the other major figure of the French literature during that century  His most famous work  Essais  created the literary genre of the essay  291 French poetry during that century was embodied by Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay  Both writers founded the La Pl iade literary movement  During the 17th century  Madame de La Fayette published anonymously La Princesse de Cl ves  a novel that is considered to be one of the very first psychological novels of all times  292 Jean de La Fontaine is one of the most famous fabulist of that time  as he wrote hundreds of fables  some being far more famous than others  such as The Ant and the Grasshopper  Generations of French pupils had to learn his fables  that were seen as helping teaching wisdom and common sense to the young people  Some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbs  293  Jean Racine  whose incredible mastery of the alexandrine and of the French language has been praised for centuries  created plays such as Ph dre or Britannicus  He is  along with Pierre
