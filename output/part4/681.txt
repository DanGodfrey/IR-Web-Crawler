Territory  2  The four islands   named Pitcairn  Henderson  Ducie  and Oeno   are spread over several hundred miles of ocean and have a total land area of about 18 square miles  47 km2   Only Pitcairn  the second largest and measuring about 2 miles  3 2 km  across  is inhabited  The islands are best known as home of the descendants of the Bounty mutineers and the Tahitians  or Polynesians  who accompanied them  an event retold in numerous books and films  This history is still apparent in the surnames of many of the islanders  With only about 48 inhabitants 3   from four families as of 2010

article  History of the Pitcairn Islands The mutineers turning Bligh and part of the officers and crew adrift from the Bounty  29 April 1789 The original settlers of the Pitcairn Islands were Polynesians who appear to have lived on Pitcairn and Henderson for several centuries  Although archaeologists believe that Polynesians were living on Pitcairn as late as the 15th century  the islands were uninhabited when they were discovered by Europeans  5  Ducie and Henderson Islands were discovered by Portuguese sailor Pedro Fernandes de Queir s  sailing for the Spanish Crown  who arrived on 26 January 1606  He named them La Encarnaci n   The Incarnation   and San Juan Bautista   Saint John the Baptist    respectively  However  some sources express doubt about exactly which of the islands were visited and named by Queir s  suggesting that Queir s  La Encarnaci n may actually have been Henderson Island  and San Juan Bautista may have been Pitcairn Island  6  Pitcairn Island was sighted on 3 July 1767 by the crew of the British sloop HMS Swallow  commanded by Captain Philip Carteret  The island was named after Midshipman Robert Pitcairn  a fifteen year old crew member who was the first to sight the island  Robert Pitcairn was the son of British Marine Officer John Pitcairn  Geodesy Collection on Pitcairn Island Carteret  who sailed without the newly invented accurate marine chronometer  charted the island at 25  2  south and 133  21  west of Greenwich  but although the latitude was reasonably accurate  the longitude was incorrect by about 3   This made Pitcairn difficult to find  as highlighted by the failure of Captain James Cook to locate the island in July 1773  7  8   edit  Habitation Further information  Mutiny on the Bounty In 1790  nine of the mutineers from the Bounty and Tahitian companions  six men  11 women and a baby    some of whom may have been kidnapped from Tahiti   settled on Pitcairn Island and set fire to the Bounty  The wreck is still visible underwater in Bounty Bay  discovered in 1957 by National Geographic explorer Luis Marden  Although the settlers were able to survive by farming and fishing  the initial period of settlement was marked by serious tensions among the settlers  Alcoholism  murder  disease and other ills took the lives of most mutineers and Tahitian men  John Adams and Ned Young turned to the scriptures using the ship s Bible as their guide for a new and peaceful society  Young eventually died of an asthmatic infection  The Pitcairners also converted to Christianity  later they converted from their existing form of Christianity to Seventh day Adventism after a successful Adventist mission in the 1890s  After the rediscovery of Pitcairn  John Adams was granted amnesty for his mutiny  The Pitcairn islanders reported that it was not until 27 December 1795 that the first ship since the Bounty was seen from the island  but as it did not approach the land  they could not make out to what nation it belonged  A second appeared some time in 1801  but did not attempt to communicate with them  A third came sufficiently near to see their habitations  but did not venture to send a boat on shore  The American trading ship Topaz under the command of Mayhew Folger was the first to visit the island and communicate with them when they spent 10 hours at Pitcairn in February 1808  A report of Folger s find was forwarded to the Admiralty mentioning the mutineers and a more precise location of the island   25  2  S latitude  130  W longitude 9    however  this rediscovery was not known to Sir Thomas Staines  who commanded a Royal Navy flotilla of two ships  HMS Briton and HMS Tagus  which found the island at 25   4  S  by meridian observation  on 17 September 1814  Staines sent a party ashore and wrote a detailed report for the Admiralty  10  11  12  Ducie Island was rediscovered in 1791 by the British Captain Edwards aboard HMS Pandora  while searching for the Bounty mutineers  He named it after Francis Reynolds Moreton  3rd Baron Ducie  a captain in the Royal Navy  Henderson Island was rediscovered on 17 January 1819 by a British Captain James Henderson of the British East India Company ship Hercules  On 2 March 1819  Captain Henry King  sailing aboard the Elizabeth  landed on the island to find the king s colours already flying  His crew scratched the name of their ship into a tree  and for some years the island s name was Elizabeth or Henderson  Oeno Island was discovered on 26 January 1824 by U S  Captain George Worth aboard the whaler Oeno   edit  British colony Pitcairn Island became a British colony in 1838 and was among the first territories to extend voting rights to women  By the mid 1850s the Pitcairn community was outgrowing the island and its leaders appealed to the British government for assistance  They were offered Norfolk Island and on 3 May 1856  the entire community of 193 people set sail for Norfolk on board the Morayshire  arriving on 8 June after a miserable five week trip  But after eighteen months on Norfolk  seventeen of the Pitcairners returned to their home island  five years later another twenty seven did the same  In 1902  Henderson  Oeno and Ducie islands were annexed by Britain  Henderson on 1 July  Oeno on 10 July and Ducie on 19 December  13  In 1938  the three islands along with Pitcairn were formally incorporated into a single administrative unit called the  Pitcairn Group of Islands   Church of Adamstown Since a population peak of 233 in 1937  the island has been suffering from emigration  primarily to New Zealand  leaving some fifty people living on Pitcairn  December 2009  45 islanders on Electoral Roll   edit  Sexual assault trials of 2004 Main article  Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 In 2004  charges were laid against seven men living on Pitcairn and six living abroad after extensive trials  the men were convicted  some with multiple counts of sexual attacks of children  14  On 25 October 2004  six men were convicted  including Steve Christian  the island s mayor at the time  15  16  17  After the six men lost their final appeal  the British government set up a prison on the island at Bob s Valley  18  19  The men began serving their sentences in late 2006  By 2010  all had served their sentences or been granted home detention status  20  In 2010  the island received a new and updated constitution  21   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of the Pitcairn Islands Politics of the Pitcairn Islands takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic dependency  whereby the Mayor is the head of government  The territory s constitution is the Local Government Ordinance of 1964  In terms of population  the Pitcairn Islands is the smallest democracy in the world  The government s administrative offices are in Auckland  New Zealand  22   edit  Military The Pitcairn Islands are an overseas territory of the United Kingdom  meaning defence is the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence and Her Majesty s Armed Forces  3   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of the Pitcairn Islands View of Bounty Bay Map of Pitcairn Islands  The Pitcairn Islands form the southeasternmost extension of the geological archipelago of the Tuamotus of French Polynesia  and consist of four islands  Pitcairn Island  Oeno Island  atoll with five islets  one of which is Sandy Island   Henderson Island and Ducie Island  atoll with four islets   The only permanently inhabited island  Pitcairn  is accessible only by boat through Bounty Bay  Henderson Island  covering about 86  of the territory s total land area and supporting a rich variety of animals in its nearly inaccessible interior  is also capable of supporting a small human population  but access is difficult  owing to its outer shores  being steep limestone cliffs covered by sharp coral  The Pitcairn Islands were formed by a centre of upwelling magma called the Pitcairn hotspot  The other islands are at a distance of more than 100 km  62 mi  and are not habitable  Satellite photo of Pitcairn Island Island or atoll Type Land area  km   Total area  km   Pop  July 2011 Coordinates Ducie Island Atoll 0 7 3

also  List of birds of the Pitcairn Islands About nine plant species are thought to occur only on Pitcairn  These include tapau  formerly an important timber resource  and the giant nehe fern  Angiopteris chauliodonta   Some  such as red berry  Coprosma rapensis var  Benefica   are perilously close to extinction  The Pitcairn Islands are one of two places  the other being Mangareva  in the world in which the plant species Glochidion pitcairnense occurs  23  In terms of fauna  an interesting and rare introduction is the Galapagos giant tortoise  Testudo elephantopus   The sole surviving tortoise  Ms T  also known as Turpen   was one of five  which arrived on Pitcairn between 1937 and 1951  brought to the island by Irving Johnson  skipper of the 96 foot  29 m  Brigantine Yankee  Turpen usually resides at Tedside by Western Harbour  A protection order makes it an offence should anyone kill  injure  capture  maim or cause harm or distress to the tortoise  24  The birds of Pitcairn fall into several groups  These include seabirds  wading birds and a small number of resident land bird species  Of 20 breeding species  Henderson Island has 16  including the unique flightless Henderson Crake  Oeno 12  Ducie 13 and Pitcairn six  Of the birds breeding on Pitcairn the best known are the Fairy Tern  Common Noddy and Red tailed Tropicbird  The Pitcairn Reed warbler  known by Pitcairners as a  Sparrow   is endemic to Pitcairn Island  formerly common  it was placed on the endangered species list in 2008   edit  Important Bird Areas The four islands in the Pitcairn group have been identified by BirdLife International as separate Important Bird Areas  IBAs   Pitcairn Island itself is recognised because it is the only nesting site of the Pitcairn Reed warbler  Henderson Island is important for its endemic landbirds as well as its breeding seabirds  Oeno s ornithological significance derives principally from its Murphy s Petrel colony  Ducie is important for its colonies of Murphy s  Herald and Kermadec Petrels  and Christmas Shearwaters  25   edit  Economy Pitcairn Island as seen from a Globe view with other Pacific Islands  The fertile soil of the Pitcairn valleys  such as Isaac s Valley on the gentle slopes south east of Adamstown  produces a wide variety of fruits  including bananas  Pitkern  plun   papaya  paw paws   pineapples  mangoes  watermelons  rockmelons  passionfruit  breadfruit  coconuts  avocadoes  and citrus  including oranges  mandarins  grapefruit  lemons and limes   and vegetables include  sweet potatoes  kumura   carrots  sweet corn  tomatoes  taro  yams  peas  and beans  Arrowroot  Tacca leontopetaloides  and sugarcane are grown and harvested to produce arrowroot flour and molasses  Pitcairn Island is remarkably productive and its benign climate allows a wide range of tropical and temperate crops to be grown  26  Fish are plentiful in the seas around Pitcairn  Spiny lobster and a large variety of fish are caught for meals and for trading aboard passing ships  Almost every day someone will go fishing  whether it is from the rocks  from a longboat or diving with a spear gun  There are numerous types of fish around the island  Fish such as Nanwee  White Fish  Moi and Opapa are caught in shallow water  while Snapper  Big Eye and Cod are caught in deep water and Yellow Tail and Wahoo are caught by trolling  A range of minerals have been discovered within the Exclusive Economic Zone  EEZ   which extends 370 km offshore and comprises 880 000 km2  including manganese  iron  copper  gold  silver and zinc  27   edit  Souvenirs The Pitcairners are involved in creating crafts and curios  made out of wood from Henderson   Typical wood carvings include sharks  fish  whales  dolphins  turtles  vases  birds  walking sticks  book boxes and the famous models of the Bounty  Miro  Thespesia populnea   a dark  durable and beautifully grained wood  is preferred for carving  Islanders also produce exquisite tapa cloth and painted hattie leaves  28   edit  Coins and stamps The major sources of revenue  until recently  have been the sale of coins and postage stamps to collectors   pn domain names  and the sale of handicrafts to passing ships  most of which are plying the United Kingdom to New Zealand route via the Panama Canal  29  Trade is restricted by the jagged geography of the island  which lacks a harbour or airstrip  forcing all trade to be made by longboat to visiting ships  Occasionally  passengers from expedition type cruise ships will come ashore for a day  weather permitting  30  Tourism is the main focus for building the future economy focusing on small groups coming by charter vessel and staying at  home stays   Providing accommodation is a growing source of revenue and some have invested in building separate self contained units adjacent to their homes   edit  Honey production In 1998  the UK Government aid agency  the Department for International Development  funded an apiculture programme for Pitcairn which included training for Pitcairn s beekeepers and a detailed analysis of Pitcairn s bees and honey with particular regard to the presence or not of disease  Pitcairn  it was discovered  has one of the best examples of disease free bee populations anywhere in the world and the honey produced was and remains exceptionally high in quality  Pitcairn bees were also found to be a particularly placid variety and  within a short time  the beekeepers were able to work with them wearing minimal protection  The Telegraph  9 January 2010   As a result  Pitcairn today exports its renowned honey to New Zealand and to the United Kingdom  where it is stocked in London by Fortnum and Mason and Partridges in Sloane Square  The honey has become a favourite of Her Majesty  Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles  31  The Pitcairn Islanders  under the  Bounty Products  and  Delectable Bounty  brands  also export dried fruit including bananas  papayas  pineapples and mangoes to New Zealand  32   edit  Tourism Tourism plays a major role on Pitcairn providing the locals 80  of their annual income  Since 2009  the Government has been operating the MV Claymore II as the island s only dedicated passenger cargo vessel providing tourists with adventure tourism holidays to Pitcairn for three  or ten day visits  Tourists stay with local families and get to experience the island s history while contributing to the local economy  Some families have invested in private self contained units for tourists to rent  Each year approximately ten cruise ships call at the island for a few hours  generating income for the locals from the sale of souvenirs  landing fees and the stamping of passports  Children under the age of 16 years require a completed entry clearance application in order to visit the island  33   edit  Electricity Electricity on the island is provided by diesel generators operating ten hours per day  from 8 am to 1 pm  and from 5 pm to 10 pm   A wind power plant is planned to be installed to help reduce the high cost of power generation currently associated with the import of diesel  and provide 24 hour electricity to the islanders at 70 cents per unit clarification needed  with no government subsidy  citation needed   edit  Culture  edit  Language Main article  Languages of the Pitcairn Islands The majority of the resident Pitcairn Islanders are the descendants of the Bounty Mutineers and Tahitians  or Polynesians   Pitkern is a creole language derived from 18th century English  with elements of the Tahitian language  It is spoken as a first language by the population and is taught alongside standard English at the island s only school  It is closely related to the creole language Norfuk  spoken on Norfolk Island  because Norfolk was repopulated in the mid 19th century by Pitcairners   edit  Demographics In September 2003  a baby was born on the island for the first time in 17 years  Pitcairn Miscellany  2003   Another child  Adrianna Tracey Christian  was born on Pitcairn on 3 March 2007  Miscellany  2007   In February 2005  Shirley and Simon Young became the first married

Public Service Number in Ireland  which is required for work  taxes and social benefits  34   edit  Religion A successful Seventh day Adventist mission in the 1890s was important in shaping Pitcairn society  In recent years  the church has declined  with only about eight islanders worshipping regularly  but most of them still attend church on special occasions  35  The Sabbath is observed as a day of rest and as a mark of respect for observant Adventists  The church which was built in 1954  is run by the Church board and resident pastor  who usually serves a two year term  The Sabbath School meets at 10 am on Saturday mornings and is followed by Divine Service an hour later  On Tuesday evenings there is a further service in the form of a prayer meeting   edit  Society The once strict moral codes  which prohibited dancing  public displays of affection  smoking  and consumption of alcohol  have been relaxed in recent years  Islanders and visitors no longer require a six month licence to purchase  import  and consume alcohol  Pitcairn Island Government Ordinance   There is now one licensed cafe and bar on the island  and the Government Store sells alcohol and cigarettes

people and goods between ship and shore through Bounty Bay  The island has one small harbour and launch ramp that is used to dock and load long boats  Because it is small and the water is shallow  only small craft can fit  Pitkern Ilan  David Evans  2007   A dedicated passenger cargo supply ship chartered by the Pitcairn Island Government  the MV Claymore II  is the principal transport from
