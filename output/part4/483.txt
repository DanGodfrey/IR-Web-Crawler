economist  political philosopher  one of America s first constitutional lawyers and the first United States Secretary of the Treasury  As Secretary of the Treasury  Hamilton was the primary author of the economic policies of the George Washington Administration  especially the funding of the state debts by the Federal government  the establishment of a national bank  a system of tariffs  and friendly trade relations with Britain  He became the leader of the Federalist Party  created largely in support of his views  and was opposed by the Democratic Republican Party  led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison  Hamilton served in the American Revolutionary War  At the start of the war  he organized an artillery company and was chosen as its captain  He later became the senior 2 aide de camp and confidant to General George Washington  the American commander in chief  He served again under Washington in the army raised to defeat the Whiskey Rebellion  a tax revolt of western farmers in 1794  In 1798  Hamilton called for mobilization against France after the XYZ Affair  and secured an appointment as commander of a new army  which he trained for a war  3  However  the Quasi War  although hard fought at sea  was never officially declared  In the end  President John Adams found a diplomatic solution that avoided war  Of illegitimate birth and raised in the West Indies  Hamilton was effectively orphaned at about the age of 11  Recognized for his abilities and talent  he came to North America for his education  sponsored by people from his community  He attended King s College  now Columbia University   After the American Revolutionary War  Hamilton was elected to the Continental Congress from New York  He resigned to practice law  and founded the Bank of New York  Hamilton was among those dissatisfied with the first national constitution the Articles of Confederation  because it lacked a president  courts  and taxing powers  He became a driving force behind the Annapolis Convention which successfully called on Congress to issue a call for the Philadelphia Convention to create a new constitution  He was an active participant and played a major role in the ratification process by writing half of the Federalist Papers  to this day the single most important source for Constitutional interpretation  4  In the new government under President George Washington  he was appointed the Secretary of the Treasury  5  An admirer of British political systems  Hamilton was a nationalist who emphasized strong central government  and successfully argued that the implied powers of the Constitution could be used to fund the national debt  assume state debts  and create the government owned Bank of the United States  These programs were funded primarily by a tariff on imports and later also by a highly controversial excise tax on whiskey  Embarrassed when an extra marital affair with Maria Reynolds became public  Hamilton resigned from office in 1795 and returned to the practice of law in New York  However  he kept his hand in politics and was a powerful influence on the cabinet of President Adams  1797 1801   Hamilton s opposition to John Adams helped cause Adams  defeat in the 1800 elections  When Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied in the electoral college  Hamilton helped defeat his bitter personal enemy Burr and elect Jefferson as president  After opposing Adams  the candidate of his own party  Hamilton was left with few political friends  In 1804  as the next presidential election approached  Hamilton again opposed the candidacy of Burr  Taking offense at some of Hamilton s comments  Burr challenged him to a duel and mortally wounded Hamilton  who died within days  6  Contents 1 Childhood in the Caribbean 2

External links Childhood in the Caribbean Alexander Hamilton was born in Charlestown  the capital of the island of Nevis  in the Leeward Islands  Nevis was then one of the British West Indies  Hamilton was born out of wedlock to Rachel Faucette Buck  a married woman of partial French Huguenot descent  and James A  Hamilton  the fourth son of the Scottish laird Alexander Hamilton of Grange  Ayrshire  7  The birthplace and early childhood home of Alexander Hamilton  in Nevis  West Indies His mother moved with the infant Hamilton to St  Croix in the Virgin Islands  then ruled by Denmark  It is not certain whether the year of Hamilton s birth was 1757 or 1755  most historical evidence after Hamilton s arrival in North America supports the idea that he was born in 1757  and many historians had accepted this birth date  Hamilton s early life in the Caribbean was recorded in documents first published in Danish in 1930  this evidence has caused historians since then to opt for a birth year of 1755  8  Hamilton listed his birth year as 1757 when he first arrived in the Thirteen Colonies  He celebrated his birthday on January 11  In later life  he tended to give his age only in round figures  Probate papers from St  Croix in 1768  after the death of Hamilton s mother  list him as then 13 years old  9  a date that would support a birth year of 1755  Historians have explained the different birth years by the following  If 1755 is correct  Hamilton may have been trying to appear younger than his college classmates  or perhaps wished to avoid standing out as older  on the other hand  if 1757 is correct  the probate document indicating a birth year of 1755 may have been in error  or Hamilton may have been attempting to pass as 13  in order to be more employable after his mother s death  10  Hamilton in his youth Hamilton s mother had been married previously to Johann Michael Lavien of St  Croix  a much older merchant planter  who is described in some accounts as Danish Jewish  7  11  To escape this unhappy marriage  Rachel left her husband and first son  traveling to St  Kitts in 1750  where she met James Hamilton  12  Hamilton and Rachel moved together to Rachel s birthplace  Nevis  where she had inherited property from her father  8  Their two sons were James  Jr   and Alexander  Because Alexander Hamilton s parents were not legally married  the Church of England denied him membership and education in the church school  Hamilton received  individual tutoring  8  and classes in a private school led by a Jewish headmistress  13  Hamilton supplemented his education with a family library of thirty four books  14  including Greek and Roman classics  Hamilton s father James abandoned Rachel and their two sons  allegedly to  spar e   Rachel  a charge of bigamy        after finding out that her first husband  intend ed  to divorce her under Danish law on grounds of adultery and desertion   7  Rachel supported her family in St  Croix by keeping a small store in Christiansted  She contracted a severe fever and died on February 19  1768  1 02 am  leaving Hamilton effectively orphaned  This may have had severe emotional consequences for him  even by the standards of an eighteenth century childhood  15  In probate court  Rachel s  first husband seized her estate  7  and obtained the few valuables Rachel had owned  including some household silver  Many items were auctioned off  but a friend purchased the family books and returned them to the young Hamilton  16  Hamilton became a clerk at a local import export firm  Beekman and Cruger  which traded with New England  he was left in charge of the firm for five months in 1771  while the owner was at sea  He and his older brother James were adopted briefly by a cousin  Peter Lytton  but when Lytton committed suicide  the brothers were separated  17  James apprenticed with a local carpenter  while Alexander was adopted by a Nevis merchant  Thomas Stevens  Some evidence suggests that Stevens may have been Alexander Hamilton s biological father  his son  Edward Stevens  became a close friend of Hamilton  The two boys were described as looking much alike  were both fluent in French  and shared similar interests  18  Hamilton continued clerking  but he remained an avid reader  later developed an interest in writing  and began to desire a life outside the small island where he lived  He wrote an essay published in the Royal Danish American Gazette  a detailed account of a hurricane that had devastated Christiansted on August 30  1772  The essay impressed community leaders  who collected a fund to send the young Hamilton to the North American colonies for his education  19  Education Statue of Hamilton outside Hamilton Hall overlooking Hamilton Lawn at his alma mater  Columbia University in New York City In the autumn of 1772  Hamilton arrived by way of Boston  Massachusetts  at Elizabethtown Academy  a grammar school in Elizabethtown  New Jersey  In 1773 he studied with Francis Barber at Elizabethtown in preparation for college work  He came under the influence of a leading intellectual and revolutionary  William Livingston  with whom he lived for a time at his new house  Liberty Hall  20  Hamilton applied to the College of New Jersey  now Princeton University   asking to be allowed to study at a quicker pace and complete his studies in a shorter time  21  The college s Board of Trustees refused his request  7  21  22  Hamilton made a similar request to King s College in New York City  now Columbia University   was accepted  and entered the college in late 1773 or early 1774  23  Hamilton Lawn separates Hamilton Hall and John Jay Hall at Columbia University When the Church of England clergyman Samuel Seabury published a series of pamphlets promoting the Loyalist cause the following year  Hamilton responded with his first political writings   A Full Vindication of the Measures of Congress  and  The Farmer Refuted   He published two additional pieces attacking the Quebec Act 24  as well as fourteen anonymous installments of  The Monitor  for Holt s New York Journal  Although Hamilton was a supporter of the Revolutionary cause at this prewar stage  he did not approve of mob reprisals against Loyalists  On May 10  1775  Hamilton saved his college president Myles Cooper  a Loyalist  from an angry mob by speaking to the crowd long enough for Cooper to escape the danger  25  During the Revolutionary War Alexander Hamilton in the Uniform of the New York Artillery by Alonzo Chappel  1828 1887  Early military career In 1775  after the first engagement of American troops with the British in Boston  Hamilton joined a New York volunteer militia company called the Hearts of Oak  which included other King s College students  He drilled with the company  before classes  in the graveyard of nearby St  Paul s Chapel  Hamilton studied military history and tactics on his own and achieved the rank of lieutenant  Under fire from HMS Asia  he led a successful raid for British cannon in the Battery  the capture of which resulted in the Hearts of Oak becoming an artillery company thereafter  Through his connections with influential New York patriots such as Alexander McDougall and John Jay  he raised the New York Provincial Company of Artillery of sixty men in 1776  and was elected captain  It took part in the campaign of 1776 around New York City  particularly at the Battle of White Plains  at the Battle of Trenton  it was stationed at the high point of town  the meeting of the present Warren and Broad Streets  to keep the Hessians pinned in the Trenton Barracks  26  Washington s staff Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton  1787 Hamilton was invited to become an aide to Nathanael Greene and to Henry Knox  however  he declined these invitations  believing his best chance for improving his station in life was glory on the battlefield  Hamilton eventually received an invitation he felt he could not refuse  to serve as Washington s aide  with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel  27  Hamilton served for four years as Washington s chief of staff  He handled letters to Congress  state governors  and the most powerful generals in the Continental Army  he drafted many of Washington s orders and letters at the latter s direction  he eventually issued orders from Washington over Hamilton s own signature  2  Hamilton was involved in a wide variety of high level duties  including intelligence  diplomacy  and negotiation with senior army officers as Washington s emissary  28  The important duties with which he was entrusted attest to Washington s deep confidence in his abilities and character  then and afterward  At the points in their relationship when there was little personal attachment  there was still always a reciprocal confidence and respect  During the war  Hamilton became close friends with several fellow officers  His letters to the Marquis de Lafayette 29  and to John Laurens  employing the sentimental literary conventions of the late eighteenth century and alluding to Greek history and mythology  30  have been read as revealing a homosocial or perhaps homosexual relationship  but few historians agree  31  Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown by John Trumbull  oil on canvas  1820 Hamilton married Elizabeth Schuyler on December 14  1780  She was the daughter of Philip Schuyler  a general and wealthy landowner from one of the most prominent families in the state of New York  The marriage took place at Schuyler Mansion in Albany  New York  Hamilton was also extremely close to Eliza s older sister  Angelica  who eloped with John Barker Church  an Englishman who made a fortune in the American colonies during the Revolution  She returned with him to London after the war  where she later become a joint friend of Maria Cosway and Thomas Jefferson  While on Washington s staff  Hamilton long sought command in active combat  As the war drew nearer to a close  he knew that opportunities for military glory were fading  In February 1781  Hamilton was mildly reprimanded by Washington  and used this as an excuse to resign his staff position  He immediately began to ask Washington and others for a field command  This continued until early July 1781  when Hamilton submitted a letter to Washington with his commission enclosed   thus tacitly threatening to resign if he didn t get his desired command   32  On July 31  1781  Washington relented and assigned Hamilton as commander of a New York light infantry battalion  In the planning for the assault on Yorktown  Hamilton was given command of three battalions  which were to fight in conjunction with French troops in taking Redoubts No  9 and No  10 of the British fortifications at Yorktown  Hamilton and his battalions fought bravely and took Redoubt No  10 with bayonets  as planned  The French also fought bravely  took heavy casualties  and successfully took Redoubt  9  This action forced the British surrender of an entire army at Yorktown  effectively ending major British military operations in North America  33  Hamilton enters Congress After the Battle of Yorktown  Hamilton resigned his commission  He was elected in July 1782 to the Congress of the Confederation as a New York representative for the term beginning in November 1782  34  Hamilton supported congressmen such as Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris  his assistant Gouverneur Morris  no relation   along with James Wilson and James Madison  to provide the Congress with the independent source of revenue it lacked under the Articles of Confederation  While on Washington s staff  Hamilton had become frustrated with the decentralized nature of the wartime Continental Congress  particularly its dependence upon the states for financial support  Under the Articles of Confederation  Congress had no power to collect taxes or to demand money from the states  This lack of a stable source of funding had made it difficult for the Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and to pay its soldiers  During the war  and for some time after  Congress obtained what funds it could from subsidies from the King of France  from aid requested from the several states  which were often unable or unwilling to contribute   and from European loans  35  An amendment to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke  in February 1781  to give Congress the power to collect a 5  impost  or duty on all imports  but this required ratification by all states  securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782  Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind  Their report recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of financial autonomy  but also the ability to make laws that superseded those of the individual states  Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had the power to tax  since it had the power to fix the sums due from the several states  but Virginia s rescission of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations  36  Congress and the Army While Hamilton was in Congress  discontented soldiers began to pose a danger to the young United States  Most of the army was then posted at Newburgh  New York  Those in the army were paying for much of their own supplies  and they had not been paid in eight months  Furthermore  the Continental officers had been promised  in May 1778  after Valley Forge  a pension of half their pay when they were discharged  37  It was at this time that a group of officers organized under the leadership of General Henry Knox sent a delegation to lobby Congress  led by Capt  Alexander MacDougall  see above   The officers had three demands  the Army s pay  their own pensions  and commutation of those pensions into a lump sum payment  Several Congressmen  including Hamilton and the Morrises  attempted to use this Newburgh Conspiracy as leverage to secure independent support for funding for the federal government in Congress and from the states  They encouraged MacDougall to continue his aggressive approach  threatening unknown consequences if their demands were not met  and defeated proposals that would have resolved the crisis without establishing general federal taxation  that the states assume the debt to the army  or that an impost be established dedicated to the sole purpose of paying that debt  38  Hamilton suggested using the Army s claims to prevail upon the states for the proposed national funding system  39  The Morrises and Hamilton contacted Knox to suggest he and the officers defy civil authority  at least by not disbanding if the army were not satisfied  Hamilton wrote Washington to suggest that Hamilton covertly  take direction  of the officers  efforts to secure redress  to secure continental funding but keep the army within the limits of moderation  40  Washington wrote Hamilton back  declining to introduce the army  41  after the crisis had ended  he warned of the dangers of using the army as leverage to gain support for the national funding plan  42  On March 15  Washington defused the Newburgh situation by giving a speech to the officers  38  Congress ordered the Army officially disbanded in April 1783  In the same month  Congress passed a new measure for a twenty five year impost which Hamilton voted against  43  that again required the consent of all the states  it also approved a commutation of the officers  pensions to five years of full pay  Rhode Island again opposed these provisions  and Hamilton s robust assertions of national prerogatives in his previous letter were widely held to be excessive  44  The Continental Congress was never able to secure full ratification for back pay  pensions  or its own independent sources of funding  In June 1783  a different group of disgruntled soldiers from Lancaster  Pennsylvania  sent Congress a petition demanding their back pay  When they began to march toward Philadelphia  Congress charged Hamilton and two others with intercepting the mob  45  Hamilton requested militia from Pennsylvania s Supreme Executive Council  but was turned down  Hamilton instructed Assistant Secretary of War William Jackson to intercept the men  Jackson was unsuccessful  The mob arrived in Philadelphia  and the soldiers proceeded to harangue Congress for their pay  The President of Congress  John Dickinson  feared that the Pennsylvania state militia was unreliable  and refused its help  Hamilton argued that Congress ought to adjourn to Princeton  New Jersey  Congress agreed  and relocated there  46  Frustrated with the weakness of the central government  Hamilton while in Princeton drafted a call to revise the Articles of Confederation  This resolution contained many features of the future US Constitution  including a strong federal government with the ability to collect taxes and raise an army  It also included the separation of powers into the Executive  Legislative  and Judicial branches  47  Return to New York Hamilton resigned from Congress  and in July 1783 was admitted to the New York Bar after several months of self directed education  48  He practiced law in New York City in partnership with Richard Harison  He specialized in defending Tories and British subjects  as in Rutgers v  Waddington  in which he defeated a claim for damages done to a brewery by the Englishmen who held it during the military occupation of New York  He pleaded for the Mayor s Court to interpret state law consistent with the 1783 Treaty of Paris which had ended the Revolutionary War  49  In 1784  he founded the Bank of New York  now the oldest ongoing bank in the United States  Hamilton was one of the men who restored King s College  which had been suspended since 1776 and severely damaged during the War  as Columbia College  Long dissatisfied with the weak Articles of Confederation  he played a major leadership role at the Annapolis Convention in 1786  He drafted its resolution for a constitutional convention  and in doing so brought his longtime desire to have a more powerful  more financially independent federal government one step closer to reality  50  Constitution and Federalist Papers Further information  Federalist Papers Hamilton shortly after the American Revolution In 1787  Hamilton served as assemblyman from New York County in the New York State Legislature and was the first delegate chosen to the Constitutional Convention  Even though Hamilton had been a leader in calling for a new Constitutional Convention  his direct influence at the Convention itself was quite limited  Governor George Clinton s faction in the New York legislature had chosen New York s other two delegates  John Lansing and Robert Yates  and both of them opposed Hamilton s goal of a strong national government  Thus  whenever the other two members of the New York delegation were present  they decided New York s vote  and when they left the convention in protest  Hamilton remained but with no vote  since two representatives were required for any state to cast a vote  Early in the Convention he made a speech proposing a President for Life  it had no effect upon the deliberations of the convention  He proposed to have an elected President and elected Senators who would serve for life  contingent upon  good behavior  and subject to removal for corruption or abuse  this idea contributed later to the hostile view of Hamilton as a monarchist sympathizer  held by James Madison  During the convention  Hamilton constructed a draft for the Constitution based on the convention debates  but he never presented it  This draft had most of the features of the actual Constitution  including such details as the three fifths clause  In this draft  the Senate was to be elected in proportion to the population  being two fifths the size of the House  and the President and Senators were to be elected through complex multistage elections  in which chosen electors would elect smaller bodies of electors  they would hold office for life  but were removable for misconduct  The President would have an absolute veto  The Supreme Court was to have immediate jurisdiction over all law suits involving the United States  and state governors were to be appointed by the federal government  51  At the end of the Convention  Hamilton was still not content with the final form of the Constitution  but signed it anyway as a vast improvement over the Articles of Confederation  and urged his fellow delegates to do so also  52  Since the other two members of the New York delegation  Lansing and Yates  had already withdrawn  Hamilton was the only New York signer to the United States Constitution  He then took a highly active part in the successful campaign for the document s ratification in New York in 1788  which was a crucial step in its national ratification  Hamilton recruited John Jay and James Madison to write a series of essays defending the proposed Constitution  now known as the Federalist Papers  and made the largest contribution to that effort  writing 51 of 85 essays published  Madison wrote 29  Jay only five   Hamilton s essays and arguments were influential in New York state  and elsewhere  during the debates over ratification  The Federalist Papers are more often cited than any other primary source by jurists  lawyers  historians  and political scientists as the major contemporary interpretation of the Constitution  53  In 1788  Hamilton served yet another term in what proved to be the last session of the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation  When the term of Hamilton s father in law Phillip Schuyler was up in 1791  elected in his place was the attorney general of New York  one Aaron Burr  Hamilton blamed Burr for this result  and ill characterizations of Burr appear in his correspondence thereafter  The two men did work together from time to time thereafter on various projects  including Hamilton s army of 1798 and the Manhattan Water Company  54  Secretary of the Treasury President George Washington appointed Hamilton as the first United States Secretary of the Treasury on September 11  1789  He left office on the last day of January 1795  Much of the structure of the government of the United States was worked out in those five years  beginning with the structure and function of the cabinet itself  Forrest McDonald argues that Hamilton saw his office  like that of the British First Lord of the Treasury  as the equivalent of a Prime Minister  Hamilton would oversee his colleagues under the elective reign of George Washington  Washington did request Hamilton s advice and assistance on matters outside the purview of the Treasury Department  In the next two years  Hamilton submitted five reports  First Report on the Public Credit  Communicated to the House of Representatives  January 14  1790  Operations of the Act Laying Duties on Imports  Communicated to the House of Representatives  April 23  1790  Second Report on Public Credit   Report on a National Bank  Communicated to the House of Representatives  December 14  1790  Report on the Establishment of a Mint  Communicated to the House of Representatives  January 28  1791  Report on Manufactures  Communicated to the House of Representatives  December 5  1791  Report on Public Credit In the Report on Public Credit  the Secretary made a controversial proposal that would have the federal government assume state debts incurred during the Revolution  55  This would give the federal government much more power by placing the country s most serious financial obligation in the hands of the federal government rather than the state governments  The primary criticism of the plan was from Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson 55  and Representative James Madison  Some states  such as Jefferson s Virginia  had paid almost half of their debts  and felt that their taxpayers should not be assessed again to bail out the less provident  They further argued that the plan passed beyond the scope of the new Constitutional government  Madison objected to Hamilton s proposal to lower the rate of interest and postpone payments on federal debt as not being payment in full  he also objected to the speculative profits being made  Much of the national debt was in the form of bonds issued to Continental veterans  in place of wages the Continental Congress did not have the money to pay  As the bonds continued to go unpaid  many had been pawned for a small fraction of their value  Madison proposed to pay in full  but to divide payment between the original recipient and the present possessor  Others  such as Samuel Livermore of New Hampshire  wished to curb speculation  and reduce taxation  by paying only part of the bond  The disagreements between Madison and Hamilton extended to other proposals Hamilton made to Congress  and drew in Jefferson when he returned from serving as minister to France  Hamilton s supporters became known as Federalists and Jefferson s as Republicans  As Madison put it   I deserted Colonel Hamilton  or rather Colonel H  deserted me  in a word  the divergence between us took place from his wishing to administration  or rather to administer the Government into what he thought it ought to be     56  Hamilton eventually secured passage of his assumption plan by striking a deal with Jefferson and Madison  Hamilton would use his influence to place the permanent national capital on the Potomac River  and Jefferson and Madison would encourage their friends to back Hamilton s assumption plan  In the end  Hamilton s assumption  together with his proposals for funding the debt  overcame legislative opposition and narrowly passed the House on July 26  1790  57  Founding the US Mint Hamilton helped found the United States Mint  the first national bank  and an elaborate system of duties  tariffs  and excises  Within five years  the complete Hamiltonian program had replaced the chaotic financial system of the Confederation era with a modern apparatus that gave the new government financial stability and investors sufficient confidence to invest in government bonds  Revenue Cutter Service Hamilton developed a  System of Cutters   forming the Revenue Cutter Service   later combined with other government entities to form the United States Coast Guard   Coast Guard vessels are still referred to as  Cutters  today  Sources of revenue One of the principal sources of revenue Hamilton prevailed upon Congress to approve was an excise tax on whiskey  Strong opposition to the whiskey tax by cottage producers in remote  rural regions erupted into the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794  in Western Pennsylvania and western Virginia  whiskey was the basic export product and was fundamental to the local economy  In response to the rebellion  believing compliance with the laws was vital to the establishment of federal authority  Hamilton accompanied to the rebellion s site President Washington  General Henry  Light Horse Harry  Lee  and more federal troops than were ever assembled in one place during the Revolution  This overwhelming display of force intimidated the leaders of the insurrection  ending the rebellion virtually without bloodshed  58  Manufacturing and industry Statue of Hamilton by Franklin Simmons  overlooking the Great Falls of the Passaic River in Paterson  New Jersey  where Hamilton envisioned using the falls to power new factories Hamilton s next report was his  Report on Manufactures   Congress shelved the report without much debate  except for Madison s objection to Hamilton s formulation of the General Welfare clause  which Hamilton construed liberally as a legal basis for his extensive programs   The Report has been often quoted by protectionists since  59  In 1791  while still Secretary of the Treasury  Hamilton worked in a private capacity to help found the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures  a private corporation that would use the power of the Great Falls of the Passaic River in New Jersey to operate mills  Although the company did not succeed in its original purpose  it leased the land around the falls to other mill ventures and continued to operate for over a century and a half  Emergence of parties During Hamilton s tenure as Treasury Secretary  political factions began to emerge  A Congressional caucus  led by James Madison and William Branch Giles  began as an opposition group to Hamilton s financial programs  and Thomas Jefferson joined this group when he returned from France  Hamilton and his allies began to call themselves Federalists  The opposition group  now called the Democratic Republican Party by political scientists  was at the time known as Republicans   60  Hamilton assembled a nationwide coalition to garner support for the Administration  including the expansive financial programs Hamilton had made Administration policy and especially the president s policy of neutrality in the European war between Britain and France  Hamilton s public relations campaign attacked the French minister Edmond Charles Gen t  he called himself as  Citizen Gen t   who tried to appeal to voters directly  which Federalists denounced as foreign interference in American affairs  61  The Jeffersonian Republicans opposed banks and cities  and favored France  They built their own national coalition to oppose the Federalists  Both sides gained the support of local political factions  each side developed its own partisan newspapers  Noah Webster  John Fenno  and William Cobbett were energetic editors for the Federalists  Benjamin Franklin Bache and Philip Freneau were fiery Republican editors  All the newspapers were characterized by intense personal attacks  major exaggerations and invented claims  In 1801  Hamilton established a daily newspaper  the New York Evening Post and brought in William Coleman as editor  It is still publishing  as the New York Post   62  Jay Treaty and Britain Main article  Jay Treaty When France and Britain went to war in early 1793  all four members of the Cabinet were consulted on what to do  They and Washington unanimously agreed to remain neutral  and to send Genet home  63  However  in 1794 policy toward Britain became a major point of contention between the two parties  Hamilton and the Federalists wished for more trade with Britain  the new nation s largest trading partner  The Republicans saw Britain as the main threat to republicanism and proposed instead a trade war  To avoid war  Washington sent Chief Justice John Jay to negotiate with the British  Hamilton largely wrote Jay s instructions  The result was Jay s Treaty  It was denounced by the Republicans but Hamilton mobilized support up and down the land  64  The Jay Treaty passed the Senate in 1795 by exactly the required two thirds majority  The Treaty resolved issues remaining from the Revolution  averted war  and made possible ten years of peaceful trade between the United States and Britain  65  Historian George Herring notes the  remarkable and fortuitous economic and diplomatic gains  produced by the Treaty  66  Several European nations had formed a League of Armed Neutrality against incursions on their neutral rights  the Cabinet was also consulted on whether the United States should join it  and decided not to  It kept that decision secret  but Hamilton revealed it in private to George Hammond  the British Minister to the United States  without telling Jay or anyone else   His act remained unknown until Hammond s dispatches were read in the 1920s   This  amazing revelation  may have had limited effect on the negotiations  Jay did threaten to join the League at one point  but the British had other reasons not to view the League as a serious threat  67  The Reynolds affair In 1791  Hamilton became involved in an affair with Maria Reynolds that badly damaged his reputation  Reynolds s complicit husband  James  blackmailed Hamilton for money by threatening to inform Hamilton s wife  When James Reynolds was arrested for counterfeiting  he contacted several prominent members of the Democratic Republican Party  most notably James Monroe and Aaron Burr  touting that he could expose a top level official for corruption  Presuming that James Reynolds could implicate Hamilton in an abuse of his position in Washington s Cabinet  they interviewed Hamilton with their suspicions  Hamilton insisted he was innocent of any misconduct in public office  but admitted to an affair with Maria Reynolds  Since this was not germane to Hamilton s conduct in office  Hamilton s interviewers did not publish about Reynolds  When rumors began spreading after his retirement  Hamilton published a confession of his affair  shocking his family and supporters by not merely confessing but also by inexplicably narrating the affair at an unexpected level of detail  This public revelation damaged Hamilton s reputation for the rest of his life  1796 presidential election Hamilton s resignation as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795 did not remove him from public life  With the resumption of his law practice  he remained close to Washington as an advisor and friend  Hamilton influenced Washington in the composition of his Farewell Address  Washington and members of his Cabinet often consulted with him  In the election of 1796  under the Constitution as it stood then  each of the presidential electors had two votes  which they were to cast for different men  The one who received most votes would become President  the second most  Vice President  This system was not designed with the operation of parties in mind  as they had been thought disreputable and factious  The Federalists planned to deal with this by having all their Electors vote for John Adams  the Vice President  and all but a few for Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina  who was on his way home from being Minister to Spain  where he had negotiated a popular treaty   Jefferson chose Aaron Burr as his vice presidential running mate  Adams resented Hamilton s influence with Washington and considered him overambitious and scandalous in his private life  Hamilton compared Adams unfavorably with Washington and thought him too emotionally unstable to be President  Hamilton took the election as an opportunity  he urged all the northern electors to vote for Adams and Pinckney  lest Jefferson get in  but he cooperated with Edward Rutledge to have South Carolina s electors vote for Jefferson and Pinckney  If all this worked  Pinckney would have more votes than Adams  Pinckney would become President  and Adams would remain Vice President  but it did not work  The Federalists found out about it  even the French minister to the United States knew   and northern Federalists voted for Adams but not for Pinckney  in sufficient numbers that Pinckney came in third and Jefferson became Vice President  68  Adams resented the intrigue  since he felt his service to the nation was much more extensive than Pinckney s  69  Quasi War During the Quasi War of 1798 1800  and with Washington s strong endorsement  Adams reluctantly appointed Hamilton a major general of the army  essentially placing him in command  since Washington could no longer leave Mt  Vernon   If full scale war broke out with France  Hamilton argued that the army should conquer the North American colonies of France s ally  Spain  bordering the United States  70  To fund this army  Hamilton had been writing incessantly to Oliver Wolcott  Jr   his successor at the Treasury  William Loughton Smith  of the House Ways and Means Committee  and Senator Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts  He directed them to pass a direct tax to fund the war  Smith resigned in July 1797  as Hamilton scolded him for slowness  and told Wolcott to tax houses instead of land  71  The eventual program included a Stamp Act like that of the British before the Revolution and other taxes on land  houses  and slaves  calculated at different rates in different states  and requiring difficult and intricate assessment of houses  This provoked resistance in southeastern Pennsylvania  led primarily by men who had marched with Washington against the Whiskey Rebellion  such as John Fries  72  Hamilton aided in all areas of the army s development  and officially served as the Senior Officer of the United States Army as a Major General from December 14  1799  to June 15  1800  The army was to guard against invasion from France  Hamilton also suggested that its strategy involve marching into the possessions of Spain  then allied with France  and potentially even taking Louisiana and Mexico  His correspondence further suggests that when he returned in military glory  he dreamed of setting up a properly energetic government  without any Jeffersonians  Adams  however  derailed all plans for war by opening negotiations with France  73  Adams had also held it proper to retain the members of Washington s cabinet  except for cause  he found  in 1800  after Washington s death   that they were obeying Hamilton rather than himself  and fired several of them  74  1800 presidential election Statue of Hamilton in the United States Capitol rotunda Main article  United States presidential election  1800 In the 1800 election  Hamilton worked to defeat not only the rival Democratic Republican candidates  but also his party s own nominee  John Adams  In November 1799  the Alien and Sedition Acts had left one Democratic Republican newspaper functioning in New York City  when the last one  the New Daily Advertiser  reprinted an article saying that Hamilton had attempted to purchase the Philadelphia Aurora and close it down  Hamilton had the publisher prosecuted for seditious libel  and the prosecution compelled Mr  Greenleaf to close it  75  Aaron Burr had won New York for Jefferson in May  Hamilton proposed a rerun of the election under different rules  with carefully drawn districts  each choosing an elector  76  so that the Federalists would split the electoral vote of New York  John Jay  a Federalist  who had given up the Supreme Court to be Governor of New York  wrote on the back of the letter the words   Proposing a measure for party purposes which it would not become me to adopt   and declined to reply  77  John Adams was running this time with Thomas Pinckney s elder brother Charles Cotesworth Pinckney  Hamilton  however  toured New England  again urging northern electors to hold firm for this Pinckney  in the renewed hope of making Pinckney President  and he again intrigued in South Carolina  This time  the important reaction was from the Jeffersonian electors  all of whom voted both for Jefferson and Burr to ensure that no such deal would result in electing a Federalist   Burr had received only one vote from Virginia in 1796   In September  Hamilton wrote a pamphlet called Letter from Alexander Hamilton  Concerning the Public Conduct and Character of John Adams  Esq  President of the United States that was highly critical of Adams  though it closed with a tepid endorsement  He mailed this to two hundred leading Federalists  when a copy fell into the Democratic Republicans  hands  they printed it  This hurt Adams s 1800 reelection campaign and split the Federalist Party  virtually assuring the victory of the Democratic Republican Party  led by Jefferson  in the election of 1800  it destroyed Hamilton s position among the Federalists  78  On the Federalist side  Governor Arthur Fenner of Rhode Island denounced these  jockeying tricks  to make Pinckney President  and one Rhode Island elector voted for Adams and Jay  Jefferson and Burr tied for first and second  Pinckney came in fourth  79  Jefferson had beaten Adams  but both he and his running mate  Aaron Burr  had received 73 votes in the Electoral College  With Jefferson and Burr tied  the United States House of Representatives had to choose between the two men   As a result of this election  the Twelfth Amendment was proposed and ratified  adopting the method under which presidential elections are held today   Several Federalists who opposed Jefferson supported Burr  and for the first 35 ballots  Jefferson was denied a majority  Before the 36th ballot  Hamilton threw his weight behind Jefferson  supporting the arrangement reached by James A  Bayard of Delaware  in which five Federalist Representatives from Maryland and Vermont abstained from voting  allowing those states  delegations to go for Jefferson  ending the impasse and electing Jefferson President rather than Burr  Even though Hamilton did not like Jefferson and disagreed with him on many issues  he was quoted as saying   At least Jefferson was honest   Hamilton felt that Burr was dangerous  Burr then became Vice President of the United States  When it became clear that he would not be asked to run again with Jefferson  Burr sought the New York governorship in 1804 with Federalist support  against the Jeffersonian Morgan Lewis  but was defeated by forces including Hamilton  80  In 1801  Hamilton announced his intention to withdraw from the Federalist Party if Burr became its presidential candidate in 1804  In 1802  he began to organize  The Christian Constitutional Society   the first principle of which  even before supporting the Constitution  was  the support of the Christian religion   81  Burr Hamilton duel Hamilton fighting his fatal duel with Vice President Aaron Burr  the depiction is inaccurate  only the two  seconds  actually witnessed the duel  Hamilton s tomb in the graveyard of Trinity Church at Wall Street and Broadway in Lower Manhattan Main article  Burr Hamilton duel Soon after the 1804 gubernatorial election in New York in which Morgan Lewis  greatly assisted by Hamilton  defeated Aaron Burr the Albany Register published Charles D  Cooper s letters  citing Hamilton s opposition to Burr and alleging that Hamilton had expressed  a still more despicable opinion  of the Vice President at an upstate New York dinner party  82  83  Burr  sensing an attack on his honor  and surely still stung by his political defeat  demanded an apology  Hamilton refused because he could not recall the instance  Following an exchange of three testy letters  and despite attempts of friends to avert a confrontation  a duel was scheduled for July 11  1804  along the west bank of the Hudson River on a rocky ledge in Weehawken  New Jersey  This was the same dueling site at which Hamilton s eldest son  Philip  had been killed three years earlier  At dawn  the duel began  and Vice President Aaron Burr shot Hamilton  Hamilton s shot broke a tree branch directly above Burr s head  A letter that he wrote the night before the duel states   I have resolved  if our interview  duel  is conducted in the usual manner  and it pleases God to give me the opportunity  to reserve and throw away my first fire  and I have thoughts even of reserving my second fire   thus asserting an intention to miss Burr  The circumstances of the duel  and Hamilton s actual intentions  are still disputed  Neither of the seconds  Pendleton or Van Ness  could determine who fired first  Soon after  they measured and triangulated the shooting  but could not determine from which angle Hamilton fired  Burr s shot  however  hit Hamilton in the lower abdomen above the right hip  The bullet ricocheted off Hamilton s second or third false rib  fracturing it and caused considerable damage to his internal organs  particularly his liver and diaphragm before becoming lodged in his first or second lumbar vertebra  Chernow considers the circumstances to indicate that Burr fired second  after having taken deliberate aim  If a duelist decided not to aim at his opponent there was a well known procedure  available to everyone involved  for doing so  According to Freeman  Hamilton apparently did not follow this procedure  if he had  Burr might have followed suit  and Hamilton s death might have been avoided  It was a matter of honor among gentlemen to follow these rules  Because of the high incidence of septicemia and death resulting from torso wounds  a high percentage of duels employed this procedure of throwing away fire  82  Years later  when told that Hamilton may have misled him at the duel  the ever laconic Burr replied   Contemptible  if true   84  The paralyzed Hamilton  who knew himself to be mortally wounded  was ferried back to New York 85  and taken to the Greenwich Village home of his friend William Bayard Jr   who had been waiting on the dock  After final visits from his family and friends and considerable suffering  Hamilton died on the following afternoon  July 12  1804 at Bayard s home at what is now 80 82 Jane Street  86 Gouverneur Morris  a political ally of Hamilton s  gave the eulogy at his funeral and secretly established a fund to support his widow and children  Hamilton was buried in the Trinity Churchyard Cemetery in Manhattan  Legacy Alexander Hamilton on the Series 2004A  10 Federal Reserve Note  based on an 1805 portrait by John Trumbull The Hamilton Grange National Memorial  now located in St  Nicholas Park  The Grange is the only home Hamilton ever owned and is where he was living at the time of his death  Hamilton s interpretations of the Constitution set forth in the Federalist Papers remain highly influential  as seen in scholarly studies and court decisions  87  From his first days as a cabinet member Hamilton set a precedent by formulating federal programs  writing them as reports  pushing for their approval by arguing for them in person on the floor of the United States Congress  and then implementing them  Hamilton and the other Cabinet members were vital to Washington  as there was no executive branch under the Articles of Confederation  and the Cabinet itself is unmentioned in the Constitution that succeeded it  Though the Constitution was ambiguous as to the exact balance of power between national and state governments  Hamilton consistently took the side of greater federal power at the expense of the states  88  As Secretary of the Treasury  he established against the intense opposition of Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson the country s first national bank  Hamilton justified the creation of this bank  and other increased federal powers  under Congress s constitutional powers to issue currency  to regulate interstate commerce  and to do anything else that would be   Necessary and proper clause necessary and proper   to enact the provisions of the Constitution  Jefferson  on the other hand  took a stricter view of the Constitution  parsing the text carefully  he found no specific authorization for a national bank  This controversy was eventually settled by the Supreme Court of the United States in McCulloch v  Maryland  which in essence adopted Hamilton s view  granting the federal government broad freedom to select the best means to execute its constitutionally enumerated powers  specifically the doctrine of implied powers  Hamilton s policies as Secretary of the Treasury greatly affected the United States government and still continue to influence it  His constitutional interpretation  specifically of the Necessary and Proper Clause  set precedents for federal authority that are still used by the courts and are considered an authority on constitutional interpretation  The prominent French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand  who spent 1794 in the United States  wrote   I consider Napoleon  Fox  and Hamilton the three greatest men of our epoch  and if I were forced to decide between the three  I would give without hesitation the first place to Hamilton   adding that Hamilton had intuited the problems of European conservatives  Talleyrand  who helped demolish the First French Republic  would have preferred to have a coalition of European monarchies curtail the solitary republicanism of the United States  which would permit the peaceful recreation of the French colonial empire of Louis XIV  he believed himself and Hamilton in general agreement  89  Opinions of Hamilton have run the gamut  both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson viewed him as unprincipled and dangerously aristocratic  Aaron Burr and Hamilton became personal enemies  Herbert Croly  Henry Cabot Lodge  and Theodore Roosevelt directed attention to him at the end of the 19th century in the interest of an active federal government  whether or not supported by tariffs  Several nineteenth  and twentieth century Republicans entered politics by writing laudatory biographies of Hamilton  90  While scholars are not unanimous  Princeton historian Sean Wilentz in 2010 identified a scholarly trend very much in Hamilton s favor   In recent years  Hamilton and his reputation have decidedly gained the initiative among scholars who portray him as the visionary architect of the modern liberal capitalist economy and of a dynamic federal government headed by an energetic executive  Jefferson and his allies  by contrast  have come across as na ve  dreamy idealists  At best according to many historians  the Jeffersonians were reactionary utopians who resisted the onrush of capitalist modernity in hopes of turning America into a yeoman farmers  arcadia  At worst  they were proslavery racists who wish to rid the West of Indians  expand the empire of slavery  and keep political power in local hands   all the better to expand the institution of slavery and protect slaveholders  rights to own human property   91  Monuments and memorials By the time of the American Civil War  Hamilton s portrait began to appear on US currency  including the  2   5   10  and  50 notes  His likeness also began to appear on US postage in 1870  His portrait has continued to appear on US postage and currency  and most notably appears on the modern  10 bill  Hamilton also appears on the  500 Series EE Savings Bond  The source of the face on the  10 bill is John Trumbull s 1805 portrait of Hamilton  in the portrait collection of New York City Hall  92  On the south side of the Treasury Building in Washington is a statue of Hamilton  On March 19  1956  the United States Postal Service issued the  5 Liberty Issue postage stamp honoring Hamilton  The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr   which he built on his 32 acre country estate in Harlem in upper Manhattan  He named the house which was completed in 1802  the  Grange  after his grandfather Alexander s estate in Ayrshire  Scotland  The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E  Davis  a British born real estate developer for  25 000  Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis  Hamilton Holly House  in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander Hamilton Jr  The historic structure  first moved from its original location in 1889  was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St  Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate  The Grange was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011  and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial  93  94  95  Family Grave of Eliza Schuyler Hamilton  1757 1854  at Trinity Church Hamilton s widow  Elizabeth  known as Eliza or Betsy   survived him for fifty years  until she died in Washington  D C  in 1854  Hamilton referred to her as the  best of wives and best of women   An extremely religious woman  Eliza spent much of her life working to help widows and orphans  She co founded New York s first private orphanage  the New York Orphan Asylum Society  Despite the Reynolds affair  Alexander and Eliza were very close  and as a widow she always strove to guard his reputation and enhance his standing in American history  Hamilton and Elizabeth had eight children  including two named Phillip  The elder Philip  Hamilton s first child  born January 22  1782   was killed in 1801 in a duel with George I  Eacker  whom he had publicly insulted in a Manhattan theater  The second Philip  Hamilton s last child  was born on June 2  1802  right after the first Philip was killed  Their other children were Angelica  born September 25  1784  Alexander  born May 16  1796  James Alexander  April 14  1788   September 1878   96 John Church  born August 22  1792  William Stephen  born August 4  1797  and Eliza  born November 26  1799  citation needed  On slavery Hamilton  often in close association with his friend John Jay was a leader in the anti slavery movement in New York City  The main goals of the New York Manumission Society was to abolish the city s role in the international slave trade  and to pass legislation that would permanently end slavery in New York State  Both goals were accomplished by 1799  97  Hamilton s first polemic against King George s ministers contains a paragraph that speaks of the evils that  slavery  to the British would bring upon the Americans  McDonald sees this as an attack on actual slavery  98  During the Revolutionary War  Hamilton took the lead in proposals to arm slaves  free them  and compensate their masters  In 1779  Hamilton worked closely with his friend John Laurens of South Carolina to propose that such a unit be formed  under Laurens  command  Hamilton proposed to the Continental Congress to create up to four battalions of slaves for combat duty  and free them  Congress recommended that South Carolina  and Georgia  acquire up to three thousand slaves  if they saw fit  In the end nothing happened  even though the South Carolina governor and Congressional delegation had supported the plan in Philadelphia  99  Letter from Alexander Hamilton  1779 Hamilton argued that blacks  natural faculties were as good as those of free whites  and he warned that the British would arm the slaves if the patriots did not  Chernow cites this incident as evidence that Hamilton and Laurens saw the Revolution and the struggle against slavery as inseparable  100  Hamilton attacked his political opponents as demanding freedom for themselves and refusing to allow it to blacks  101  In January 1785  he attended the second meeting of the New York Manumission Society  NYMS   Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president  102  Chernow notes how the membership soon included many of Hamilton s friends and associates  He was a member of the committee of the society that petitioned the legislature to end the slave trade  and that succeeded in passing legislation banning the export of slaves from New York  103  however  three months later  Hamilton returned a fugitive slave to Henry Laurens of South Carolina  104  Hamilton never supported forced emigration for freed slaves  it has been argued from this that he would be comfortable with a multiracial society  and that this distinguished him from his contemporaries  105  In international affairs  he supported Toussaint L Ouverture s black government in Haiti after the revolt that overthrew French control  as he had supported aid to the slaveowners in 1791 both measures hurt France  106  Hamilton may have owned household slaves himself  the evidence for this is indirect  McDonald interprets it as referring to paid employees   He supported a gag rule to keep divisive discussions of slavery out of Congress  He opposed the compromise at the 1787 Constitutional Convention by which the federal government could not abolish the slave trade for 20 years  and was disappointed when he lost that argument  107  On economics Alexander Hamilton is sometimes considered the  patron saint  of the American School of economic philosophy that  according to one historian  dominated economic policy after 1861  108  He firmly supported government intervention in favor of business  after the manner of Jean Baptiste Colbert  as early as the fall of 1781  109  Hamilton opposed the British ideas of free trade  which he believed skewed benefits to colonial and imperial powers  in favor of US protectionism  which he believed would help develop the fledgling nation s emerging economy  Henry C  Carey was inspired by his writings  Some say who   he influenced the ideas and work of the German Friedrich List  From the 1860s onwards members of Japan s Meiji leadership  after touring America s post Civil War political and industrial landscape  embraced Hamilton s words and work as being applicable to their own need to modernize  Within the Grant Administration they found Hamiltonian advocates who opened up American financial and manufacturing operations for Japanese inspection  The Meiji leadership sent their sons to study American finance and industry in New York  New Jersey  Philadelphia  and other centers of commerce  These Japanese leaders found Hamilton s words and work also being used by Bismarck s administration in Germany  having been brought to Germany by Friedrich List in the 1840s after List had spent time in exile in Philadelphia  Later Hamilton s reports to Congress could be found in libraries not only in Japan but in Taiwan and Korea  after they came under the colonial rule of Meiji Japan  Post 1945 leaders in both countries  i e   South Korea  used Hamilton s Report on Credit to establish their own modern financial systems  Austin  2009   Hamilton s religion During much of his life  Hamilton remained quite religious  110  Biographer Ron Chernow argues that this was the source of his aggressive abolitionism  Hamilton  as a youth in the West Indies  was an orthodox and conventional Presbyterian of the  New Light  evangelical type  as opposed to the  Old Light  Calvinists   he was being taught by a student of John Witherspoon  a moderate of the New School  111  He wrote two or three hymns  which were published in the local newspaper  112  Robert Troup  his college roommate  noted that Hamilton was  in the habit of praying on his knees night and morning   113  From 1777 to 1792  Hamilton appears to have been completely indifferent  and made jokes about God at the Constitutional Convention  114  During the French Revolution  he had an  opportunistic religiosity   using Christianity for political ends and insisting that Christianity and Jefferson s democracy were incompatible  114  After his misfortunes of 1801  Hamilton further asserted the truth of Christianity  he also proposed a Christian Constitutional Society in 1802  to take hold of  some strong feeling of the mind  to elect  fit men  to office  and he wrote of  Christian welfare societies  for the poor  He was not a member of any denomination  After being shot  Hamilton spoke of his belief in God s mercy  and of his desire to renounce dueling  Bishop Moore administered communion to Hamilton  115  Hamilton on US postage The first postage stamp to honor Hamilton was issued by the US Post Office in 1870  The portrayals on the 1870 and 1888 issues are from the same engraved die  which was modeled after a bust of Hamilton by Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi 116  The Hamilton 1870 issue was the first US Postage stamp to honor a Secretary of the Treasury  The 3 cent red commemorative issue  which was released on the 200th anniversary of Hamilton s birth in 1957  includes a rendition of the Federal Hall building  located in New York City  117  1870 1888 1956 1957 Memorials Hamilton s statue on the south side of the treasury building  Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton Oneida Academy in New York state  When the Academy received a college charter in 1812  the school was formally renamed Hamilton College  There is a prominent statue of Alexander Hamilton in front of the school s chapel  commonly referred to as the  Al Ham  statue  and the Burke Library has an extensive collection of Hamilton s personal documents  Columbia University  Hamilton s alma mater  has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City  The college s main classroom building for the humanities is Hamilton Hall  and a large statue of Hamilton stands in front of it  The university press has published his complete works in a multivolume letterpress edition  Columbia University s student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates is named the Alexander Hamilton Society  The main administration building of the Coast Guard Academy in New London  CT  is named Hamilton Hall to commemorate Hamilton s creation of the United States Revenue Cutter Service  one of the predecessor services of the United States Coast Guard  The U S  Army s Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn is named after Hamilton  His country home  named  The Grange   is in Hamilton Heights  a neighborhood in upper Manhattan  It has been restored to its condition in 1802  118  A
