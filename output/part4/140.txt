Gaelic  2  is a Goidelic language of the Indo European language family  originating in Ireland and historically spoken by the Irish people  Irish is now spoken as a first language by a small minority of Irish people  as well as being a second language of a larger proportion of the population  Irish enjoys constitutional status as the national and first official language of the Republic of Ireland  It is an official language of the European Union and an officially recognised minority language in Northern Ireland  Irish was the predominant language of the Irish people for most of their recorded history  and they brought their Gaelic speech with them to other countries  notably Scotland and the Isle of Man  where it gave rise to Scottish Gaelic and Manx  3  4  5  It has the oldest vernacular literature in Western Europe  6  It began to decline under English and British rule after the seventeenth century  The nineteenth century saw a dramatic decrease in the number of speakers especially after the Great Famine of 1845 1852  where Ireland lost 20 25  of its population either to emigration or death   Irish speaking areas were especially hard hit  By the end of British rule  the language was spoken by less than 15  of the national population  7  Since then  Irish speakers have been in the minority except in areas collectively known as the Gaeltacht  Ongoing efforts have been made to preserve  promote and revive the language  particularly the Gaelic Revival  Estimates of native speakers range from 20 000 to 80 000 people  8  9  10  In the 2006 census for the Republic  85 000 people reported using Irish as a daily language outside of the education system  and 1 2 million reported using it at least occasionally in or out of school  11  There are also thousands of Irish speakers in Northern Ireland  and viable communities of native speakers in two other countries  which   Contents 1 Names of the language 1 1 Irish 1 2 English 2 History 3 Phonology 4 Grammar 4 1

Caighde n Oifigi il  the official written standard  the name of the language is Gaeilge  Irish pronunciation     e l       Before the spelling reform of 1948  this form was spelled Gaedhilge  originally this was the genitive of Gaedhealg  the form used in classical Modern Irish  12  Older spellings of this include Gaoidhealg in Classical Irish  ge   l g  and Go delc  goi el g  in Old Irish  The modern spelling results from the deletion of the silent dh in the middle of Gaedhilge  Other forms of the name found in the various modern Irish dialects  in addition to south Connacht Gaeilge mentioned above  include Gaedhilic Gaeilic Gaeilig     e l  c   or Gaedhlag     e l       in Ulster Irish and northern Connacht Irish and Gaedhealaing Gaoluinn Gaelainn     e l       e l   n   13  14  in Munster Irish   edit  English In European English  the language is usually referred to as Irish  The term Irish Gaelic is often used when English speakers discuss the relationship among the three Goidelic languages  Irish  Scottish Gaelic  and Manx  or when discussion of Irish is confused to mean Hiberno English  the form of English as spoken in Ireland  Scottish Gaelic is often referred to in English as simply Gaelic  Outside Ireland  the term Gaelic or  Irish Gaelic  is also frequently used for the Irish language  15  The archaic term Erse  from Erische   originally a Scots form of the word Irish applied in Scotland  by Lowlanders  to all of the Goidelic languages  is no longer used for any Goidelic language  16  17   edit  History Main article  History of the Irish language Written Irish is first attested in Ogham inscriptions from the fourth century AD  this stage of the language is known as Primitive Irish  These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain  Primitive Irish transitioned into Old Irish through the 5th century  Old Irish  dating from the sixth century  used the Latin alphabet and is attested primarily in marginalia to Latin manuscripts  By the 10th century Old Irish evolved into Middle Irish  which was spoken throughout Ireland and in Scotland and the Isle of Man  It is the language of a large corpus of literature  including the famous Ulster Cycle  From the 12th century Middle Irish began to evolve into modern Irish in Ireland  into Scottish Gaelic in Scotland  and into the Manx language in the Isle of Man  Early Modern Irish  dating from the thirteenth century  was the literary language of both Ireland and Gaelic speaking Scotland  and is attested by such writers as Geoffrey Keating  Modern Irish emerged from the literary language known as Early Modern Irish in Ireland and as Classical Gaelic in Scotland  this was used through the 18th century  From the eighteenth century the language went into a decline  rapidly losing ground to English due in part to restrictions dictated by British rule   a conspicuous example of the process known by linguists as language shift  18  In the mid nineteenth century it lost a large portion of its speakers to death and emigration resulting from poverty  particularly in the wake of the Great Famine  1845 1849   At the end of the nineteenth century  members of the Gaelic Revival movement made efforts to encourage the learning and use of Irish in Ireland  Particular emphasis was placed at that point on the folk tradition  which in Irish is particularly rich  but efforts were also made to develop journalism and a modern literature   edit  Phonology Main article  Irish phonology In pronunciation  Irish most closely resembles its nearest relatives  Scottish Gaelic and Manx  One notable feature is that consonants  except  h   come in pairs  one  broad   velarized  pronounced with the back of the tongue pulled back towards the soft palate  and one  slender   palatalized  pronounced with the middle of the tongue pushed up towards the hard palate   While broad slender pairs are not unique to Irish  Russian has something similar   they can pose a problem for English speakers  Consonant phonemes Labial Coronal Dorsal Glottal Bilabial Labio  velar Labio  dental Dental Alveolar Post  alveolar Palatal Velar broad slender

Main article  Irish grammar The grammar of Irish shares with other Celtic languages a number of features which  while not unique  are unusual in an Indo European context  The grammatical features most unfamiliar to English speakers of the language are the initial consonant mutations  the verb subject object word order  and the use of two different forms for  to be   None of these features are peculiar to Irish  however  All of them occur in other Celtic languages as well as in non Celtic languages  morphosyntactically triggered initial consonant mutations are found in Fula and Shoshoni  VSO word order is found in Classical Arabic and Biblical Hebrew  and Portuguese  Spanish  Italian  Catalan and Galician have two different forms for  to be   The use of prepositional pronouns recalls the Semitic languages  as well as some lesser known European languages such as Venetian  The situation is complicated by dialect variations  by a recommended standard and by what appears to be a colloquial simplification of both grammar and pronunciation by fluent speakers in the urban context  19   edit  Syntax Main article  Irish syntax Irish is a VSO  verb subject object  language  and uses two verbs  to be   One of these  the copula  known in Irish as an chopail   is used to describe the permanent identity or characteristic of a person or thing as opposed to temporary aspects  The adjective normally follows the noun  the possessive adjectives are an exception   but there are a certain number of adjectives and particles which may function as prefixes   edit  Morphology Main articles  Irish declension and Irish conjugation Irish is an inflected language  having  in its standard form  the following cases  common  the old nominative and accusative   vocative and genitive  In Munster dialects a dative form persisted  though this has been largely discarded by younger speakers  The present inflectional system represents a radical simplification of the grammar of Old Irish  Irish nouns may be masculine or feminine  the neuter having disappeared   To a certain degree the gender difference is indicated by specific word endings    n and   n being masculine and   g feminine  Another feature of Irish grammar that is shared with other Celtic languages is the use of prepositional pronouns  forainmneacha r amhfhoclacha   which are essentially conjugated prepositions  For example  the word for  at  is ag  which in the first person singular becomes agam  at me   When used with the verb b    to be   ag indicates possession  this is the equivalent of the English verb  to have   T  leabhar agam   I have a book    Literally   there is a book at me    T  leabhar agat   You have a book   T  leabhar aige   He has a book   T  leabhar aici   She has a book   T  leabhar againn   We have a book   T  leabhar agaibh   You  plural  have a book   T  leabhar acu   They have a book    edit  Mutations Main article  Irish initial mutations Irish shares with other Celtic languages a feature known as mutation  whereby initial and final consonants may change to express nuances of grammatical relationship and meaning  Mutation affects verbs  nouns and adjectives  Certain consonants may be capable of changing in two ways  depending on the context  In Irish  there are two classes of initial consonant mutations  Lenition  in Irish  s imhi   softening   describes the change of stops into fricatives  Indicated in old orthography by a buailte  a dot  written above the changed consonant  as in the dot shown above the c in  Gaelac  below   this is now shown in writing by adding an  h  caith   throw     chaith m   I threw   this is an example of the lenition as a past tense marker  which is caused by the use of do  although it is now usually omitted  margadh  market    market place    bargain    Tadhg an mhargaidh  the man of the street   word for word  Tadhg of the market place   here we see the lenition marking the genitive case of a masculine noun  Se n  Se n  John    a She in   O John    here we see lenition as part of what is called the vocative case   in fact  the vocative lenition is triggered by the a or vocative marker before She in  Eclipsis  in Irish  ur   covers the voicing of voiceless stops  as well as the nasalisation of voiced stops  athair  father     r nAthair  our Father  t s  start   ar dt s  at the start  Gaillimh  Galway    i nGaillimh  in Galway  Mutations are often the only way to distinguish similar grammatical forms  For example  the only way  apart from context  in which the possessive pronouns  her    his  and  their  can be distinguished is through initial mutations  since all these meanings are represented by the same word a  It is seen here in apposition to the word br g  shoe   their shoe   a mbr g  eclipsis  his shoe   a bhr g  lenition  her shoe   a br g  unchanged   edit  Orthography  Gaelach  in traditional Gaelic type  Main article  Irish orthography Modern Irish typically uses the ISO basic Latin alphabet without 20  the letters j k q w x y z  but with the addition of one diacritic sign  the acute accent              known in Irish as the s neadh fada  long mark   plural s nte fada  In idiomatic English usage  this diacritic is frequently referred to simply as the fada  where the adjective is used as a noun  The fada serves to lengthen the sound of the vowels and in some cases also changes their quality  For example  in Munster Irish  Kerry   a is  a  or     and   is      in  law  but in Ulster Irish  Donegal     tends to be        Traditional orthography had an additional diacritic   a dot over some consonants to indicate lenition  In modern Irish  the letter h suffixed to a consonant indicates that the consonant is lenited  Thus  for example   Gaela    see illustration  has become  Gaelach    Around the time of World War II  S amas Dalt n  in charge of Rann g an Aistri ch in  the official translations department of the Irish government   issued his own guidelines about how to standardise Irish spelling and grammar  This de facto standard was subsequently approved of by the State and called the Official Standard or Caighde n Oifigi il  It simplified and standardised the orthography  Many words had silent letters removed and vowel combination brought closer to the spoken language  Where multiple versions existed in different dialects for the same word  one or more were selected  Examples  Gaedhealg   Gaedhilg e    Gaedhealaing   Gaeilic   Gaelainn   Gaoidhealg   Gaolainn   Gaeilge   Irish language   Gaoluinn or Gaolainn is still used in books written in dialect by Munster authors  or as a facetious name for the Munster dialect  citation needed  Lughbhaidh   L    Louth  biadh   bia   food  The standard spelling does not always reflect every dialect s pronunciation  For example  in standard Irish  bia   food   has the genitive bia  But in Munster Irish  the genitive is pronounced  b i     21  For this reason  the spelling biadh is still used by the speakers of some dialects  in particular those that show a meaningful and audible difference between biadh  nominative case  and b dh  genitive case   of food  food s   In Munster  the latter spelling regularly produces the pronunciation  b i    because final  idh   igh regularly delenites to  ig in Munster pronunciation  Another example would be the word crua  meaning  hard   This pronounced  kru    22  in Munster  in line with the pre Caighde n spelling  cruaidh  In Munster  ao is pronounced  e   and aoi pronounced  i    23  but the new spellings of saoghal   life  world   genitive  saoghail  have become saol  genitive saoil  This produces irregularities in the matchup between the spelling and pronunciation in Munster  because the word is pronounced  s e l     genitive  s e l    24  The dot above diacritic  called a ponc s imhithe or s  buailte  often shortened to buailte   derives from the punctum delens used in medieval manuscripts to indicate deletion  similar to crossing out unwanted words in handwriting today  From this usage it was used to indicate the lenition of s  from  s  to  h   and f  from  f  to zero  in Old Irish texts  Lenition of c  p  and t was indicated by placing the letter h after the affected consonant  lenition of other sounds was left unmarked  Later both methods were extended to be indicators of lenition of any sound except l and n  and two competing systems were used  lenition could be marked by a buailte or by a postposed h  Eventually  use of the buailte predominated when texts were written using Gaelic letters  while the h predominated when writing using Roman letters  Today  Gaelic type and the buailte are rarely used except where a  traditional  style is required  e g  the motto on the University College Dublin coat of arms or the symbol of the Irish Defence Forces  The Irish Defence Forces cap badge   glai  na h  ireann   Letters with the buailte are available in Unicode and Latin 8 character sets  see Latin Extended Additional chart   25   edit  Dialects Irish is represented by several traditional dialects and by various varieties of urban Irish  the latter influenced in grammar and phonology by both traditional Irish and by English  Differences between the dialects make themselves felt in stress  intonation  vocabulary and structural features  There are a number of distinct dialects of Irish  Roughly speaking  the three major dialect areas coincide with the provinces of Munster  C ige Mumhan   Connacht  C ige Chonnacht  and Ulster  C ige Uladh   Records of some dialects of Leinster were made by the Irish Folklore Commission among other bodies prior to their extinction  Newfoundland  in eastern Canada  is also seen to have  or have had  a minor dialect of Irish  closely resembling the Munster Irish spoken during the 16th to 17th centuries  see Newfoundland Irish    edit  Munster Main article  Munster Irish Munster Irish is mainly spoken in the Gaeltacht areas of Kerry  Contae Chiarra    Ring  An Rinn  near Dungarvan  D n Garbh in  in County Waterford  Contae Phort L irge  and Muskerry  M scra   and Cape Clear Island  Oile n Chl ire  in the western part of County Cork  Contae Chorca    The most important subdivision in Munster is that between Decies Irish  Na D ise   spoken in Waterford  and the rest of Munster Irish  Some typical features of Munster Irish are  The use of endings to show person on verbs in parallel with a pronominal subject system  thus  I must  is in Munster caithfead as well as caithfidh m   while other dialects prefer caithfidh m   m  means  I     I was and you were  is Bh os agus bh s as well as Bh  m  agus bh  t  in Munster  but more commonly Bh  m  agus bh  t  in other dialects  Note that these are strong tendencies  and the personal forms Bh os etc  are used in the West and North  particularly when the words are last in the clause  Use of independent dependent forms of verbs that are not included in the Standard  For example   I see  in Munster is ch m  which is the independent form   Northern Irish also uses a similar form  tch m   whereas  I do not see  is n  fheicim  feicim being the dependent form  which is used after particles such as n   not    Ch m is replaced by feicim in the Standard  Similarly  the traditional form preserved in Munster bheirim I give n  thugaim is tugaim n  thugaim in the Standard  gheibhim I get n  bhfaighim is faighim n  bhfaighim  When before  nn   m   rr   rd   ll and so on  in monosyllabic words and in the stressed syllable of multisyllabic words where the syllable is followed by a consonant  some short vowels are lengthened while others are diphthongised  thus ceann  k aun   head   cam  k um   crooked   gearr    a r   short   ord  o rd   sledgehammer   gall    ul   foreigner  non Gael   iontas  u nt s   a wonder  a marvel   comp nach  k um p  n x   companion  mate   etc  A copular construction involving ea  it  is frequently used  Thus  I am an Irish person  can be said is  ireannach m  and  ireannach is ea m  in Munster  there is a subtle difference in meaning  however  the first choice being a simple statement of fact  while the second brings emphasis onto the word  ireannach  In effect the construction is a type of  fronting   Both masculine and feminine words are subject to lenition after insan  sa san   in the   den  of the  and don  to for the    sa tsiopa   in the shop   compared to the Standard sa siopa  the Standard lenites only feminine nouns in the dative in these cases   Eclipsis of f after sa  sa bhfeirm   in the farm   instead of san fheirm  Eclipsis of t and d after preposition   singular article  with all prepositions except after insan  den and don  ar an dtigh  on the house   ag an ndoras  at the door   Stress falls in general found on the second syllable of a word when the first syllable contains a short vowel  and the second syllable contains a long vowel  diphthong  or is   e ach  e g  bior n   pin    as opposed to bior n in Connacht and Ulster   edit  Connacht Main article  Connacht Irish The strongest dialect of Connacht Irish is to be found in Connemara and the Aran Islands  Much closer to the larger Connacht Gaeltacht is the dialect spoken in the smaller region on the border between Galway  Gaillimh  and Mayo  Maigh Eo   The northern Mayo dialect of Erris  Iorras  and Achill  Acaill  is in grammar and morphology essentially a Connacht dialect  but shows some similarities to Ulster Irish due to large scale immigration of dispossessed people following the Plantation of Ulster  Features in Connemara Irish differing from the official standard include a preference for verbal nouns ending in  achan  e g  lagachan instead of lag    weakening   The non standard pronunciation of the Cois Fharraige area with lengthened vowels and heavily reduced endings gives it a distinct sound  Distinguishing features of Connacht and Ulster dialect include the pronunciation of word final broad bh and mh as  w   rather than as  v   in Munster  For example sliabh   mountain   is pronounced   l i w  in Connacht and Ulster as opposed to   l i    in the south  In addition Connacht and Ulster speakers tend to include the  we  pronoun rather than use the standard compound form used in Munster e g  bh  muid is used for  we were  instead of bh omar  Like in Munster Irish  when before  nn   m   rr   rd   ll and so on  in monosyllabic words and in the stressed syllable of multisyllabic words where the syllable is followed by a consonant  some short vowels are lengthened while others are diphthongised  thus ceann  k   n   head   cam  k  m   crooked   gearr  g   r   short   ord  ourd   sledgehammer   gall  g  l   foreigner  non Gael   iontas  i nt s   a wonder  a marvel   etc  The present day Irish of Meath  in Leinster  is a special case  It belongs mainly to the Connemara dialect  The Irish speaking community in Meath is mostly a group of Connemara speakers who moved there in the 1930s after a land reform campaign spearheaded by M irt n   Cadhain  who subsequently became one of the greatest modernist writers in the language   Irish President Douglas Hyde was one of the last of speakers of the Roscommon dialect of Irish   edit  Ulster Main article  Ulster Irish Linguistically the most important of the Ulster dialects today is that of the Rosses  na Rossa   which has been used extensively in literature by such authors as the brothers S amus   Grianna and Seosamh Mac Grianna  locally known as Jim  Fheilim  and Joe Fheilim   This dialect is essentially the same as that in Gweedore  Gaoth Dobhair   Inlet of Streaming Water   and used by native singers Enya  Eithne  and M ire Brennan and their siblings in Clannad  Clann as Dobhar   Family from the Dobhar  a section of Gweedore   Na Casaidigh  and Mair ad N  Mhaonaigh from another local band Altan  Ulster Irish sounds very different and shares several features with southern dialects of Scottish Gaelic and Manx Gaelic  as well as having lots of characteristic words and shades of meanings  However  since the demise of those Irish dialects spoken natively in what is today Northern Ireland  it is probably an exaggeration to see present day Ulster Irish as an intermediary form between Scottish Gaelic and the southern and western dialects of Irish  Northern Scottish Gaelic has many non Ulster features in common with Munster Irish  One noticeable trait of Ulster Irish  Manx Gaelic and Scots Gaelic is the use of the negative particle cha n  in place of the Munster and Connacht n   Though southern Ulster Irish tends to use n  more than cha n   cha n  has almost ousted n  in northernmost dialects  e g  Rosguill and Tory Island   though even in these areas n l  is not  is more common than chan fhuil or cha bhfuil  26  27  Another noticeable trait is the pronunciation of the first person singular verb ending  im as  am  also common to Ulster  Man and Scotland  Munster Connacht Leinster si laim  I walk   Ulster si lam    edit  An Caighde n Oifigi il This section may contain original research  Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding references  Statements consisting only of original research may be removed  More details may be available on the talk page   August 2009  An Caighde n Oifigi il   The Official Standard    often shortened to An Caighde n  is the standard language  which is taught in most schools in Ireland  though with strong influences from local dialects  It was published by the translators in D il  ireann in the 1950s  28  Its development in the 1950s and 1960s had two purposes  One was to simplify Irish spelling  which had retained its Classical spelling  by removing many silent letters  and to give a standard written form that was mutually intelligible by speakers with different dialects  28  Though many aspects of the Caighde n are essentially those of Connacht Irish  this was simply because this is the central dialect which forms a  bridge   as it were  between the North and South  In reality  dialect speakers pronounce words as in their own dialect  as the spelling simply reflects the pronunciation of Classical Irish  For example  ceann  head  in early modern Irish was pronounced  k en     The spelling has been retained  but the word is variously pronounced  k aun   in the South   k   n   in Connacht  and  k  n    in the North  Beag  small  was  b      in early modern Irish  and is now  b      in Waterford Irish   b      in Cork Kerry Irish  varies between  b      and  b      in the West  and is  b      in the North  The simplification was weighted in favour of the Western dialect  For example  the early modern Irish leaba  dative case leabaidh  l eb      bed  is pronounced  l ab    as well as  l ab      in Waterford Irish   l ab      in Cork Kerry Irish   l  b    in Connacht Irish   l   b    in Cois Fharraige Irish   and  l  b i  in the North  Native speakers from the North and South may consider that leabaidh should be the representation in the Caighde n rather than actual leaba  However  leaba is the historically correct nominative form and arguably preferable to the historically incorrect yet common use of the dative form for the nominative  On the other hand  in other cases the Caighde n retained classical spellings even when none of the dialects had retained the corresponding pronunciation  For example  it has retained the Classical Irish spelling of ar  on  for  etc   and ag  at  by  of  etc    The first is pronounced       throughout the Goidelic speaking world  and is written er in Manx  and air in Scottish Gaelic   and should be written either eir or oir in Irish  The second is pronounced  i    in the South  and  e    in the North and West  Again  Manx and Scottish Gaelic reflect this pronunciation much more clearly than Irish does  Manx ec  Scottish aig   In many cases  however  the Caighde n can only refer to the Classical language  in that every dialect is different  as happens in the personal forms of ag  at  by  of  etc   Munster   ag m      um    ag t      ut     ig       e   ic     k i   ag ing      u      agu ng      i     West Cork Kerry ag in      un     agu n      in

  a        agaibh   a        acu   ak u      ak    Another purpose was to create a grammatically regularised or  simplified  standard which would make the language more accessible for the majority English speaking school population  In part this is why the Caighde n is not universally respected by native speakers  in that it makes simplified language an ideal  rather than the ideal that native speakers traditionally had of their dialects  or of the Classical dialect if they had knowledge of that   Of course  this was not the original aim of the developers  who rather saw the  school version  Caighde n as a means of easing second language learners into the task of learning  full  Irish  The Caighde n verb system is a prime example  with the reduction in irregular verb forms and personal forms of the verb   except for the first persons  However  once the word  standard  becomes used  the forms represented as  standard  take on a power of their own  and therefore the ultimate goal has become forgotten in many circles  The Caighde n is in general spoken by non native speakers  frequently from the capital  and is sometimes also called  Dublin Irish  or  Urban Irish   As it is taught in many Irish Language schools  where Irish is the main  or sometimes only  medium of instruction   it is also sometimes called  Gaelscoil Irish   The so called  Belfast Irish   spoken in that city s Gaeltacht Quarter is the Caighde n heavily influenced by Ulster Irish and Belfast English  The differences between dialects are considerable  and have led to recurrent difficulties in defining standard Irish  In recent decades contacts between speakers of different dialects have become more frequent and the differences between the dialects are less noticeable  citation needed   edit  Current status Main article  Status of the Irish language  edit  Republic of Ireland Irish is given recognition by the Constitution of Ireland as the national and first official language of the Republic of Ireland  with English being a second official language   Although this is technically the case in practice almost all government debates and business are conducted in English  29  In 1938  the founder of Conradh na Gaeilge  The Gaelic League   Douglas Hyde  was inaugurated as the first President of Ireland  The record of his delivering his auguration Declaration of Office in Roscommon Irish remains almost the only surviving remnant of anyone speaking in that dialect  From the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922  see also History of the Republic of Ireland   the Irish Government required a degree of proficiency in Irish for all those who became newly appointed to civil service positions  including postal workers  tax officials  agricultural inspectors  etc    30  Proficiency in just one official language for entrance to the public service was introduced in 1974  in part through the actions of protest organizations like the Language Freedom Movement  Though the First Official Language requirement was also dropped for wider public service jobs  Irish remains a required subject of study in all schools within the Republic which receive public money  see also Education in the Republic of Ireland   Those wishing to teach in primary schools in the State must also pass a compulsory examination called  Scr d  C il ochta sa Ghaeilge   The need for a pass in Leaving Certificate Irish or English for entry to the Garda   police  was introduced in September 2005  although applicants are given lessons in the language during the two years of training  All official documents of the Irish Government must be published in both Irish and English or Irish alone  this is according to the official languages act 2003  which is enforced by  An Comisin ir Teanga   the Irish language ombudsman   The National University of Ireland requires all students wishing to embark on a degree course in the NUI federal system to pass the subject of Irish in the Leaving Certificate or GCE GCSE Examinations  31  Exemptions are made from this requirement for students born outside of the Republic of Ireland  those who were born in the Republic but completed primary education outside it  and students diagnosed with dyslexia  The National University of Ireland  Galway is required to appoint people who are competent in the Irish language  as long as they meet all other respects of the vacancy they are appointed to  This requirement is laid down by the University College Galway Act  1929  Section 3   32  It is expected that the requirement may be repealed in due course  33  For a number of years there has been vigorous debate in political  academic and other circles about the failure of most students in the mainstream  English medium  schools to achieve competence in the language  even after fourteen years  34  35  36  The concomitant decline in the number of traditional native speakers has also been a cause of great concern  37  38  39  40  There is  however  a growing body of Irish speakers in the cities  Most of these are products of an independent education system in which Irish is the sole language of instruction  Such schools are known at the primary level as Gaelscoileanna and are supported by a number of secondary colleges  These Irish medium schools send a much higher proportion of students on to tertiary level than do the mainstream schools  and it seems increasingly likely that  within a generation  habitual users of Irish will typically be members of an urban  middle class and highly educated minority  41  Even though modern parliamentary legislation is supposed to be issued in both Irish and English  in practice it is frequently only available in English  This is notwithstanding that Article 25 4 of the Constitution of Ireland requires that an  official translation  of any law in one official language be provided immediately in the other official language if not already passed in both official languages  42   edit  Gaeltacht Main article  Gaeltacht Official Gaeltacht areas There are parts of Ireland where Irish is still spoken as a traditional  native language used daily  These regions are known individually and collectively as the Gaeltacht  or in the plural as Gaeltachta   While the Gaeltacht s fluent Irish speakers  whose numbers have been estimated by scholar Donncha   h allaithe at twenty or thirty thousand  43  are a minority of the total number of fluent Irish speakers  they represent a higher concentration of Irish speakers than other parts of the country and it is only in Gaeltacht areas  in especial the more strongly Irish speaking ones  that Irish continues to be a natural vernacular of the general population  There are Gaeltacht regions in  County Galway  Contae na Gaillimhe   including Connemara  Conamara   the Aran Islands  Oile in  rann   Carraroe  An Cheathr  Rua  and Spiddal  An Spid al   on the west coast of County Donegal  Contae Dh n na nGall   in the part which is known as Tyrconnell  T r Chonaill   Dingle Peninsula  Corca Dhuibhne  and Iveragh Peninsula  Uibh Rathach  in County Kerry  Contae Chiarra    Smaller ones also exist in counties Mayo  Contae Mhaigh Eo   Meath  Contae na M    Waterford  Contae Phort L irge   and Cork  Contae Chorca    To summarise the extent of the survival   See Hindley   The Death of the Irish Language   Map 7  Irish speakers by towns and distinct electoral divisions  census 1926   Irish remains as a natural vernacular in the following areas  south Connemara  from a point west of Spiddal  covering Inverin  Carraroe  Rosmuck  and the islands  the Aran Islands  northwest Donegal in the area around Gweedore  including Rannafast  Gortahork  the surrounding townlands and Tory Island  in the townland of Rathcarn  Co  Meath  Gweedore  Gaoth Dobhair  County Donegal is the largest Gaeltacht parish in Ireland  The numerically and socially strongest Gaeltacht areas are those of South Connemara  the west of the Dingle Peninsula and northwest Donegal  in which the majority of residents use Irish as their primary language  These areas are often referred to as the F or Ghaeltacht   true Gaeltacht   and collectively have a population just under 20 000   Caution Children  Irish summer colleges are attended by tens of thousands of Irish teenagers annually  Students live with Gaeltacht families  attend classes  participate in sports  go to c ilithe and are obliged to speak Irish  All aspects of Irish culture and tradition are encouraged  According to data compiled by the Irish Department of Community  Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs  only one quarter of households in officially Gaeltacht areas possess a fluency in Irish  The author of a detailed analysis of the survey  Donncha   h allaithe of the Galway Mayo Institute of Technology  described the Irish language policy followed by Irish governments a  complete and absolute disaster   The Irish Times  referring to his analysis published in the Irish language newspaper Foinse  quoted him as follows   It is an absolute indictment of successive Irish Governments that at the foundation of the Irish State there were 250 000 fluent Irish speakers living in Irish speaking or semi Irish speaking areas  but the number now is between 20 000 and 30 000   43   edit  Northern Ireland Main article  Irish language in Northern Ireland A sign for the Department of Culture  Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland  in English  Irish  and Ulster Scots  Prior to the establishment of the Northern Ireland state in 1921  Irish was recognised as a school subject and as  Celtic  in some third level institutions  Between 1921 and 1972  Northern Ireland had devolved government  During those years the political party holding power in the Stormont Parliament  the Ulster Unionist Party  UUP   was hostile to the language  citation needed  In broadcasting  there was an exclusion on the reporting of minority cultural issues  and Irish was excluded from radio and television for almost the first fifty years of the previous devolved government  44  The language received a degree of formal recognition in Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom  under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement  45  and then  in 2003  by the Government s ratification in respect of the language of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages  The British government promised to create legislation encouraging the language as part of the 2006 St Andrews Agreement  46   edit  European Union Irish became an official language of the EU on 1 January 2007 meaning that MEPs with Irish fluency can now speak the language in the EU Parliament in Europe and at committees although in the case of the latter they have to give prior notice to a simultaneous interpreter in order to ensure that what they say can be interpreted into other languages  While an official language of the European Union  only co decision regulations must be available in Irish for the moment  due to a renewable five year derogation on what has to be translated  requested by the Irish Government when negotiating the language s new official status  Any expansion in the range of documents to be translated will depend on the results of the first five year review and on whether the Irish authorities decide to seek an extension  The Irish government has committed itself to train the necessary number of translators and interpreters and to bear the related costs  47  Before Irish became an official language it was afforded the status of treaty language and only the highest level documents of the EU had been made available in Irish   edit  Outside Ireland Main article  Irish language outside Ireland The Irish language was carried abroad in the modern period by a vast diaspora  chiefly to Britain and North America  but also to Australia  New Zealand and Argentina  The first large movements began in the 17th century  largely as a result of the Cromwellian conquest  which saw many Irish sent to the West Indies  Irish emigration to America was well established by the 18th century  and was reinforced in the 1840s by thousands fleeing from the Famine  This flight also affected Britain  Up until that time most emigrants spoke Irish as their first language  though English was steadily establishing itself as the primary language  Irish speakers had first arrived in Australia in the late 18th century as convicts and soldiers  and many Irish speaking settlers followed  particularly in the 1860s  New Zealand also received some of this influx  Argentina was the only non English speaking country to receive large numbers of Irish emigrants  and it is likely that some of them spoke Irish  Relatively few of the emigrants were literate in Irish  but many manuscripts arrived in America  and it was there that the first Irish language newspaper was established  In Australia  too  the language found its way into print  The Gaelic Revival  which started in Ireland in the 1890s  found a response abroad  with branches of the Gaelic League being established in all the countries to which Irish speakers had emigrated  The decline of Irish in Ireland and a slowing of emigration help ensure a decline in the language abroad  along with natural attrition in the host countries  Despite this  a handful of enthusiasts continued to learn and cultivate Irish in diaspora countries and elsewhere  a trend which strengthened in the second half of the 20th century  Today the language is taught at tertiary level in North America  Australia and Europe  and Irish speakers outside Ireland contribute to journalism and literature in the language   edit  See also B arlachas  Anglicisms in Irish Bunt s Cainte  a course in basic spoken Irish Cumann Gaelach  Irish
