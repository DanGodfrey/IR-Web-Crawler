series of comic albums created by Belgian artist Georges Remi  1907 1983   who wrote under the pen name of Herg   The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century  with translations published in more than 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date  1  The series first appeared in French in Le Petit Vingti me  a children s supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le XXe Si cle on 10 January 1929  The success of the series saw the serialised strips published in Belgium s leading newspaper Le Soir and spun into a successful Tintin magazine  Then in 1950  Herg  created Studios Herg   which produced the canon series of twenty four albums  The Adventures of Tintin have been adapted for radio  television  theatre  and film  Set during a largely realistic 20th century  the hero of the series is Tintin  a young Belgian reporter  He is aided in his adventures by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy  Milou in French   Later  popular additions to the cast included the brash and cynical Captain Haddock  the highly intelligent but hearing impaired Professor Calculus  Professeur Tournesol  and other supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson  Dupont et Dupond   Herg  himself features in several of the comics as a background character  as do his assistants in some instances  The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean  expressive drawings in Herg  s signature ligne claire style  2  3  4  5  Its engaging  6  well researched 6  7  8  plots straddle a variety of genres  swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy  mysteries  political thrillers  and science fiction  The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humour  offset in later albums by dashes of sophisticated satire and political cultural commentary  Contents 1 List of titles 2 History 3 Synopsis 3 1 Characters 3 1 1 Tintin and Snowy 3 1 2 Captain Haddock 3 1 3 Supporting characters

known under his pen name of Herg  first came up with the character of Tintin  a young boy reporter  whilst working at the Belgian newspaper Le XXe Si cle  The 20th century   Pioneering this new character in the story Tintin in the Land of the Soviets  this comic  which involved Tintin battling the socialist authorities in the Soviet Union  was serialised in Le XXe Si cle s supplement for children  Le Petit Vingti me  The Little Twentieth   from 10 January 1929 until 11 May 1930  9  The series was an instant success  sales of the Thursday edition of the newspaper  the day the supplement appeared  were to increase by 600   Herg  went on to pen a string of new Adventures of Tintin  sending his character to real locations such as the Belgian Congo  the United States  Egypt  India  China  and the United Kingdom  and also to fictional countries of his own devising  such as the Latin American republic of San Theodoros and the East European kingdom of Syldavia  The eighth Tintin adventure  King Ottokar s Sceptre  1939   involved Tintin battling the forces of fictional fascist state Borduria  whose leader  named M sstler  was a combination of Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler and Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini  10  Himself an anti fascist  Herg  focused his Adventures of Tintin on non political themes to avoid trouble with the Gestapo  pictured here  during the period of Nazi occupation  Then  in May 1940  Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as World War II broke out across Europe  and although Herg  initially considered fleeing into a self imposed exile  he ultimately decided to stay in his occupied homeland  11  To ensure their own dominance  the Nazi authorities closed down Le XXe Si cle  leaving Herg  unemployed  12  In search of employment  he was given a job as an illustrator at Belgium s leading newspaper  Le Soir  The Evening   which was allowed to continue publication under German management  13  On 17 October 1940 he was made editor of the paper s children s supplement  Le Soir Jeunesse  in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures  14  In this new  more repressive political climate  Herg  could no longer explore political themes in his Adventures of Tintin lest he be arrested by the Gestapo  As Tintinologist Harry Thompson noted  Tintin s role as a reporter came to an end  to be replaced by his new role as an explorer  something which was not a politically sensitive topic  15  With the end of the war  Herg  left Le Soir and  in 1949  accepted an invitation to continue The Adventures of Tintin in the new Tintin magazine  Le journal de Tintin   Finally  Herg  s Tintin series reached the height of its success in 1950 when he created Studios Herg   The studios produced eight new Tintin albums  coloured and reformatted several old Tintin albums  and ultimately completed twenty three albums of the canon series  Studios Herg  continued to release additional publications until Herg  s death in 1983  In 1986  a twenty fourth unfinished album was released  the Studios were disbanded  and its assets were transferred to the Herg  Foundation  The Adventures of Tintin continue to entertain new generations of Tintin fans today   edit  Synopsis  edit  Characters Main article  List of The Adventures of Tintin characters  edit  Tintin and Snowy Main articles  Tintin  character  and Snowy  character  Tintin is a young Belgian reporter who becomes involved in dangerous cases in which he takes heroic action to save the day  Almost every adventure features Tintin hard at work in his investigative journalism  but seldom is he seen actually turning in a story  He is a young man of neutral attitudes and boy scout ideals  in this respect  he represents the everyman  Readers and critics have described Tintin as a well rounded yet open ended  intelligent and imaginative character  noting that his rather neutral personality sometimes labelled as bland permits a balanced reflection of the evil  folly and foolhardiness which surrounds him  His boy scout ideals  which represent Herg  s own  are never compromised by the character  and his status allows the reader to assume his position within the story  rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist  16  Tintin s iconic representation enhances this aspect  with Scott McCloud noting that it  allows readers to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world   17  Snowy  Milou in the original version   a white fox terrier  is Tintin s four legged companion  The bond between Snowy and Tintin is very deep as they have saved each other from perilous situations many times  Snowy frequently  speaks  to the reader through his thoughts  often displaying a dry sense of humour   which are supposedly not heard by the human characters in the story  Snowy has nearly let Tintin down on occasion  particularly when distracted by a bone  Like Captain Haddock  he is fond of Loch Lomond brand Scotch whisky  and his occasional bouts of drinking tend to get him into trouble  as does his arachnophobia   edit  Captain Haddock Main article  Captain Haddock Captain Archibald Haddock  a seafaring captain of disputed ancestry  he may be of Belgian  French  or Scottish origin   is Tintin s best friend  who was introduced in The Crab with the Golden Claws  Haddock was initially depicted as a weak and alcoholic character  but later became more respectable  He evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure captured by his ancestor  Sir Francis Haddock  The Captain s coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin s often implausible heroism  he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic  Captain Haddock lives in the luxurious mansion Marlinspike Hall  Haddock uses a range of colourful insults and curses to express his feelings  such as  billions of blue blistering barnacles   sometimes just  blistering barnacles    billions of blistering barnacles   or  blue blistering barnacles     ten thousand thundering typhoons   sometimes just  thundering typhoons     troglodyte    bashi bazouk    visigoths    kleptomaniac    ectoplasm    sea gherkin    anacoluthon    pockmark    nincompoop    abominable snowman    nitwits    scoundrels    steam rollers    parasites    vegetarians    floundering oath    carpet seller   blundering Bazookas    Popinjay    bragger    pinheads    miserable slugs    ectomorph    maniacs    freshwater swabs    miserable molecule of mildew   and  Fuzzy Wuzzy   but nothing that is actually considered a swear word  Haddock is a hard drinker  particularly fond of rum and of Loch Lomond scotch whisky  his bouts of drunkenness are often used for comic effect  Captain Haddock remained without a first name until the last completed story  Tintin and the Picaros   edit  Supporting characters Herg  s supporting characters have been cited as far more developed than the central character  each imbued with a strength of character and depth of personality which has been compared with that of the characters of Charles Dickens  18  Herg  used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists  adventures  To further the realism and continuity  characters would recur throughout the series  It has been speculated that the occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Herg  forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations  The major supporting cast was developed during this period  19  Professor Calculus  an absent minded professor and half deaf physicist  is a minor but regular character alongside Tintin  Snowy  and Captain Haddock  He was introduced in Red Rackham s Treasure  and based partially on Auguste Piccard  20  a Swiss physicist  His presence was initially not welcomed by the leading characters  but through his generous nature and his scientific ability he develops a lasting bond with them  Eventually  at the end of the album Land of Black Gold  he has become a resident of Marlinspike Hall  Calculus has a tendency to act in an aggressive manner when someone says he s  acting the goat   He is a fervent believer in dowsing  and carries a pendulum for that purpose  Calculus s deafness is a frequent source of humour  as he repeats back what he thinks he has heard  usually in the most unlikely words possible  He does not admit to being near deaf and insists he is only a little hard of hearing in one ear  Thomson and Thompson are two bumbling detectives who  although unrelated  look like twins whose only discernible difference is the shape of their moustaches  21  They provide much of the comic relief throughout the series  being afflicted with chronic spoonerisms and comic pratfalls  They are thoroughly incompetent in their tasks  always bent on arresting the wrong character  but in spite of this they somehow get entrusted with delicate missions  The detectives usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks  except when abroad  during those missions they insist on wearing the  costume  of the locality they are visiting so as to blend into the local population  but instead manage to attire themselves in folkloric attire that actually makes them stand apart  The detectives were in part based on Herg  s father Alexis and uncle L on  identical twins who often took walks together wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks  Bianca Castafiore is an opera singer whom Haddock absolutely despises  She seems to constantly be popping up wherever he goes  along with her maid Irma and pianist Igor Wagner  She is comically foolish  whimsical  absent minded  and talkative  and seems unaware that her voice is shrill and appallingly loud  Her speciality is the Jewel Song  Ah  je ris de me voir si belle en ce miroir  from Gounod s opera  Faust  and sings this at the least provocation  much to Haddock s dismay  She tends to be melodramatic in an exaggerated fashion and is often maternal toward Haddock  of whose dislike she remains ignorant  She often confuses words  especially names  with other words that rhyme with them or of which they remind her   Haddock  is frequently replaced by malapropisms such as  Paddock    Harrock    Padlock    Hopscotch    Drydock    Stopcock    Maggot    Bart k    Hammock   and  Hemlock   while Nestor  Haddock s butler  is confused with  Chestor  and  Hector   Her own name means  white and chaste flower   a meaning to which Professor Calculus refers when he offers a white rose to the singer in The Castafiore Emerald  She was based upon opera divas in general  according to Herg  s perception   Herg  s Aunt Ninie who was known for her  shrill  singing of opera  and  in the post war comics  on Maria Callas  22  Other recurring characters include Nestor the butler  Chang the loyal Chinese boy  Jolyon Wagg the infuriating  to Haddock  insurance salesman  General Alcazar the South American leader  Kalish Ezab the Arab emir  Abdullah the emir s mischievous son  Dr  J W  M ller the evil Nazi German doctor  Oliveira de Figueira the friendly salesman who can sell even the most trivial of items  Cutts the Butcher who is repeatedly telephoned by accident by Haddock and whose phone number is repeatedly confused with Haddock s  Rastapopoulos  the criminal mastermind  and Allan  Rastapopoulos  henchman and formerly Haddock s first mate   edit  Settings Main article  Settings in The Adventures of Tintin The settings within Tintin have also added depth to the strips  Herg  mingles real and fictional lands into his stories  along with a base in Belgium from where the heroes set off  originally 26 Labrador Road  but later Marlinspike Hall   This is best demonstrated in King Ottokar s Sceptre  in which Herg  creates two fictional countries  Syldavia and Borduria  and invites the reader to tour them in text through the insertion of a travel brochure into the storyline  6  Other fictional lands include San Theodoros  San Paolo  and Nuevo Rico in South America  the kingdom or administrative region of Gaipajama in India  and Khemed on the Arabian Peninsula 23  which replaced the setting of Mandate Palestine used in the first edition of Land of Black Gold  Along with these fictitious locations  actual nations were employed such as Belgium  Switzerland  the United Kingdom  the United States  the Soviet Union  Congo  Peru  India  Egypt  Indonesia  Nepal  Tibet  and China  Other actual locales used were the Sahara Desert  the Atlantic Ocean and the Moon   edit  Research Herg  s extensive research began with The Blue Lotus  Herg  stating   it was from that time that I undertook research and really interested myself in the people and countries to which I sent Tintin  out of a sense of responsibility to my readers   7  Herg  s use of research and photographic reference allowed him to build a realised universe for Tintin  going so far as to create fictionalised countries  dressing them with specific political cultures  These were heavily informed by the cultures evident in Herg  s lifetime  Pierre Skilling has asserted that Herg  saw monarchy as  the legitimate form of government   noting that democratic  values seem underrepresented in  such  a classic Franco Belgian strip   24  Syldavia in particular is described in considerable detail  Herg  creating a history  customs  and a language which is actually a Slavian looking transcript of Marols  the Flemish dialect of Brussels  He set the country in the Balkans  and it is  by his own admission  modeled after Albania  25  The country finds itself threatened by neighbouring Borduria with an attempted annexation appearing in King Ottokar s Sceptre  This situation parallels the Italian conquest of Albania and of Czechoslovakia and Austria by expansionist Nazi Germany prior to World War II  26  Herg  s use of research would include months of preparation for Tintin s voyage to the moon in the two part storyline spread across Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon  His research for the storyline was noted in New Scientist   The considerable research undertaken by Herg  enabled him to come very close to the type of space suit that would be used in future Moon exploration  although his portrayal of the type of rocket that was actually used was a long way off the mark   The moon rocket is based on the German V2 rockets  27   edit  Influences In his youth Herg  admired Benjamin Rabier and suggested that a number of images within Tintin in the Land of the Soviets reflected this influence  particularly the pictures of animals  Ren  Vincent  the Art Deco designer  also had an impact on early Tintin adventures   His influence can be detected at the beginning of the Soviets  where my drawings are designed along a decorative line  like an  S      28  Herg  also felt no compunction in admitting that he had stolen the image of round noses from George McManus  feeling they were  so much fun that I used them  without scruples   29  During the extensive research Herg  carried out for The Blue Lotus  he became influenced by Chinese and Japanese illustrative styles and woodcuts  This is especially noticeable in the seascapes  which are reminiscent of works by Hokusai and Hiroshige  30  31  Herg  also declared Mark Twain an influence  although this admiration may have led him astray when depicting Incas as having no knowledge of an upcoming solar eclipse in Prisoners of the Sun  an error attributed by T F  Mills to an attempt to portray  Incas in awe of a latter day  Connecticut Yankee    8   edit  Reception  edit  Awards On 1 June 2006  the Dalai Lama bestowed the International Campaign for Tibet s Light of Truth Award upon the character of Tintin  along with South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu  32  The award was in recognition of Herg  s book Tintin in Tibet  which the Executive Director of ICT Europe Tsering Jampa noted was  for many     their introduction to the awe inspiring landscape and culture of Tibet   33  In 2001 the Herg  Foundation demanded the recall of the Chinese translation of the work  which had been released with the title Tintin in China s Tibet  The work was subsequently published with the correct translation of the title  34  Accepting on behalf of the Herg  Foundation  Herg  s widow Fanny Rodwell declared   We never thought that this story of friendship would have a resonance more than 40 years later   32   edit  Tintinology and literary criticism Main article  List of books about Tintin The study of The Adventures of Tintin is known as Tintinology  with its followers being varyingly known as Tintinologists  Tintinophiles  Tintinolators  Tintinites or Herg logues  3  35  One notable Tintinologist is the Belgian Philippe Goddin  who published Herg  et Tintin reporters  Du Petit vingti me au Journal Tintin  1986  later republished in English as Herg  and Tintin Reporters  From  Le Petit Vingtieme  to  Tintin  Magazine in 1987  and Herg  et les Bigotudos  1993  amongst other books on the series  In 1983  Beno t Peeters published Le Monde d Herg   subsequently published in English as Tintin and the World of Herg  in 1988  36  Although Goddin and Peeters were native French speakers  the English reporter Michael Farr also published works on Tintinology such as Tintin  60 Years of Adventure  1989   Tintin  The Complete Companion  2001   37 Tintin  amp  Co   2007  38  and The Adventures of Herg   2007   as had English screenwriter Harry Thompson  the author of Tintin  Herg  and his Creation  1991   39  The Adventures of Tintin have also been examined by literary critics  primarily in French speaking Europe  In 1984  Jean Marie Apostolid s published his study of the Adventures of Tintin from a more  adult  perspective as Les M tamorphoses de Tintin  although it would only appear in English as The Metamorphoses of Tintin  or Tintin for Adults in 2010  40  In reviewing Apostolid s  book  Nathan Perl Rosenthal of The New Republic thought that it was  not for the faint of heart  it is densely packed with close textual analysis and laden with psychological jargon   41  Following Apostolid s s work  French psychoanalyst Serge Tisseron examined the series in his books Tintin et les Secrets de Famille   Tintin and the Family Secrets    which was published in 1990  42  and Tintin et le Secret d Herg    Tintin and Herg  s Secret    published in 1993  43  The first English language work of literary criticism devoted to the series was Tintin and the Secret of Literature  written by the novelist Tom McCarthy and published in 2006  In this book  McCarthy compares Herg  s work with that of Aeschylus  Honor  de Balzac  Joseph Conrad and Henry James and argues that the series contains the key to understanding literature itself  44  McCarthy considered the Adventures of Tintin to be  stupendously rich   45  containing  a mastery of plot and symbol  theme and sub text  46  which  influenced by Tisseron s psychoanalytical readings of the work  he believed could be deciphered to reveal a series of recurring themes  ranging from bartering 47  to implicit sexual intercourse 48  that Herg  had featured throughout the series  Reviewing the book in The Telegraph  Toby Clements argued however that McCarthy s work  and literary criticism of Herg  s comic strips in general  cut  perilously close  to simply feeding  the appetite of those willing to cross the line between enthusiast and obsessive  in the Tintinological community  2   edit  Politically correct criticism The earliest stories in The Adventures of Tintin have been criticised who   for both displaying animal cruelty as well as racial stereotypes  violent  colonialist  and even fascist leanings  including caricatured portrayals of non Europeans  While the Herg  Foundation has presented such criticism as na vet   49  and scholars of Herg  such as Harry Thompson have claimed that  Herg  did what he was told by the Abb  Wallez   49  Herg  himself felt that his background made it impossible to avoid prejudice  stating that  I was fed the prejudices of the bourgeois society that surrounded me   29  In Tintin in the Land of the Soviets  the Bolsheviks were presented without exception as villains  Herg  drew on Moscow Unveiled  a work given to him by Wallez and authored by Joseph Douillet  the former Belgian consul in Russia  that is highly critical of the Soviet regime  although Herg  contextualised this by noting that in Belgium  at the time a devout Catholic nation   Anything Bolshevik was atheist   29  In the story  Bolshevik leaders are motivated only by personal greed and by a desire to deceive the world  Tintin discovers  buried   the hideout where Lenin  Trotsky  and Stalin have collected together wealth stolen from the people   Herg  later dismissed the failings of this first story as  a transgression of my youth   49  By 1999  some part of this presentation was being noted as far more reasonable  with British weekly newspaper The Economist declaring   In retrospect  however  the land of hunger and tyranny painted by Herg  was uncannily accurate   50  Tintin in the Congo has been criticised as presenting the Africans as na ve and primitive  In the original work  Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing a class of African children   Mes chers amis   he says   je vais vous parler aujourd hui de votre patrie  La Belgique    My dear friends  I am going to talk to you today about your fatherland  Belgium    Herg  redrew this in 1946 to show a lesson in mathematics  51  52  Herg  later admitted the flaws in the original story  excusing it by noting   I portrayed these Africans according to     this purely paternalistic spirit of the time   29  The perceived problems with this book were summarised by Sue Buswell in 1988 53  as being  all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals  although Thompson noted this quote may have been  taken out of context   49   Dead animals  refers to the fashion for big game hunting at the time of the work s original publication  Drawing on Andr  Maurois  Les Silences du colonel Bramble  Herg  presents Tintin as a big game hunter  accidentally killing fifteen antelope as opposed to the one needed for the evening meal  However  concerns over the number of dead animals did lead the Scandinavian publishers of Tintin s adventures to request changes  A page which presented Tintin killing a rhinoceros by drilling a hole in the animal s back and inserting a stick of dynamite was deemed excessive  and Herg  substituted a page in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin s rifle while he slept under a tree  54  In 2007 the UK s Commission for Racial Equality called for the book to be pulled from the shelves after a complaint  stating that  it beggars belief that in this day and age that any shop would think it acceptable to sell and display  Tintin In The Congo    55  56  In August 2007  a complaint was filed in Brussels  Belgium  by a Congolese student  claiming the book was an insult to the Congolese people  Public prosecutors are investigating  however  the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism warned against excess political correctness  57  Mr  Bohlwinkel Some of the early albums were altered by Herg  in subsequent editions  usually at the demand of publishers  For example  at the instigation of his American publishers  many of the black characters in Tintin in America were re coloured to make their race white or ambiguous  58 The Shooting Star album originally had an American villain with the Jewish surname of  Blumenstein   This proved to be controversial  as the character exhibited exaggerated stereotypically Jewish characteristics   Blumenstein  was changed to an American with a less ethnically specific name  Mr  Bohlwinkel  in later editions and subsequently to a South American of a fictional country   S o Rico  Herg  later discovered that  Bohlwinkel  was also a Jewish name  26   edit  Adaptations and memorabilia Main article  Tintin books  films  and media The Adventures of Tintin has been adapted in a variety of media besides the original comic strip and its collections  Herg  encouraged adaptations and members of his studio working on the animated films  After Herg  s death  the Herg  Foundation became responsible for authorising adaptations and exhibitions  59  The French film poster for the 1961 film  Tintin and the Golden Fleece  edit  Cinema The Crab with the Golden Claws  1947    The first successful attempt to adapt one of the comics into a feature film  Written and directed by Claude Misonne and Jo o B Michiels  the film was a black and white stop motion puppet production created by a small Belgian studio  60  Tintin and the Golden Fleece  1961    A French live action film was released  adapted not from one of Herg  s Adventures of Tintin but instead from an original script written by Andr  Barret and R mo Forlani  61  Directed by Jean Jacques Vierne and starring Jean Pierre Talbot as Tintin and Georges Wilson as Haddock  the plot revolves around the protagonists travelling to Istanbul in Turkey to collect the Golden Fleece  a ship left to Haddock in the will of his friend  Themistocle Paparanic  Whilst in the city however  Tintin and Haddock discover that a group of villains also want possession of the ship  believing that it would lead them to a hidden treasure  61  Tintin and the Blue Oranges  1964    The success of the first Tintin live action film led to a second being released  Again based upon an original script  once more by Andr  Barret  it was directed by Philippe Condroyer and starred Talbot as Tintin and Jean Bouise as Haddock  61  The plot revolves around a new invention  the blue orange  that can grow in the desert and solve world famines  which has been devised by Calculus  friend  the Spanish Professor Zalamea  An emir whose interests are threatened by the invention of the blue orange proceeds to kidnap both Zalamea and Calculus  and Tintin and Haddock travel to Spain in order to rescue them  61  Tintin and the Temple of the Sun  1969    The next feature film to be based upon the Adventures of Tintin was the animated  adapted from the comic books The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun  Produced by Belvision  who had recently finished their television series based upon the Tintin stories  it was directed by Eddie Lateste and featured a critically acclaimed musical score by Fran ois Rauber  62  In 1970  Belvision then released an animated promotional short  Tintin et la SGM  63  Tintin and the Lake of Sharks  1972    based on an original script by Greg and subsequently adapted into comic book form  64  The Adventures of Tintin  2011    Steven Spielberg directed a motion capture 3D film based on three stories published in the 1940s  The Crab with the Golden Claws  1941   The Secret of the Unicorn  1943   and Red Rackham s Treasure  1944   65 Peter Jackson s company Weta Digital provided the animation and special effects  Jackson and Spielberg will co direct the second movie of the trilogy  an adaptation of The Seven Crystal Balls  1948  and Prisoners of the Sun  1949   66   edit  Television and radio Two animated television series have been made  both adaptations of the comic strips rather than original stories  The first was Herg  s Adventures of Tintin  produced by Belvision  The series aired from 1958 to 1962  with 104 five minute episodes produced  It was adapted by Charles Shows and then translated into French by Greg  Michel Regnier   then editor in chief of Tintin magazine  This series has been criticised for differing too greatly from the original books and for its poor animation  67  The second series was The Adventures of Tintin  featuring twenty one of the stories  It ran for three seasons  from 1991 to 1992   was co directed by St phane Bernasconi and Peter Hudecki  and was produced by Ellipse  France   and Nelvana  Canada   on behalf of La Fondation Herg   Traditional animation techniques were used on the series  adhering closely to the books to such an extent that some frames from the original albums were transposed directly to screen  The series was successful and it has aired in over fifty countries and was released on DVD  68  The British Broadcasting Corporation produced two  The Adventures of Tintin  series in 1992 and 1993 starring Richard Pearce as Tintin and Andrew Sachs as Snowy  Captain Haddock was played by Leo McKern in Series One and Lionel Jeffries in Series Two  Professor Calculus was played by Stephen Moore and The Thompsons were played by Charles Kay  This series aired in the US on HBO   edit  Documentaries Two documentaries have been made about Tintin and his creator Herg   I  Tintin  1976   a French documentary Tintin and I  Tintin et Moi   by Danish director Anders H gsbro  stergaard in 2003  a co production of companies from Denmark  Belgium  France  and Switzerland  This documentary was based on a taped interview with Herg  by Numa Sadoul from 1971  Although the interview was published as a book  Herg  was allowed to edit the work prior to publishing and much of the interview was excised  69  The documentary was broadcast in the United States as  Tintin and I  on the PBS network  11 July 2006  67   edit  Theatre Herg  himself helped to create two Tintin stage plays  Tintin in India  The Mystery of the Blue Diamond  1941  and The Disappearance of Mr  Boullock  1941 1942   both of which were written with Jacques Van Melkebeke and performed in Brussels  70  In the late 1970s and early 1980s  two Tintin plays appeared in London  adapted by Geoffrey Case for the Unicorn Theatre Company   these were Tintin s Great American Adventure  based on the comic Tintin in America  which was shown across 1976 1977  and Tintin and the Black Island  which was based on The Black Island and shown in 1980  This second play later went on tour  71  72  73  74  75  A musical based on The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun premi red on 15 September 2001 at the Stadsschouwburg  city theatre  in Antwerp  Belgium  It was entitled Kuifje   De Zonnetempel  De Musical  and was broadcast on Canal Plus  before moving on to Charleroi in 2002 as Tintin   Le Temple du Soleil  75  76  77  78  The Young Vic theatre company ran a musical version of Tintin in Tibet at the Barbican Arts Centre in London from December 2005 to January 2006  79  The production was directed by Rufus Norris  and was adapted by Norris and David Greig  79  The Herg  Foundation organised the return of this show to the West End theatre in December 2006 and January 2007 in order to celebrate the Herg  centenary  2007    edit  Exhibitions Herg  s work on Tintin has formed the basis of many exhibitions  with the Herg  Foundation creating a mobile exhibition in 1991   The World of Herg   is described by the Foundation as being  an excellent introduction to Herg  s work   Materials from this exhibition have also formed the basis for larger shows  namely  Herg  the Draughtsman   an exhibition to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Tintin s creation  and the more recent  In Tibet With Tintin   In 2001 the Mus e de la Marine staged an exhibition of items related to the sea which had inspired Herg   In 2002 the Bunkamura Museum of Art in Japan staged an exhibition of original drawings  as well as of the submarine and rocket ship invented in the strips by Professor Calculus  Barcelona has also hosted an exhibition on Tintin and the sea   llamp de rellamp  at the Maritime Museum in 2003  59  2004 saw exhibitions in Holland   Tintin and the Incas  at the Royal Museum of Ethnology  the  Tintin in the City  exhibition in the Halles Saint G ry in Brussels  and an exhibition focusing on Tintin s exploits at sea at the National Maritime Museum in London  59  The latter exhibition was in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the publication of Tintin s first adventure  and was organised in partnership with the Herg  Foundation  80  2004 also saw the Belgian Centre for Comic Strip Art add an area dedicated to Herg   59  The 100th anniversary of Herg  s birth is commemorated with a large exhibition at the Paris museum for contemporary arts  Centre Georges Pompidou  from 20 December 2006 until 19 February 2007  featuring all 120 original pages of The Blue Lotus  81   edit  Memorabilia and merchandise Soft toy versions of Snowy  Milou  Images from the series have long been licensed for use on merchandise  the success of the Tintin magazine helping to create a market for such items  Tintin s image has been used to sell a wide variety of products  from alarm clocks to underpants  82  There are now estimated to be over 250 separate items related to the character available  with some becoming collectors items in their own right  83  Since Herg  s death  the Herg  Foundation have maintained control of the licenses  through Moulinsart  the commercial wing of the foundation  Speaking in 2002  Peter Horemans  the then director general at Moulinsart  noted this control   We have to be very protective of the property  We don t take lightly any potential partners and we have to be very selective     for him to continue to be as popular as he is  great care needs to be taken of his use   84  However  the Foundation has been criticised by scholars as  trivialising the work of Herg  by concentrating on the more lucrative merchandising  in the wake of a move in the late 1990s to charge them for using relevant images to illustrate their papers on the series  85  NBC Universal acquired the rights to all of The Adventures of Tintin merchandise in North America  The Tintin Shop in Covent Garden  London Tintin memorabilia and merchandise has allowed a chain of stores based solely on the character to become viable  The first shop was launched in 1984 in Covent Garden  London  Tintin shops have also opened in both Bruges and Brussels in Belgium  and in Montpellier  France  The British bookstore chain  Ottakar s  founded in 1987  was named after the character of King Ottokar from the Tintin book King Ottokar s Sceptre  and their shops stocked a large amount of Tintin merchandise till their takeover by Waterstone s in 2006  86   edit  Stamps and coinage Main article  Tintin on postage stamps Tintin s image has been used on postage stamps on numerous occasions  the first issued by the Belgian Post in 1979 to celebrate the day of youth philately  87  This was the first in a series of stamps with the images of Belgian comic heroes  and was the first stamp in the world to feature a comic book hero  In 1999  the Royal Dutch Post released two stamps  based upon the Destination Moon adventure  with the stamps selling out within hours of release  The French post office  Poste Fran aise  then issued a stamp of Tintin and Snowy in 2001  To mark the end of the Belgian Franc  and also to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the publication of Tintin in the Congo  two more stamps were issued by the Belgian Post on 31 December 2001  The stamps were also issued in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the same time  2002 saw the French Post issue stamped envelopes featuring Tintin  whilst in 2004 the Belgian post office celebrated its own seventy fifth anniversary  as well as the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Explorers on the Moon and the thirty fifth anniversary of the moon landings with a series of stamps based upon the Explorers on the Moon adventure  88  In 2007  to celebrate Herg  s centennial  Belgium  France and Switzerland all plan to issue special stamps in commemoration  89  Besides stamps  Tintin has also been commemorated by coin several times  In 1995  Monnaie de Paris issued a set of 12 silver medallions to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Herg  s death  which were available in a limited edition of 5000  Another coin was released to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Tintin book Explorers on the Moon  again in a limited run  this time of 10 000  Belgium minted a limited edition commemorative coin to celebrate the 75th birthday of Tintin in January 2004  90  The coin  composed of silver and featuring Tintin and Snowy  was limited to a minting of 50 000  Although it has a face value of  10  it is  as with other commemorative euro coins of this type  i e  not a commemorative issue of a standard euro coin   only legal tender in the country in which it was issued   in this case  Belgium  90   edit  Parody and pastiche Main article  List of Tintin parodies and pastiches A frame from Breaking Free  a revolutionary socialist comic that parodies the Adventures of Tintin During Herg  s lifetime  parodies were produced of the Adventures of Tintin  with one of the earliest appearing in Belgian newspaper La Patrie after the liberation of the country from Nazi German occupation in September 1944  Entitled Tintin au Pays de Nazis   Tintin in the Land of the Nazis    the short and crudely drawn strip lampoons Herg  for working for a Nazi run newspaper during the occupation  91  Following Herg  s death  hundreds more unofficial parodies and pastiches of the Adventures of Tintin were produced  covering a wide variety of different genres  92  Tom McCarthy divided such works into three specific groupings  those which are pornographic  those which are political  and those which are artistic  93  In a number of cases  the actual name  Tintin  is replaced by something similar  like Nitnit  Timtim or Quinquin  within these books  92  Some of these parodies  such as 1976 s Tintin en Suisse   Tintin in Switzerland   and Jan Bucquoy s 1992 work La Vie Sexuelle de Tintin   The Sexual Life of Tintin   are pornographic in content  featuring Tintin and the other characters engaged in sexual acts  92  93  94  Another such example of a Tintin parody was Tintin in Thailand  in which Tintin  Haddock and Calculus travel to the East Asian country for a sex holiday  The book circulated from December 1999 onwards  but in 2001 Belgian police arrested those responsible and confiscated 650 copies for copyright violation  95  Other parodies have been produced for political reasons  for instance Tintin in Iraq lampoons the world politics of the early 21st century  with Herg  s character General Alcazar representing President of the United States George W  Bush  92  Written by the pseudonymous Jack Daniels  Breaking Free  1989  is a revolutionary socialist comic set in Britain during the 1980s  with Tintin and his uncle  modelled after Captain Haddock  being working class Englishmen who turn to socialism in order to oppose the capitalist policies of the Conservative Party government of Margaret Thatcher  When first published in Britain  it caused an outrage in the mainstream press  with one paper issuing the headline that  Commie nutters turn Tintin into picket yob   92  Other comic creators have chosen to create stories that are more like fan fiction than parody  The Swiss comic creator Exem has produced a series of adventures about Tintin s  evil twin  Zinzin  92  Similarly  the Canadian comic book writer and illustrator Yves Rodier has produced a number of Tintin works  none of which have been authorised by the Herg  Foundation  including a 1986  completion  of the unfinished Tintin and Alph art  which he drew in imitation of Herg  s ligne clair style  92  The response to these parodies has been mixed in the Tintinological community  Many Tintinologists despise them  seeing them as an affront to Herg  s work  92  with this being the view taken by Nick Rodwell of the Studio Herg   who declared that  None of these copyists count as true fans of Herg   If they were  they would respect his wishes that no one but him draw Tintin s adventures   92  Where possible  Studio Herg  have taken legal action against those known to be producing such items  Other Tintinologists have however taken a different attitude  considering such parodies and pastiches to be tributes to Herg   and collecting them has become a  niche speciality   92   edit  Translation into English Tintin first appeared in English in the weekly children s comic Eagle in 1951 in Vol 2 17  3 August  and it ran in weekly parts in the lower half of the centrefold  beneath the cutaway drawings  until Vol 3 5  9 May 1952   It was translated by a Frenchman in conjunction with Casterman  Tintin s publishers  and starts by describing Tintin as  a French boy   Snowy was called by his French name  Milou   96  The process of translating Tintin into English was then commissioned in 1958 by Methuen  amp  Co  Ltd  of London  It was a joint operation  headed by Leslie Lonsdale Cooper and Michael Turner  97  who worked closely with Herg  to attain an accurate translation as true as possible to the original work  98  The works were also sold in the American market by Golden Books  a branch of the Western Publishing Company in the 1950s  The albums were translated from French into American English with some blocks blanked except for the speech balloons  This was done to remove content considered to be inappropriate for children  such as drunkenness and free mixing of races  99  The albums were not very popular and only six were published in mixed order  100  The edited albums later had their blanked blocks redrawn by Herg  to be more acceptable  and they currently appear this way in published editions around the world  Atlantic Monthly Press  in cooperation with Little  Brown and Company beginning in the 1970s  published the albums again  This time  the text features the originally translated British English text with alterations to non universally understood words such as gaol  tyre  saloon and spanner  Currently  they are being published under the Joy Street imprint of Little  Brown and Company  Due in part to the large amount of language specific word play  such as punning  in the series  especially the jokes which played on Professor Calculus  partial deafness  it was always the intention not to translate literally  instead striving to sculpt a work whose idioms and jokes would be meritorious in their own right  however  in spite of the free hand Herg  afforded the two  they worked closely with the original text  asking for regular assistance to understand Herg  s intentions  98  More than simple translations  however  the English versions were anglicised to appeal to British customs and values  Milou  for example  was renamed Snowy at the translators  discretion  Moreover  the translation process served to colour the imagery within the book  the opportunity was taken to make scenes set in Britain more true to life  such as ensuring that the British police were unarmed  and ensuring scenes of the British countryside were more accurate for discerning British readers  98  Unlike in the United Kingdom  the books have always had very limited popularity in the United States  101  However  from 1966 to 1979 Children s Digest included monthly installments of The Adventures of Tintin  These serializations served to greatly increase Tintin s popularity in the United States  At that time Children s Digest had a circulation of around 700 000 copies monthly  102   edit  Legacy Tintin and his creator Herg  have inspired many artists within comics  Most notably  Herg  s ligne claire style has proven influential  Contributors to the Tintin magazine have employed ligne claire  and more recently  Jacques Tardi  Yves Chaland  Jason Little  Phil Elliott  Martin Handford  Geof Darrow  Eric Heuvel  and Garen Ewing have produced works utilising it  Tintin s legacy includes the establishment of a market for comic strip collections  the serialisation followed by collection model has been adopted by creators and publishers in France and Belgium  This system allows for greater financial stability  as creators receive money whilst working  This rivals the American and British model of work for hire  Roger Sabin has argued that this model allowed for  in theory     a better quality product   103 Paul Gravett has also noted that the use of detailed reference material and a picture archive  which Herg  implemented from The Blue Lotus onwards  was  a turning point     in the maturing of the medium as a whole   7  In the wider art world  both Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein have claimed Herg  as one of their most important influences  Lichtenstein made paintings based on fragments from Tintin s comics  whilst Warhol utilised the ligne claire and even made a series of paintings with Herg  as subject  He declared   Herg  has influenced my work in the same way as Walt Disney  For me  Herg  was more than a comic strip artist   104  In music  Tintin has been the inspiration to a number of bands and musicians  A British 1980s pop band took the name Thompson Twins after the Tintin characters  105 Stephen Duffy  lead singer of Duran Duran before they struck fame  had a UK number 4 hit with  Kiss Me  under the name Stephen  Tintin  Duffy  he had to drop the nickname  however  under pressure of a copyright infringement suit  106  An Australian psychedelic rock band and an American independent progressive rock band have used the name  Tin Tin   and British electronic dance music duo Tin Tin Out was similarly inspired by the character  South African singer songwriter Gert Vlok Nel compares Tintin to God in his Afrikaans song  Waarom ek roep na jou vanaand   presumably because Tintin is a morally pure character  Australian cartoonist Bill Leak often portrays Australia s round faced former prime minister and subsequent foreign minister  Kevin Rudd  as Tintin  Herg  has been lauded as  creating in art a powerful graphic record of the 20th century s tortured history  through his work on Tintin  107  whilst Maurice Horn s Encyclopaedia of World Comics declares him to have  spear headed the post World War II renaissance of European comic art   108  French philosopher Michel Serres noted that the 23 Tintin albums constituted a  chef d oeuvre  to which  the work of no French novelist is comparable in importance or greatness   109  On 30 May 2010  a life sized bronze statue of Tintin and Snowy  and more than 200 other Tintin items  including many original panels by Herg   sold for 1 08 million euros   1 3 million USD  at a Paris auction  110  Charles de Gaulle once said  My only international rival is Tintin   111  The Amazing Race 19 used the detectives of The Adventures of Tintin as a challenge to find out that the contestants were going to
