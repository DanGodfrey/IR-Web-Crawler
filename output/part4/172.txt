located at the southern tip of Africa  It is divided into nine provinces  with 2 798 kilometres  1 739 mi  of coastline 8  9  on the Atlantic and Indian oceans  10  To the north of the country lie the neighbouring territories of Namibia  Botswana and Zimbabwe  to the east are Mozambique and Swaziland  while Lesotho is an enclave surrounded by South African territory  11  South Africa is multi ethnic and has diverse cultures and languages  Eleven official languages are recognised in the constitution  10  Two of these languages are of European origin  South African English and Afrikaans  a language which originated mainly from Dutch that is spoken by the majority of white and Coloured South Africans  Though English is commonly used in public and commercial life  it is only the fifth most spoken home language  10  All ethnic and language groups have political representation in the country s constitutional democracy comprising a parliamentary republic  unlike most parliamentary republics  the positions of head of state and head of government are merged in a parliament dependent President  About 79 5  of the South African population is of black African ancestry  4  divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages  nine of which have official status  10  South Africa also contains the largest communities of European  Asian  and racially mixed ancestry in Africa  South Africa is ranked as an upper middle income economy by the World Bank  one of only four countries in Africa in this category  the others being Botswana  Gabon and Mauritius   12  It has the largest economy in Africa  and the 28th largest in the world  13  About a quarter of the population is unemployed 14  and lives on less than US  1 25 a day  15  Contents 1 History 1 1

16  17  18  Extensive fossil remains have been recovered from a series of caves in Gauteng Province  The area is a UNESCO World Heritage site and has been termed the Cradle of Humankind  The sites include Sterkfontein  which is one of the richest hominin fossil sites in the world  Other sites include Swartkrans  Gondolin Cave Kromdraai  Coopers Cave and Malapa  The first hominin fossil discovered in Africa  the Taung Child was found near Taung in 1924  Further hominin remains have been recovered from the sites of Makapansgat in Northern Province  Cornelia and Florisbad in the Free State  Border Cave in KwaZulu Natal  Klasies River Mouth in eastern Cape and Pinnacle Point  Elandsfontein and Die Kelders Cave in Western Cape  These sites suggest that various hominin species existed in South Africa from about three million years ago starting with Australopithecus africanus  19  These were succeeded by various species  including Australopithecus sediba  Homo ergaster  Homo erectus  Homo rhodesiensis  Homo helmei and modern humans  Homo sapiens  Mapungubwe Hill  the site of the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Mapungubwe Settlements of Bantu speaking peoples  who were iron using agriculturists and herdsmen  were already present south of the Limpopo River  now the northern border with Botswana and Zimbabwe  by the fourth or fifth century CE   See Bantu expansion   They displaced  conquered and absorbed the original Khoisan speakers  the Khoikhoi and San peoples  The Bantu slowly moved south  The earliest ironworks in modern day KwaZulu Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050  The southernmost group was the Xhosa people  whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan people  The Xhosa reached the Great Fish River  in today s Eastern Cape Province  As they migrated  these larger Iron Age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples  who often had hunter gatherer societies citation needed   Modern humans have inhabited Southern Africa for at least 170 000 years  At the time of European contact  the dominant indigenous peoples were Bantu speaking peoples who had migrated from other parts of Africa about one thousand years before  The two major historic groups were the Xhosa and Zulu peoples  In 1487  the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias led the first European voyage to land in southern Africa  20  On 4 December  he landed at Walfisch Bay  now known as Walvis Bay in present day Namibia   This was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor  the Portuguese navigator Diogo C o  Cape Cross  north of the bay   Dias continued down the western cost of southern Africa  After 8 January 1488  prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast  he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of Africa without seeing it  He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as  what he called  Rio do Infante  probably the present day Groot River  in May 1488  but on his return he saw the Cape  which he first named Cabo das Tormentas  Cape of Storms   His King  John II  renamed the point Cabo da Boa Esperan a  or Cape of Good Hope  as it led to the riches of the East Indies  21  Dias  feat of navigation was later memorialised in Lu s de Cam es  epic Portuguese poem  The Lusiads  1572   Colonization The arrival of Jan van Riebeeck  the first European to settle in South Africa  with Devil s Peak in the background In 1652  a century and a half after the discovery of the Cape Sea Route  Jan van Riebeeck established a refreshment station at the Cape of Good Hope  at what would become Cape Town  22  on behalf of the Dutch East India Company  The Dutch transported slaves from Indonesia  Madagascar  and India as labour for the colonists in Cape Town  As they expanded east  the Dutch settlers met the southwesterly migrating Xhosa people in the region of the Fish River  A series of wars  called the Cape Frontier Wars  were fought over conflicting land and livestock interests  The discovery of diamonds  and later gold  was one of the catalysts that triggered the 19th century conflict known as the Anglo Boer War  as the Boers  original Dutch  Flemish  German  and French settlers  and the British fought for the control of the South African mineral wealth  Cape Town became a British colony in 1806  European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the Boers and the British 1820 Settlers claimed land in the north and east of the country  Conflicts arose among the Xhosa  Zulu  and Afrikaner groups who competed for territory  Great Britain took over the Cape of Good Hope area in 1795  to prevent it from falling under control of the French First Republic  which had invaded the Dutch Republic  Given its standing interests in Australia and India  Great Britain wanted to use Cape Town as an interim port for its merchants  long voyages  The British returned Cape Town to the Dutch Batavian Republic in 1803  the Dutch East India Company having effectively gone bankrupt by 1795  The British finally annexed the Cape Colony in 1806 and continued the frontier wars against the Xhosa  the British pushed the eastern frontier through a line of forts established along the Fish River  They consolidated the territory by encouraging British settlement  Due to pressure of abolitionist societies in Britain  the British parliament stopped its global slave trade with the passage of the Slave Trade Act 1807 and then abolished slavery in all its colonies with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833  In the first two decades of the 19th century  the Zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader  Shaka  23  Shaka s warfare led indirectly to the Mfecane   crushing   that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early 1820s  24  25  An offshoot of the Zulu  the Matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king Mzilikazi  During the 1830s  approximately 12 000 Boers  later known as Voortrekkers   departed from the Cape Colony  where they had been subjected to British control  They migrated to the future Natal  Orange Free State  and Transvaal regions  The Boers founded the Boer Republics  the South African Republic  now Gauteng  Limpopo  Mpumalanga and North West provinces  and the Orange Free State  Free State   The discovery of diamonds in 1867 and gold in 1884 in the interior started the Mineral Revolution and increased economic growth and immigration  This intensified the European South African subjugation of the indigenous people  The struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between Europeans and the indigenous population and also between the Boers and the British  26  Boers in combat  1881  The Boer Republics successfully resisted British encroachments during the First Boer War  1880 1881  using guerrilla warfare tactics  which were well suited to local conditions  The British returned with greater numbers  more experience  and new strategy in the Second Boer War  1899 1902  but suffered heavy casualties through attrition  but were ultimately successful  Within the country  anti British policies among white South Africans focused on independence  During the Dutch and British colonial years  racial segregation was mostly informal  though some legislation were enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people  including the Native Location Act of 1879 and the system of pass laws  27  28  29  Power was held by the ethnic European colonists  After four years of negotiating  the South Africa Act 1909 created the Union of South Africa from the Cape and Natal colonies  as well as the republics of Orange Free State and Transvaal  on 31 May 1910  eight years after the end of the Second Boer War  The newly created Union of South Africa was a dominion of the British Empire  The Natives  Land Act of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks  at that stage natives controlled only 7  of the country  The amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased  30  In the Boer republics  31  from as early as the Pretoria Convention  chapter XXVI   32  and subsequent South African governments  the legislature passed legally institutionalised segregation  later known as apartheid  The government established three racial classes  white  coloured  people of Asian or mixed racial ancestry   and black  with rights and restrictions for each  In 1931 the union was effectively granted independence from the United Kingdom with the passage of the Statute of Westminster  In 1934  the South African Party and National Party merged to form the United Party  seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English speaking  Whites   In 1939 the party split over the entry of the Union into World War II as an ally of the United Kingdom  a move which the National Party followers strongly opposed   For use by white persons    sign from the apartheid era In 1948  the National Party was elected to power  It strengthened the racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule  and subsequent South African governments since the Union was formed citation needed   The Nationalist Government classified all peoples into three races  developed rights and limitations for each  such as pass laws and residential restrictions citation needed   The white minority controlled the vastly larger black majority  The system of segregation became known collectively as apartheid  While the White minority enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of Africa  comparable to First World Western nations  the Black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard  including income  education  housing  and life expectancy  Republic On 31 May 1961  following a whites only referendum  the country became a republic and left the Commonwealth  Queen Elizabeth II ceased to be head of state  and the last Governor General became State President  Despite opposition both within and outside the country  the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid  Apartheid became increasingly controversial  and some Western nations and institutions began to boycott doing business with South Africa because of its racial policies and oppression of civil rights  International sanctions  divestment of holdings by investors accompanied growing unrest and oppression within South Africa  The government harshly oppressed resistance movements  and violence became widespread  with anti apartheid activists using strikes  marches  protests  and sabotage by bombing and other means  The African National Congress  ANC  was a major resistance movement  In the late 1970s  South Africa began a programme of nuclear weapons development  In the following decade  it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons  33  34  The Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith  signed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz in 1974  enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all  the first of such agreements by acknowledged black and white political leaders in South Africa  Ultimately  F  W  de Klerk negotiated with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for a transition of policies and government  In 1990 the National Party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the African National Congress and other political organisations  It released Nelson Mandela from prison after twenty seven years  serving a sentence for sabotage  A negotiation process followed  The government repealed apartheid legislation  South Africa destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty  South Africa held its first universal elections in 1994  which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority  It has been in power ever since  The country rejoined the Commonwealth of Nations  In post apartheid South Africa  unemployment has been extremely high as the country has struggled with many changes  While many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes  the overall unemployment rate of blacks worsened between 1994 and 2003  35  Poverty among whites  previously rare  increased  36  In addition  the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth  Since the ANC led government took power  the United Nations Human Development Index of South Africa has fallen  while it was steadily rising until the mid 1990s  37  Some may be attributed to the AIDS pandemic  and the failure of the government to take steps to address it in the early years  38  In May 2008  riots left over sixty people dead  39  The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions estimates over 100 000 people were driven from their homes  40  Migrants and refugees seeking asylum were the targets  but a third of the victims were South African citizens  39  In a 2006 survey  the South African Migration Project concluded that South Africans are more opposed to immigration than anywhere else in the world  41  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2008 over 200 000 refugees applied for asylum in South Africa  almost four times as many as the year before  42  These people were mainly from Zimbabwe  though many also come from Burundi  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Rwanda  Eritrea  Ethiopia and Somalia  42  Competition over jobs  business opportunities  public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities  42  While xenophobia is still a problem  recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared  42  Politics Main articles  Government of South Africa  Politics of South Africa  and Law of South Africa The Union Buildings in Pretoria  seat of the executive The Houses of Parliament in Cape Town  seat of the legislature South Africa is a parliamentary republic  although unlike most such republics the President is both head of state and head of government  and depends for his tenure on the confidence of Parliament  The executive  legislature and judiciary are all subject to the supremacy of the Constitution  and the superior courts have the power to strike down executive actions and acts of Parliament if they are unconstitutional  The National Assembly  the lower house of Parliament  consists of 400 members and is elected every five years by a system of party list proportional representation  In the most recent election  held on 22 April 2009  the African National Congress  ANC  won 65 9  of the vote and 264 seats  while the main opposition  the Democratic Alliance  DA  won 16 7  of the vote and 67 seats  The National Council of Provinces  the upper house  consists of ninety members  with each of the nine provincial legislatures electing ten members  After each parliamentary election  the National Assembly elects one of its members as President  hence the President serves a term of office the same as that of the Assembly  normally five years  No President may serve more than two terms in office  The President appoints a Deputy President and Ministers  who form the Cabinet  The President and the Cabinet may be removed by the National Assembly by a motion of no confidence  South Africa has three capital cities  Cape Town  as the seat of Parliament  is the legislative capital  Pretoria  as the seat of the President and Cabinet  is the administrative capital  and Bloemfontein  as the seat of the Supreme Court of Appeal  is the judicial capital  Since the end of apartheid in 1994  South African politics have been dominated by the African National Congress  ANC   which has been the dominant party with 60 70  of the vote  The main challenger to the rule of the ANC is the Democratic Alliance  The National Party  which ruled from 1948 to 1994  renamed itself in 1997 to the New National Party  and chose to merge with the ANC in 2005  Other major political parties represented in Parliament are the Congress of the People  which split from the ANC and won 7 4  of the vote in 2009  and the Inkatha Freedom Party  which mainly represents Zulu voters and took 4 6  of the vote in the 2009 election  Since 2004  the country has had many thousands of popular protests  some violent  making it  according to one academic  the  most protest rich country in the world   43  Many of these protests have been organised from the growing shanty towns that surround South African cities  In 2008  South Africa placed 5th out of 48 sub Saharan African countries on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance  South Africa scored well in the categories of Rule of Law  Transparency  amp  Corruption and Participation  amp  Human Rights  but was let down by its relatively poor performance in Safety  amp  Security  The Ibrahim Index is a comprehensive measure of African governance  based on a number of different variables which reflect the success with which governments deliver essential political goods to its citizens  44  Law The Constitutional Court in Johannesburg The primary sources of South African law are Roman Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law  as imports of Dutch settlements and British colonialism  45  The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the Dutch East India Company and is called Roman Dutch law  It was imported before the codification of European law into the Napoleonic Code and is comparable in many ways to Scots law  This was followed in the 19th century by English law  both common and statutory  Starting in 1910 with unification  South Africa had its own parliament which passed laws specific for South Africa  building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies  During the years of apartheid  the country s political scene was dominated by figures like B  J  Vorster and P  W  Botha  as well as opposition figures such as Harry Schwarz  Joe Slovo and Helen Suzman  The judicial system consists of the magistrates  courts  which hear lesser criminal cases and smaller civil cases  the High Courts  which are courts of general jurisdiction for specific areas  the Supreme Court of Appeal  which is the highest court in all but constitutional matters  and the Constitutional Court  which hears only constitutional matters  According to a survey for the period 1998 2000 compiled by the United Nations  South Africa was ranked second for murder and first for assaults and rapes per capita  46  Nearly 50 murders are committed each day in South Africa  47  Total crime per capita is 10th out of the 60 countries in the data set  citation needed  Middle class South Africans seek security in gated communities  citation needed  Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a big motivator for them to leave  48 Crime against the farming community has continued to be a major problem  49  It is estimated that 500 000 women are raped in South Africa every year 50  with the average woman more likely to be raped than complete secondary school  51  A 2009 survey found one in four South African men admitted to raping someone 52  and another survey found one in three women out of 4000 surveyed women said they had been raped in the past year  53  Rapes are also perpetrated by children  some as young as ten   54 Child and baby rape incidences are some of the highest in the world and a number of high profile cases have outraged the nation  55  Foreign relations Main article  Foreign relations of South Africa As the Union of South Africa  the country was a founding member of the United Nations  The then Prime Minister Jan Smuts wrote the preamble to the United Nations Charter  56  57  The country is one of the founding members of the African Union  AU   and has the largest economy of all the members  It is also a founding member of the AU s New Partnership for Africa s Development  NEPAD   South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade  such as in Burundi  the Democratic Republic of Congo  the Comoros  and Zimbabwe  After apartheid ended  South Africa was readmitted to the Commonwealth of Nations  The country is a member of the Group of 77 and chaired the organisation in 2006  South Africa is also a member of the Southern African Development Community  South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone  Southern African Customs Union  Antarctic Treaty System  World Trade Organization  International Monetary Fund  G20 and G8 5  South African President Jacob Zuma and Chinese President Hu Jintao upgraded bilateral ties between the two countries on 24 August 2010  when they signed the Beijing Agreement  which elevated South Africa s earlier  strategic partnership  with China to the higher level of  comprehensive strategic partnership  in both economic and political affairs  including the strengthening of exchanges between their respective ruling parties and legislatures  58  59  In April 2011  South Africa formally joined the Brazil Russia India China  BRICS  grouping of countries  identified by President Zuma as the country s largest trading partners  and also the largest trading partners with Africa as a whole  All five BRICS member countries are currently on the UN Security Council  Brazil  India and South Africa as non permanent members  Zuma asserted that BRICS member countries would also work with each other through the UN

South Africa and weapons of mass destruction The South African National Defence Force  SANDF  was created in 1994  61  62  as an all volunteer force composed of the former South African Defence Force  the forces of the African nationalist groups  Umkhonto we Sizwe and Azanian People s Liberation Army   and the former Bantustan defence forces  61  The SANDF is subdivided into four branches  the South African Army  the South African Air Force  the South African Navy  and the South African Medical Service  63  In recent years  the SANDF has become a major peacekeeping force in Africa  64  and has been involved in operations in Lesotho  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  64  and Burundi  64  amongst others  It has also served in multi national UN peacekeeping forces  South Africa is the only African country to have successfully developed nuclear weapons  It became the first country  followed by Ukraine  with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty in 1991  65  South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s 65  According to former state president FW de Klerk  the decision to build a  nuclear deterrent  was taken  as early as 1974 against a backdrop of a Soviet expansionist threat   66  South Africa may have conducted a nuclear test over the Atlantic in 1979  67  though De Klerk asserted that South Africa had  never conducted a clandestine nuclear test   66  Six nuclear devices were completed between 1980 and 1990  but all were destroyed before South Africa signed the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty in 1991  66  Provinces Main article  Provinces of South Africa Provinces of South Africa At the end of apartheid in 1994  the  independent  and  semi independent  Bantustans were abolished  as were the four original provinces  Cape  Natal  Orange Free State and Transvaal   and nine new provinces were created  Each province is governed by a unicameral legislature  which is elected every five years by party list proportional representation  The legislature elects a Premier as head of government  and the Premier appoints an Executive Council as a provincial cabinet  The powers of provincial governments are limited to topics listed in the Constitution  these topics include such fields as health  education  public housing and transport  Province Provincial capital Largest city Area  km   68  Population  2011 est   69  Eastern Cape Bhisho Port Elizabeth 168 966 6 829 958 Free State Bloemfontein Bloemfontein 129 825 2 759

urban agglomerations  perform the functions of both district and local municipalities  Geography Main article  Geography of South Africa Satellite picture of South Africa The Drakensberg mountains  the highest mountain range in South Africa South Africa is located at the southernmost region of Africa  with a long coastline that stretches more than 2 500 km  1 553 mi  and along two oceans  the South Atlantic and the Indian   At 1 219 912 km2  471 011 sq mi   70  South Africa is the 25th largest country in the world and is comparable in size to Colombia  Mafadi in the Drakensberg at 3 450 m  11 320 ft  is the highest peak in South Africa  Excluding the Prince Edward Islands  the country lies between latitudes 22  and 35 S  and longitudes 16  and 33 E  The interior of South Africa is a vast  flat  and sparsely populated scrubland  the Karoo  which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert  In contrast  the eastern coastline is lush and well watered  which produces a climate similar to the tropics  To the north of Johannesburg  the altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld  and turns into the lower lying Bushveld  an area of mixed dry forest and an abundance of wildlife  East of the Highveld  beyond the eastern escarpment  the Lowveld stretches towards the Indian Ocean  It has particularly high temperatures  and is also the location of extended subtropical agriculture  South Africa also has one possession  the small sub Antarctic archipelago of the Prince Edward Islands  consisting of Marion Island  290 km2 110 sq mi  and Prince Edward Island  45 km2 17 sq mi   not to be confused with the Canadian province of the same name   Climate Main article  Climate of South Africa South Africa has a generally temperate climate  due in part to being surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides  by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north  towards the equator  and further inland  Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence  a great variety of climatic zones exist  Winters in South Africa occur between June and August  The climatic zones vary  from the extreme desert of the southern Namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the Mozambique border and the Indian ocean  From the east  the land quickly rises over a mountainous escarpment towards the interior plateau known as the Highveld  Even though South Africa is classified as semi arid  there is considerable variation in climate as well as topography  The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the Mediterranean with wet winters and hot  dry summers  hosting the famous Fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket  This area also produces much of the wine in South Africa  This region is also particularly known for its wind  which blows intermittently almost all year  The severity of this wind made passing around the Cape of Good Hope particularly treacherous for sailors  causing many shipwrecks  Further east on the south coast  rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year  producing a green landscape  This area is popularly known as the Garden Route  The Free State is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau  North of the Vaal River  the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat  Johannesburg  in the centre of the Highveld  is at 1 740 m  5 709 ft  and receives an annual rainfall of 760 mm  29 9 in   Winters in this region are cold  although snow is rare  The high Drakensberg mountains  which form the south eastern escarpment of the Highveld  offer limited skiing opportunities in winter  The coldest place in South Africa is Sutherland in the western Roggeveld Mountains  where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as  15  C  5  F   The deep interior has the hottest temperatures  a temperature of 51 7  C  125 06  F  was recorded in 1948 in the Northern Cape Kalahari near Upington  71  Flora and fauna See also  Wildlife of South Africa and Protected areas of South Africa South Africa is ranked sixth out of the world s seventeen megadiverse countries  72  with more than 20 000 different plants  or about 10  of all the known species of plants on Earth  making it particularly rich in plant biodiversity  The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the grassland  particularly on the Highveld  where the plant cover is dominated by different grasses  low shrubs  and acacia trees  mainly camel thorn and whitethorn  Vegetation becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low rainfall  There are several species of water storing succulents like aloes and euphorbias in the very hot and dry Namaqualand area  The grass and thorn savannah turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north east of the country  with denser growth  There are significant numbers of baobab trees in this area  near the northern end of Kruger National Park  73  The Fynbos Biome  which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the Cape floristic region  one of the six floral kingdoms  is located in a small region of the Western Cape and contains more than 9 000 of those species  making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of floral biodiversity  The majority of the plants are evergreen hard leaf plants with fine  needle like leaves  such as the sclerophyllous plants  Another uniquely South African plant is the protea genus of flowering plants  There are around 130 different species of protea in South Africa  South African giraffe  Kruger National Park While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants  only 1  of South Africa is forest  almost exclusively in the humid coastal plain of KwaZulu Natal  where there are also areas of Southern Africa mangroves in river mouths  There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of fire  known as montane forests  Plantations of imported tree species are predominant  particularly the non native eucalyptus and pine  South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades  primarily due to overpopulation  sprawling development patterns and deforestation during the nineteenth century  South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many  e g  Black Wattle  Port Jackson  Hakea  Lantana and Jacaranda  posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and the already scarce water resources  The original temperate forest found by the first European settlers was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained  Currently  South African hardwood trees like Real Yellowwood  Podocarpus latifolius   stinkwood  Ocotea bullata   and South African Black Ironwood  Olea laurifolia  are under government protection  Numerous mammals are found in the bushveld including lions  leopards  white rhinos  blue wildebeest  kudus  impalas  hyenas  hippopotamus and giraffes  A significant extent of the bushveld exists in the north east including Kruger National Park and the Mala Mala Reserve  as well as in the far north in the Waterberg Biosphere  Statistics from South African National Parks show a record 333 rhinos have been killed in 2010  74  Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi arid region  with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves  flooding and drought  According to computer generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute 75  parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the Northern Cape in late spring and summertime by 2050  The Cape Floral Kingdom has been identified as one of the global biodiversity hotspots since it will be hit very hard by climate change and has such a great diversity of life  Drought  increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many of these rare species towards extinction  South Africa houses many endemic species  among them the critically endangered Riverine Rabbit  Bunolagus monticullaris  in the Karoo

attracts the largest number of foreign visitors in South Africa The Nelson Mandela Bridge in Johannesburg  Gauteng produces 33  of South Africa s GDP and 10  of the African continent s GDP JSE is the largest stock exchange on the African continent South Africa has a mixed economy with a high rate of poverty and low GDP per capita  Unemployment is high and South Africa is ranked in the top 10 countries in the world for income inequality  76  77  78  measured by the Gini coefficient  Unlike most of the world s poor countries  South Africa does not have a thriving informal economy  according to OECD estimates  only 15  of South African jobs are in the shadow economy  compared with around half in Brazil and India and nearly three quarters in Indonesia  The OECD attributes this difference to South Africa s widespread welfare system  79 World Bank research shows that South Africa has one of the widest gaps between per capita GNP versus its Human Development Index ranking  with only Botswana showing a larger gap  80  After 1994 government policy brought down inflation  stabilised public finances  and some foreign capital was attracted  however growth was still subpar  81  From 2004 onward economic growth picked up significantly  both employment and capital formation increased  81  South Africa is a popular tourist destination  and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism  82  Illegal immigrants are involved in informal trading  83  Many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions  and the immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since 1994  84  Principal international trading partners of South Africa besides other African countries include Germany  the United States  China  Japan  the United Kingdom and Spain  85  Labour market During 1995 2003  the number of formal jobs decreased and informal jobs increased  overall unemployment worsened  35  The government s Black Economic Empowerment policies have drawn criticism from the Development Bank of Southern Africa s lead economist who   for focusing  almost exclusively on promoting individual ownership by black people  which  does little to address broader economic disparities  though the rich may become more diverse   86  Official affirmative action policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class  87  Other problems include state ownership and interference  which impose high barriers to entry in many areas  88  Restrictive labour regulations have contributed to the unemployment malaise  35  Along with many African nations  South Africa has been experiencing a  brain drain  in the past 20 years  This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy  89  not in citation given  clarification needed  and is almost certainly detrimental for the well being of the majority of people reliant on the healthcare infrastructure  given the HIV AIDS epidemic  90  clarification needed  The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad  91  However  the statistics which purport to show a brain drain are disputed and also do not account for repatriation and expiry of foreign work contracts  According to several surveys 92  93  there has been a reverse in brain drain following the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 and expiration of foreign work contracts  In the first quarter of 2011  confidence levels for graduate professionals were recorded at a level of 84  in a PPS survey  94  Agriculture Main article  Agriculture in South Africa Grain elevators are a common sight in the Free State and other regions of South Africa Farm workers The South African agricultural industry contributes around 10  of formal employment  relatively low compared to other parts of Africa  as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2 6  of GDP for the nation  95  Due to the aridity of the land  only 13 5  can be used for crop production  and only 3  is considered high potential land  96  According to FAOSTAT  South Africa is one of world s largest producers of  chicory roots  4th   grapefruit  4th   cereals  5th   green maize and maize  7th   castor oil seed  9th   pears  9th   sisal  10th   fibre crops

government has set a target of transferring 30  of productive farmland from whites to  previously disadvantaged  blacks by 2014  99  Land reform has been criticised both by farmers  groups and by landless workers  the latter alleging that the pace of change has not been fast enough  and the former alleging  racist  treatment and expressing concerns that a similar situation to Zimbabwe s land reform policy may develop  100  a fear exacerbated by comments made by former deputy president Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka  101  102  The government has been accused of either putting in too much effort  103  dated info  or not enough effort  104  to tackle the problem of farm attacks as opposed to other forms of violent crime  Some predictions show surface water supply could decrease by 60  by the year 2070 in parts of the Western Cape  105  To reverse the damage caused by land mismanagement  the government has supported a scheme which promotes sustainable development and the use of natural resources  106  Maize production  which contributes to a 36  majority of the gross value of South Africa s field crops  has also experienced negative effects due to climate change  The estimated value of loss  which takes into consideration scenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilisation effect  107  ranges between tens and hundreds of millions of Rands  108  Science and technology Main article  Science and technology in South Africa Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa  The first human to human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in December 1967  Max Theiler developed a vaccine against Yellow Fever  Allan McLeod Cormack pioneered x ray Computed tomography  and Aaron Klug developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques  These advancements were all  with the exception of that of Barnard  recognised with Nobel Prizes  Sydney Brenner won most recently  in 2002  for his pioneering work in molecular biology  Mark Shuttleworth founded an early Internet security company Thawte  that was subsequently bought out by world leader VeriSign  Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology  IT and other high technology fields  no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa  It is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology  based on the realisation that South Africa cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing  nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity  South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community  It hosts the Southern African Large Telescope  the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere  South Africa is currently building the Karoo Array Telescope as a pathfinder for the  1 5 billion Square Kilometer Array project  109  South Africa is a finalist  with Australia

and the next will be in 2011  Even though the population of South Africa has increased in the past decade 111  112   primarily due to immigration   the country had an annual population growth rate of  0 051  in 2010  CIA est    where the birth rate is higher than the death rate but there is a net emigration rate  110  113  South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million illegal immigrants  including some 3 million Zimbabweans  114  115  116  A series of anti immigrant riots occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008  117  118  Statistics South Africa provided five racial categories by which people could classify themselves  the last of which   unspecified other  drew negligible responses  and these results were omitted  111  The 2010 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were Black African at 79 4   White at 9 2   Coloured at 8 8   and Indian or Asian at 2 6   119  The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22  of the population  it declined to 16  in 1980  120  By far the major part of the population classified itself as African or black  but it is not culturally or linguistically homogeneous  Major ethnic groups include the Zulu  Xhosa  Basotho  South Sotho   Bapedi  North Sotho   Venda  Tswana  Tsonga  Swazi and Ndebele  all of which speak Bantu languages  The colored population is mainly concentrated in the Cape region  and come from a combination of ethnic backgrounds including White  Khoi  San  Griqua  Chinese and Malay  121  White South Africans are descendants of Dutch  German  French Huguenots  English and other European and Jewish settlers  121  122  Culturally and linguistically  they are divided into the Afrikaners  who speak Afrikaans  and English speaking groups  The white population has been on the decrease due to a low birth rate and emigration  as a factor in their decision to emigrate  many cite the high crime rate and the affirmative action policies of the government  123  124  Since 1994  approximately 440 000 white South Africans have permanently emigrated  119  Despite high emigration levels  a few immigrants from Europe have settled in the country  By 2005  an estimated 212 000 British citizens were residing in South Africa  By 2011  this number may have grown to 500 000  125  Some white Zimbabwean emigrated to South Africa  Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as  Whenwes   because of their nostalgia for their lives in Rhodesia  when we were in Rhodesia   126  The Indian population came to South Africa as indentured labourers to work in the sugar plantations in Natal in the late 19th and early 20th century  121  They came from different parts of the Indian subcontinent  adhered to different religions and spoke different languages  121  Serious riots in Durban between Indians and Zulus erupted in 1949  127  There is also a significant group of Chinese South Africans  approximately 100 000 individuals  and Vietnamese South Africans  approximately 50 000 individuals   In 2008  the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as Coloureds  As a result of this ruling  about 12 000 15 000 128  ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994  numbering 3  5  of the total Chinese population in the country  will be able to benefit from government BEE policies  129  South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population  According to the World Refugee Survey 2008  published by the U S  Committee for Refugees and Immigrants  this population numbered approximately 144 700 in 2007  130  Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10 000 included people from Zimbabwe  48 400   The Democratic Republic of the Congo  24 800   and Somalia  12 900   130  These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg  Pretoria  Durban  Cape Town  and Port Elizabeth  130  Many refugees have now also started to work and live in rural areas in provinces such as Mpumalanga and KwaZulu Natal  Religion Main article  Religion in South Africa Dutch Reformed Church in Wolmaransstad According to the 2001 national census  Christians accounted for 79 7  of the population  This includes Zion Christian  11 1    Pentecostal  Charismatic   8 2    Roman Catholic  7 1    Methodist  6 8    Dutch Reformed  6 7    Anglican  3 8

 2 3  were other and 1 4  were unspecified  85  131  132  African Indigenous Churches were the largest of the Christian groups  It was believed that many of these persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to traditional indigenous religions  Many peoples have syncretic religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences  133  South African Muslims constitute mostly of those are described as Coloureds and those who are described as Indians  They have been joined by black or white South African converts as well as others from other parts of Africa  134  South African Muslims claim that their faith is the fastest growing religion of conversion in the country  with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold  from 12 000 in 1991 to 74 700 in 2004 134  135  The Hindu population was primarily established during British colonial period  but later waves of immigration from India have also contributed to it  Most Hindus are ethnically South Asian but there are many who come from mixed racial stock  and some are converts with the efforts of Hindu missionaries such as ISKCON  Other minority religions in South Africa are Sikhism  Jainism  and Bah    Faith  131  Languages Map showing dominant South African languages    Afrikaans   English   Ndebele   Xhosa   Zulu   Northern Sotho   Sotho   Tswana   Swazi   Venda   Tsonga   None dominant

spoken first home languages are Zulu  23 8    Xhosa  17 6    and Afrikaans  13 3    111  Despite the fact that English is recognised as the language of commerce and science  it was spoken by only 8 2  of South Africans at home in 2001  an even lower percentage than in 1996  8 6    111  The country also recognises several unofficial languages  including Fanagalo  Khoe  Lobedu  Nama  Northern Ndebele  Phuthi  San  and South African Sign Language  137  These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent  Nevertheless  their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition  Many of the  unofficial languages  of the San and Khoikhoi people contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana  and elsewhere  These people  who are a physically distinct population from other Africans  have their own cultural identity based on their hunter gatherer societies  They have been marginalised to a great extent  and many of their languages are in danger of becoming extinct  Many white South Africans also speak other European languages  such as Portuguese  also spoken by black Angolans and Mozambicans   German  and Greek  while some Asians and Indians in South Africa speak South Asian languages  such as Tamil  Hindi  Gujarati  Urdu  and Telugu  French is still widely spoken by French South Africans citation needed  especially in places like Franschhoek  where many South Africans are of French origin  South African French is spoken by fewer than 10 000

caused a fall in life expectancy  The spread of AIDS  acquired immuno deficiency syndrome  is an alarming problem in South Africa  with up to 31  of pregnant women found to be HIV infected in 2005 and the infection rate among adults estimated at 20   138  The link between HIV  a virus spread primarily by sexual contact  and AIDS was long denied by prior president Thabo Mbeki and then health minister Manto Tshabalala Msimang  who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition  and hence poverty  and not HIV  139  According to the South African Institute of Race Relations  the life expectancy in 2009 was 71 years for a white South African and 48 years for a black South African  140  In 2007  in response to international pressure  the government made efforts to fight AIDS  141  In September 2008 Thabo Mbeki was recalled by the ANC and chose to resign and Kgalema Motlanthe was appointed for the interim  One of Motlanthe s first actions was to replace Tshabalala Msimang with Barbara Hogan who immediately started working to improve the Government s approach to AIDS  After the 2009 General Elections  President Jacob Zuma appointed Dr Aaron Motsoaledi as the new minister and committed his government to increasing funding for and widening the scope of AIDS treatment  142  AIDS affects mainly those who are sexually active and is far more prevalent in the black population  Most deaths are people who are also economically active  resulting in many families losing their primary wage earners  This has resulted in many  AIDS orphans  who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support  143  It is estimated that there are 1 200 000 orphans in South Africa  143  Many elderly people also lose the support from lost younger members of their family  According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report  South Africa has an estimated 5 6 million people living with HIV   more than any other country in the world  144  Society and culture Decorated

marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety of South African cuisine  In addition to food  music and dance feature prominently  citation needed  South African cuisine is heavily meat based and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a braai  or barbecue  South Africa has also developed into a major wine producer  with some of the best vineyards lying in valleys around Stellenbosch  Franschoek  Paarl and Barrydale  145  The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives  It is among these people that cultural traditions survive most strongly  as blacks have become increasingly urbanised and Westernised  aspects of traditional culture have declined  Urban blacks usually speak English or Afrikaans in addition to their native tongue  There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of Khoisan languages who are not included in the eleven official languages  but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages  There are small groups of speakers of endangered languages  most of which are from the Khoi San family  that receive no official status  some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival  Members of the middle class  who are predominantly white but whose ranks include growing numbers of black  coloured and Indian people  146  have lifestyles similar in many respects to that of people found in Western Europe  North America and Australasia  Members of the middle class often study and work abroad for greater exposure to the markets of the world  Asians  predominantly of Indian origin  preserve their own cultural heritage  languages and religious beliefs  being either Christian  Hindu or Sunni Muslim and speaking English  with Indian languages like Hindi  Telugu  Tamil or Gujarati being spoken less frequently  but the majority of Indians being able to understand their mother tongue  The first Indians arrived on the famous Truro ship as indentured labourers in Natal to work the Sugar Cane Fields  There is a much smaller Chinese community in South Africa  although its numbers have increased due to immigration from Republic of China  Taiwan   South Africa has also had a large influence in the Scouting movement  with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of Robert Baden Powell  the founder of Scouting  during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s  The South African Scout Association was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa  This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as Quo Vadis  147  In 2006  South Africa became the fifth country in the world  and the first in Africa  to legalise same sex marriage  Art Main article  South African art Eland  rock painting  Drakensberg  South Africa The oldest art objects in the world were discovered in a South African cave  Dating from 75 000 years ago  148  these small drilled snail shells could have no other function than to have been strung on a string as a necklace  South Africa was one of the cradles of the human species  One of the defining characteristics of our species is the making of art  from Latin  ars  meaning worked or formed from basic material   The scattered tribes of Khoisan peoples moving into South Africa from around 10000 BC had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings  They were superseded by Bantu Nguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms  In the 20th century  traditional tribal forms of art were scattered and re melded by the divisive policies of apartheid  New forms of art evolved in the mines and townships  a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes  The Dutch influenced folk art of the Afrikaner Trekboers and the urban white artists earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards also contributed to this eclectic mix  which continues to evolve today  Literature Main article  South African literature Olive Schreiner South Africa s unique social and political history have generated a strong group of local writers  with themes that span the days of apartheid to the lives of people in the  new South Africa   Many of the first black South African authors were missionary educated  and the majority of which thus wrote in either English or Afrikaans  One of the first well known novels written by a black author in an African language was Solomon Thekiso Plaatje s Mhudi  written in 1930  Notable white South African authors include Nadine Gordimer who was  in Seamus Heaney s words  one of  the guerrillas of the imagination   and who became the first South African and the seventh woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1991  Her most famous novel  July s People  was released in 1981  depicting the collapse of white minority rule  J M  Coetzee was the second South African to win the Nobel Prize for Literature  in 2003  When awarding the prize  the Swedish Academy stated that Coetzee  in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider   149  The press release for the award also cited his  well crafted composition  pregnant dialogue and analytical brilliance   while focusing on the moral nature of his work  149  Athol Fugard  whose plays have been regularly premiered in fringe theatres in South Africa  London  The Royal Court Theatre  and New York  Olive Schreiner s The Story of an African Farm  1883  was a revelation in Victorian literature  it is heralded by many as introducing feminism into the novel form  Alan Paton published the acclaimed novel Cry  the Beloved Country in 1948  He told the tale of a black priest who comes to Johannesburg to find his son  which became an international best seller  During the 1950s  Drum magazine became a hotbed of political satire  fiction  and essays  giving a voice to urban black culture  Afrikaans language writers also began to write controversial material  Breyten Breytenbach was jailed for his involvement with the guerrilla movement against apartheid  Andre Brink was the first Afrikaner writer to be banned by the government after he released the novel A Dry White Season about a white South African who discovers the truth about a black friend who dies in police custody  J  R  R  Tolkien  author of The Hobbit  The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion  was born in Bloemfontein in 1892  Cinema Main article  Cinema of South Africa While many foreign films have been produced about South Africa  usually involving race relations   few local productions are known outside South Africa itself  One exception was the film The Gods Must Be Crazy in 1980  set in the Kalahari  This is about how life in a traditional community of Bushmen is changed when a Coke bottle  thrown out of an aeroplane  suddenly lands from the sky  The late Jamie Uys  who wrote and directed The Gods Must Be Crazy  also had success overseas in the 1970s with his films Funny People and Funny People II  similar to the TV series Candid Camera in the US  Leon Schuster s You Must Be Joking  films are in the same genre  and hugely popular among South Africans  Arguably  the most high profile film portraying South Africa in recent years was District 9  Directed by Neill Blomkamp  a native South African  and produced by Peter Jackson  the action science fiction film depicts a sub class of alien refugees forced to live in the slums of Johannesburg in what many saw as a creative allegory for apartheid  The film was a critical and commercial success worldwide  and was nominated for Best Picture at the 82nd Academy Awards  Other notable exceptions are the film Tsotsi  which won the Academy Award for Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards in 2006 as well as U Carmen e Khayelitsha  which won the Golden Bear at the 2005 Berlin International Film Festival  Music Main article  Music of South Africa There is great diversity in music from South Africa  Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages  and have developed a unique style called Kwaito  Of note is Brenda Fassie  who launched to fame with her song  Weekend Special   which was sung in English  More famous traditional musicians include Ladysmith Black Mambazo  while the Soweto String Quartet performs classic music with an African flavour  White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles  South Africa has produced world famous jazz musicians  notably Hugh Masekela  Jonas Gwangwa  Abdullah Ibrahim  Miriam Makeba  Jonathan Butler  Chris McGregor  and Sathima Bea Benjamin  Afrikaans music covers multiple genres  such as the contemporary Steve Hofmeyr and the punk rock band Fokofpolisiekar  Crossover artists such as Verity  internationally recognised for innovation in the music industry  and Johnny Clegg and his bands Juluka and Savuka have enjoyed various success underground  publicly  and abroad  The South
