V amp A s main entrance  The Victoria and Albert Museum  often abbreviated as the V amp A   is the world s largest museum of decorative arts and design  housing a permanent collection of over 4 5 million objects  Named after Prince Albert and Queen Victoria  it was founded in 1852  and has since grown to cover 12 5 acres  51 000 m2  2  and 145 galleries  Its collection spans 5 000 years of art  from ancient times to the present day  in virtually every medium  from the cultures of Europe  North America  Asia and North Africa  The museum is a non departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture  Media and Sport  The holdings of ceramics  glass  textiles  costumes  silver  ironwork  jewellery  furniture  medieval objects  sculpture  prints and printmaking  drawings and photographs are among the largest  important and most comprehensive in the world  The museum possesses the world s largest collection of post classical sculpture  the holdings of Italian Renaissance

particular strengths in ceramics and metalwork  while the Islamic collection  alongside the British Museum  Mus e du Louvre and Metropolitan Museum of Art  New York City  is amongst the largest in the Western world  Set in the Brompton district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea  neighbouring institutions include the Natural History Museum and Science Museum  the V amp A is located in what is termed London s  Albertopolis   an area of immense cultural  scientific and educational importance  Since 2001  the museum has embarked on a major  150m renovation programme  3  which has seen a major overhaul of the departments  including the introduction of newer galleries  gardens  shops and visitor facilities  Following in similar vein to other national British museums  entrance to the

Foundation Henry Cole  the museum s first director Frieze detail from internal courtyard showing Queen Victoria in front of the 1851 Great Exhibition  The V amp A has its origins in the Great Exhibition of 1851  with which Henry Cole  the museum s first director  was involved in planning  initially it was known as the Museum of Manufactures  4  first opening in May 1852 at Marlborough House  but by September had been transferred to Somerset House  At this stage the collections covered both applied art and science  5  Several of the exhibits from the Exhibition were purchased to form the nucleus of the collection  6  By February 1854 discussions were underway to transfer the museum to the current site 7  and it was renamed as the South Kensington Museum  In 1855 the German architect Gottfried Semper  at the request of Cole  produced a design for the museum  but it was rejected by the Board of Trade as too expensive  8  The site was occupied by Brompton Park House  this was extended including the first refreshment rooms opened in 1857  the museum being the first in the world to provide such a facility  9  The official opening by Queen Victoria was on 22 June 1857  10  In the following year  late night openings were introduced  made possible by the use of gas lighting  This was to enable in the words of Cole  to ascertain practically what hours are most convenient to the working classes  11    this was linked to the use of the collections of both applied art and science as educational resources to help boost productive industry  5  In these early years the practical use of the collection was very much emphasised as opposed to that of  High Art  at the National Gallery and scholarship at the British Museum  12 George Wallis 1811 1891   the first Keeper of Fine Art Collection  passionately promoted the idea of wide art education through the museum collections  This led to the transfer to the museum of the School of Design that had been founded in 1837 at Somerset House  after the transfer it was referred to as the Art School or Art Training School  later to become the Royal College of Art which finally achieved full independence in 1949  From the 1860s to the 1880s the scientific collections had been moved from the main museum site to various improvised galleries to the west of Exhibition Road  5  In 1893 the  Science Museum  had effectively come into existence when a separate director was appointed  13  The laying of the foundation stone to the left of the main entrance of the Aston Webb building  on 17 May 1899 14  was the last official public appearance by Queen Victoria  It was during this ceremony that the change of name from the South Kensington Museum to the Victoria and Albert Museum was made public  15  London Gazette of the time ended  I trust that it will remain for ages a Monument of discerning Liberality and a Source of Refinement and Progress   The exhibition which the museum organised to celebrate the centennial of the 1899 renaming   A Grand Design   first toured in North America from 1997  Baltimore Museum of Art  Museum of Fine Arts  Boston  Royal Ontario Museum  Toronto  Museum of Fine Arts  Houston and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco   returning to London in 1999  16  To accompany and support the exhibition  the Museum published a book  Grand Design  which it has made available for reading online on its website  17   edit  1900 1950 Victoria and Albert Museum   Front Elevation The opening ceremony for the Aston Webb building by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra took place on 26 June 1909  18  In 1914 the construction commenced of the Science Museum signalling the final split of the science and art collections  19  Since then the museum has maintained its role of one of the world s greatest decorative arts collections  In 1939 on the outbreak of World War II  most of the collection was sent to a quarry in Wiltshire  to Montacute House in Somerset  or to a tunnel near Aldwych tube station  with larger items remaining in situ  sand bagged and bricked in  20  Between 1941 and 1944 some galleries were used as a school for children evacuated from Gibraltar  21  The South Court became a canteen  first for the Royal Air Force and later for Bomb Damage Repair Squads  21  Before the return of the collections after the war  the Britain Can Make It exhibition was held between September and November 1946  22  attracting nearly a million and a half visitors  23  This was organised by the Council of Industrial Design established by the British government in 1944  to promote by all practicable means the improvement of design in the products of British industry   23  The success of this exhibition led to the planning of the Festival of Britain  1951   By 1948 most of the collections had been returned to the museum   edit  Since 1950 In July 1973  as part of its outreach programme to young people  the V amp A became the first museum in Britain to present a rock concert  The V amp A presented a combined concert lecture by British progressive folk rock band Gryphon  who explored the lineage of mediaeval music and instrumentation and related how those contributed to contemporary music 500 years later  This innovative approach to bringing young people to museums was a hallmark of the Directorship of Roy Strong and was subsequently emulated by some other British museums  In the 1980s  Sir Roy Strong renamed the museum as  The Victoria and Albert Museum  the National Museum of Art and Design   Strong s successor Elizabeth Esteve Coll oversaw a turbulent period for the institution in which the museum s curatorial departments were re structured leading to public criticism from some staff  Esteve Coll s attempts to make the V amp A more accessible included a criticised marketing campaign emphasising the cafe over the collection  In 2001   FuturePlan  was launched  which involves redesigning all the galleries and public facilities in the museum that have yet to be remodelled  This is to ensure that the exhibits are better displayed  more information is available and the Museum meets modern expectations for museum facilities  it should take about ten years to complete the work  The museum also runs the Museum of Childhood at Bethnal Green and used to run the Theatre Museum in Covent Garden and Apsley House  The Theatre Museum is now closed and the V amp A Theatre Collections are now displayed within the South Kensington building   edit  Regional partnerships The V amp A has no museums or galleries of its own outside of London  Instead it works with a small number of partner organisations in Sheffield  Dundee and Blackpool to provide a regional presence  24  25  The V amp A is in discussion with the University of Dundee  University of Abertay  Dundee City Council and the Scottish Government with a view to opening a new  43m gallery in Dundee which would use the V amp A brand although it would be funded through and operated independently  26  27  The V amp A Dundee will be on the city s waterfront and is intended to focus on fashion  architecture  product design  graphic arts and photography  It is planned that it could open within 5 years  28  29  Plans for a new gallery in Blackpool are also under consideration  30  This follows earlier plans to move the theatre collection to a new  60m museum in Blackpool  which failed due to lack of funding  31  The V amp A exhibits twice a year at the Millennium Galleries in partnership with Museums Sheffield  31   edit  International partnerships The V amp A is one of 17 museums across Europe and the Mediterranean participating in a project called Discover Islamic Art  Developed by the Brussels based consortium Museum With No Frontiers  this online  virtual museum  brings together over 1200 works of Islamic art and architecture into a single database   edit  Architecture of the museum  edit  Victorian period The Victorian areas have a complex history  with piecemeal additions by different architects  Founded in May 1852  it was not until 1857 that the museum moved to the present site  This area of London was known as Brompton but had been renamed South Kensington  The land was occupied by Brompton Park House  which was extended  most notably by the  Brompton Boilers   32  which were starkly utilitarian iron galleries with a temporary look  they were later dismantled and used to build the V amp A Museum of Childhood  The first building to be erected that still forms part of the museum was the Sheepshanks Gallery in 1857 on the eastern side of the garden  33  its architect was civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke  Royal Engineers  who was appointed by Cole  34  The next major expansions were designed by the same architect  these were the Turner and Vernon galleries built 1858 9 35   built to house the eponymous collections  which were later transferred to the Tate Gallery  now used as the picture galleries and tapestry gallery respectively   then the North 36  and South Courts  37  both of which opened by June 1862  They now form the galleries for temporary exhibitions and are directly behind the Sheepshanks Gallery  On the very northern edge of the site is situated the Secretariat Wing  38  also built in 1862 this houses the offices and board room etc  and is not open to the public  The Ceramic Staircase   Designed by Frank Moody The mosaic in the pediment of the North Fa ade   Designed by Godfrey Sykes An ambitious scheme of decoration was developed for these new areas  a series of mosaic figures depicting famous European artists of the Medieval and Renaissance period were produced  39  These have now been removed to other areas of the museum  Also started were a series of frescoes by Lord Leighton  Industrial Arts as Applied to War 1878 1880 and Industrial Arts Applied to Peace  which was started but never finished  40  To the east of this were additional galleries  the decoration of which was the work of another designer Owen Jones  these were the Oriental Courts  covering India  China and Japan  completed in 1863  none of this decoration survives  41  part of these galleries became the new galleries covering the 19th century  opened in December 2006  The last work by Fowke was the design for the range of buildings on the north and west sides of the garden  this includes the refreshment rooms  reinstated as the Museum Caf  in 2006  with the silver gallery above   at the time the ceramics gallery   the top floor has a splendid lecture theatre although this is seldom open to the general public  The ceramic staircase in the northwest corner of this range of buildings was designed by F W  Moody  42  all the architectural details are produced in moulded and coloured pottery  All the work on the north range was designed and built in 1864 1869  The style adopted for this part of the museum was Italian Renaissance  much use was made of terracotta  brick and mosaic  this north fa ade was intended as the main entrance to the museum with its bronze doors designed by James Gamble  amp  Reuben Townroe having six panels depicting  Humphry Davy  chemistry   Isaac Newton  astronomy   James Watt  mechanics   Bramante  architecture   Michelangelo  sculpture   Titian  painting   thus representing the range of the museums collections  43 Godfrey Sykes also designed the terracotta embellishments and the mosaic in the Pediment of the North Fa ade commemorating the Great Exhibition the profits from which helped to fund the museum  this is flanked by terracotta statue groups by Percival Ball  44  This building replaced Brompton Park House  which could then be demolished to make way for the south range  Dorchester House fireplace  by Alfred Stevens  the Centre Refreshment Room The interiors of the three refreshment rooms were assigned to different designers  The Green Dining Room 1866 68 was the work of Philip Webb and William Morris  45  displays Elizabethan influences  the lower part of the walls are panelled in wood with a band of paintings depicting fruit and the occasional figure  with moulded plaster foliage on the main part of the wall and a plaster frieze around the decorated ceiling and stained glass windows by Edward Burne Jones  46  The Centre Refreshment Room 1865 77 was designed in a Renaissance style by James Gamble  47  the walls and even the Ionic columns are covered in decorative and moulded ceramic tile  the ceiling consists of elaborate designs on enamelled metal sheets and matching stained glass windows  the marble fireplace 48  was designed and sculpted by Alfred Stevens and was removed from Dorchester House prior to that building s demolition in 1929  The Grill Room 1876 81 was designed by Sir Edward Poynter  49  the lower part of the walls consist of blue and white tiles with various figures and foliage enclosed by wood panelling  above there are large tiled scenes with figures depicting the four seasons and the twelve months these were painted by ladies from the Art School then based in the museum  the windows are also stained glass  there is an elaborate cast iron grill still in place  With the death of Captain Francis Fowke  Royal Engineers the next architect to work at the museum was Colonel  later Major General  Henry Young Darracott Scott  50  also of the Royal Engineers  He designed to the north west of the garden the five storey School for Naval Architects  also known as the science schools   51  now the Henry Cole Wing in 1867 72  Scott s assistant J H  Wild designed the impressive staircase 52  that rises the full height of the building  made from Cadeby stone the steps are 7 feet  2 1 m  in length  the balustrades and columns are Portland stone  It is now used to jointly house the prints and architectural drawings of the V amp A  prints  drawings  paintings and photographs  and Royal Institute of British Architects  RIBA Drawings and Archives Collections   and the Sackler Centre for arts education which openned in 2008  53  Continuing the style of the earlier buildings  various designers were responsible for the decoration  the terracotta embellishments were again the work of Godfrey Sykes  although Sgraffito was used to decorate the east side of the building designed by F W  Moody  54  a final embellishment were the wrought iron gates made as late as 1885 designed by Starkie Gardner  55  these lead to a passage through the building  Scott also designed the two Cast Courts 1870 73 56  to the southeast of the garden  the site of the  Brompton Boilers    these vast spaces have ceilings 70 feet  21 m  in height to accommodate the plaster casts of parts of famous buildings  including Trajan s Column  in two separate pieces   The final part of the museum designed by Scott was the Art Library and what is now the sculpture gallery on the south side of the garden  built 1877 83  57  the exterior mosaic panels in the parapet were designed by Reuben Townroe who also designed the plaster work in the library  58  Sir John Taylor designed the book shelves and cases  58  also this was the first part of the museum to have electric lighting  59  This completed the northern half of the site  creating a quadrangle with the garden at its centre  but left the museum without a proper fa ade  In 1890 the government launched a competition to design new buildings for the museum  with architect Alfred Waterhouse as one of the judges  60  this would give the museum a new imposing front entrance   edit  Edwardian period The main fa ade  built from red brick and Portland stone  stretches 720 feet  220 m  along Cromwell Gardens and was designed by Aston Webb after winning a competition in 1891 to extend the museum  Construction took place between 1899 to 1909  61  Stylistically it is a strange hybrid  although much of the detail belongs to the Renaissance there are medieval influences at work  The main entrance consisting of a series of shallow arches supported by slender columns and niches with twin doors separated by pier is Romanesque in form but Classical in detail  Likewise the tower above the main entrance has an open work crown surmounted by a statue of fame  62  a feature of late Gothic architecture and a feature common in Scotland  but the detail is Classical  The main windows to the galleries are also mullioned and transomed  again a Gothic feature  the top row of windows are interspersed with statues of many of the British artists whose work is displayed in the museum  Prince Albert appears within the main arch above the twin entrances  Queen Victoria above the frame around the arches and entrance  sculpted by Alfred Drury  These fa ades surround four levels of galleries  Other areas designed by Webb include the Entrance Hall and Rotunda  the East and West Halls  the areas occupied by the shop and Asian Galleries as well as the Costume Gallery  The interior makes much use of marble in the entrance hall and flanking staircases  although the galleries as originally designed were white with restrained classical detail and mouldings  very much in contrast to the elaborate decoration of the Victorian galleries  although much of this decoration was removed in the early 20th century  63  North side of Garden  by Captain Francis Fowke  Royal Engineers 1864 69 Western Cast Court  by Henry Young Darracott Scott 1870 73 The Art Library  by Scott and other designers 1877 83 Main Entrance  by Aston Webb 1899 1909  edit  Post war period Bomb damage on the exhibition road facade The Museum survived the Second World War with only minor bomb damage  The worst loss was the Victorian stained glass on the Ceramics Staircase which was blown in when bombs fell nearby  pock marks still visible on the fa ade of the museum were caused by shrapnel from the bombs  In the immediate post war years there was little money available for other than essential repairs  The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work  the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967  This involved flooring over Aston Webb s main hall to form the book stacks  64  with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor  now the shop  opened in 2006   Then the lower ground floor galleries in the south west part of the museum were redesigned  opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600 1800  late Renaissance  Baroque through Rococo and neo Classical   65  In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science  66  In order to adapt the building as galleries  all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling  To link this to the rest of the museum  a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house  the intended site of the Spiral  between 1978 and 1982  67  This building is of concrete and very functional  the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art  67  These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the fa ade   edit  Recent years A few galleries were redesigned in the 1990s including  Indian  Japanese  Chinese  iron work  the main glass and the main silverware gallery  although this gallery was further enhanced in 2002 when some of the Victorian decoration was recreated  This included two of the ten columns having their ceramic decoration replaced and the elaborate painted designs restored on the ceiling  As part of the 2006 renovation the mosaic floors in the sculpture gallery were restored   most of the Victorian floors were covered in linoleum after the Second World War  After the success of the British Galleries  opened in 2001  it was decided to embark on a major redesign of all the galleries in the museum  this is known as  FuturePlan   and was created in consultation with the exhibition designers and masterplanners Metaphor  The plan is expected to take about ten years and was started in 2002  To date several galleries have been redesigned  notably  in 2002  the main Silver Gallery  Contemporary  in 2003  Photography  the main entrance  The Painting Galleries  in 2004  the tunnel to the subway leading to South Kensington tube station  New signage throughout the museum  architecture  V amp A and RIBA reading rooms and stores  metalware  Members  Room  contemporary glass  the Gilbert Bayes sculpture gallery  in 2005  portrait miniatures  prints and drawings

involved in this work  Eva Jiricna designed the enhancements to the main entrance and rotunda  the new shop  the tunnel and the sculpture galleries  Gareth Hoskins was responsible for contemporary and architecture  Softroom  Islamic Middle East and the Members  Room  McInnes Usher McKnight Architects  MUMA  were responsible for the new Cafe and designed the new Medieval and Renaissance galleries which opened in 2009  68  The John Madejski Garden   Opened in 2005 Recently  controversy surrounded the museum s proposed building of an  80 million extension called The Spiral  designed by Daniel Libeskind  which was criticised as out of keeping with the architecture of the original buildings  The Spiral s design was described by some as looking like jumbled cardboard boxes  In September 2004  the museum s board of trustees voted to abandon the design after failing to receive funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund  69   edit  Garden The central garden was redesigned by Kim Wilkie and opened as the John Madejski Garden  on 5 July 2005  The design is a subtle blend of the traditional and modern  the layout is formal  there is an elliptical water feature lined in stone with steps around the edge which may be drained to use the area for receptions  gatherings or exhibition purposes  This is in front of the bronze doors leading to the refreshment rooms  a central path flanked by lawns leads to the sculpture gallery  the north  east and west sides have herbaceous borders along the museum walls with paths in front which continues along the south fa ade  in the two corners by the north fa ade there is planted an American Sweetgum tree  the southern  eastern and western edges of the lawns have glass planters which contain orange and lemon trees in summer  these are replaced by bay trees in winter  At night both the planters and water feature may be illuminated  and the surrounding fa ades lit to reveal details normally in shadow  especially noticeable are the mosaics in the loggia of the north fa ade  In summer a caf  is set up in the south west corner  The garden is also used for temporary exhibits of sculpture  for example a sculpture by Jeff Koons was shown in 2006  It has also played host to the museum s annual contemporary design showcase  the V amp A Village Fete since 2005   edit  Collections The Victoria  amp  Albert Museum is split into four Collections

possible only with the assistance of the National Art Collections Fund   edit  Architecture In 2004  the V amp A alongside Royal Institute of British Architects opened the first permanent gallery in the UK 71  covering the history of architecture with displays using models  photographs  elements from buildings and original drawings  With the opening of the new gallery  the RIBA Drawings and Archives Collection has been transferred to the museum  joining the already extensive collection held by the V amp A  With over 600 000 drawings  over 750 000 papers and paraphernalia  and over 700 000 photographs from around the world  together they form the world s most comprehensive architectural resource  Not only are all the major British architects of the last four hundred years represented  but many European  especially Italian  and American architects  drawings are held in the collection  The RIBA s holdings of over 330 drawings by Andrea Palladio are the largest in the world  72  other Europeans well represented are Jacques Gentilhatre 73  and Antonio Visentini  74  British architects whose drawings  and in some cases models of their buildings  in the collection

galleries These fifteen galleries which opened in November 2001 contain around 4 000 items  The displays in these galleries are based around three major themes   Style    Who Led Taste  and  What Was New   The period covered is 1500 to 1900  with the galleries divided into three major subdivisions  Tudor and Stuart Britain  1500 1714  covering the Renaissance  Elizabethan  Jacobean  Restoration and Baroque styles Georgian Britain  1714 1837  covering Palladianism  Rococo  Chinoiserie  Neoclassicism  the Regency  the influence of Chinese  Indian and Egyptian styles  and the early Gothic Revival Victorian Britain  1837 1901  covering the later phases of the Gothic Revival  French influences  Classical and Renaissance revivals  Aestheticism  Japanese style  the continuing influence of China  India  and the Islamic world  the Arts and Crafts movement and the Scottish School  Not only the work of British artists and craftspeople is on display  but also work produced by European

William Morris  The galleries also link design to wider trends in British culture  For instance  design in the Tudor period was influenced by the spread of printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain  In the Stuart period  increasing trade  especially with Asia  enabled wider access to luxuries like carpets  lacquered furniture  silks and porcelain  In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure  For example  the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies  European styles seen on the Grand Tour also influenced taste  As the Industrial Revolution took hold  the growth of mass production produced entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood  Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade  In the Victorian era new technology and machinery had a significant effect on manufacturing  and for the first time since the reformation  the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches had a major effect on art and design such as the Gothic Revival  There is a large display on the Great Exhibition which  among other things  led to the founding of the V amp A  In the later 19th century  the increasing backlash against industrialization  led by John Ruskin  contributed to the Arts and Crafts movement  Henry VIII s writing box Howard Grace Cup Great Bed of Ware  one of the largest beds of the world
