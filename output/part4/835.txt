affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally transforming the human condition by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate aging and to greatly enhance human intellectual  physical  and psychological capacities  1  Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations  as well as study the ethical matters involved in developing and using such technologies  They predict that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into beings with such greatly expanded abilities as to merit the label  posthuman   1  The contemporary meaning of the term transhumanism was foreshadowed by one of the first professors of futurology  FM 2030  who taught  new concepts of the Human  at The New School of New York City in the 1960s  when he began to identify people who adopt technologies  lifestyles and world views transitional to  posthumanity  as  transhuman   2  This hypothesis would lay the intellectual groundwork for the British philosopher Max More to begin articulating the principles of transhumanism as a futurist philosophy in 1990  and organizing in California an intelligentsia that has since grown into the worldwide transhumanist movement  2  3  Influenced by seminal works of science fiction  the transhumanist vision of a transformed future humanity has attracted many supporters and detractors from a wide range of perspectives  2  Transhumanism has been condemned by one critic  Francis Fukuyama  as the world s most dangerous idea  4  while one proponent  Ronald Bailey  counters that it is the  movement that epitomizes the most daring  courageous  imaginative  and idealistic aspirations of humanity   5  Contents

Audio  edit  History Cover of the first issue of h  Magazine  a web based quarterly publication that focuses on transhumanism  covering the scientific  technological  and cultural developments that are challenging and overcoming human limitations  According to philosophers who have studied and written about the history of transhumanist thought  1 transcendentalist impulses have been expressed at least as far back as in the quest for immortality in the Epic of Gilgamesh  as well as historical quests for the Fountain of Youth  Elixir of Life  and other efforts to stave off aging and death  Transhumanist philosophy  however  is rooted in Renaissance humanism and the Enlightenment  For example  Giovanni Pico della Mirandola called on people to  sculpt their own statue   and the Marquis de Condorcet speculated about the use of medical science to indefinitely extend the human life span  while Benjamin Franklin dreamed of suspended animation  and after Charles Darwin  it became increasingly plausible to view the current version of humanity not as the endpoint of evolution but rather as a possibly quite early phase   1  However  there is ongoing debate within the transhumanist community about whether the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche can be considered an influence  despite its exaltation of the  overman   due to its emphasis on self actualization rather than technological transformation  1  6  7  Nikolai Fyodorov  a 19th century Russian philosopher  advocated radical life extension  physical immortality and even resurrection of the dead using scientific methods  8  In the 20th century  a direct and influential precursor to transhumanist concepts was geneticist J B S  Haldane s 1923 essay Daedalus  Science and the Future  which predicted that great benefits would come from applications of advanced sciences to human biology and that every such advance would first appear to someone as blasphemy or perversion   indecent and unnatural   J  D  Bernal speculated about space colonization  bionic implants  and cognitive enhancement  which have been common transhumanist themes since then  1  Biologist Julian Huxley  brother of author Aldous Huxley  a childhood friend of Haldane s   appears to have been the first to use the actual word  transhumanism   Writing in 1957  he defined transhumanism as  man remaining man  but transcending himself  by realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature   9  This definition differs  albeit not substantially  from the one commonly in use since the 1980s  Computer scientist Marvin Minsky wrote on relationships between human and artificial intelligence beginning in the 1960s  10  Over the succeeding decades  this field continued to generate influential thinkers  such as Hans Moravec and Raymond Kurzweil  who oscillated between the technical arena and futuristic speculations in the transhumanist vein  11  12  The coalescence of an identifiable transhumanist movement began in the last decades of the 20th century  In 1966  FM 2030  formerly F M  Esfandiary   a futurist who taught  new concepts of the Human  at The New School in New York City  began to identify people who adopt technologies  lifestyles and world views transitional to  posthumanity  as  transhuman   13  In 1972  Robert Ettinger contributed to the conceptualization of  transhumanity  in his book Man into Superman  14  15  FM 2030 published the Upwingers Manifesto in 1973 to stimulate transhumanly conscious activism  16  The first self described transhumanists met formally in the early 1980s at the University of California  Los Angeles  which became the main center of transhumanist thought  Here  FM 2030 lectured on his  Third Way  futurist ideology  At the EZTV Media venue frequented by transhumanists and other futurists  Natasha Vita More presented Breaking Away  her 1980 experimental film with the theme of humans breaking away from their biological limitations and the Earth s gravity as they head into space  17  18  FM 2030 and Vita More soon began holding gatherings for transhumanists in Los Angeles  which included students from FM 2030 s courses and audiences from Vita More s artistic productions  In 1982  Vita More authored the Transhumanist Arts Statement  19  and  six years later  produced the cable TV show TransCentury Update on transhumanity  a program which reached over 100 000 viewers  In 1986  Eric Drexler published Engines of Creation  The Coming Era of Nanotechnology  20  which discussed the prospects for nanotechnology and molecular assemblers  and founded the Foresight Institute  As the first non profit organization to research  advocate for  and perform cryonics  the Southern California offices of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation became a center for futurists  In 1988  the first issue of Extropy Magazine was published by Max More and Tom Morrow  In 1990  More  a strategic philosopher  created his own particular transhumanist doctrine  which took the form of the Principles of Extropy  21  and laid the foundation of modern transhumanism by giving it a new definition  22  Transhumanism is a class of philosophies that seek to guide us towards a posthuman condition  Transhumanism shares many elements of humanism  including a respect for reason and science  a commitment to progress  and a valuing of human  or transhuman  existence in this life        Transhumanism differs from humanism in recognizing and anticipating the radical alterations in the nature and possibilities of our lives resulting from various sciences and technologies        In 1992  More and Morrow founded the Extropy Institute  a catalyst for networking futurists and brainstorming new memeplexes by organizing a series of conferences and  more importantly  providing a mailing list  which exposed many to transhumanist views for the first time during the rise of cyberculture and the cyberdelic counterculture  In 1998  philosophers Nick Bostrom and David Pearce founded the World Transhumanist Association  WTA   an international non governmental organization working toward the recognition of transhumanism as a legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and public policy  23  In 2002  the WTA modified and adopted The Transhumanist Declaration  24 The Transhumanist FAQ  prepared by the WTA  gave two formal definitions for transhumanism  25  The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally improving the human condition through applied reason  especially by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate aging and to greatly enhance human intellectual  physical  and psychological capacities  The study of the ramifications  promises  and potential dangers of technologies that will enable us to overcome fundamental human limitations  and the related study of the ethical matters involved in developing and using such technologies  A number of similar definitions have been collected by Anders Sandberg  an academic and prominent transhumanist  26  In possible contrast with other transhumanist organizations  WTA officials considered that social forces could undermine their futurist visions and needed to be addressed  2  A particular concern is the equal access to human enhancement technologies across classes and borders  27  In 2006  a political struggle within the transhumanist movement between the libertarian right and the liberal left resulted in a more centre leftward positioning of the WTA under its former executive director James Hughes  27  28  In 2006  the board of directors of the Extropy Institute ceased operations of the organization  stating that its mission was  essentially completed   29  This left the World Transhumanist Association as the leading international transhumanist organization  In 2008  as part of a rebranding effort  the WTA changed its name to  Humanity   in order to project a more humane image  30  Humanity Plus and Betterhumans publish h  Magazine  a periodical edited by R  U  Sirius which disseminates transhumanist news and ideas  31  32   edit  Theory See also  Outline of transhumanism It is a matter of debate whether transhumanism is a branch of  posthumanism  and how posthumanism should be conceptualised with regard to transhumanism  The latter is often referred to as a variant or activist form of posthumanism by its conservative  4 Christian 33  and progressive 34  35  critics  A common feature of transhumanism and philosophical posthumanism is the future vision of a new intelligent species  into which humanity will evolve  which will supplement humanity or supersede it  Transhumanism stresses the evolutionary perspective  including sometimes the creation of a highly intelligent animal species by way of cognitive enhancement  i e  biological uplift   2  but clings to a  posthuman future  as the final goal of participant evolution  36  Nevertheless  the idea to create intelligent artificial beings  proposed  for example  by roboticist Hans Moravec  has influenced transhumanism  11  Moravec s ideas and transhumanism have also been characterised as a  complacent  or  apocalyptic  variant of posthumanism and contrasted with  cultural posthumanism  in humanities and the arts  37  While such a  cultural posthumanism  would offer resources for rethinking the relations of humans and increasingly sophisticated machines  transhumanism and similar posthumanisms are  in this view  not abandoning obsolete concepts of the  autonomous liberal subject  but are expanding its  prerogatives  into the realm of the posthuman  38  Transhumanist self characterisations as a continuation of humanism and Enlightenment thinking correspond with this view  Some secular humanists conceive transhumanism as an offspring of the humanist freethought movement and argue that transhumanists differ from the humanist mainstream by having a specific focus on technological approaches to resolving human concerns  i e  technocentrism  and on the issue of mortality  39  However  other progressives have argued that posthumanism  whether it be its philosophical or activist forms  amount to a shift away from concerns about social justice  from the reform of human institutions and from other Enlightenment preoccupations  toward narcissistic longings for a transcendence of the human body in quest of more exquisite ways of being  40  In this view  transhumanism is abandoning the goals of humanism  the Enlightenment  and progressive politics   edit  Aims  Countdown to Singularity   Raymond Kurzweil  While many transhumanist theorists and advocates seek to apply reason  science and technology for the purposes of reducing poverty  disease  disability  and malnutrition around the globe  25  transhumanism is distinctive in its particular focus on the applications of technologies to the improvement of human bodies at the individual level  Many transhumanists actively assess the potential for future technologies and innovative social systems to improve the quality of all life  while seeking to make the material reality of the human condition fulfill the promise of legal and political equality by eliminating congenital mental and physical barriers  Transhumanist philosophers argue that there not only exists a perfectionist ethical imperative for humans to strive for progress and improvement of the human condition but that it is possible and desirable for humanity to enter a transhuman phase of existence  in which humans are in control of their own evolution  In such a phase  natural evolution would be replaced with deliberate change  Some theorists  such as Raymond Kurzweil  think that the pace of technological innovation is accelerating and that the next 50 years may yield not only radical technological advances but possibly a technological singularity  which may fundamentally change the nature of human beings  41  Transhumanists who foresee this massive technological change generally maintain that it is desirable  However  some are also concerned with the possible dangers of extremely rapid technological change and propose options for ensuring that advanced technology is used responsibly  For example  Bostrom has written extensively on existential risks to humanity s future welfare  including risks that could be created by emerging technologies  42   edit  Ethics Transhumanists engage in interdisciplinary approaches to understanding and evaluating possibilities for overcoming biological limitations  They draw on futurology and various fields of ethics such as bioethics  infoethics  nanoethics  neuroethics  roboethics  and technoethics mainly but not exclusively from a philosophically utilitarian  socially progressive  politically and economically liberal perspective  Unlike many philosophers  social critics  and activists who place a moral value on preservation of natural systems  transhumanists see the very concept of the specifically  natural  as problematically nebulous at best  and an obstacle to progress at worst  43  In keeping with this  many prominent transhumanist advocates refer to transhumanism s critics on the political right and left jointly as  bioconservatives  or  bioluddites   the latter term alluding to the 19th century anti industrialisation social movement that opposed the replacement of human manual labourers by machines  44   edit  Currents There is a variety of opinion within transhumanist thought  Many of the leading transhumanist thinkers hold views that are under constant revision and development  45  Some distinctive currents of transhumanism are identified and listed here in alphabetical order  Abolitionism  an ethical ideology based upon a perceived obligation to use technology to eliminate involuntary suffering in all sentient life  46  Democratic transhumanism  a political ideology synthesizing liberal democracy  social democracy  radical democracy and transhumanism  47  Extropianism  an early school of transhumanist thought characterized by a set of principles advocating a proactive approach to human evolution  22  Immortalism  a moral ideology based upon the belief that technological immortality is possible and desirable  and advocating research and development to ensure its realization  48  Libertarian transhumanism  a political ideology synthesizing right libertarianism and transhumanism  44  Postgenderism  a social philosophy which seeks the voluntary elimination of gender in the human species through the application of advanced biotechnology and assisted reproductive technologies  49  Singularitarianism  a moral ideology based upon the belief that a technological singularity is possible  and advocating deliberate action to effect it and ensure its safety  41  Technogaianism  an ecological ideology based upon the belief that emerging technologies can help restore Earth s environment  and that developing safe  clean  alternative technology should therefore be an important goal of environmentalists  47   edit  Spirituality Although some transhumanists report having religious or spiritual views  they are for the most part atheists  agnostics or secular humanists  23  A vocal minority of transhumanists  however  follow liberal forms of Eastern philosophies such as Buddhism and Yoga 50  or have merged their transhumanist ideas with established Western religions such as liberal Christianity 51  or Mormonism  52  Despite the prevailing secular attitude  some transhumanists pursue hopes traditionally espoused by religions  such as  immortality   48  while several controversial new religious movements  originating in the late 20th century  have explicitly embraced transhumanist goals of transforming the human condition by applying technology to the alteration of the mind and body  such as Ra lism  53  However  most thinkers associated with the transhumanist movement focus on the practical goals of using technology to help achieve longer and healthier lives  while speculating that future understanding of neurotheology and the application of neurotechnology will enable humans to gain greater control of altered states of consciousness  which were commonly interpreted as  spiritual experiences   and thus achieve more profound self knowledge  50  Secular transhumanists are strong physicalists and naturalists who do not believe in a transcendent human soul  54  Transhumanist personhood theory  i e  personism  also argues against the unique identification of moral actors and subjects with biological humans  judging as speciesist the exclusion of non human and part human animals  and sophisticated machines  from ethical consideration  55  Many transhumanists believe in the compatibility of human minds with computer hardware  with the theoretical implication that human consciousness may someday be transferred to alternative media  a speculative technique commonly known as  mind uploading   56  One extreme formulation of this idea  which some transhumanists are interested in  is the proposal of the  Omega Point  by Christian cosmologist Frank Tipler  Drawing upon ideas in digitalism  Tipler has advanced the notion that the collapse of the Universe billions of years hence could create the conditions for the perpetuation of humanity in a simulated reality within a megacomputer  and thus achieve a form of  posthuman godhood   Tipler s thought was inspired by the writings of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin  a paleontologist and Jesuit theologian who saw an evolutionary telos in the development of an encompassing noosphere  a global consciousness  57  58  59  The idea of uploading personality to a non biological substrate and the underlying assumptions are criticised by a wide range of scholars  scientists and activists  sometimes with regard to transhumanism itself  sometimes with regard to thinkers such as Marvin Minsky or Hans Moravec  who are often seen as its originators  Relating the underlying assumptions  for example  to the legacy of cybernetics  some have argued that this materialist hope engenders a spiritual monism  a variant of philosophical idealism  60  Viewed from the perspective of some Christian fundamentalists  the idea of mind uploading is asserted to represent a denigration of the human body characteristic of gnostic belief  61  Transhumanism and its presumed intellectual progenitors have also been described as neo gnostic by non Christian and secular commentators  62  63  The first dialogue between transhumanism and faith was the focus of an academic seminar held at the University of Toronto in 2004  54  Because it might serve a few of the same functions that people have traditionally sought in religion  religious and secular critics maintained that transhumanism is itself a religion or  at the very least  a pseudoreligion  Some even dismissed transhumanism as technological utopianism turned into a new religious movement  64  Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor a relationship with the divine  They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of postmodern cynicism and anomie  Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy  which far from being cynical  is rooted in optimistic  idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment  65  Following this dialogue  William Sims Bainbridge  a sociologist of religion  conducted a pilot study  published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology  suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas  and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as being a direct  competitive  though ultimately futile  affront to their spiritual beliefs  66  Since 2009  the American Academy of Religion holds a  Transhumanism and Religion  consultation during its annual meeting where scholars in the field of religious studies seek to identify and critically evaluate any implicit religious beliefs that might underlie key transhumanist claims and assumptions  consider how transhumanism challenges religious traditions to develop their own ideas of the human future  in particular the prospect of human transformation  whether by technological or other means  and provide critical and constructive assessments of an envisioned future that place greater confidence in nanotechnology  robotics  and information technology to achieve virtual immortality and create a superior posthuman species  67   edit  Practice While some transhumanists take an abstract and theoretical approach to the perceived benefits of emerging technologies  others have offered specific proposals for modifications to the human body  including heritable ones  Transhumanists are often concerned with methods of enhancing the human nervous system  Though some propose modification of the peripheral nervous system  the brain is considered the common denominator of personhood and is thus a primary focus of transhumanist ambitions  68  As proponents of self improvement and body modification  transhumanists tend to use existing technologies and techniques that supposedly improve cognitive and physical performance  while engaging in routines and lifestyles designed to improve health and longevity  69  Depending on their age  some transhumanists express concern that they will not live to reap the benefits of future technologies  However  many have a great interest in life extension strategies  and in funding research in cryonics in order to make the latter a viable option of last resort rather than remaining an unproven method  70  Regional and global transhumanist networks and communities with a range of objectives exist to provide support and forums for discussion and collaborative projects   edit  Technologies of interest Main article  Human enhancement technologies Converging Technologies  a 2002 report exploring the potential for synergy among nano   bio   info  and cogno technologies  has become a landmark in near future technological speculation  Transhumanists support the emergence and convergence of technologies such as nanotechnology  biotechnology  information technology and cognitive science  NBIC   and hypothetical future technologies such as simulated reality  artificial intelligence  superintelligence  mind uploading  chemical brain preservation  and cryonics  They believe that humans can and should use these technologies to become more than human  71  They therefore support the recognition and or protection of cognitive liberty  morphological freedom  and procreative liberty as civil liberties  so as to guarantee individuals the choice of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children  72  Some speculate that human enhancement techniques and other emerging technologies may facilitate more radical human enhancement no later than the midpoint of the 21st century  41  A 2002 report  Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance  commissioned by the National Science Foundation and US Department of Commerce  contains descriptions and commentaries on the state of NBIC science and technology by major contributors to these fields  The report discusses potential uses of these technologies in implementing transhumanist goals of enhanced performance and health  and ongoing work on planned applications of human enhancement technologies in the military and in the rationalization of the human machine interface in industry  73  Some reports on the converging technologies and NBIC concepts have criticised their transhumanist orientation and alleged science fictional character  74  At the same time  research on brain and body alteration technologies has accelerated under the sponsorship of the US Department of Defense  which is interested in the battlefield advantages they would provide to the  supersoldiers  of the United States and its allies  75  There has already been a brain research program to  extend the ability to manage information  while military scientists are now looking at stretching the human capacity for combat to a maximum 168 hours without sleep  76   edit  Arts and culture Main articles  Transhumanism in fiction and Transhumanist art Transhumanist themes have become increasingly prominent in various literary forms during the period in which the movement itself has emerged  Contemporary science fiction often contains positive renditions of technologically enhanced human life  set in utopian  especially techno utopian  societies  However  science fiction s depictions of enhanced humans or other posthuman beings frequently come with a cautionary twist  The more pessimistic scenarios include many horrific or dystopian tales of human bioengineering gone wrong  In the decades immediately before transhumanism emerged as an explicit movement  many transhumanist concepts and themes began appearing in the speculative fiction of authors of the Golden Age of Science Fiction such as Robert A  Heinlein  Lazarus Long series  1941 87   A  E  van Vogt  Slan  1946   Isaac Asimov  I  Robot  1950   Arthur C  Clarke  Childhood s End  1953  and Stanis aw Lem  Cyberiad  1967   2  The cyberpunk genre  exemplified by William Gibson s Neuromancer  1984  and Bruce Sterling s Schismatrix  1985   has particularly been concerned with the modification of human bodies  Other novels dealing with transhumanist themes that have stimulated broad discussion of these issues include Blood Music  1985  by Greg Bear  The Xenogenesis Trilogy  1987 1989  by Octavia Butler  The Beggar s Trilogy  1990 94  by Nancy Kress  much of Greg Egan s work since the early 1990s  such as Permutation City  1994  and Diaspora  1997   The Culture novels of Iain M  Banks  The Bohr Maker  1995  by Linda Nagata  Altered Carbon  2002  by Richard K Morgan  Oryx and Crake  2003  by Margaret Atwood  The Elementary Particles  Eng  trans  2001  and The Possibility of an Island  Eng  trans  2006  by Michel Houellebecq  Mindscan  2005  by Robert J  Sawyer  the Commonwealth Saga  2002 10  by Peter F  Hamilton and Glasshouse  2005  by Charles Stross  Some  but not all  of these works are considered part of the cyberpunk genre or its postcyberpunk offshoot    Your mind is software  Program it  Your body is a shell  Change it  Death is a disease  Cure it Extinction is approaching  Fight it     Eclipse Phase Fictional transhumanist scenarios have also become popular in other media during the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries  Such treatments are found in comic books  Captain America  1941  Transmetropolitan  1997  The Surrogates  2006   films  2001  A Space Odyssey  1968  Blade Runner  1982  Gattaca  1997  Repo  The Genetic Opera  2008   television series  the Cybermen of Doctor

addition to the work of Natasha Vita More  curator of the Transhumanist Arts  amp  Culture center  transhumanist themes appear in the visual and performing arts  79  Carnal Art  a form of sculpture originated by the French artist Orlan  uses the body as its medium and plastic surgery as its method  80  Commentators have pointed to American performer Michael Jackson as having used technologies such as plastic surgery  skin lightening drugs and hyperbaric oxygen therapy over the course of his career  with the effect of transforming his artistic persona so as to blur identifiers of gender  race and age  81  The work of the Australian artist Stelarc centers on the alteration of his body by robotic prostheses and tissue engineering  82  Other artists whose work coincided with the emergence and flourishing of transhumanism and who explored themes related to the transformation of the body are the Yugoslavian performance artist Marina Abramovic and the American media artist Matthew Barney  A 2005 show  Becoming Animal  at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art  presented exhibits by twelve artists whose work concerns the effects of technology in erasing boundaries between the human and non human  Steampunk musician and Internet personality Dr  Steel often deals with the subject of transhumanism in his music and videos  he has been interviewed on his views by the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies 83  and has even published a paper on the subject  84  85   edit  Controversy The scientific community classifies many elements of transhumanist thought and research to be within the realm of fringe science because it departs significantly from the mainstream and often directly challenges orthodox theories  citation needed  The very notion and prospect of human enhancement and related issues also arouse public controversy  86  Criticisms of transhumanism and its proposals take two main forms  those objecting to the likelihood of transhumanist goals being achieved  practical criticisms   and those objecting to the moral principles or world view sustaining transhumanist proposals or underlying transhumanism itself  ethical criticisms   However  these two strains sometimes converge and overlap  particularly when considering the ethics of changing human biology in the face of incomplete knowledge  Critics or opponents often see transhumanists  goals as posing threats to human values  Some also argue that strong advocacy of a transhumanist approach to improving the human condition might divert attention and resources from social solutions  2  As most transhumanists support non technological changes to society  such as the spread of civil rights and civil liberties  and most critics of transhumanism support technological advances in areas such as communications and health care  the difference is often a matter of emphasis  Sometimes  however  there are strong disagreements about the very principles involved  with divergent views on humanity  human nature  and the morality of transhumanist aspirations  2  At least one public interest organization  the U S  based Center for Genetics and Society  was formed  in 2001  with the specific goal of opposing transhumanist agendas that involve transgenerational modification of human biology  such as full term human cloning and germinal choice technology  The Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future of the Chicago Kent College of Law critically scrutinizes proposed applications of genetic and nanotechnologies to human biology in an academic setting  Some of the most widely known critiques of the transhumanist program refer to novels and fictional films  These works of art  despite presenting imagined worlds rather than philosophical analyses  are used as touchstones for some of the more formal arguments  2   edit  Infeasibility  Futurehype argument  In his 1992 book Futurehype  The Tyranny of Prophecy  sociologist Max Dublin points out many past failed predictions of technological progress and argues that modern futurist predictions will prove similarly inaccurate  He also objects to what he sees as scientism  fanaticism  and nihilism by a few in advancing transhumanist causes  and writes that historical parallels exist to millenarian religions and Communist doctrines  87  Several notable transhumanists have predicted that death defeating technologies will arrive  usually late  within their own conventionally expected lifetimes  Wired magazine founding executive editor Kevin Kelly has argued these transhumanists have overly optimistic expectations of when dramatic technological breakthroughs will occur because they hope to be saved from their own deaths by those developments  88  Despite his sympathies for transhumanism  in his 2002 book Redesigning Humans  Our Inevitable Genetic Future  public health professor Gregory Stock is skeptical of the technical feasibility and mass appeal of the cyborgization of humanity predicted by Raymond Kurzweil  Hans Moravec and Kevin Warwick  He believes that throughout the 21st century  many humans will find themselves deeply integrated into systems of machines  but will remain biological  Primary changes to their own form and character will arise not from cyberware but from the direct manipulation of their genetics  metabolism  and biochemistry  89  In his 2006 book Future Hype  The Myths of Technology Change  computer scientist and engineer Bob Seidensticker argues that today s technological achievements are not unprecedented  Exposing major myths of technology and examining the history of high tech hype  he aims to uncover inaccuracies and misunderstandings that may characterise the popular and transhumanist views of technology  to explain how and why these views have been created  and to illustrate how technological change in fact proceeds  90  Those thinkers who defend the likelihood of massive technological change within a relatively short timeframe emphasize what they describe as a past pattern of exponential increases in humanity s technological capacities  This emphasis appears in the work of popular science writer Damien Broderick  notably his 1997 book  The Spike  which contains his speculations about a radically changed future  Kurzweil develops this position in much detail in his 2005 book  The Singularity Is Near  Broderick points out that many of the seemingly implausible predictions of early science fiction writers have  indeed  come to pass  among them nuclear power and space travel to the moon  He also claims that there is a core rationalism to current predictions of very rapid change  asserting that such observers as Kurzweil have a good track record in predicting the pace of innovation  91   edit  Hubris  Playing God argument  There are two distinct categories of criticism  theological and secular  that have been referred to as  playing god  arguments  improper synthesis   The first category is based on the alleged inappropriateness of humans substituting themselves for an actual god  This approach is exemplified by the 2002 Vatican statement Communion and Stewardship  Human Persons Created in the Image of God  92  in which it is stated that   Changing the genetic identity of man as a human person through the production of an infrahuman being is radically immoral   implying  as it would  that  man has full right of disposal over his own biological nature   At the same time  this statement argues that creation of a superhuman or spiritually superior being is  unthinkable   since true improvement can come only through religious experience and  realizing more fully the image of God   Christian theologians and lay activists of several churches and denominations have expressed similar objections to transhumanism and claimed that Christians already enjoy  however post mortem  what radical transhumanism promises such as indefinite life extension or the abolition of suffering  In this view  transhumanism is just another representative of the long line of utopian movements which seek to immanentize the eschaton i e  try to create  heaven on earth   93  94  The biocomplexity spiral is a depiction of the multileveled complexity of organisms in their environments  which is seen by many critics as the ultimate obstacle to transhumanist ambition  The second category is aimed mainly at  algeny   which Jeremy Rifkin defined as  the upgrading of existing organisms and the design of wholly new ones with the intent of  perfecting  their performance   95  and  more specifically  attempts to pursue transhumanist goals by way of genetically modifying human embryos in order to create  designer babies   It emphasizes the issue of biocomplexity and the unpredictability of attempts to guide the development of products of biological evolution  This argument  elaborated in particular by the biologist Stuart Newman  is based on the recognition that the cloning and germline genetic engineering of animals are error prone and inherently disruptive of embryonic development  Accordingly  so it is argued  it would create unacceptable risks to use such methods on human embryos  Performing experiments  particularly ones with permanent biological consequences  on developing humans  would thus be in violation of accepted principles governing research on human subjects  see the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki   Moreover  because improvements in experimental outcomes in one species are not automatically transferable to a new species without further experimentation  there is claimed to be no ethical route to genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages  96  As a practical matter  however  international protocols on human subject research may not present a legal obstacle to attempts by transhumanists and others to improve their offspring by germinal choice technology  According to legal scholar Kirsten Rabe Smolensky  existing laws would protect parents who choose to enhance their child s genome from future liability arising from adverse outcomes of the procedure  97  Religious thinkers allied with transhumanist goals  such as the theologians Ronald Cole Turner and Ted Peters  reject the first argument  holding that the doctrine of  co creation  provides an obligation to use genetic engineering to improve human biology  98  99  Transhumanists and other supporters of human genetic engineering do not dismiss the second argument out of hand  insofar as there is a high degree of uncertainty about the likely outcomes of genetic modification experiments in humans  However  bioethicist James Hughes suggests that one possible ethical route to the genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages is the building of computer models of the human genome  the proteins it specifies  and the tissue engineering he argues that it also codes for  With the exponential progress in bioinformatics  Hughes believes that a virtual model of genetic expression in the human body will not be far behind and that it will soon be possible to accelerate approval of genetic modifications by simulating their effects on virtual humans  2 Public health professor Gregory Stock points to artificial chromosomes as an alleged safer alternative to existing genetic engineering techniques  89  Transhumanists therefore argue that parents have a moral responsibility called procreative beneficence to make use of these methods  if and when they are shown to be reasonably safe and effective  to have the healthiest children possible  They add that this responsibility is a moral judgment best left to individual conscience rather than imposed by law  in all but extreme cases  In this context  the emphasis on freedom of choice is called procreative liberty  2   edit  Contempt for the flesh  Fountain of Youth argument  Philosopher Mary Midgley  in her 1992 book Science as Salvation  traces the notion of achieving immortality by transcendence of the material human body  echoed in the transhumanist tenet of mind uploading  to a group of male scientific thinkers of the early 20th century  including J B S  Haldane and members of his circle  She characterizes these ideas as  quasi scientific dreams and prophesies  involving visions of escape from the body coupled with  self indulgent  uncontrolled power fantasies   Her argument focuses on what she perceives as the pseudoscientific speculations and irrational  fear of death driven fantasies of these thinkers  their disregard for laymen  and the remoteness of their eschatological visions  100  What is perceived as contempt for the flesh in the writings of Marvin Minsky  Hans Moravec  and some transhumanists  has also been the target of other critics for what they claim to be an instrumental conception of the human body  38  Reflecting a strain of feminist criticism of the transhumanist program  philosopher Susan Bordo points to  contemporary obsessions with slenderness  youth  and physical perfection   which she sees as affecting both men and women  but in distinct ways  as  the logical  if extreme  manifestations of anxieties and fantasies fostered by our culture   101  Some critics question other social implications of the movement s focus on body modification  Political scientist Klaus Gerd Giesen  in particular  has asserted that transhumanism s concentration on altering the human body represents the logical yet tragic consequence of atomized individualism and body commodification within a consumer culture  62  Nick Bostrom asserts that the desire to regain youth  specifically  and transcend the natural limitations of the human body  in general  is pan cultural and pan historical  and is therefore not uniquely tied to the culture of the 20th century  He argues that the transhumanist program is an attempt to channel that desire into a scientific project on par with the Human Genome Project and achieve humanity s oldest hope  rather than a puerile fantasy or social trend  1   edit  Trivialization of human identity  Enough argument  In the US  the Amish are a religious group probably most known for their avoidance of certain modern technologies  Transhumanists draw a parallel by arguing that in the near future there will probably be  Humanish   people who choose to  stay human  by not adopting human enhancement technologies  whose choice they believe must be respected and protected  102  In his 2003 book Enough  Staying Human in an Engineered Age  environmental ethicist Bill McKibben argued at length against many of the technologies that are postulated or supported by transhumanists  including germinal choice technology  nanomedicine and life extension strategies  He claims that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves  or their children  in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations  such as vulnerability to aging  maximum life span  and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability  Attempts to  improve  themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice  He claims that human lives would no longer seem meaningful in a world where such limitations could be overcome technologically  Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished  since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities  He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies  using as examples Ming China  Tokugawa Japan and the contemporary Amish  103  Transhumanists and other supporters of technological alteration of human biology  such as science journalist Ronald Bailey  reject as extremely subjective the claim that life would be experienced as meaningless if some human limitations are overcome with enhancement technologies  They argue that these technologies will not remove the bulk of the individual and social challenges humanity faces  They suggest that a person with greater abilities would tackle more advanced and difficult projects and continue to find meaning in the struggle to achieve excellence  Bailey also claims that McKibben s historical examples are flawed  and support different conclusions when studied more closely  104  For example  few groups are more cautious than the Amish about embracing new technologies  but though they shun television and use horses and buggies  some are welcoming the possibilities of gene therapy since inbreeding has afflicted them with a number of rare genetic diseases  89   edit  Genetic divide  Gattaca argument  Some critics of libertarian transhumanism have focused on its likely socioeconomic consequences in societies in which divisions between rich and poor are on the rise  Bill McKibben  for example  suggests that emerging human enhancement technologies would be disproportionately available to those with greater financial resources  thereby exacerbating the gap between rich and poor and creating a  genetic divide   103 Lee M  Silver  a biologist and science writer who coined the term  reprogenetics  and supports its applications  has nonetheless expressed concern that these methods could create a two tiered society of genetically engineered  haves  and  have nots  if social democratic reforms lag behind implementation of enhancement technologies  105  Critics who make these arguments do not thereby necessarily accept the transhumanist assumption that human enhancement is a positive value  in their view  it should be discouraged  or even banned  because it could confer additional power upon the already powerful  The 1997 film Gattaca s depiction of a dystopian society in which one s social class depends entirely on genetic modifications is often cited by critics in support of these views  2  These criticisms are also voiced by non libertarian transhumanist advocates  especially self described democratic transhumanists  who believe that the majority of current or future social and environmental issues  such as unemployment and resource depletion  need to be addressed by a combination of political and technological solutions  such as a guaranteed minimum income and alternative technology   Therefore  on the specific issue of an emerging genetic divide due to unequal access to human enhancement technologies  bioethicist James Hughes  in his 2004 book Citizen Cyborg  Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future  argues that progressives or  more precisely  techno progressives must articulate and implement public policies  such as a universal health care voucher system that covers human enhancement technologies  in order to attenuate this problem as much as possible  rather than trying to ban human enhancement technologies  The latter  he argues  might actually worsen the problem by making these technologies unsafe or available only to the wealthy on the local black market or in countries where such a ban is not enforced  2   edit  Threats to morality and democracy  Brave New World argument  Various arguments have been made to the effect that a society that adopts human enhancement technologies may come to resemble the dystopia depicted in the 1932 novel Brave New World by Aldous Huxley  Sometimes  as in the writings of Leon Kass  the fear is that various institutions and practices judged as fundamental to civilized society would be damaged or destroyed  106  In his 2002 book Our Posthuman Future and in a 2004 Foreign Policy magazine article  political economist and philosopher Francis Fukuyama designates transhumanism the world s most dangerous idea because he believes that it may undermine the egalitarian ideals of democracy in general and liberal democracy in particular  through a fundamental alteration of  human nature   4  Social philosopher J rgen Habermas makes a similar argument in his 2003 book The Future of Human Nature  in which he asserts that moral autonomy depends on not being subject to another s unilaterally imposed specifications  Habermas thus suggests that the human  species ethic  would be undermined by embryo stage genetic alteration  107  Critics such as Kass  Fukuyama  and a variety of Christian authors hold that attempts to significantly alter human biology are not only inherently immoral but also threaten the social order  Alternatively  they argue that implementation of such technologies would likely lead to the  naturalizing  of social hierarchies or place new means of control in the hands of totalitarian regimes  The AI pioneer Joseph Weizenbaum criticizes what he sees as misanthropic tendencies in the language and ideas of some of his colleagues  in particular Marvin Minsky and Hans Moravec  which  by devaluing the human organism per se  promotes a discourse that enables divisive and undemocratic social policies  108  In a 2004 article in Reason  science journalist Ronald Bailey has contested the assertions of Fukuyama by arguing that political equality has never rested on the facts of human biology  He asserts that liberalism was founded not on the proposition of effective equality of human beings  or de facto equality  but on the assertion of an equality in political rights and before the law  or de jure equality  Bailey asserts that the products of genetic engineering may well ameliorate rather than exacerbate human inequality  giving to the many what were once the privileges of the few  Moreover  he argues   the crowning achievement of the Enlightenment is the principle of tolerance   In fact  he argues  political liberalism is already the solution to the issue of human and posthuman rights since  in liberal societies  the law is meant to apply equally to all  no matter how rich or poor  powerful or powerless  educated or ignorant  enhanced or unenhanced  5  Other thinkers who are sympathetic to transhumanist ideas  such as philosopher Russell Blackford  have also objected to the appeal to tradition  and what they see as alarmism  involved in Brave New World type arguments  109   edit  Dehumanization  Frankenstein argument  Australian artist Patricia Piccinini s concept of what human animal hybrids might look like are provocative creatures which are part of a sculpture entitled The Young Family  produced to address the reality of such possible parahumans in a compassionate way  Transhumanists would call for the recognition of self aware parahumans as persons  Biopolitical activist Jeremy Rifkin and biologist Stuart Newman accept that biotechnology has the power to make profound changes in organismal identity  They argue against the genetic engineering of human beings  because they fear the blurring of the boundary between human and artifact  96  110  Philosopher Keekok Lee sees such developments as part of an accelerating trend in modernization in which technology has been used to transform the  natural  into the  artifactual   111  In the extreme  this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of  monsters  such as human clones  human animal chimeras or bioroids  but even lesser dislocations of humans and non humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic  The film Blade Runner  1982   the novels The Boys From Brazil  1978  and The Island of Dr  Moreau  1896  depict elements of such scenarios  but Mary Shelley s 1818 novel Frankenstein is most often alluded to by critics who suggest that biotechnologies could create objectified and socially unmoored people and subhumans  Such critics propose that strict measures be implemented to prevent what they portray as dehumanizing possibilities from ever happening  usually in the form of an international ban on human genetic engineering  112  Writing in Reason magazine  Ronald Bailey has accused opponents of research involving the modification of animals as indulging in alarmism when they speculate about the creation of subhuman creatures with human like intelligence and brains resembling those of Homo sapiens  Bailey insists that the aim of conducting research on animals is simply to produce human health care benefits  113  A different response comes from transhumanist personhood theorists who object to what they characterize as the anthropomorphobia fueling some criticisms of this research  which science writer Isaac Asimov termed the  Frankenstein complex   They argue that  provided they are self aware  human clones  human animal chimeras and uplifted animals would all be unique persons deserving of respect  dignity  rights and citizenship  They conclude that the coming ethical issue is not the creation of so called monsters but what they characterize as the  yuck factor  and  human racism  that would judge and treat these creations as monstrous  23  55   edit  Specter of coercive eugenicism  Eugenics Wars argument  Some critics of transhumanism allege an ableist bias in the use of such concepts as  limitations    enhancement  and  improvement   Some even see the old eugenics  social Darwinist and master race ideologies and programs of the past as warnings of what the promotion of eugenic enhancement technologies might unintentionally encourage  Some fear future  eugenics wars  as the worst case scenario  the return of coercive state sponsored genetic discrimination and human rights violations such as compulsory sterilization of persons with genetic defects  the killing of the institutionalized and  specifically  segregation from  and genocide of   races  perceived as inferior  114  Health law professor George Annas and technology law professor Lori Andrews are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to such human posthuman caste warfare  112  115  For most of its history  eugenics has manifested itself as a movement to sterilize against their will the  genetically unfit  and encourage the selective breeding of the genetically fit  The major transhumanist organizations strongly condemn the coercion involved in such policies and reject the racist and classist assumptions on which they were based  along with the pseudoscientific notions that eugenic improvements could be accomplished in a practically meaningful time frame through selective human breeding  Most transhumanist thinkers instead advocate a  new eugenics   a form of egalitarian liberal eugenics  116  In their 2000 book From Chance to Choice  Genetics and Justice   non transhumanist  bioethicists Allen Buchanan  Dan Brock  Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler have argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible  so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals  reproductive rights or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies  in order to maximize public health and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements  117  Most transhumanists holding similar views nonetheless distance themselves from the term  eugenics   preferring  germinal choice  or  reprogenetics   105  to avoid having their position confused with the discredited theories and practices of early 20th century eugenic movements  118   edit  Existential risks  Terminator argument  Struck by a passage from Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski s anarcho primitivist manifesto  quoted in Ray Kurzweil s 1999 book  The Age of Spiritual Machines 12    computer scientist Bill Joy became a notable critic of emerging technologies  119  Joy s 2000 essay  Why the future doesn t need us  argues that human beings would likely guarantee their own extinction by developing the technologies favored by transhumanists  It invokes  for example  the  grey goo scenario  where out of control self replicating nanorobots could consume entire ecosystems  resulting in global ecophagy  120  Joy s warning was seized upon by appropriate technology organizations such as the ETC Group  Related notions were also voiced by self described neo luddite Kalle Lasn  a culture jammer who co authored a 2001 spoof of Donna Haraway s 1985 Cyborg Manifesto as a critique of the techno utopianism he interpreted it as promoting  121  Lasn argues that high technology development should be completely relinquished since it inevitably serves corporate interests with devastating consequences on society and the environment  122  In his 2003 book Our Final Hour  British Astronomer Royal Martin Rees argues that advanced science and technology bring as much risk of disaster as opportunity for progress  However  Rees does not advocate a halt to scientific activity  he calls for tighter security and perhaps an end to traditional scientific openness  123  Advocates of the precautionary principle  such as many in the environmental movement  also favor slow  careful progress or a halt in potentially dangerous areas  Some precautionists believe that artificial intelligence and robotics present possibilities of alternative forms of cognition that may threaten human life  124  The Terminator franchise s doomsday depiction of the emergence of an A I  that becomes a superintelligence   Skynet  a malignant computer network which initiates a nuclear war in order to exterminate the human species  has often been cited by some involved in this debate  125  Transhumanists do not necessarily rule out specific restrictions on emerging technologies so as to lessen the prospect of existential risk  Generally  however  they counter that proposals based on the precautionary principle are often unrealistic and sometimes even counter productive  as opposed to the technogaian current of transhumanism which they claim is both realistic and productive  In his television series Connections  science historian James Burke dissects several views on technological change  including precautionism and the restriction of open inquiry  Burke questions the practicality of some of these views  but concludes that maintaining the status quo of inquiry and development poses hazards of its own  such as a disorienting rate of change and the depletion of our planet s resources  The common transhumanist position is a pragmatic one where society takes deliberate action to ensure the early arrival of the benefits of safe  clean  alternative technology rather than fostering what it considers to be anti scientific views and technophobia  126  One transhumanist solution proposed by Nick Bostrom is differential technological development  in which attempts would be made to influence the sequence in which technologies developed  In this approach  planners would strive to retard the development of possibly harmful technologies and their applications  while accelerating the development of likely beneficial technologies  especially those that offer protection against the harmful effects of others  42  An argument for an  anti progressionist and pessimistic version of transhumanism  has also been presented by Philippe Verdoux  127   edit  References This article cites its sources but does not provide
