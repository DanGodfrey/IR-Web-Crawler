originating in ancient India  1  2  The goal of yoga  or of the person practicing yoga  is the attainment of a state of perfect spiritual insight and tranquility while meditating on the Hindu concept of divinity or Brahman  3  The word is associated with meditative practices in Hinduism  Jainism  and Buddhism  4  5  6  Within Hindu philosophy  the word yoga is used to refer to one of the six orthodox   stika  schools of Hindu philosophy  7  8  Yoga in this sense is based on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali  and is also known as R ja Yoga to distinguish it from later schools  9  Patanjali s system is discussed and elaborated upon in many classical Hindu texts  and has also been influential in Buddhism and Jainism  The Bhagavad Gita introduces distinctions such as Jnana Yoga   yoga based on knowledge   vs  Karma Yoga   yoga based on action    Other systems of philosophy introduced in Hinduism during the medieval period are bhakti yoga  and hatha yoga  10  11  12  The Sanskrit word yoga has the literal meaning of  yoke   from a root yuj meaning to join  to unite  or to attach  As a term for a system of abstract meditation or mental abstraction it was introduced by Pata jali in the 2nd century BC  Someone who practices yoga or follows the yoga philosophy with a high level of commitment is called a yogi or yogini  13  The goals of yoga are varied and range from improving health to achieving moksha  14  Within the Hindu monist schools of Advaita Vedanta  Shaivism and Jainism  the goal of yoga takes the form of moksha  which is liberation from all worldly suffering and the cycle of birth and death  samsara   at which point there is a realization of identity with the Supreme Brahman  In the Mahabharata  the goal of yoga is variously described as entering the world of Brahma  as Brahman  or as perceiving the Brahman or  tman that pervades all things  15  For the bhakti schools of Vaishnavism  bhakti or service to Svayam Bhagavan itself may be the ultimate goal of the yoga process  where the goal is to enjoy an eternal relationship with Vishnu  16  Contents 1 Terminology 2 History 2 1 Before Patanjali 2 1 1 Prehistory 2 1 2 Upanishadic and Early Buddhist era 2

Bangalore  India  performing yogic meditation in the Padmasana posture  The Sanskrit word yoga has the literal meaning of  yoke   or  the act of yoking or harnessing   from a root yuj  A serious practitioner of Yoga  someone pursuing the higher spiritual and religious goals of Yoga  takes upon themselves a life of austere self discipline common to nearly all forms of mystical and religious life  The practices that constitute this self disciplined life are called in yoga yama and niyama  This self discipline is the  yoke  that one puts upon oneself for the purpose of attaining moksha  An alternative definition is that Yoga is the method of yoking  or unifying  the  lower   egoistic  personality  those inclinations that in Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity are called passions  to the  higher  via a process of sublimation  17  In Vedic Sanskrit  the term  yoga  besides its literal meaning  the yoking or harnessing of oxen or horses  already has a figurative sense  where it takes the general meaning of  employment  use  application  performance   compare the figurative uses of  to harness  as in  to put something to some use    All further developments of the sense of this word are post Vedic  A sense of  exertion  endeavour  zeal  diligence  is found in Epic Sanskrit  The more technical sense of the term  yoga   describing a system of meditation or contemplation with the aim of the cessation of mental activity and the attaining of a  supreme state  arises with early Buddhism  5th century BC   and is adopted in Vedanta philosophy by the 4th century BC  There are a great many compounds containing yog in Sanskrit  many of them unrelated to the technical or spiritual sense the word has taken in Vedanta  Yoga in these words takes meanings such as  union  connection  contact   or  method  application  performance   etc  For example  gu   yoga means  contact with a cord   cakr  yoga has a medical sense of  applying a splint or similar instrument by means of pulleys  in case of dislocation of the thigh    candr  yoga has the astronomical sense of  conjunction of the moon with a constellation   pu  yoga is a grammatical term expressing  connection or relation with a man   etc  Many such compounds are also found in the wider field of religion  Thus  bhakti yoga means  devoted attachment  in the monotheistic Bhakti movement  The term kriy  yoga has a grammatical sense  meaning  connection with a verb   But the same compound is also given a technical meaning in the Yoga Sutras  2 1   designating the  practical  aspects of the philosophy  i e  the  union with the Supreme  due to performance of duties in everyday life   edit  History  edit  Before Patanjali  edit  Prehistory Several seals discovered at Indus Valley Civilization sites  dating to the mid 3rd millennium BC  depict figures in positions resembling a common yoga or meditation pose  showing  a form of ritual discipline  suggesting a precursor of yoga   according to archaeologist Gregory Possehl  18  Some type of connection between the Indus Valley seals and later yoga and meditation practices is speculated upon by many scholars  though there is no conclusive evidence  19  Techniques for experiencing higher states of consciousness in meditation were developed by the shramanic traditions and in the Upanishadic tradition  20  While there is no clear evidence for meditation in pre Buddhist early Brahminic texts  there is a view that formless meditation might have originated in the Brahminic tradition  This is based on strong parallels between Upanishadic cosmological statements and the meditative goals of the two teachers of the Buddha as recorded in early Buddhist texts  21  As well as some less likely possibilities  22  the view put forward is that cosmological statements in the Upanishads reflect a contemplative tradition  and it is concluded that the Nasadiya Sukta contains evidence for a contemplative tradition  even as early as the late Rg Vedic period  21  The Vedic Samhitas contain references to ascetics  while ascetic practices   tapas   are referenced in the Br hma as  900 to 500 BCE   early commentaries on the Vedas  23   edit  Upanishadic and Early Buddhist era Further information  Buddhism and Hinduism Meditation See also  Pranayama Buddhism The Buddha depicted in yogic meditation  Kamakura  Japan The more technical linguistic sense of the term  yoga   describing a system of meditation or contemplation with the aim of the cessation of mental activity and the attaining of a  supreme state  arises with early Buddhism  In Hindu scripture  this sense of the term  yoga  first appears in the middle Upanishads  such as the Katha Upanishad  ca  400 BCE   24 Shvetashvatara Upanishad mentions   When earth  water  fire  air and akasa arise  when the five attributes of the elements  mentioned in the books on yoga  become manifest then the yogi s body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness  old age and death    Verse 2 12   More importantly in the following verse  2 13  it mentions  the  precursors of perfection in yoga   namely lightness and healthiness of the body  absence of desire  clear complexion  pleasantness of voice  sweet odour and slight excretions  25  The early Buddhist texts describe meditative practices and states that existed before the Buddha  as well as those first developed within Buddhism  26  27  28  One key innovative teaching of the Buddha was that meditative absorption must be combined with liberating cognition  29  Meditative states alone are not an end  for according to the Buddha  even the highest meditative state is not liberating  Instead of attaining a complete cessation of thought  some sort of mental activity must take place  a liberating cognition  based on the practice of mindful awareness  30  The Buddha also departed from earlier yogic thought in discarding the early Brahminic notion of liberation at death  31  Liberation for the Brahminic yogin was thought to be the realization at death of a nondual meditative state anticipated in life  In fact  old Brahminic metaphors for the liberation at death of the yogic adept   becoming cool    going out   were given a new meaning by the Buddha  their point of reference became the sage who is liberated in life  32  Many of the Yogic practices that came in later ages synthesized the multiple approaches seen in this era  incorporating elements from Jainism and Buddhism into the Hindu Samkhya philosophy   edit  Indian Antiquity Classical Yoga as a system of contemplation with the aim of uniting the human spirit with Ishvara  the  Supreme Being  developed in early Hinduism  Buddhism and Jainism during Indian Antiquity  between the Mauryan and the Gupta era  roughly the 2nd century BCE to the 5th century CE    edit  Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Main articles  Raja Yoga and Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Yoga Sutras of Patanjali 33  Pada  Chapter  English meaning Sutras Samadhi Pada On being absorbed in spirit 51 Sadhana Pada On being immersed in spirit 55 Vibhuti Pada On supernatural abilities and gifts 56 Kaivalya Pada On absolute freedom 34 In Hindu philosophy  Yoga is the name of one of the six orthodox philosophical schools  34  35  founded by Patanjali with heavy Buddhist influence 36   This school accepts the Samkhya psychology and metaphysics  but is more theistic than the Samkhya  as evidenced by the addition of a divine entity to the Samkhya s twenty five elements of reality  37  38  The parallels between Yoga and Samkhya were so close that Max M ller says that  the two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord      39  The intimate relationship between Samkhya and Yoga is explained by Heinrich Zimmer  These two are regarded in India as twins  the two aspects of a single discipline  S  khya provides a basic theoretical exposition of human nature  enumerating and defining its elements  analyzing their manner of co operation in a state of bondage   bandha    and describing their state of disentanglement or separation in release   mok a    while Yoga treats specifically of the dynamics of the process for the disentanglement  and outlines practical techniques for the gaining of release  or  isolation integration    kaivalya    40  Patanjali is widely regarded as the compiler of the formal Yoga philosophy  41  Patanjali s yoga is known as Raja yoga  which is a system for control of the mind  42  Patanjali defines the word  yoga  in his second sutra  which is the definitional sutra for his entire work                           yoga  citta v tti nirodha     Yoga Sutras 1 2 This terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms  I  K  Taimni translates it as  Yoga is the inhibition  nirodha   of the modifications  v tti  of the mind  citta    43  The use of the word nirodha  in the opening definition of yoga is an example of the important role that Buddhist technical terminology and concepts play in the Yoga Sutra  this role suggests that Patanjali was aware of Buddhist ideas and wove them into his system  44 Swami Vivekananda translates the sutra as  Yoga is restraining the mind stuff  Citta  from taking various forms  Vrittis    45  A sculpture of a Hindu yogi in the Birla Mandir  Delhi Patanjali s writing also became the basis for a system referred to as  Ashtanga Yoga    Eight Limbed Yoga    This eight limbed concept derived from the 29th Sutra of the 2nd book  and is a core characteristic of practically every Raja yoga variation taught today  The Eight Limbs are  Yama  The five  abstentions    Ahimsa  non violence   Satya  Truth  non lying   Asteya  non covetousness   Brahmacharya  non sensuality  celibacy   and Aparigraha  non possessiveness   Niyama  The five  observances    Shaucha purity   Santosha contentment   Tapas  austerity   Svadhyaya  study of the Vedic scriptures to know about God and the soul   and Ishvara Pranidhana  surrender to God   Asana  Literally means  seat   and in Patanjali s Sutras refers to the seated position used for meditation  Pranayama   Suspending Breath    Pr na  breath    y ma   to restrain or stop  Also interpreted as control of the life force  Pratyahara   Abstraction    Withdrawal of the sense organs from external objects  Dharana   Concentration    Fixing the attention on a single object  Dhyana   Meditation    Intense contemplation of the nature of the object of meditation  Sam dhi   Liberation    merging consciousness with the object of meditation  In the view of this school  the highest attainment does not reveal the experienced diversity of the world to be illusion  The everyday world is real  Furthermore  the highest attainment is the event of one of many individual selves discovering itself  there is no single universal self shared by all persons  46   edit  Yoga Yajnavalkya Main article  Yoga Yajnavalkya

classical treatise on yoga attributed to Vedic sage Yajnavalkya  It takes the form of a dialogue between Yajnavalkya and his wife Gargi  a renowned female philosopher  The text consists of 12 chapters and its origin has been traced to the period between the second century B C E  and fourth century C E  The Yoga Yajnavalkya predates most other yoga texts  with the exception of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali  Most later yoga texts like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika  the Yoga Kundalini and Yoga Tattva Upanishads have borrowed verses almost verbatim from or make frequent references to the Yoga Yajnavalkya  The Yoga Yajnavalkya is regarded to be the most important and authentic classical text on yoga after the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali  In the Yoga Yajnavalkya  yoga is defined as jivatmaparamatmasamyogah  or the union between the individual self  jivatma  and the Divine  paramatma    edit  Yoga and Samkhya Further information  Samkhya Patanjali systematized the conceptions of Yoga and set them forth on the background of the metaphysics of Samkhya  which he assumed with slight variations  In the early works  the Yoga principles appear along with the Samkhya ideas  Vyasa s commentary on the Yoga Sutras  also called the  Samkhyapravacanabhasya   brings out the intimate relation between the two systems  47  Yoga agrees with the essential metaphysics of Samkhya  but differs from it in that while Samkhya holds that knowledge is the means of liberation  Yoga is a system of active striving  mental discipline  and dutiful action  Yoga also introduces the conception of God  Sometimes Patanjali s system is referred to as  Seshvara Samkhya  in contradistinction to Kapila s  Nirivara Samkhya    48   edit  Bhagavad Gita Main article  Bhagavad Gita The Bhagavad Gita   Song of the Lord    uses the term  yoga  extensively in a variety of ways  In addition to an entire chapter  ch  6  dedicated to traditional yoga practice  including meditation  14  it introduces three prominent types of yoga  49  Karma yoga  The yoga of action  Bhakti yoga  The yoga of devotion  note Krishna had also specified devotion itself was action similar to above  Jnana yoga  The yoga of knowledge  In Chapter 2 of the Bhagavad Gita  Krishna explains to Arjuna about the essence of Yoga as practiced in daily lives

Be steadfast in yoga  yoga stha    O Arjuna  Perform your duty  kuru karmani  and abandon all attachment  sangam  to success or failure  siddhy asiddhyo    Such evenness of mind  samatvam  is called yoga   50  Madhusudana Sarasvati  b  circa 1490  divided the Gita into three sections  with the first six chapters dealing with Karma yoga  the middle six with Bhakti yoga  and the last six with Jnana  knowledge   51  Other commentators ascribe a different  yoga  to each chapter  delineating eighteen different yogas  52   edit  Yoga and Jainism According to  Tattvarthasutra   2nd century CE Jain text   Yoga   is the sum total of all the activities of mind  speech and body  6 Umasvati calls yoga the cause of  asrava  or karmic influx  53  as well as one of the essentials samyak caritra in the path to liberation  53  In his  Niyamasara   Acarya Kundakunda  describes yoga bhakti devotion to the path to liberation as the highest form of devotion  54  Acarya Haribhadra and Acarya Hemacandra mention the five major vows of ascetics and 12 minor vows of laity under yoga  This has led certain Indologists like Prof  Robert J  Zydenbos to call Jainism  essentially  a system of yogic thinking that grew into a full fledged religion  55  The five yamas or the constraints of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali bear a resemblance to the five major vows of Jainism  indicating a history of strong cross fertilization between these traditions  56  57   edit  Yogacara school In the late phase of Indian antiquity  on the eve of the development of Classical Hinduism  the Yogacara movement arises during the Gupta period  4th to 5th centuries   Yogacara received the name as it provided a  yoga   a framework for engaging in the practices that lead to the path of the bodhisattva  58  The Yogacara sect teaches  yoga  as a way to reach enlightenment  59   edit  Middle Ages The practice of Yoga remained in development in Classical Hinduism  and cognate techniques of meditation within Buddhism

Bhakti movement Main article  Bhakti Yoga The Bhakti movement was a development in medieval Hinduism advocating the concept of a personal God  or  Supreme Personality of Godhead    initiated by the Alvars of South India in the 6th to 9th centuries  and gaining influence throughout India by the 12th to 15th centuries  giving rise to sects such as Gaudiya Vaishnavism  60  The Bhagavata Purana is an important text of the Bhakti movement within Vaishnavism  It focusses on the concept of bhakti  devotion to God  in the theological framework of Krishnaism  The Bhagavata Purana discusses religious devotion as a kind of yoga  called bhaktiyoga  It also emphasizes kriy yoga  i e  the devotion to the deity in everday life  4 13 3   The Bhagavata Purana is a commentary and elaboration on the Bhagavadgita  an older text of the Mahabharata epic which rose to great importance in Vaishnavism during the Bhakti movement  In the Bhagavadgita  3 3   j  nayoga is the acquisition of true knowledge  as opposed to karmayoga  the performance of the proper religious rites  This terminology involving various yogas has given rise to the concept of the Four Yogas in modern Hinduism from the 1890s  These are Karma Yoga Bhakti Yoga Raja Yoga Jnana Yoga In this usage  the term  Yoga  ceases to translate to  a system of meditation  and takes on the much more general sense of  religious path   Thus  Karma Yoga is  the Path of Action   Bhakti Yoga  the Path of Devotion  and Jnana Yoga  the Path of Knowledge   all standing alongside Raja Yoga   the Path of Meditation  as alternative possibilities towards religious fulfillment   edit  Hatha Yoga Main articles  Hatha yoga and Hatha Yoga Pradipika Hatha Yoga  sometimes referred to as the  psychophysical yoga   61  is a particular system of Yoga described by Yogi Swatmarama  compiler of the Hatha Yoga Pradipika in 15th century India  Hatha Yoga differs substantially from the Raja Yoga of Patanjali in that it focuses on  shatkarma   the purification of the physical body as leading to the purification of the mind   ha    and  prana   or vital energy  tha   62  63  Compared to the seated asana  or sitting meditation posture  of Patanjali s Raja yoga  64  it marks the development of asanas  plural  into the full body  postures  now in popular usage  65  and  along with its many modern variations  is the style that many people associate with the word  Yoga  today  66  Hatha Yoga exercises have resulted in severe bodily dysfunction or injury  Practitioners suggest that this is primarily the case when individuals push themselves or are pushed beyond what their physical condition will support  67   edit  Modern history  edit  Hindu revivalism New schools of Yoga were introduced in the context of Hindu revivalism towards the end of the 19th century  The physical poses of Hatha Yoga have a tradition that goes back to the 15th century  but they were not widely practiced in India prior to the early 20th century  Hatha Yoga was advocated by a number of late 19th to early 20th century gurus in India  including Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya in south India  Swami Sivananda in the north  Sri Yogendra in Bombay  and Swami Kuvalyananda in Lonavala  In 1946  Paramahansa Yogananda in his Autobiography of a Yogi introduced the term Kriya Yoga for the tradition of Yoga transmitted by his lineage of gurus  deriving it via Yukteswar Giri and Lahiri Mahasaya from Mahavatar Babaji  fl  1860s   Also influential in the development of modern Yoga were Tirumalai Krishnamacharya  and his disciple K  Pattabhi Jois  who introduced his style of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga in 1948  Most systems of Hatha Yoga which developed from the 1960s in the  yoga boom  in the West are derived from Jois  system   edit  Reception in the West Main article  Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine A western style Hatha Yoga class  Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Hindu philosophy  The first Hindu teacher to actively advocate and disseminate aspects of Yoga to a western audience was Swami Vivekananda  who toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s  68  In the West  the term  yoga  is today typically associated with Hatha Yoga and its asanas  postures  or as a form of exercise  69  In the 1960s  western interest in Hindu spirituality reached its peak  giving rise to a great number of Neo Hindu schools specifically advocated to a western public  Among the teachers of Hatha yoga who were active in the west in this period were B K S  Iyengar  K  Pattabhi Jois  and Swami Vishnu devananda  and Swami Satchidananda   70  71  72  A second  yoga boom  followed in the 1980s  as Dean Ornish  a follower of Swami Satchidananda  connected yoga to heart health  legitimizing yoga as a purely physical system of health exercises outside of counter culture or esotericism circles  and unconnected to a religious denomination  68  Kundalini Yoga  considered an advanced form of yoga and meditation  was on the whole a secretive and misunderstood technology   it was not widely taught by any master teachers outside of India until Yogi Bhajan Siri Singh Sahib  brought his understanding of the teachings to the United States in 1969  73  There has been an emergence of studies investigating yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer patients  Yoga is used for treatment of cancer patients to decrease depression  insomnia  pain  and fatigue and increase anxiety control  74  Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction  MBSR  programs include yoga as a mind body technique to reduce stress  A study found that after seven weeks the group treated with yoga reported significantly less mood disturbance and reduced stress compared to the control group  Another study found that MBSR had showed positive effects on sleep anxiety  quality of life  and spiritual growth  75  Yoga has also been studied as a treatment for schizophrenia  Yoga is found to improve cognitive functions and reduce stress in schizophrenia  a condition associated with cognitive deficits and stress related relapse  In one study  at the end of four months those patients treated with yoga were better in their social and occupational functions and quality of life  76  The three main focuses of Hatha yoga  exercise  breathing  and meditation  make it beneficial to those suffering from heart disease  Overall  studies of the effects of yoga on heart disease suggest that yoga may reduce high blood pressure  improve symptoms of heart failure  enhance cardiac rehabilitation  and lower cardiovascular risk factors  77  Long term yoga practitioners in the United States have reported musculoskeletal and mental health improvements  as well reduced symptoms of asthma in asthmatics  78  Regular yoga practice increases brain GABA levels and has been shown to improve mood and anxiety more than some other metabolically matched exercises  such as walking  79  Implementation of the Kundalini Yoga Lifestyle has shown to help substance abuse addicts increase their quality of life according to psychological questionnaires like the Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale and the Quality of Recovery Index  80   edit  Yoga compared with other systems of meditation  edit  Tantra Tantrism is a practice that is supposed to alter the relation of its practitioners to the ordinary social  religious  and logical reality in which they live  Through Tantric practice  an individual perceives reality as maya  illusion  and the individual achieves liberation from it  81  Both Tantra  amp  Yoga offer paths that relieve a person from depending on the world  Where Yoga relies on progressive restriction of inputs from outside  Tantra relies on transmutation of all external inputs so that one is no longer dependent on them  but can take them or leave them at will  They both make a person independent  82  This particular path to salvation among the several offered by Hinduism  links Tantrism to those practices of Indian religions  such as yoga  meditation  and social renunciation  which are based on temporary or permanent withdrawal from social relationships and modes  81  As Robert Svoboda attempts to summarize the three major paths of the Vedic knowledge  he exclaims  Because every embodied individual is composed of a body  a mind and a spirit  the ancient Rishis of India who developed the Science of Life organized their wisdom into three bodies of knowledge  Ayurveda  which deals mainly with the physical body  Yoga  which deals mainly with spirit  and Tantra  which is mainly concerned with the mind  The philosophy of all three is identical  their manifestations differ because of their differing emphases  Ayurveda is most concerned with the physical basis of life  concentrating on its harmony of mind and spirit  Yoga controls body and mind to enable them to harmonize with spirit  and Tantra seeks to use the mind to balance the demands of body and spirit  82  During tantric practices and studies  the student is instructed further in meditation technique  particularly chakra meditation  This is often in a limited form in comparison with the way this kind of meditation is known and used by Tantric practitioners and yogis elsewhere  but is more elaborate than the initiate s previous meditation  It is considered to be a kind of Kundalini Yoga for the purpose of moving the Goddess into the chakra located in the  heart   for meditation and worship  83   edit  Buddhism Further information  Dhyana Even though the roots of Yoga date back to a period of time contemporaneous with early Buddhism and its interaction with Vedanta  Buddhist meditation or dhyana in the medieval period took a separate development from Yoga as laid down by Patanjali and its descendants   edit  Zen Buddhism A Falun Gong practitioner depicted in yogic meditation in the Lotus position Zen  the name of which derives from the Sanskrit  dhyaana  via the Chinese  ch an  84   is a form of Mahayana Buddhism  The Mahayana school of Buddhism is noted for its proximity with Yoga  85  In the west  Zen is often set alongside Yoga  the two schools of meditation display obvious family resemblances  86  This phenomenon merits special attention since yogic practices have some of their roots in the Zen Buddhist school  87  Certain essential elements of Yoga are important both for Buddhism in general and for Zen in particular  88   edit  Tibetan Buddhism Yoga is central to Tibetan Buddhism  In the Nyingma tradition  the path of meditation practice is divided into nine yanas  or vehicles  which are said to be increasingly profound  89  The last six are described as  yoga yanas    Kriya yoga    Upa yoga    Yoga yana    Mah  yoga    Anu yoga  and the ultimate practice   Ati yoga    90  The Sarma traditions also include Kriya  Upa  called  Charya    and Yoga  with the Anuttara yoga class substituting for Mahayoga and Atiyoga  91  Other tantra yoga practices include a system of 108 bodily postures practiced with breath and heart rhythm  The Nyingma tradition also practices Yantra yoga  Tib   Trul khor    a discipline that includes breath work  or pranayama   meditative contemplation and precise dynamic movements to centre the practitioner  92  The body postures of Tibetan ancient yogis are depicted on the walls of the Dalai Lama s summer temple of Lukhang  A semi popular account of Tibetan Yoga by Chang  1993  refers to ca  al   Tib   tummo    the generation of heat in one s own body  as being  the very foundation of the whole of Tibetan Yoga    93  Chang also claims that Tibetan Yoga involves reconciliation of apparent polarities  such as prana and mind  relating this to theoretical implications of tantrism   edit  Christian meditation Main articles  A Christian reflection on the New Age and Aspects of Christian meditation Some Christians integrate yoga and other aspects of Eastern spirituality with prayer and meditation  This has been attributed to a desire to experience God in a more complete way  94  The Roman Catholic Church  and some other Christian organizations have expressed concerns and disapproval with respect to some eastern and New Age practices that include yoga and meditation  95  96  97  In 1989 and 2003  the Vatican issued two documents  Aspects of Christian meditation and  A Christian reflection on the New Age   that were mostly critical of eastern and New Age practices  The 2003 document was published as a 90 page handbook detailing the Vatican s position  98  The Vatican warned that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation  can degenerate into a cult of the body  and that equating bodily states with mysticism  could also lead to psychic disturbance and  at times  to moral deviations   Such has been compared to the early days of Christianity  when the church opposed the gnostics  belief that salvation came not through faith but through a mystical inner knowledge  94  The letter also says   one can see if and how  prayer  might be enriched by meditation methods developed in other religions and cultures  99  but maintains the idea that  there must be some fit between the nature of  other approaches to  prayer and Christian beliefs about ultimate reality   94  Some fundamentalist Christian organizations consider yoga to be incompatible with their religious background  considering it a part of the New Age movement inconsistent with Christianity  100   edit  Sufism The development of Sufism was considerably influenced by Indian yogic practises  where they adapted both physical postures  asanas  and breath control  pranayama   101  The ancient Indian yogic text Amritakunda   Pool of Nectar   was translated into Arabic and Persian as early as the 11th century  Several other yogic texts were appropriated by Sufi tradition  but typically the texts juxtapose yoga materials alongside Sufi practices without any real attempt at integration or synthesis  Yoga became known to Indian Sufis gradually over time  but engagement with yoga is not found at the historical beginnings of the tradition  102  Malaysia s top Islamic body in 2008 passed a fatwa  which is legally non binding  against Muslims practicing yoga  saying it had elements of  Hindu spiritual teachings  and that its practice was blasphemy and is therefore haraam  Muslim yoga teachers in Malaysia criticized the decision as  insulting   103 Sisters in Islam  a women s rights group in Malaysia  also expressed disappointment and said that its members would continue with their yoga classes  104  The fatwa states that yoga practiced only as physical exercise is permissible  but prohibits the chanting of religious mantras  105  and states that teachings such as the uniting of a human with God is not consistent with Islamic philosophy  106  In a similar vein  the Council of Ulemas  an Islamic body in Indonesia  passed a fatwa banning yoga on the grounds that it contains  Hindu elements  107  These fatwas have  in turn  been criticized by Darul Uloom Deoband  a Deobandi Islamic seminary in India  108  In May 2009  Turkey s head of the Directorate of Religious Affairs  Ali Bardako lu  discounted personal development techniques such as yoga as commercial ventures that could lead to extremism  His comments were made in the context of yoga possibly competing with and eroding participation in Islamic practice  109  The only sect of the Islam community that has successfully incorporated yoga into its practice is the Jogi Faqir  whose followers are Muslim converts from the Hindu Jogicaste   edit  References  edit  Notes   Baptiste  Sherri  Scott  Megan  2005 12 16   Yoga with Weights for Dummies  ISBN 9780471749370  http   books google com  id J6tEKjkY6WYC amp
