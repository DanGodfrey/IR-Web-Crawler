Saratoga Philadelphia Western Northern Southern Yorktown Caribbean Gulf Coast Naval The American Revolutionary War  1775 1783   the American War of Independence  9  or simply the Revolutionary War to many Americans  began as a war between the Kingdom of Great Britain and thirteen British colonies in North America  and ended in a global war between several European great powers  The war was the result of the political American Revolution  Colonists galvanized around the position that the Stamp Act of 1765  imposed by Parliament of Great Britain  was unconstitutional  The British Parliament insisted it had the right to tax colonists  The colonists claimed that  as they were British subjects  taxation without representation was illegal  The American colonists formed a unifying Continental Congress and a shadow government in each colony  though ostensibly claiming loyalty to the monarch and a place in the British Empire  The American boycott of directly taxed British tea led to the Boston Tea Party in 1773  London responded by ending self government in Massachusetts and putting it under the control of the British army with General Thomas Gage as governor  In April 1775 Gage learned that weapons were being gathered in Concord  and he sent British troops to seize and destroy them  10  Local militia confronted the troops and exchanged fire  see Battles of Lexington and Concord   After repeated pleas to the British monarchy for intervention with Parliament  any chance of a compromise ended when the Congress were declared traitors by royal decree  and they responded by declaring the independence of a a new sovereign nation external to the British Empire  the United States of America  on July 4  1776  American Loyalists rejected the Declaration  which received limited international recognition  Attempts to expand the rebellion into Quebec and the Floridas were unsuccessful  France  Spain and the Dutch Republic all secretly provided supplies  ammunition and weapons to the revolutionaries starting early in 1776  After early British success  the war became a standoff  The British used their naval superiority to capture and occupy American coastal cities while the rebels largely controlled the countryside  where 90 percent of the population lived  British strategy relied on mobilizing Loyalist militia  and was never fully realized  A British invasion from Canada ended in the capture of the British army at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777  That American victory persuaded France to enter the war openly in early 1778  balancing the two sides  military strength  Spain and the Dutch Republic French allies also went to war with Britain over the next four years  threatening an invasion of Great Britain and severely testing British military strength with campaigns in Europe  Spain s involvement resulted in the expulsion of British armies from West Florida  securing the American southern flank  The decisive British naval victory at the Battle of the Saintes thwarted French and Spanish plans to drive Britain out of the Caribbean  and the joint Franco Spanish attempt to capture the British stronghold of Gibraltar also resulted in similar defeat  French involvement proved decisive 11  yet expensive as it ruined France s economy  12  A French naval victory in the Chesapeake led to a siege by combined French and Continental armies that forced a second British army to surrender at the Yorktown  Virginia in 1781  Fighting continued throughout 1782  while peace negotiations began  In 1783  the Treaty of Paris ended the war and recognized the sovereignty of the United States over the territory bounded roughly by what is now Canada to the north  Florida to the south  and the Mississippi River to the west  13  14  A wider international peace was agreed  in which several territories were exchanged  Contents 1 Combatants before 1778 1 1 American armies and militias 1 2 Loyalists 1 3 British armies and auxiliaries 1 4 Black Americans 1 5

Minutemen Population density in the American Colonies in 1775 When the war began  the 13 colonies lacked a professional army or navy  Each colony sponsored local militia  Militiamen were lightly armed  had little training  and usually did not have uniforms  Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time  were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations  and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience  If properly used  however  their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces  as at the battles of Concord  Bennington and Saratoga  and the siege of Boston  Both sides used partisan warfare but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when British regulars were not in the area  15  Seeking to coordinate military efforts  the Continental Congress established  on paper  a regular army on June 14  1775  and appointed George Washington as commander in chief  The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress  and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war  The United States Marine Corps traces its institutional roots to the Continental Marines of the war  formed at Tun Tavern in Philadelphia  by a resolution of the Continental Congress on November 10  1775  a date regarded and celebrated as the birthday of the Marine Corps  At the beginning of 1776  Washington s army had 20 000 men  with two thirds enlisted in the Continental Army and the other third in the various state militias  16  At the end of the American Revolution in 1783  both the Continental Navy and Continental Marines were disbanded  About 250 000 men served as regulars or as militiamen for the Revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war  but there were never more than 90 000 men under arms at one time  Armies were small by European standards of the era  largely attributable to limitations such as lack of powder and other logistical capabilities on the American side  17  It was also difficult for Great Britain to transport troops across the Atlantic and they depended on local supplies that the Patriots tried to cut off  By comparison  Duffy notes that Frederick the Great usually commanded from 23 000 to 50 000 in battle  Both figures pale in comparison to the armies that would be fielded in the early 19th century  where troop formations approached or exceeded 100 000 men  Loyalists Main article  Loyalist  American Revolution  Historians 18  have estimated that approximately 40 to 45 percent of the colonists supported the rebellion  while 15 to 20 percent remained loyal to the Crown  The rest attempted to remain neutral and kept a low profile  At least 25 000 Loyalists fought on the side of the British  Thousands served in the Royal Navy  On land  Loyalist forces fought alongside the British in most battles in North America  Many Loyalists fought in partisan units  especially in the Southern theater  19  The British military met with many difficulties in maximizing the use of Loyalist factions  British historian Jeremy Black wrote   In the American war it was clear to both royal generals and revolutionaries that organized and significant Loyalist activity would require the presence of British forces   20  In the South  the use of Loyalists presented the British with  major problems of strategic choice  since while it was necessary to widely disperse troops in order to defend Loyalist areas  it was also recognized that there was a need for  the maintenance of large concentrated forces able  to counter major attacks from the American forces  21  In addition  the British were forced to ensure that their military actions would not  offend Loyalist opinion   eliminating such options as attempting to  live off the country   destroying property for intimidation purposes  or coercing payments from colonists   laying them under contribution    22  British armies and auxiliaries Further information  History of the British Army  American War of Independence Early in 1775  the British Army consisted of about 36 000 men worldwide  but wartime recruitment steadily increased this number  Great Britain had a difficult time appointing general officers  however  General Thomas Gage  in command of British forces in North America when the rebellion started  was criticized for being too lenient  perhaps influenced by his American wife   General Jeffrey Amherst  1st Baron Amherst turned down an appointment as commander in chief due to an unwillingness to take sides in the conflict  23  Similarly  Admiral Augustus Keppel turned down a command  saying  I cannot draw the sword in such a cause   The Earl of Effingham publicly resigned his commission when his 22nd Regiment of foot was posted to America  and William Howe and John Burgoyne were members of parliament who opposed military solutions to the American rebellion  Howe and Henry Clinton stated that they were unwilling participants in the war and were only following orders  24  Over the course of the war  Great Britain signed treaties with various German states  which supplied about 30 000 soldiers  Germans made up about one third of the British troop strength in North America  The Landgraviate of Hesse Kassel contributed more soldiers than any other state  and German soldiers became known as  Hessians  to the Americans  Revolutionary speakers called German soldiers  foreign mercenaries   and they are scorned as such in the Declaration of Independence  By 1779  the number of British and German troops stationed in North America was over 60 000  although these were spread from Canada to Florida  25  The Secretary of State at War Lord Barrington and the Adjutant General Edward Harvey were both strongly opposed to outright war on land  In 1766 Barrington had recommended withdrawing the army from the 13 Colonies to Canada  Nova Scotia and Florida  At the beginning of the war he urged a naval blockade  which would quickly damage the colonists  trading activities  26  Black Americans This 1780 drawing of American soldiers from the Yorktown campaign shows a black infantryman from the 1st Rhode Island Regiment  African Americans slave and free served on both sides during the war  The British recruited slaves belonging to Patriot masters and promised freedom to those who served  Because of manpower shortages  George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776  Small all black units were formed in Rhode Island and Massachusetts  many slaves were promised freedom for serving  Another all black unit came from Haiti with French forces  At least 5 000 black soldiers fought for the Revolutionary cause  27  Tens of thousands of slaves escaped during the war and joined British lines  others simply moved off into the chaos  For instance  in South Carolina  nearly 25 000 slaves  30  of the enslaved population  fled  migrated or died during the disruption of the war  28  This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war  When they withdrew their forces from Savannah and Charleston  the British also evacuated 10 000 slaves  now freedmen  29  Altogether  the British were estimated to evacuate nearly 20 000 freedmen  including families  with other Loyalists and their troops at the end of the war  More than 3 000 freedmen were resettled in Nova Scotia  others were transported to the West Indies of the Caribbean islands  and some to Great Britain  30  Native Americans Most Native Americans east of the Mississippi River were affected by the war  and many communities were divided over the question of how to respond to the conflict  Though a few tribes were on friendly terms with the Americans  most Native Americans opposed the United States as a potential threat to their territory  Approximately 13 000 Native Americans fought on the British side  with the largest group coming from the Iroquois tribes  who fielded around 1 500 men  31  The powerful Iroquois Confederacy was shattered as a result of the conflict  although the Confederacy did not take sides  the Seneca  Onondaga  and Cayuga nations sided with the British  Members of the Mohawk fought on both sides  Many Tuscarora and Oneida sided with the colonists  The Continental Army sent the Sullivan Expedition on raids throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes which had sided with the British  Both during and after the war friction between the Mohawk leaders Joseph Louis Cook and Joseph Brant  who had sided with the Americans and the British respectively  further exacerbated the split  A watercolor painting depicting a variety of Continental Army soldiers  Creek and Seminole allies of Britain fought against Americans in Georgia and South Carolina  In 1778  a force of 800 Creeks destroyed American settlements along the Broad River in Georgia  Creek warriors also joined Thomas Brown s raids into South Carolina and assisted Britain during the Siege of Savannah  32  Many Native Americans were involved in the fighting between Britain and Spain on the Gulf Coast and up the Mississippi River mostly on the British side  Thousands of Creeks  Chickasaws  and Choctaws fought in or near major battles such as the Battle of Fort Charlotte  the Battle of Mobile  and the Siege of Pensacola  33  Sex  race  class Pybus  2005  estimates that about 20 000 slaves defected to or were captured by the British  of whom about 8 000 died from disease or wounds or were recaptured by the Patriots  and 12 000 left the country at the end of the war  for freedom in Canada or slavery in the West Indies  34  Baller  2006  examines family dynamics and mobilization for the Revolution in central Massachusetts  He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible  Militiamen found that living and working on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life  Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation  A man s birth order often influenced his military recruitment  as younger sons went to war and older sons took charge of the farm  A person s family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization  Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant s orders  Some relatives might be Loyalists  creating internal strains  On the whole  historians conclude the Revolution s effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored egalitarianism  35  McDonnell   2006  shows a grave complication in Virginia s mobilization of troops was the conflicting interests of distinct social classes  which tended to undercut a unified commitment to the Patriot cause  The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave owning planters  the middling yeomen  some owning a few slaves   and landless indentured servants  among other groups  The Assembly used deferments  taxes  military service substitute  and conscription to resolve the tensions  Unresolved class conflict  however  made these laws less effective  There were violent protests  many cases of evasion  and large scale desertion  so that Virginia s contributions came at embarrassingly low levels  With the British invasion of the state in 1781  Virginia was mired in class divisiveness as its native son  George Washington  made desperate appeals for troops  36  War in the north  1775 1780 See also  Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga Massachusetts Main article  Boston campaign Before the war  Boston had been the center of much revolutionary activity  leading to the punitive Massachusetts Government Act in 1774 that ended local government  Popular resistance to these measures  however  compelled the newly appointed royal officials in Massachusetts to resign or to seek refuge in Boston  Lieutenant General Thomas Gage  the British North American commander in chief  commanded four regiments of British regulars  about 4 000 men  from his headquarters in Boston  but the countryside was in the hands of the Revolutionaries  The British marching to Concord in April 1775 On the night of April 18  1775  General Gage sent 700 men to seize munitions stored by the colonial militia at Concord  Massachusetts  Riders including Paul Revere alerted the countryside  and when British troops entered Lexington on the morning of April 19  they found 77 minutemen formed up on the village green  Shots were exchanged  killing several minutemen  The British moved on to Concord  where a detachment of three companies was engaged and routed at the North Bridge by a force of 500 minutemen  As the British retreated back to Boston  thousands of militiamen attacked them along the roads  inflicting great damage before timely British reinforcements prevented a total disaster  With the Battles of Lexington and Concord  the war had begun  The militia converged on Boston  bottling up the British in the city  About 4 500 more British soldiers arrived by sea  and on June 17  1775  British forces under General William Howe seized the Charlestown peninsula at the Battle of Bunker Hill  The Americans fell back  but British losses were so heavy that the attack was not followed up  The siege was not broken  and Gage was soon replaced by Howe as the British commander in chief  37  In July 1775  newly appointed General Washington arrived outside Boston to take charge of the colonial forces and to organize the Continental Army  Realizing his army s desperate shortage of gunpowder  Washington asked for new sources  Arsenals were raided and some manufacturing was attempted  90  of the supply  2 million pounds  was imported by the end of 1776  mostly from France  38  Patriots in New Hampshire had seized powder  muskets and cannons from Fort William and Mary in Portsmouth Harbor in late 1774  39  Some of the munitions were used in the Boston campaign  The standoff continued throughout the fall and winter  In early March 1776  heavy cannons that the patriots had captured at Fort Ticonderoga were brought to Boston by Colonel Henry Knox  and placed on Dorchester Heights  Since the artillery now overlooked the British positions  Howe s situation was untenable  and the British fled on March 17  1776  sailing to their naval base at Halifax  Nova Scotia  40 Washington then moved most of the Continental Army to fortify New York City  Quebec Main article  Invasion of Canada  1775  Canadian militiamen and British soldiers repulse the American assault at Sault au Matelot  December 1775 Three weeks after the siege of Boston began  a troop of militia volunteers led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold captured Fort Ticonderoga  a strategically important point on Lake Champlain between New York and the Province of Quebec  After that action they also raided Fort St  John s  not far from Montreal  which alarmed the population and the authorities there  In response  Quebec s governor Guy Carleton began fortifying St  John s  and opened negotiations with the Iroquois and other Native American tribes for their support  These actions  combined with lobbying by both Allen and Arnold and the fear of a British attack from the north  eventually persuaded the Congress to authorize an invasion of Quebec  with the goal of driving the British military from that province   Quebec was then frequently referred to as Canada  as most of its territory included the former French Province of Canada   41  Two Quebec bound expeditions were undertaken  On September 28  1775  Brigadier General Richard Montgomery marched north from Fort Ticonderoga with about 1 700 militiamen  besieging and capturing Fort St  Jean on November 2 and then Montreal on November 13  General Carleton escaped to Quebec City and began preparing that city for an attack  The second expedition  led by Colonel Arnold  went through the wilderness of what is now northern Maine  Logistics were difficult  with 300 men turning back  and another 200 perishing due to the harsh conditions  By the time Arnold reached Quebec City in early November  he had but 600 of his original 1 100 men  Montgomery s force joined Arnold s  and they attacked Quebec City on December 31  but were defeated by Carleton in a battle that ended with Montgomery dead  Arnold wounded  and over 400 Americans taken prisoner  42  The remaining Americans held on outside Quebec City until the spring of 1776  suffering from poor camp conditions and smallpox  and then withdrew when a squadron of British ships under Captain Charles Douglas arrived to relieve the siege  43  Another attempt was made by the Americans to push back towards Quebec  but they failed at Trois Rivi res on June 8  1776  Carleton then launched his own invasion and defeated Arnold at the Battle of Valcour Island in October  Arnold fell back to Fort Ticonderoga  where the invasion had begun  While the invasion ended as a disaster for the Americans  Arnold s efforts in 1776 delayed a full scale British counteroffensive until the Saratoga campaign of 1777  The invasion cost the Americans their base of support in British public opinion   So that the violent measures towards America are freely adopted and countenanced by a majority of individuals of all ranks  professions  or occupations  in this country   44  It gained them at best limited support in the population of Quebec  which  while somewhat supportive early in the invasion  became less so later during the occupation  when American policies against suspected Loyalists became harsher  and the army s hard currency ran out  Two small regiments of Canadiens were recruited during the operation  and they were with the army on its retreat back to Ticonderoga  45  New York and New Jersey Main article  New York and New Jersey campaign American soldiers in the Battle of Long Island  1776 Having withdrawn his army from Boston  General Howe now focused on capturing New York City  which then was limited to the southern tip of Manhattan Island  To defend the city  General Washington spread about 20 000 soldiers along the shores of New York s harbor  concentrated on Long Island and Manhattan  46  While British and recently hired Hessian troops were assembling across the upper harbor on Staten Island for the campaign  Washington had the newly issued Declaration of American Independence read to his men and the citizens of the city  47  No longer was there any possibility of compromise  citation needed  On August 27  1776  after landing about 22 000 men on Long Island  the British drove the Americans back to Brooklyn Heights  securing a decisive British victory in the largest battle of the entire Revolution  Howe then laid siege to fortifications there  In a feat considered by many historians to be one of his most impressive actions as Commander in Chief  Washington personally directed the withdrawal of his entire remaining army and all their supplies across the East River in one night without discovery by the British or significant loss of men and materiel  48  After a failed peace conference on September 11  Howe resumed the attack  On September 15  Howe landed about 12 000 men on lower Manhattan  quickly taking control of New York City  The Americans withdrew north up the island to Harlem Heights  where they skirmished the next day but held their ground  When Howe moved to encircle Washington s army in October  the Americans again fell back  and a battle at White Plains was fought on October 28  49  Again Washington retreated  and Howe returned to Manhattan and captured Fort Washington in mid November  taking about 2 000 prisoners  with an additional 1 000 having been captured during the battle for Long Island   Thus began the infamous  prison ships  system the British maintained in New York for the rest of the war  in which more American soldiers and sailors died of neglect than died in every battle of the entire war  combined  50  51  52  53  54  Howe then detached General Clinton to seize Newport  Rhode Island  while General Lord Cornwallis continued to chase Washington s army through New Jersey  until the Americans withdrew across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania in early December  55  With the campaign at an apparent conclusion for the season  the British entered winter quarters  Although Howe had missed several opportunities to crush the diminishing American army  he had killed or captured over 5 000 Americans  The outlook of the Continental Army was bleak   These are the times that try men s souls   wrote Thomas Paine  who was with the army on the retreat  56  The army had dwindled to fewer than 5 000 men fit for duty  and would be reduced to 1 400 after enlistments expired at the end of the year  citation needed  Congress had abandoned Philadelphia in despair  although popular resistance to British occupation was growing in the countryside  57  Emanuel Leutze s stylized depiction of Washington Crossing the Delaware  1851  Washington decided to take the offensive  stealthily crossing the Delaware on Christmas night and capturing nearly 1 000 Hessians at the Battle of Trenton on December 26  1776  58  Cornwallis marched to retake Trenton but was first repulsed and then outmaneuvered by Washington  who successfully attacked the British rearguard at Princeton on January 3  1777  59  Washington then entered winter quarters at Morristown  New Jersey  having given a morale boost to the American cause  New Jersey militia continued to harass British and Hessian forces throughout the winter  forcing the British to retreat to their base in and around New York City  60  At every stage the British strategy assumed a large base of Loyalist supporters would rally to the King given some military support  In February 1776 Clinton took 2 000 men and a naval squadron to invade North Carolina  which he called off when he learned the Loyalists had been crushed at the Battle of Moore s Creek Bridge  In June he tried to seize Charleston  South Carolina  the leading port in the South  hoping for a simultaneous rising in South Carolina  It seemed a cheap way of waging the war but it failed as the naval force was defeated by the forts and because no local Loyalists attacked the town from behind  The Loyalists were too poorly organized to be effective  but as late as 1781 senior officials in London  misled by Loyalist exiles  placed their confidence in their rising  citation needed  Saratoga and Philadelphia Mohawk leader Joseph Brant led both Native Americans and white Loyalists in battle   The surrender at Saratoga  shows General Daniel Morgan in front of a French de Valli re 4 pounder  Washington and Lafayette look over the troops at Valley Forge  When the British began to plan operations for 1777  they had two main armies in North America  Carleton s army in Quebec  and Howe s army in New York  In London  Lord George Germain approved campaigns for these armies which  because of miscommunication  poor planning  and rivalries between commanders  did not work in conjunction  Although Howe successfully captured Philadelphia  the northern army was lost in a disastrous surrender at Saratoga  Both Carleton and Howe resigned after the 1777 campaign  Saratoga campaign Main article  Saratoga campaign The first of the 1777 campaigns was an expedition from Quebec led by General John Burgoyne  The goal was to seize the Lake Champlain and Hudson River corridor  effectively isolating New England from the rest of the American colonies  Burgoyne s invasion had two components  he would lead about 8 000 men along Lake Champlain towards Albany  New York  while a second column of about 2 000 men  led by Barry St  Leger  would move down the Mohawk River Valley and link up with Burgoyne in Albany  New York  61  Burgoyne set off in June  and recaptured Fort Ticonderoga in early July  Thereafter  his march was slowed by the Americans who literally knocked down trees in his path  and by his army s extensive baggage train  A detachment sent out to seize supplies was decisively defeated in the Battle of Bennington by American militia in August  depriving Burgoyne of nearly 1 000 men  Meanwhile  St  Leger more than half of his force Native Americans led by Sayenqueraghta had laid siege to Fort Stanwix  American militiamen and their Native American allies marched to relieve the siege but were ambushed and scattered at the Battle of Oriskany  When a second relief expedition approached  this time led by Benedict Arnold  St  Leger s Indian support abandoned him  forcing him to break off the siege and return to Quebec  Burgoyne s army had been reduced to about 6 000 men by the loss at Bennington and the need to garrison Ticonderoga  and he was running short on supplies  62  Despite these setbacks  he determined to push on towards Albany  An American army of 8 000 men  commanded by the General Horatio Gates  had entrenched about 10 miles  16 km  south of Saratoga  New York  Burgoyne tried to outflank the Americans but was checked at the first battle of Saratoga in September  Burgoyne s situation was desperate  but he now hoped that help from Howe s army in New York City might be on the way  It was not  Howe had instead sailed away on his expedition to capture Philadelphia  American militiamen flocked to Gates  army  swelling his force to 11 000 by the beginning of October  After being badly beaten at the second battle of Saratoga  Burgoyne surrendered on October 17  Saratoga was the turning point of the war  Revolutionary confidence and determination  suffering from Howe s successful occupation of Philadelphia  was renewed  What is more important  the victory encouraged France to make an open alliance with the Americans  after two years of semi secret support  For the British  the war had now become much more complicated  63  Philadelphia campaign Main article  Philadelphia campaign Having secured New York City in 1776  General Howe concentrated on capturing Philadelphia  the seat of the Revolutionary government  in 1777  He moved slowly  landing 15 000 troops in late August at the northern end of Chesapeake Bay  Washington positioned his 11 000 men between Howe and Philadelphia but was driven back at the Battle of Brandywine on September 11  1777  The Continental Congress again abandoned Philadelphia  and on September 26  Howe finally outmaneuvered Washington and marched into the city unopposed  Washington unsuccessfully attacked the British encampment in nearby Germantown in early October and then retreated to watch and wait  After repelling a British attack at White Marsh  Washington and his army encamped at Valley Forge in December 1777  about 20 miles  32 km  from Philadelphia  where they stayed for the next six months  Over the winter  2 500 men  out of 10 000  died from disease and exposure  The next spring  however  the army emerged from Valley Forge in good order  thanks in part to a training program supervised by Baron von Steuben  who introduced the most modern Prussian methods of organization and tactics  citation needed  General Clinton replaced Howe as British commander in chief  French entry into the war had changed British strategy  and Clinton abandoned Philadelphia to reinforce New York City  now vulnerable to French naval power  Washington shadowed Clinton on his withdrawal and forced a strategic victory at the battle at Monmouth on June 28  1778  the last major battle in the north  Clinton s army went to New York City in July  arriving just before a French fleet under Admiral d Estaing arrived off the American coast  Washington s army returned to White Plains  New York  north of the city  Although both armies were back where they had been two years earlier  the nature of the war had now changed  64  An international war  1778 1783 Main

had encouraged a French alliance  and guns such as de Valliere type were used  playing an important role in such battles as the Battle of Saratoga  65 George Washington wrote about the French supplies and guns in a letter to General Heath on May 2  1777  After learning of the American victory at Saratoga  France signed the Treaty of Alliance with the United States on February 6  1778  formalizing the Franco American alliance negotiated by Benjamin Franklin  French troops storming Redoubt  9 during the Siege of Yorktown In 1776 the Count of Aranda met in representation of Spain with the first U S  Commission composed by Benjamin Franklin  Silas Deane and Arthur Lee  66  The Continental Congress had charged the commissioners to travel to Europe and forge alliances with other European powers that could help break the British naval blockade along the North American coast  Aranda invited the commission to his house in Paris  where he was acting as Spanish ambassador and he became an active supporter of the struggle of the fledgling Colonies  recommending an early and open Spanish commitment to the Colonies  However he was overruled by Jos  Mo ino  1st Count of Floridablanca who opted by a more discreet approach  The Spanish position was later summarized by the Spanish Ambassador to the French Court  Jer nimo Grimaldi  in a letter to Arthur Lee who was in Madrid trying to persuade the Spanish government to declare an open alliance  Grimaldi told Lee that  You have considered your own situation  and not ours  The moment is not yet come for us  The war with Portugal   France being unprepared  and our treasure ships from South America not being arrived   makes it improper for us to declare immediately   67  Meanwhile  Grimaldi reassured Lee  stores of clothing and powder were deposited at New Orleans and Havana for the Americans  and further shipments of blankets were being collected at Bilbao  Spain finally entered officially the war in June 1779  thus implementing the Treaty of Aranjuez  although the Spanish government had been providing assistance to the revolutionaries since the very beginning of the war  So too had the Dutch Republic  which was formally brought into the war at the end of 1780  68  Punish the Americans Oil on canvas painting depicting the Wyoming Massacre  July 3  1778 In London King George III gave up all hope of subduing America by more armies  while Britain had a European war to fight   It was a joke   he said   to think of keeping Pennsylvania   There was no hope of recovering New England  But the King was still determined  never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans  and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal   69  His plan was to keep the 30 000 men garrisoned in New York  Rhode Island  Quebec  and Florida  other forces would attack the French and Spanish in the West Indies  To punish the Americans the King planned to destroy their coasting trade  bombard their ports  sack and burn towns along the coast  as Benedict Arnold did to New London  Connecticut in 1781   and turn loose the Native Americans to attack civilians in frontier settlements  These operations  the King felt  would inspire the Loyalists  would splinter the Congress  and  would keep the rebels harassed  anxious  and poor  until the day when  by a natural and inevitable process  discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse  and they would beg to return to his authority  70  The plan meant destruction for the Loyalists and loyal Native Americans  an indefinite prolongation of a costly war  and the risk of disaster as the French and Spanish assembled an armada to invade the British Isles  The British planned to re subjugate the

Rochambeau and the position of the squadron of Knight Ternay in 1780  When the war began  the British had overwhelming naval superiority over the American colonists  The Royal Navy had over 100 ships of the line and many frigates and smaller craft  although this fleet was old and in poor condition  a situation which would be blamed on Lord Sandwich  the First Lord of the Admiralty  During the first three years of the war  the Royal Navy was primarily used to transport troops for land operations and to protect commercial shipping  The American colonists had no ships of the line  and relied extensively on privateering to harass British shipping  The privateers caused worry disproportionate to their material success  although those operating out of French channel ports before and after France joined the war caused significant embarrassment to the Royal Navy and inflamed Anglo French relations  About 55 000 American sailors served aboard the privateers during the war  71  The American privateers had almost 1 700 ships  and they captured 2 283 enemy ships  72  The Continental Congress authorized the creation of a small Continental Navy in October 1775  which was primarily used for commerce raiding  John Paul Jones became the first great American naval hero  capturing HMS Drake on April 24  1778  the first victory for any American military vessel in British waters  73  The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar  September 13  1782  by John Singleton Copley France s formal entry into the war meant that British naval superiority was now contested  The Franco American alliance began poorly  however  with failed operations at Rhode Island in 1778 and Savannah  Georgia  in 1779  Part of the problem was that France and the United States had different military priorities  France hoped to capture British possessions in the West Indies before helping to secure American independence  While French financial assistance to the American war effort was already of critical importance  French military aid to the Americans would not show positive results until the arrival in July 1780 of a large force of soldiers led by the Comte de Rochambeau  Spain entered the war as a French ally with the goal of recapturing Gibraltar and Minorca  which it had lost to the British in 1704  Gibraltar was besieged for more than three years  but the British garrison stubbornly resisted and was resupplied twice  once after Admiral Rodney s victory over Juan de L ngara in the 1780  Moonlight Battle   and again after Admiral Richard Howe fought Luis de C rdova y C rdova to a draw in the Battle of Cape Spartel  Further Franco Spanish efforts to capture Gibraltar were unsuccessful  One notable success took place on February 5  1782  when Spanish and French forces captured Minorca  which Spain retained after the war  Ambitious plans for an invasion of Great Britain in 1779 had to be abandoned  West Indies and Gulf Coast Bernardo de G lvez Main article  Caribbean theater of the American Revolutionary War There was much action in the West Indies  especially in the Lesser Antilles  Although France lost St  Lucia early in the war  its navy dominated the West Indies  capturing Dominica  Grenada  Saint Vincent  Montserrat  Tobago  St  Kitts and the Turks and Caicos between 1778 and 1782  Dutch possessions in the West Indies and South America were captured by Britain but later recaptured by France and restored to the Dutch Republic  At the Battle of the Saintes in April 1782  a victory by Rodney s fleet over the French Admiral de Grasse frustrated the hopes of France and Spain to take Jamaica and other colonies from the British  citation needed  On the Gulf Coast  Count Bernardo de G lvez  the Spanish governor of Louisiana  quickly removed the British from their outposts on the lower Mississippi River in 1779 in actions at Manchac and Baton Rouge in British West Florida  G lvez then captured Mobile in 1780 and stormed and captured the British citadel and capital of Pensacola in 1781  On May 8  1782  G lvez captured the British naval base at New Providence in the Bahamas  it was ceded by Spain after the Treaty of Paris and simultaneously recovered by British Loyalists in 1783  G lvez  actions led to the Spanish acquisition of East and West Florida in the peace settlement  denied the British the opportunity of encircling the American rebels from the south  and kept open a vital conduit for supplies to the American frontier  The Continental Congress cited G lvez in 1785 for his aid during the revolution and George Washington took him to his right during the first parade of July 4  74  Norteamerica  1792  Jaillot Elwe  Florida s borders after Bernardo G lvez s military actions  Central America was also subject to conflict between Britain and Spain  as Britain sought to expand its influence beyond coastal logging and fishing communities in present day Belize  Honduras  and Nicaragua  Expeditions against San Fernando de Omoa in 1779 and San Juan in 1780  the latter famously led by a young Horatio Nelson  met with only temporary success before being abandoned due to disease  The Spanish colonial leaders  in turn  could not completely eliminate British influences along the Mosquito Coast  Except for the French acquisition of Tobago  sovereignty in the West Indies was returned to the status quo ante

1st Cuddalore 2nd Cuddalore When word reached India in 1778 that France had entered the war  British military forces moved quickly to capture French colonial outposts there  capturing Pondicherry after two months of siege  75  The capture of the French controlled port of Mah  on India s west coast motivated Mysore s ruler  Hyder Ali  who was already upset at other British actions  and benefited from trade through the port   to open the Second Anglo Mysore War in 1780  Ali  and later his son Tipu Sultan  almost drove the British from southern India but was frustrated by weak French support  and the war ended status quo ante bellum with the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore  French opposition was led in 1782 and 1783 by Admiral the Baillie de Suffren  who recaptured Trincomalee from the British and fought five celebrated  but largely inconclusive  naval engagements against British Admiral Sir Edward Hughes  76  France s Indian colonies were returned after the war  Suffren meeting with ally Hyder Ali in 1783  J B  Morret engraving  1789 The Dutch Republic  nominally neutral  had been trading with the Americans  exchanging Dutch arms and munitions for American colonial wares  in contravention of the British Navigation Acts   primarily through activity based in St  Eustatius  before the French formally entered the war  77  The British considered this trade to include contraband military supplies and had attempted to stop it  at first diplomatically by appealing to previous treaty obligations  interpretation of whose terms the two nations disagreed on  and then by searching and seizing Dutch merchant ships  The situation escalated when the British seized a Dutch merchant convoy sailing under Dutch naval escort in December 1779  prompting the Dutch to join the League of Armed Neutrality  Britain responded to this decision by declaring war on the Dutch in December 1780  sparking the Fourth Anglo Dutch War  78  The war was a military and economic disaster for the Dutch Republic  Paralyzed by internal political divisions  it could not respond effectively to British blockades of its coast and the capture of many of its colonies  In the 1784 peace treaty between the two nations  the Dutch lost the Indian port of Negapatam and were forced to make trade concessions  79  The Dutch Republic signed a friendship and trade agreement with the United States in 1782  and was the second country  after France  to formally recognize the United States  80  Southern theater Main article  Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War During the first three years of the American Revolutionary War  the primary military encounters were in the north  although some attempts to organize Loyalists were defeated  a British attempt at Charleston  South Carolina failed  and a variety of efforts to attack British forces in East Florida failed  After French entry into the war  the British turned their attention to the southern colonies  where they hoped to regain control by recruiting large numbers of Loyalists  This southern strategy also had the advantage of keeping the Royal Navy closer to the Caribbean  where the British needed to defend economically important possessions against the French and Spanish  81  The British Lt  Col  Banastre Tarleton  Painting by Sir Joshua Reynolds  1782  On December 29  1778  an expeditionary corps from Clinton s army in New York captured Savannah  Georgia  An attempt by French and American forces to retake Savannah failed on October 9  1779  Clinton then besieged Charleston  capturing it and most of the southern Continental Army on May 12  1780  With relatively few casualties  Clinton had seized the South s biggest city and seaport  providing a base for further conquest  82  The remnants of the southern Continental Army began to withdraw to North Carolina but were pursued by Lt  Colonel Banastre Tarleton  who defeated them at the Waxhaws on May 29  1780  With these events  organized American military activity in the region collapsed  though the war was carried on by partisans such as Francis Marion  Cornwallis took over British operations  while Horatio Gates arrived to command the American effort  On August 16  1780  Gates was defeated at the Battle of Camden  setting the stage for Cornwallis to invade North Carolina  83  Cornwallis  victories quickly turned  however  One wing of his army was utterly defeated at the Battle of Kings Mountain on October 7  1780  and Tarleton was decisively defeated by Daniel Morgan at the Battle of Cowpens on January 17  1781  General Nathanael Greene  who replaced General Gates  proceeded to wear down the British in a series of battles  each of them tactically a victory for the British but giving no strategic advantage to the victors  Greene summed up his approach in a motto that would become famous   We fight  get beat  rise  and fight again   By March  Greene s army had grown to the point where he felt that he could face Cornwallis directly  In the key Battle of Guilford Court House  Cornwallis defeated Greene  but at tremendous cost  and without breaking Greene s army  He retreated to Wilmington  North Carolina for resupply and reinforcement  after which he moved north into Virginia  leaving the Carolinas and Georgia open to Greene  The British strategy that assumed thousands of Loyalists would flock to the Crown was a failure far fewer joined up than expecyed because the Patriots put heavy pressure on Loyalist and their families would become hostages  84  In January 1781  a British force under Benedict Arnold landed in Virginia  and began moving through the Virginia countryside  destroying supply depots  mills  and other economic targets  In February  General Washington dispatched General Lafayette to counter Arnold  later also sending General Anthony Wayne  Arnold was reinforced with additional troops from New York in March  and his army was joined with that of Cornwallis in May  Lafayette skirmished with Cornwallis  avoiding a decisive battle while gathering reinforcements  Cornwallis could not trap Lafayette  and upon his arrival at Williamsburg in June  received orders from General Clinton to establish a fortified naval base in Virginia  Following these orders  he fortified Yorktown  and  shadowed by Lafayette  awaited the arrival of the Royal Navy  85  Northern and western frontier Further information  Western theater of the American Revolutionary War George Rogers Clark s 180 mile  290 km  winter march led to the capture of General Henry Hamilton  Lieutenant Governor of Quebec West of the Appalachian Mountains and along the border with Quebec  the American Revolutionary War was an  Indian War   Most Native Americans supported the British  Like the Iroquois Confederacy  tribes such as the Shawnee split into factions  and the Chickamauga split off from the rest of the Cherokee over differences regarding peace with the Americans  The British supplied their native allies with muskets  gunpowder and advice  while Loyalists led raids against civilian settlements  especially in New York  Kentucky  and Pennsylvania  Joint Iroquois Loyalist attacks in the Wyoming Valley and at Cherry Valley in 1778 provoked Washington to send the Sullivan Expedition into western New York during the summer of 1779  There was little fighting as Sullivan systematically destroyed the Indians  winter food supplies  forcing them to flee permanently to British bases in Quebec and the Niagara Falls area  86  In the Ohio Country and the Illinois Country  the Virginia frontiersman George Rogers Clark attempted to neutralize British influence among the Ohio tribes by capturing the outposts of Kaskaskia and Cahokia and Vincennes in the summer of 1778  at which he succeeded  When General Henry Hamilton  the British commander at Detroit  retook Vincennes  Clark returned in a surprise march in February 1779 and captured Hamilton  87  In March 1782  Pennsylvania militiamen killed about a hundred neutral Native Americans in the Gnadenh tten massacre  In the last major encounters of the war  a force of 200 Kentucky militia was defeated at the Battle of Blue Licks in August 1782  Yorktown and the surrender of Cornwallis Main article  Siege of Yorktown Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown by  John Trumbull  1797  The northern  southern  and naval theaters of the war converged in 1781 at Yorktown  Virginia  Cornwallis  having been ordered to occupy a fortified position that could be resupplied  and evacuated  if necessary  by sea  had settled in Yorktown  on the York River  which was navigable by sea going vessels  Aware that the arrival of the French fleet from The West Indies would give the allies control of the Chesapeake  Washington began moving the American and French forces south toward Virginia in August  In early September  French naval forces defeated a British fleet at the Battle of the Chesapeake  cutting off Cornwallis  escape  When Washington arrived outside Yorktown  the combined Franco American force of 18 900 men began besieging Cornwallis in early October  For several days  the French and Americans bombarded the British defenses  and then began taking the outer positions  Cornwallis decided his position was becoming untenable  and he surrendered his entire army of over 8 000 men on October 19  1781  88  With the surrender at Yorktown  King George lost control of Parliament to the peace party  and there were no further major military activities in North America  The British had 30 000 garrison troops occupying New York City  Charleston  and Savannah  89  The war continued elsewhere  including the siege of Gibraltar and naval operations in the East and West Indies  until peace was agreed in 1783  Treaty of Paris Main article  Treaty of Paris  1783  In London  as political support for the war plummeted after Yorktown  British Prime Minister Lord North resigned in March 1782  In April 1782  the Commons voted to end the war in America  Preliminary peace articles were signed in Paris at the end of November  1782  the formal end of the war did not occur until the Treaty of Paris  for the U S   and the Treaties of Versailles  for the other Allies  were signed on September 3  1783  The last British troops left New York City on November 25  1783  and the United States Congress of the Confederation ratified the Paris treaty on January 14  1784  90  Britain negotiated the Paris peace treaty without consulting her Native American allies and ceded all Native American territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River to the United States  Full of resentment  Native Americans reluctantly confirmed these land cessions with the United States in a series of treaties  but the fighting would be renewed in conflicts along the frontier in the coming years  the largest being the Northwest Indian War  91  The British would continue to support the Indians against the new American nation especially when hostilities resumed 29 years later in the War of 1812  The United States gained more than it expected  thanks to the award of western territory  The other Allies had mixed to poor results  France made some gains over its nemesis  Great Britain  but its material gains were minimal and its financial losses huge  It was already in financial trouble and its borrowing to pay for the war used up all its credit and created the financial disasters that marked the 1780s  Historians link those disasters to the coming of the French Revolution  The Dutch clearly lost on all points  The Spanish had a mixed result  they did not achieve their primary war goal  recovery of Gibraltar   but they did gain territory  However in the long run  as the case of Florida shows  the new territory was of little or no value  14  Advantages and disadvantages of the opposing sides The Americans The Americans began the war with significant disadvantages compared to the British  They had no national government  no national army or navy  and no financial system  no banks  no established credit  and no functioning government departments  such as a treasury  The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees  which proved inefficient  At first  the Americans had no international allies  However the American cause eventually attracted alliances and supporters  especially from France  the Netherlands  and Spain  The Americans had a large  relatively prosperous population  when compared to other colonies  that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies  They were on their home ground  had a smoothly functioning  well organized system of local and state governments  newspapers and printers  and internal lines of communications  They had a long established system of local militia  with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias  and provide a training ground for the national army that the Congress set up  92  In peacetime the colonies relied heavily on ocean shipping  but that was now shut down by the British blockade  At the onset of the war  the Americans had no major international allies  however battles such as the Battle of Bennington  Battles of Saratoga and even defeats such as the Battle of Germantown 93  proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain  who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies  to overtly supporting them militarily  moving the war to a global stage  94  Upon the creation of the Continental Army to combat the British forces and their allies in North America  the army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training regime  and largely inexperienced officers  The inexperience of its officers was compensated for in part by its senior officers  officers such as George Washington  Horatio Gates  Charles Lee  Richard Montgomery and Francis Marion all had military experience with the British Army during the French and Indian conflict  The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in Winter Quarters at Valley Forge  where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben  a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff  He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline  drills  tactics and strategy  and wrote the Revolutionary War Drill Manual  which was used to train American troops up until the War of 1812  95  When the Army emerged from Valley Forge  they proved their ability to equally match the British troops in battle when they fought a successful strategic action at the Battle of Monmouth  When compared to other colonies  the Americans had a relatively large and prosperous population  and could rely on local production for food and other supplies  something the British could not rely on sufficiently  While they had little in the way of a national government  the colonies themselves had effective local and state governments  and the long established militia network  previously used to combat the French and Native Americans instantly provided the Americans with a basis for the creation of an army  92  Fighting on their home ground  the Americans were also much more acclimatised to the climate than the British and their allies  The British The British were beset with major difficulties in fighting the war  Compared to the Americans  the British had no major allies  and only had troops provided by small German states to bolster the strength of the British Army in North America  At the onset of the war  the British Army was less than 48 000 strong worldwide  and suffered from a lack of effective recruiting  By 1778  the army was pardoning criminals for military service and had extended the age range for service to be from 16 to 50  96  97  Although its officer and non commissioned officer corps were relatively professional and experienced  98  this professionalism was diluted because wealthy individuals lacking military experience could purchase commissions and promotions  As a consequence  inexperienced officers sometimes found their way into positions of high responsibility  96  99  Distance was also major problem for the British  Although the Royal Navy was the largest and most experienced in the world at the time  it sometimes took months for troops to reach North America  and orders were often out of date because the military situation on the ground had changed by the time they arrived  100  Additionally  the British had logistical problems whenever they operated away from the coast  they were vulnerable to guerilla attacks on their supply chains whenever they went far inland  On a logistical note  the flints used in British weapons also put them at a disadvantage on the battlefield  British flints could only fire for 6 rounds before requiring re sharpening  while American flints could fire 60 rounds before resharpening  A common expression ran among the redcoats  which was that  Yankee flint was as good as a glass of grog   99  Although discipline was harsh in the army  the redcoats had little self discipline  gambling  promiscuity and heavy drinking were common problems  among all ranks alike  99  The army suffered from mediocre organisation in terms of logistics  food supplies were often bad and the sparse land of America offered little in the way of finding reliable substitutes  101  Map of campaigns in the Revolutionary War Suppressing a rebellion in America also posed other problems  At the onset of the war  the British had around 8 000 men stationed in North America  however these were required to cover an area that stretched from Canada to Florida  99  As the colonies had not been united before the war  there was no central area of strategic importance  In European conflicts  the capture of a capital city often meant the end of the war  however in America  when the British seized key cities such as New York  Philadelphia or Boston  the war continued unabated  Furthermore  despite the fact that at its height  the British fielded some 56 000 men in the colonies exclusive of mercenaries and militia  97  they lacked the sufficient numbers to both defeat the Americans on the battlefield and simultaneously occupy the captured areas  It was not unusual for the Americans to suffer a string of defeats  but the British could not occupy the captured land due to lack of numbers  Despite strong Loyalist support  these troops were often displaced by Patriot militia when British regulars were not in the area  demonstrated at battles such as Kings Mountain  The manpower shortage became critical when France  Spain and the Netherlands entered the war  as the British were spread across several theatres worldwide  when before they were concentrated only in America  102  The need to maintain Loyalist allegiance also provided setbacks  as the British could not use the harsh methods of suppressing rebellion they had used in Ireland and Scotland  Despite these limitations  neutral colonists were often driven into the ranks of the Revolutionaries due to the conflict  103  Washington and the Comte de Rochambeau at Yorktown  1781 Costs of the war Casualties Americans  amp  Allies The total loss of life throughout the war is largely unknown  As was typical in the wars of the era  disease claimed far more lives than battle  Between 1775 and 1782 a smallpox epidemic swept across North America  killing more than 130 000 people  Historian Joseph Ellis suggests that Washington s decision to have his troops inoculated against the smallpox epidemic was one of his most important decisions  104  More than 25 000 American Revolutionaries died during active military service  About 8 000 of these deaths were in battle  the other 17 000 recorded deaths were from disease  including about 8 000 12 000 who died of starvation or disease brought on by deplorable conditions while prisoners of war  105  most in rotting British prison ships in New York  This tally of deaths from disease is undoubtedly too low  however  2 500 Americans died while encamped at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777 78 alone  The number of Revolutionaries seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from 8 500 to 25 000  The total American military casualty figure was therefore as high as 50 000  106  British  amp  Allies About 171 000 sailors served in the Royal Navy during the war  about a quarter had been pressed into service  About 1 240 were killed in battle  while 18 500 died from disease  The greatest killer was scurvy  a disease which had been shown to be preventable by issuing lemon or lime juice to sailors but was not taken seriously  Scurvy would be eradicated in the Royal Navy in 1790s by the chairman of the Navy s Sick and Hurt Board  Gilbert Blane  About 42 000 British sailors deserted during the war  107  Approximately 1 200 Germans were killed in action and 6 354 died from illness or accident  About 16 000 of the remaining German troops returned home  but roughly 5 500 remained in the United States after the war for various reasons  many eventually becoming American citizens  No reliable statistics exist for the number of casualties among other groups  including Loyalists  British regulars  Native Americans  French and Spanish troops  and civilians  Financial costs Main article  Financial costs of the American Revolutionary War The British spent about  80 million and ended with a national debt of  250 million  which it easily financed at about  9 5 million a year in interest  The French spent 1 3 billion livres  about  56 million   Their total national debt was  187 million  which they could not easily finance  over half the French national revenue went to debt service in the 1780s  The debt crisis became a major enabling factor of the French Revolution as the government could not raise taxes without public approval  108  The United States spent  37 million at the national level plus  114 million by the states  This was mostly covered by loans from France and the Netherlands  loans from Americans  and issuance of an increasing amount of paper money  which became  not worth a continental    The U S  finally solved its debt and currency problems in the 1790s when Alexander Hamilton spearheaded the establishment of the First Bank of the United States  109  See also George Washington in the American Revolution Battles of the American Revolutionary War
