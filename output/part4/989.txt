disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by poor emotional responsiveness  1  It most commonly manifests itself as auditory hallucinations  paranoid or bizarre delusions  or disorganized speech and thinking  and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction  The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood  with a global lifetime prevalence of about 0 3 0 7   2  Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the patient s reported experiences  Genetics  early environment  neurobiology  and psychological and social processes appear to be important contributory factors  some recreational and prescription drugs appear to cause or worsen symptoms  Current research is focused on the role of neurobiology  although no single isolated organic cause has been found  The many possible combinations of symptoms have triggered debate about whether the diagnosis represents a single disorder or a number of discrete syndromes  Despite the etymology of the term from the Greek roots skhizein            to split   and phr n  phren                 mind    schizophrenia does not imply a  split mind  and it is not the same as dissociative identity disorder also known as  multiple personality disorder  or  split personality  a condition with which it is often confused in public perception  3  The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication  which primarily suppresses dopamine  and sometimes serotonin  receptor activity  Psychotherapy and vocational and social rehabilitation are also important in treatment  In more serious cases where there is risk to self and others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary  although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were  4  The disorder is thought mainly to affect cognition  but it also usually contributes to chronic problems with behavior and emotion  People with schizophrenia are likely to have additional  comorbid  conditions  including major depression and anxiety disorders  the lifetime occurrence of substance abuse is almost 50   5  Social problems  such as long term unemployment  poverty and homelessness  are common  The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is 12 to 15 years less than those without  the result of increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate  about 5    2  Contents 1 Symptoms 1 1

links Symptoms A person diagnosed with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations  most reported are hearing voices   delusions  often bizarre or persecutory in nature   and disorganized thinking and speech  The latter may range from loss of train of thought  to sentences only loosely connected in meaning  to incoherence known as word salad in severe cases  Social withdrawal  sloppiness of dress and hygiene  and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia  6  There is often an observable pattern of emotional difficulty  for example lack of responsiveness  7  Impairment in social cognition is associated with schizophrenia  8  as are symptoms of paranoia  social isolation commonly occurs  9  In one uncommon subtype  the person may be largely mute  remain motionless in bizarre postures  or exhibit purposeless agitation  all signs of catatonia  10  Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia  2  critical years in a young adult s social and vocational development  11  In 40  of men and 23  of women diagnosed with schizophrenia  the condition manifested itself before the age of 19  12  To minimize the developmental disruption associated with schizophrenia  much work has recently been done to identify and treat the prodromal  pre onset  phase of the illness  which has been detected up to 30 months before the onset of symptoms  11  Those who go on to develop schizophrenia may experience transient or self limiting psychotic symptoms 13  and the non specific symptoms of social withdrawal  irritability  dysphoria  14  and clumsiness 15  during the prodromal phase  Schneiderian classification The psychiatrist Kurt Schneider  1887 1967  listed the forms of psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders  These are called first rank symptoms or Schneider s first rank symptoms  They include delusions of being controlled by an external force  the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one s conscious mind  the belief that one s thoughts are being broadcast to other people  and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one s thoughts or actions or that have a conversation with other hallucinated voices  16  Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria  the specificity of first rank symptoms has been questioned  A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider s claims  and suggested that first rank symptoms be de emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems  17  Positive and negative symptoms Schizophrenia is often described in terms of positive and negative  or deficit  symptoms  18  Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience but are present in people with schizophrenia  They can include delusions  disordered thoughts and speech  and tactile  auditory  visual  olfactory and gustatory hallucinations  typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis  19  Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme  20  Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication  20  Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes  and respond less well to medication  6  They commonly include flat or blunted affect and emotion  poverty of speech  alogia   inability to experience pleasure  anhedonia   lack of desire to form relationships  asociality   and lack of motivation  avolition   Research suggests that negative symptoms contribute more to poor quality of life  functional disability  and the burden on others than do positive symptoms  21  People with prominent negative symptoms often have a history of poor adjustment before the onset of illness  and response to medication is often limited  6  22  Causes Main article  Causes of schizophrenia A combination of genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of schizophrenia  2  3  People with a family history of schizophrenia who suffer a transient or self limiting psychosis have a 20 40  chance of being diagnosed one year later  23  Genetic Estimates of heritability vary because of the difficulty in separating the effects of genetics and the environment  24  The greatest risk for developing schizophrenia is having a first degree relative with the disease  risk is 6 5    more than 40  of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected  3  It is likely that many genes are involved  each of small effect  3  Many possible candidates have been proposed  including specific copy number variations  NOTCH4 and histone protein loci  25  A number of genome wide associations such as zinc finger protein 804A have also been linked  26  There appears to be significant overlap in the genetics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder  27  Assuming a hereditary basis  one question from evolutionary psychology is why genes that increase the likelihood of psychosis evolved  assuming the condition would have been maladaptive from an evolutionary point of view  One theory implicates genes involved in the evolution of language and human nature  but to date such ideas remain little more than theoretical in nature   28  29  Environment Environmental factors associated with the development of schizophrenia include the living environment  drug use and prenatal stressors  2  Parenting style seems to have no major effect  although people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents  3  Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two  2  3  even after taking into account drug use  ethnic group  and size of social group  30  Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity  racial discrimination  family dysfunction  unemployment  and poor housing conditions  3  31  There is evidence that childhood experiences of abuse or trauma are risk factors for a diagnosis of schizophrenia later in life  32  Substance misuse A number of drugs have been associated with the development of schizophrenia  including cannabis  cocaine  and amphetamines  3  About half of those with schizophrenia use drugs and or alcohol excessively  33  The role of cannabis could be causal  34  but other drugs may be used only as coping mechanisms to deal with depression  anxiety  boredom  and loneliness  33  35  Cannabis is associated with a dose dependent increase in the risk of developing a psychotic disorder 36  with frequent use being correlated with twice the risk of psychosis and schizophrenia  35  37  While cannabis use is accepted as a contributory cause of schizophrenia by many  38  it remains controversial  25  39  Amphetamine  cocaine  and to a lesser extent alcohol  can result in psychosis that presents very similarly to schizophrenia  3  40  Although not generally believed to be a cause of the illness  people with schizophrenia use nicotine at much greater rates than the general population  41  Prenatal Factors such as hypoxia and infection  or stress and malnutrition in the mother during fetal development  may result in a slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life  2  People diagnosed with schizophrenia are more likely to have been born in winter or spring  at least in the northern hemisphere   which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposures in utero  3  This difference is about 5 to 8   42  Mechanisms Main article  Mechanisms of schizophrenia A number of attempts have been made to explain the link between altered brain function and schizophrenia  2  One of the most common is the dopamine hypothesis  which attributes psychosis to the mind s faulty interpretation of the misfiring of dopaminergic neurons  2  Psychological Many psychological mechanisms have been implicated in the development and maintenance of schizophrenia  Cognitive biases have been identified in those with the diagnosis or those at risk  especially when under stress or in confusing situations  43  Some cognitive features may reflect global neurocognitive deficits such as memory loss  while others may be related to particular issues and experiences  44  45  Despite a demonstrated appearance of  blunted affect   recent findings indicate that many individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia are emotionally responsive  particularly to stressful or negative stimuli  and that such sensitivity may cause vulnerability to symptoms or to the disorder  46  47  Some evidence suggests that the content of delusional beliefs and psychotic experiences can reflect emotional causes of the disorder  and that how a person interprets such experiences can influence symptomatology  48  49  50  The use of  safety behaviors  to avoid imagined threats may contribute to the chronicity of delusions  51  Further evidence for the role of psychological mechanisms comes from the effects of psychotherapies on symptoms of schizophrenia  52  Neurological Functional magnetic resonance imaging  fMRI   and other brain imaging technologies  allow for the study of differences in brain activity in people diagnosed with schizophrenia  The image shows two levels of the brain  with areas that were more active in healthy controls than in schizophrenia patients shown in red  during an fMRI study of working memory  Schizophrenia is associated with subtle differences in brain structures  found in 40 to 50  of cases  and in brain chemistry during acute psychotic states  2  Studies using neuropsychological tests and brain imaging technologies such as fMRI and PET to examine functional differences in brain activity have shown that differences seem to most commonly occur in the frontal lobes  hippocampus and temporal lobes  53  Reductions in brain volume  smaller than those found in Alzheimer s disease  have been reported in areas of the frontal cortex and temporal lobes  It is uncertain whether these volumetric changes are progressive or preexist prior to the onset of the disease  54  These differences have been linked to the neurocognitive deficits often associated with schizophrenia  55  Because neural circuits are altered  it has alternatively been suggested that schizophrenia should be thought of as a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders  56  Particular attention has been paid to the function of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain  This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that phenothiazine drugs  which block dopamine function  could reduce psychotic symptoms  It is also supported by the fact that amphetamines  which trigger the release of dopamine  may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia  57  The influential dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that excessive activation of D2 receptors was the cause of  the positive symptoms of  schizophrenia  Although postulated for about 20 years based on the D2 blockade effect common to all antipsychotics  it was not until the mid 1990s that PET and SPET imaging studies provided supporting evidence  The dopamine hypothesis is now thought to be simplistic  partly because newer antipsychotic medication  atypical antipsychotic medication  can be just as effective as older medication  typical antipsychotic medication   but also affects serotonin function and may have slightly less of a dopamine blocking effect  58  Interest has also focused on the neurotransmitter glutamate and the reduced function of the NMDA glutamate receptor in schizophrenia  largely because of the abnormally low levels of glutamate receptors found in the postmortem brains of those diagnosed with schizophrenia  59  and the discovery that glutamate blocking drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine can mimic the symptoms and cognitive problems associated with the condition  60  Reduced glutamate function is linked to poor performance on tests requiring frontal lobe and hippocampal function  and glutamate can affect dopamine function  both of which have been implicated in schizophrenia  have suggested an important mediating  and possibly causal  role of glutamate pathways in the condition  61  But positive symptoms fail to respond to glutamatergic medication  62  Diagnosis Main article  Diagnosis of schizophrenia John Nash  a U S  mathematician and joint winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize for Economics  suffered from schizophrenia  His life has been the subject of the 2001 Academy Award winning film A Beautiful Mind  Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the American Psychiatric Association s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  version DSM IV TR  or the World Health Organization s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems  the ICD 10  2  These criteria use the self reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior  followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional  Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity before a diagnosis is made  3  As of 2009 there is no objective test  2  Criteria The ICD 10 criteria are typically used in European countries  while the DSM IV TR criteria are used in the United States and the rest of the world  and are prevailing in research studies  The ICD 10 criteria put more emphasis on Schneiderian first rank symptoms  In practice  agreement between the two systems is high  63  According to the revised fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  DSM IV TR   to be diagnosed with schizophrenia  three diagnostic criteria must be met  64  Characteristic symptoms  Two or more of the following  each present for much of the time during a one month period  or less  if symptoms remitted with treatment   Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech  which is a manifestation of formal thought disorder Grossly disorganized behavior  e g  dressing inappropriately  crying frequently  or catatonic behavior Negative symptoms  Blunted affect  lack or decline in emotional response   alogia  lack or decline in speech   or avolition  lack or decline in motivation  If the delusions are judged to be bizarre  or hallucinations consist of hearing one voice participating in a running commentary of the patient s actions or of hearing two or more voices conversing with each other  only that symptom is required above  The speech disorganization criterion is only met if it is severe enough to substantially impair communication  Social or occupational dysfunction  For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance  one or more major areas of functioning such as work  interpersonal relations  or self care  are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset  Significant duration  Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least six months  This six month period must include at least one month of symptoms  or less  if symptoms remitted with treatment   If signs of disturbance are present for more than a month but less than six months  the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied  64  Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder  and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified  Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present  although schizoaffective disorder could be diagnosed   or if symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present  or if the symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance  such as abuse of a drug or medication  Subtypes The DSM IV TR contains five sub classifications of schizophrenia  although the developers of DSM 5 are recommending they be dropped from the new classification  65  66  Paranoid type  Delusions or auditory hallucinations are present  but thought disorder  disorganized behavior  or affective flattening are not  Delusions are persecutory and or grandiose  but in addition to these  other themes such as jealousy  religiosity  or somatization may also be present   DSM code 295 3 ICD code F20 0  Disorganized type  Named hebephrenic schizophrenia in the ICD  Where thought disorder and flat affect are present together   DSM code 295 1 ICD code F20 1  Catatonic type  The subject may be almost immobile or exhibit agitated  purposeless movement  Symptoms can include catatonic stupor and waxy flexibility   DSM code 295 2 ICD code F20 2  Undifferentiated type  Psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid  disorganized  or catatonic types have not been met   DSM code 295 9 ICD code F20 3  Residual type  Where positive symptoms are present at a low intensity only   DSM code 295 6 ICD code F20 5  The ICD 10 defines two additional subtypes  66  Post schizophrenic depression  A depressive episode arising in the aftermath of a schizophrenic illness where some low level schizophrenic symptoms may still be present   ICD code F20 4  Simple schizophrenia  Insidious and progressive development of prominent negative symptoms with no history of psychotic episodes   ICD code F20 6  Differential See also  Dual diagnosis Psychotic symptoms may be present in several other mental disorders  including bipolar disorder  67 borderline personality disorder  68  drug intoxication and drug induced psychosis  Delusions   non bizarre   are also present in delusional disorder  and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder  avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder  Schizophrenia is comorbid with obsessive compulsive disorder  OCD  considerably more often than could be explained by pure chance  although it can be difficult to distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia  69  A more general medical and neurological examination may be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia like symptoms  64  such as metabolic disturbance  systemic infection  syphilis  HIV infection  epilepsy  and brain lesions  It may be necessary to rule out a delirium  which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations  acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness  and indicates an underlying medical illness  Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication  Prevention Currently the evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent schizophrenia is inconclusive  70  While there is some evidence that early intervention in those with a psychotic episode may improve short term outcomes  there is little benefit from these measures after five years  2  Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the prodrome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended  71  Prevention is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disease  72  However  some cases of schizophrenia could be delayed or possibly prevented by discouraging cannabis use  particularly among youths  73  Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia may be more vulnerable to cannabis induced psychosis  38  And  one study found that cannabis induced psychotic disorders are followed by development of persistent psychotic conditions in approximately half of the cases  74  Theoretical research continues into strategies that might lower the incidence of schizophrenia  One approach seeks to understand what happens on a genetic and neurological level to account for the illness  so that biomedical interventions can be developed  However  multiple and varied genetic effects each of small size  interacting with the environment  makes this difficult  Alternatively  public health strategies could selectively address socioeconomic factors that have been linked to higher rates of schizophrenia in certain groups  for example in relation to immigration  ethnicity or poverty  Population wide strategies could promote services to ensure safe pregnancies and healthy growth  including in areas of psychological development such as social cognition  However  there is not enough evidence to implement such ideas at the current time  and a number of the broader issues are not specific to schizophrenia  75  76  Management Main article  Management of schizophrenia The primary treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications  often in combination with psychological and social supports  2  Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or  if mental health legislation allows it  involuntarily  Long term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s  although still occurs  4  Community support services including drop in centers  visits by members of a community mental health team  supported employment 77  and support groups are common  Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has a positive effect on the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia  78  Medication Risperidone  trade name Risperdal  is a common atypical antipsychotic medication  The first line psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication  79  which can reduce the positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 14 days  Antipsychotics  however  fail to significantly ameliorate the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction  22  80  The choice of which antipsychotic to use is based on benefits  risks  and costs  2  It is debatable whether  as a class  typical or atypical antipsychotics are better  81  Both have equal drop out and symptom relapse rates when typicals are used at low to moderate dosages  82  There is a good response in 40 50   a partial response in 30 40   and treatment resistance  failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily after six weeks to two or three different antipsychotics  in 20  of people  22 Clozapine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs  but it has the potentially serious side effect of agranulocytosis  lowered white blood cell count  in 1 4   2  3  83  With respect to side effects typical antipsychotics are associated with a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects while atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain  diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome  82  While atypicals have fewer extrapyramidal side effects these differences are modest  84  Some atypicals such as quetiapine and risperidone are associated with a higher risk of death compared to the typical antipsychotic perphenazine  while clozapine is associated with the lowest risk of death  85  It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome  a rare but serious neurological disorder  86  For people who are unwilling or unable to take medication regularly  long acting depot preparations of antipsychotics may be used to achieve control  87  When used in combination with psychosocial interventions they may improve long term adherence to treatment  87  Psychosocial A number of psychosocial interventions may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia including  family therapy  88 assertive community treatment  supported employment  cognitive remediation  89  skills training  cognitive behavioral therapy  CBT   token economic interventions  and psychosocial interventions for substance use and weight management  90  Family therapy or education  which addresses the whole family system of an individual  may reduce relapses and hospitalizations  88  The evidence for CBT s effectiveness in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal  91  92  Art or drama therapy have not been well researched  93  94  Prognosis Main article  Prognosis of schizophrenia Schizophrenia has great human and economic costs  2  It results in a decreased life expectancy of 12 15 years  primarily because of its association with obesity  sedentary lifestyles  and smoking  with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role  2  These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s  95  and between the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century did not change substantially in a health system with open access to care  Finland   85  Schizophrenia is a major cause of disability  with active psychosis ranked as the third most disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness  96  Approximately three fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses  22  Some people do recover completely and others function well in society  97  Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support  2  In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long term outcome occurs in 42   an intermediate outcome in 35  and a poor outcome in 27   98  Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world  99  These conclusions  however  have been questioned  100  101  There is a higher than average suicide rate associated with schizophrenia  This has been cited at 10   but a more recent analysis of studies and statistics revises the estimate to 4 9   most often occurring in the period following onset or first hospital admission  102  Several times more  20 to 40   attempt suicide at least once  103  104  There are a variety of risk factors  including male gender  depression  and a high intelligence quotient  103  Schizophrenia and smoking have shown a strong association in studies world wide  105  106  Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia  with estimates ranging from 80  to 90  being regular smokers  as compared to 20  of the general population  106  Those who smoke tend to smoke heavily  and additionally smoke cigarettes with high nicotine content  104  Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning  107  Epidemiology Disability adjusted life year for schizophrenia per 100 000 inhabitants in 2004    no data     185   185 197   197 207   207 218   218 229   229 240   240 251   251 262   262 273   273 284   284 295     295 Main article  Epidemiology of schizophrenia Schizophrenia affects around 0 3 0 7  of people at some point in their life  2  or 24 million people worldwide as of 2011  108  It occurs 1 4 times more frequently in males than females and typically appears earlier in men 3  the peak ages of onset are 20 28 years for males and 26 32 years for females  109 Onset in childhood is much rarer  110  as is onset in middle  or old age  111  Despite the received wisdom that schizophrenia occurs at similar rates worldwide  its prevalence varies across the world  112  within countries  113  and at the local and neighborhood level  114  It causes approximately 1  of worldwide disability adjusted life years  3  The rate of schizophrenia varies up to threefold depending on how it is defined  2  History Main article  History of schizophrenia Accounts of a schizophrenia like syndrome are thought to be rare in the historical record before the 19th century  although reports of irrational  unintelligible  or uncontrolled behavior were common  A detailed case report in 1797 concerning James Tilly Matthews  and accounts by Phillipe Pinel published in 1809  are often regarded as the earliest cases of the illness in the medical and psychiatric literature  115  Schizophrenia was first described as a distinct syndrome affecting teenagers and young adults by B n dict Morel in 1853  termed d mence pr coce  literally  early dementia    The term dementia praecox was used in 1891 by Arnold Pick in a case report of a psychotic disorder  In 1893 Emil Kraepelin introduced a broad new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia praecox and mood disorder  termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression   Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was primarily a disease of the brain  116  and particularly a form of dementia  distinguished from other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer s disease which typically occur later in life  117  Molecule of chlorpromazine  trade name Thorazine   which revolutionized treatment of schizophrenia in the 1950s The word schizophrenia which translates roughly as  splitting of the mind  and comes from the Greek roots schizein            to split   and phr n  phren                 mind   118  was coined by Eugen Bleuler in 1908 and was intended to describe the separation of function between personality  thinking  memory  and perception  Bleuler described the main symptoms as 4 A s  flattened Affect  Autism  impaired Association of ideas and Ambivalence  119  Bleuler realized that the illness was not a dementia  as some of his patients improved rather than deteriorated  and thus proposed the term schizophrenia instead  Treatment was revolutionized in the mid 1950s with the development and introduction of chlorpromazine  120  In the early 1970s  the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia was the subject of a number of controversies which eventually led to the operational criteria used today  It became clear after the 1971 US UK Diagnostic Study that schizophrenia was diagnosed to a far greater extent in America than in Europe  121  This was partly due to looser diagnostic criteria in the US  which used the DSM II manual  contrasting with Europe and its ICD 9  David Rosenhan s 1972 study  published in the journal Science under the title  On being sane in insane places   concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the US was often subjective and unreliable  122  These were some of the factors leading to the revision not only of the diagnosis of schizophrenia  but the revision of the whole DSM manual  resulting in the publication of the DSM III in 1980  123  The term schizophrenia is commonly misunderstood to mean that affected persons have a  split personality   Although some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may hear voices and may experience the voices as distinct personalities  schizophrenia does not involve a person changing among distinct multiple personalities  The confusion arises in part due to the literal interpretation of Bleuler s term schizophrenia  Bleuler originally associated Schizophrenia with dissociation and included split personality in his category of Schizophrenia 124  125    Dissociative identity disorder  having a  split personality   was also often misdiagnosed as Schizophrenia based on the loose criteria in the DSM II  126  127   The first known misuse of the term to mean  split personality  was in an article by the poet T  S  Eliot in 1933  128  Society and culture The term schizophrenia was coined by Eugen Bleuler  In 2002 the term for schizophrenia in Japan was changed from Seishin Bunretsu By         mind split disease  to T g  shitch  sh         integration disorder  to reduce stigma  129  The new name was inspired by the biopsychosocial model  it increased the percentage of patients who were informed of the diagnosis from 37  to 70  over three years  130  In the United States  the cost of schizophrenia including direct costs  outpatient  inpatient  drugs  and long term care  and non health care costs  law enforcement  reduced workplace productivity  and unemployment  was estimated to be  62 7 billion in 2002  131  The book and film A Beautiful Mind chronicles the life of John Forbes Nash  a Nobel Prize winning mathematician who was diagnosed with schizophrenia  Social stigma has been identified as a major obstacle in the recovery of patients with schizophrenia  132  Violence Individuals with severe mental illness including schizophrenia are at a significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non violent crime  133  On the other hand  schizophrenia has sometimes been associated with a higher rate of violent acts  although this is primarily due to higher rates of drug use  134  Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse  and parallel the overall rate in a region  135  What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial  but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors  136  Media coverage relating to schizophrenia tends to revolve around rare but unusual acts of violence  Furthermore  in a large  representative sample from a 1999 study  12 8  of Americans believed that individuals with schizophrenia were  very likely  to do something violent against others  and 48 1  said that they were  somewhat likely  to  Over 74  said that people with schizophrenia were either  not very able  or  not able at all  to make decisions concerning their treatment  and 70 2  said the same of money
