External links 9 1 Other  edit  Mission  Vision  and Functions  edit  Mission According to the National Security Act of 1947  61 Stat  502   which created the USAF  In general the United States Air Force shall include aviation forces both combat and service not otherwise assigned  It shall be organized  trained  and equipped primarily for prompt and sustained offensive and defensive air operations  The Air Force shall be responsible for the preparation of the air forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war except as otherwise assigned and  in accordance with integrated joint mobilization plans  for the expansion of the peacetime components of the Air Force to meet the needs of war   8062 of Title 10 US Code defines the purpose of the USAF as  9  to preserve the peace and security  and provide for the defense  of the United States  the Territories  Commonwealths  and possessions  and any areas occupied by the United States  to support national policy  to implement national objectives  to overcome any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the United States  The stated mission of the USAF today is to  fly  fight  and win in air  space  and cyberspace   10   edit  Vision The United States Air Force will be a trusted and reliable joint partner with our sister services known for integrity in all of our activities  including supporting the joint mission first and foremost  We will provide compelling air  space  and cyber capabilities for use by the combatant commanders  We will excel as stewards of all Air Force resources in service to the American people  while providing precise and reliable Global Vigilance  Reach and Power for the nation   10   edit  Core Functions Recently the Air Force refined its understanding of the core duties and responsibilities it performs as a Military Service Branch  streamlining what previously were six distinctive capabilities and seventeen operational functions into twelve core functions to be used across the doctrine  organization  training  materiel  leadership and education  personnel  and facilities spectrum  These core functions express the ways in which the Air Force is particularly and appropriately suited to contribute to national security  but they do not necessarily express every aspect of what the Air Force contributes to the nation  It should be emphasized that the core functions  by themselves  are not doctrinal constructs  11   edit  Nuclear Deterrence Operations The purpose of Nuclear Deterrence Operations  NDO  is to operate  maintain  and secure nuclear forces to achieve an assured capability to deter an adversary from taking action against vital US interests  In the event deterrence fails  the US should be able to appropriately respond with nuclear options  The sub elements of this function are  11  Assure Dissuade Deter is a mission set derived from the Air Force s readiness to carry out the nuclear strike operations mission as well as from specific actions taken to assure allies as a part of extended deterrence  Dissuading others from acquiring or proliferating WMD  and the means to deliver them  contributes to promoting security and is also an integral part of this mission  Moreover  different deterrence strategies are required to deter various adversaries  whether they are a nation state  or non state transnational actor  The Air Force maintains and presents credible deterrent capabilities through successful visible demonstrations and exercises which assure allies  dissuade proliferation  deter potential adversaries from actions that threaten US national security or the populations and deployed military forces of the US  its allies and friends  11  Nuclear strike is the ability of nuclear forces to rapidly and accurately strike targets which the enemy holds dear in a devastating manner  If a crisis occurs  rapid generation and  if necessary  deployment of nuclear strike capabilities will demonstrate US resolve and may prompt an adversary to alter the course of action deemed threatening to our national interest  Should deterrence fail  the President may authorize a precise  tailored response to terminate the conflict at the lowest possible level and lead to a rapid cessation of hostilities  Post conflict  regeneration of a credible nuclear deterrent capability will deter further aggression  The Air Force may present a credible force posture in either the continental US  within a theater of operations  or both to effectively deter the range of potential adversaries envisioned in the 21st century  This requires the ability to engage targets globally using a variety of methods  therefore  the Air Force should possess the ability to induct  train  assign  educate and exercise individuals and units to rapidly and effectively execute missions that support US NDO objectives  Finally  the Air Force regularly exercises and evaluates all aspects of nuclear operations to ensure high levels of performance  11  Nuclear surety ensures the safety  security and effectiveness of nuclear operations  Because of their political and military importance  destructive power  and the potential consequences of an accident or unauthorized act  nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems require special consideration and protection against risks and threats inherent in their peacetime and wartime environments  The Air Force  in conjunction with other entities within the Departments of Defense or Energy  achieves a high standard of protection through a stringent nuclear surety program  This program applies to materiel  personnel  and procedures that contribute to the safety  security  and control of nuclear weapons  thus assuring no nuclear accidents  incidents  loss  or unauthorized or accidental use  The Air Force continues to pursue safe  secure and effective nuclear weapons consistent with operational requirements  Adversaries  allies  and the American people must be highly confident of the Air Force s ability to secure nuclear weapons from accidents  theft  loss  and accidental or unauthorized use  This day to day commitment to precise and reliable nuclear operations is the cornerstone of the credibility of the NDO mission  Positive nuclear command  control  communications  effective nuclear weapons security  and robust combat support are essential to the overall NDO function  11   edit  Air Superiority Air Superiority is  that degree of dominance in the air battle of one force over another which permits

succession of changes of organization  titles  and missions advanced toward eventual separation 40 years later  The Air Force came of age in World War II  Almost 68 000 U S airmen died helping to win the war  only the infantry suffered more enlisted casualties  12  In practice  the USAAF was virtually independent of the Army during World War II  but officials wanted formal independence  The USAF became a separate military service on 18 September 1947  with the implementation of the National Security Act of 1947  13  The Act created the National Military Establishment  renamed Department of Defense in 1949   which was composed of three subordinate Military Departments  namely the Department of the Army  the Department of the Navy and a newly created Department of the Air Force  14  Prior

shifted to include a deployment phase  This deployment phase  now called the BEAST  places the trainees in a surreal environment that they may experience once they deploy  While the trainees do tackle the massive obstacle courses along with the BEAST  the other portions include defending and protecting their base of operations  forming a structure of leadership  directing search and recovery  and basic self aid buddy care  During this event  the Military Training Instructors  MTI  act as mentors and enemy forces in a deployment exercise  citation needed  In 2007  the USAF undertook a reduction in force  Because of budget constraints  the USAF planned to reduce the service s size from 360 000 active duty personnel to 316 000  15  The size of the active duty force in 2007 was roughly 64  of that of the USAF at the end of the Gulf War in 1991  16  However  the reduction was ended at approximately 330 000 personnel in 2008 to meet mission requirements  15  These same constraints have seen a sharp reduction in flight hours for crew training since 2005 17  and the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower and Personnel directing Airmen s Time Assessments  18  On 5 June 2008  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates  accepted the resignations of both the Secretary of the Air Force  Michael Wynne  and the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force  Gen  T  Michael Moseley  Gates in effect fired both men for  systemic issues associated with declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance   This followed an investigation into two embarrassing incidents involving mishandling of nuclear weapons  and were also the culmination of disputes between the Air Force leadership and Gates  19  To put more emphasis on nuclear assets  the USAF established the nuclear focused Air Force Global Strike Command on 24 October 2008  20  On 26 June 2009  the USAF released a force structure plan that cuts fighter aircraft and shifts resources to better support nuclear  irregular and

future are to be unmanned  23  In recent years the USAF has fumbled several high profile aircraft procurement projects  such as the failure to make the case for the Next Generation Bomber  the failure to control costs on the Lockheed Martin F 22 Raptor and the decade of failures on the KC X program  Winslow Wheeler has written that this pattern represents  failures of intellect and   much more

anywhere from one to four stars  one to five stars in war time   citation needed   edit  Commissioned officers Main article  United States Air Force officer rank insignia The commissioned officer ranks of the USAF are divided into three sections  company grade  field grade  and general officers  Company grade officers are those officers in pay grades O 1 to O 3  while field grade officers are those in pay grades O 4 to O 6  and general officers are those in pay grades of O 7 and above  Currently  promotion from Second Lieutenant to First Lieutenant is virtually guaranteed after two years of satisfactory service  The promotion from First Lieutenant to Captain is competitive after successfully completing another two years of service  Promotion to Major and above is through a board process  An officer s record is reviewed by a selection board at the Air Force Personnel Center at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio  Texas  This process occurs approximately between the seven  and ten year mark  where a certain percentage of Captains will be selected for Major  This process will repeat at the 11 14 year mark for promotion to Lieutenant Colonel  and then around the 18 20 year mark for promotion to Colonel  The Air Force has the largest ratio of general officers to total strength of all of the armed forces and this ratio has increased as the force has shrunk from its

Secretary of the Air Force to appoint warrant officers  the Air Force does not currently use warrant officer grades  and is the only one of the U S  Armed Services not to do so  The Air Force inherited warrant officer ranks from the Army at its inception in 1947  but their place in the Air Force structure was never made clear  citation needed  When the Congress authorized the creation of two new senior enlisted ranks in 1958  Air Force officials privately concluded that these two new  super grades  could fill all Air Force needs then performed at the warrant officer level  although

Force USAF personnel wear uniforms that are distinct from those of the other branches of the United States Armed Forces  The first USAF dress uniform  in 1947  was dubbed and patented  Uxbridge Blue  after  Uxbridge 1683 Blue   developed at the former Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company  38  The current Service Dress Uniform  which was adopted in 1993 and standardized in 1995  consists of a three button  pocketless coat  similar to that of a men s  sport jacket   with silver  U S   pins on the lapels  with a silver ring surrounding on those of enlisted members   matching trousers  and either a service cap or flight cap  all in Shade 1620   Air Force Blue   a darker purplish blue   This is worn with a light blue shirt  Shade 1550  and Shade 1620 herringbone patterned necktie  Enlisted members wear sleeve insignia on both the jacket and shirt  while officers wear metal rank insignia pinned onto the coat  and Air Force Blue slide on epaulet loops on the shirt  USAF personnel assigned to Base Honor Guard duties wear  for certain occasions  a modified version of the standard service dress uniform  but with silver trim on the sleeves and trousers  with the addition of a ceremonial belt  if necessary   wheel cap with silver trim and Hap Arnold Device  and a silver aiguillette placed on the left shoulder seam and all devices and accoutrement  Following a three year phase in period in which it gradually gained popularity through broader distribution  the Airman Battle Uniform  ABU  became the sole authorized utility uniform  except the flight suit for air  missile and space crews  of the USAF on 1 November 2011  The ABU replaced the Battle Dress Uniform  BDU  previously worn by all U S  military forces and mirrors similar replacements by the U S  Army  Navy  and Marine Corps with utility uniforms suitable for each service s particular operations  Improvements in the ABU over the BDU included more specific sizing for superior fit and a no wrinkle material that makes ironing unnecessary  use of starch  ubiquitous in the Air Force during the BDU era  citation needed  is forbidden with the ABU  These relatively popular citation needed  enhancements have been offset by certain less favorable choices  including complaints that the placement of ABU pockets makes them nearly useless while wearing body armor and the decision to make a  one weight  uniform allegedly usable in summer and winter that airmen have consistently reported is inadequate for use in the extreme temperatures of the Middle East  Among critics of the uniform design process  these observations have fueled claims that the ABU was designed more for  parade fashion  than for any functional use as a true  battle uniform   That the Air Force subsequently developed a lightweight  summer  version of the ABU blouse for use in hot environments lends some credibility to these claims  though airmen continue to deploy with and wear the ABU in locations around the world  citation

are used by the USAF to indicate a job assignment or qualification level for a given assignment  Badges can also be used as merit based or service based awards  Over time  various badges have been discontinued and are no longer distributed  Authorized badges include the Shields of USAF Fire Protection  and Security Forces  and the Missile Badge  or  pocket rocket    which is earned after working in a missile system maintenance or operations capacity for at least one year   edit  Training Main article  United States Air Force Basic Military Training All non prior service enlisted Airmen attend Basic Military Training  BMT  at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio  Texas  The Air Force accepts the basic training programs of other U S  military branches in lieu of BMT for airmen who enlist having completed prior service in the U S  Army  Navy  or Marine Corps  Officers may be commissioned upon graduation from the United States Air Force Academy  upon graduation from another college or university through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps  AFROTC  program  or through the Air Force Officer Training School  OTS   OTS  which is based at Maxwell Air Force Base  in turn encompasses two separate commissioning programs  Basic Officer Training  BOT   which is for line officer candidates of the active duty Air Force and the U S  Air Force Reserve  and the Academy of Military Science  AMS   which is for line officer candidates of the Air National Guard   The term  line officer  derives from the concept of the line of battle and refers to an officer whose role falls somewhere within the  Line of the Air   meaning combat or combat support operations within the scope of legitimate combatants as defined by the Geneva Conventions   The Air Force also provides Commissioned Officer Training  COT  for officers of all three components who are direct commissioned to non line positions due to their credentials in medicine  law  religion  biological sciences  or healthcare administration  Originally viewed as a  knife and fork school  that covered little beyond basic wear of the uniform  COT in recent years has been fully integrated into the OTS

training at Lackland AFB Main article  United States Air Force Fitness Test The US Air Force Fitness Test  AFFT  is designed to test the abdominal circumference  muscular strength endurance and cardiovascular respiratory fitness of airmen in the USAF  As part of the Fit to Fight program  the USAF adopted a more stringent physical fitness assessment  the new fitness program was put into effect on 1 June 2010  The annual ergo cycle test which the USAF had used for several years had been replaced in 2004  In the AFFT  Airmen are given a score based on performance consisting of four components  waist circumference  the sit up  the push up  and a 1 5 mile  2 4 km  run  Airmen can potentially earn a score of 100  with the run counting as 60   waist circumference as 20   and both strength test counting as 10  each  A passing score is 75 points  Effective 1 July 2010  the AFFT will be administered by the base Fitness Assessment Cell  FAC   and will be required twice a year  Personnel may test once a year if he or she earns a score above a 90   Additionally  only meeting the minimum standards on each one of these test will not get you a passing score of 75   and failing any one component will result in a failure for the entire test   edit  Aircraft inventory Main article  List of active United States military aircraft The US Air Force has over 5 778 aircraft

on the ground and are often deployed as close air support for  and in proximity to  U S  ground forces  The proximity to friendly forces require precision strikes from these aircraft that are not possible with bomber aircraft listed below  They are typically deployed as close air support to ground forces  their role is tactical rather than strategic  operating at the front of the battle rather

supersonic strategic bomber  In the US Air Force  the distinction between bombers  fighter bombers  and attack aircraft has become blurred  Many attack aircraft  even ones that look like fighters  are optimized to drop bombs  with very little ability to engage in aerial combat  Many fighter aircraft  such as the F 16  are often used as  bomb trucks   despite being designed for aerial combat  Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range  a bomber is generally a long range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory  whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to  theater  missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat  Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling  which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations  The US is the only country  besides Russia  that operates strategic bombers  The B 52 Stratofortress airframe is over 50 years old  and are scheduled to remain in service for another 30 years  which would keep the airframe in service for nearly 90 years  an unprecedented length of service for any aircraft  Plans for successors to the current strategic bomber force remain only paper projects  and political and funding pressures suggest that they are likely to remain paper bound for the foreseeable future  B 1B Lancer   98 B 2A

the aircraft providing the fuel is specially designed for the task  although refueling pods can be fitted to existing aircraft designs if the  probe and drogue  system is to be used  There is no known regular civilian in flight refueling activity  In large scale operations  and even daily air operations   air to air refueling is extensively used  fighters  bombers  and cargo aircraft rely heavily on the lesser known  tanker  aircraft  This makes these aircraft an essential part of the Air Force s global mobility and the U S  force projection  KC 10A Extender KC 135E R T Stratotanker  edit  M

pilots of various aircraft types have driven its priorities over the years  At first there was a focus on bombers  driven originally by the Bomber mafia   followed by a focus on fighters  Fighter Mafia and following   42  In response to the 2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons incident  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates accepted in June 2009 the resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force General T  Michael Moseley  Moseley s successor  General Norton A  Schwartz  was the first officer appointed to that position who did not have a background as a fighter or bomber pilot  43  The Washington Post reported that General Schwartz has begun to dismantle the rigid class system of the USAF  44  Daniel L  Magruder  Jr defines USAF culture as a combination of the rigorous application of advanced technology  individualism and progressive airpower theory  45  Major General Charles J  Dunlap  Jr  adds that Air Force culture includes an egalitarianism bred from officers as warriors who work with small groups of enlisted airmen either as the service crew or onboard crew of their aircraft  46   edit  Slogans and creeds The United States Air Force has had numerous recruiting slogans including  No One Comes Close  and  Uno Ab Alto   For many years  the U S  Air Force used  Aim High  as its recruiting slogan  more recently  they have used  Cross into the Blue    We ve been waiting for you  and  Do Something Amazing   47   Above All   48  and the newest one  as of 7 October 2010  considered a call and response   Aim high  followed with the response   Fly Fight Win  49  Each wing  group  or squadron usually has its own slogan s   Information and logos can usually be found on the wing  group  or squadron websites  50  The Air Force Core Values are   Integrity first    Service before self    Excellence in all we do   51 The Airman s Creed is a statement introduced in the spring of 2007 to summarize the culture of the Air Force  To help further knowledge of their mission and functions  the Air Force has also produced videos  such as  Setting the Conditions for Victory  and  How We Fight   52  to outline the Air Force role in the war on terrorism and how the service succeeds in its domains of air  space  and cyberspace  The Above All campaign continues to support the message of  air  space and cyberspace
