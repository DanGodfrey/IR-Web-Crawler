Territorial evolution of the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search See also  Territorial changes of the United States This is a list of the evolution of the borders of the United States  This lists each change to the internal and external borders of the country  as well as status and name changes  It also shows the surrounding areas that eventually became part of the United States  Each stage has a map  to show what the specific makeup of the country was at any given time  After achieving independence with the Treaty of Paris  the United States expanded westward  enlarging its borders seven times  with two major border adjustments  one each with colonies of the United Kingdom and Spain  and several small disputes  The original thirteen states grew into fifty states  most of which began as incorporated territories  The general pattern seen in this is of territorial expansion  carving of organized territories from the newly acquired land  modification of the borders of these territories  and eventual statehood  Only two states  Nevada and Missouri  grew appreciably after statehood  and five  Georgia  Massachusetts  North Carolina  Texas  and Virginia  lost land  in each case to form new states  Contents 1 Notes 2 18th century 3 1800s 4 1810s 5 1820s 6 1830s 7 1840s 8 1850s 9 1860s 10 1870s 11 1880s 12 1890s 13 20th century 14

between unincorporated and incorporated territories is that incorporated territories are considered to forever be under the jurisdiction of the United States Constitution  whereas it is possible for unincorporated territories to become independent  These are  Nations under Compacts of Free Association  Marshall Islands  Federated States of Micronesia  Palau  Unincorporated  organized territories  Guam  United States Virgin Islands  Commonwealths  another form of unincorporated and organized territory  Northern Mariana Islands  Puerto Rico  This is different from the term commonwealth used by some states   American Samoa is unorganized  but has a constitution and self government  making it functionally very similar to an organized territory  The United States Minor Outlying Islands  which are uninhabited  unorganized  and except for Palmyra Atoll  unincorporated  The former unincorporated territories of the Line Islands  Panama Canal Zone  the Commonwealth of the Philippines  and the Phoenix Islands  The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands  a United Nations trusteeship granted to the United States following World War II  It has since dissolved  becoming the Marshall Islands  Federated States of Micronesia  the Northern Mariana Islands  and Palau  Various other unincorporated territories whose claims under the Guano Island Act have been abrogated by the United States Government   Unorganized territory  is not a name  it simply means Congress has not passed an organic act for the territory  In most situations  the purpose of unorganized territory was to act as land for Native American settlement  Later  the last unorganized territory in the country was indeed referred to as  Indian Territory   though this is not an official name  The last territories acquired by the United States  Alaska  Hawaii  and the Mexican Cession  began unorganized  but not as land set aside for Native Americans  but simply because they had not been organized yet  Palmyra Atoll is the only remaining unorganized incorporated U S  territory  Dotted lines on the borders mean that region is part of a country not fully shown on the map  since it s confined to the present day borders of the United States  An exception is Oregon Country  which was shared land which extended beyond the area of the map  Some territorial disputes and borders from early in the United States  history are unclear  For example  the border between West Florida and East Florida seems unclear  For the purposes of simplicity  this article uses the original border  the Apalachicola River  even though later maps tended to move it west to the Perdido River  This is partly because the Organic Act for Florida specified that it included parts of both West and East Florida  if the border were the Perdido River  then Florida Territory would not have included any of West Florida  it having already been divided among Louisiana  Mississippi  and Alabama  1  Several very small changes are included in the list but not included in the maps  The switch of two extra counties from Virginia to West Virginia at the end of the American Civil War  The Alaska Boundary Dispute  since it arose from a total lack of surveying  rather than a dispute over the surveyed lines  it would also appear quite small on the map  When the Dakota Territory was created  it also included land south of 43  N and north of the Keya Paha and Niobrara rivers  This was transferred to the state of Nebraska on March 28  1882  2  The two small adjustments to Indiana Territory  Various disputes along the Rio Grande with Mexico  Ratification of the Constitution  Confederacy formation and reconstruction are simplified to make the map simpler   edit  18th century March 4  1789 The United States Constitution came into effect  forming the new nation  Note that the states ratified at different times  but to simplify the map  the final result is shown here  The United States achieved independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Treaty of Paris on September 3  1783  which established that the thirteen colonies were sovereign and independent states  The borders were established by Article 2 of the treaty  but with a couple of issues  First  it stated that the border would run west from the Lake of the Woods to the Mississippi River   at the time  it was not known that the headwaters of the Mississippi lay south of such a line  so the border has since been taken to run south from the lake to the river  3  Some peculiarities to point out to those familiar only with the current borders  Many states had sea to sea grants from the British crown that they would not give up easily  so prior to this date  they ceded this land to the federal government in exchange for their Revolutionary War debts  However  Georgia did not do so until much later  and Connecticut ceded most land but kept its Western Reserve  Virginia ceded its claim to the territory north and west of the Ohio River  and this land became unorganized territory  North Carolina also ceded its claim to its western counties  but this was not officially accepted by Congress until 1790  New York ceded its claim on the Erie Triangle to the federal government  At this point in history  all of the states except for Georgia and Virginia were at their present day borders  except for some of the minor issues mentioned above  West Florida claimed a border further north than what the United States said it had  Its border had been 31  north when Spain ceded it to the United Kingdom  The British later moved its border north to 32 38  latitude  but when Spanish Florida was ceded back to Spain in the Treaty of Paris  the British cited the original border at the 31st parallel north  but Spain continued to claim the higher border  4  Also  the borders at the northern area of the Maine District of Massachusetts and the area northwest of Lake Superior remained disputed  The Wedge  disputed since the 17th century  remained a point of contention between Delaware and Pennsylvania  The Vermont Republic was a complex matter  with areas being claimed by New York and New Hampshire  but it existed as a de facto unrecognized independent state  August 7  1789 The United States Congress affirmed the organization of the Territory North West of the Ohio River  or Northwest Territory  under the terms of the Northwest Ordinance  5  Northwest Territory consisted of present day Illinois  Indiana  Michigan  northeastern Minnesota  most of Ohio  and Wisconsin  The Northwest Territory had previously been organized under the Articles of Confederation on July 13  1787  and was slightly modified under the new Constitution  April 2  1790 Congress accepts North Carolina s cession of its western counties  which had initially been ceded on December 22  1789  The land became unorganized territory  6  May 26  1790 The Southwest Ordinance organized the Territory South of the Ohio River  or Southwest Territory  which corresponded to present day Tennessee  7  March 4  1791 The Vermont Republic  which had portions claimed by New York and New Hampshire and  while unrecognized by the United States  was a de facto independent country  was admitted as the 14th state  Vermont  September 9  1791 The District of Columbia  the nation s federal district  was formed from land granted by Maryland and Virginia  the Virginia portion would be returned in 1847  8  March 3  1792 The federal government sold the Erie Triangle to Pennsylvania  9  June 1  1792 The western counties of Virginia beyond the Appalachian Mountains were split off and admitted as the 15th state  Kentucky  January 11  1794 In the third Nootka Convention Spain surrenders its exclusive claim to the entire Pacific Coast and acknowledges the right of Britain or other powers to use unoccupied territory  October 27  1795 Pinckney s Treaty  also known as the Treaty of San Lorenzo  signed on October 27  1795  and proclaimed on August 3  1796  settles the northern border of West Florida as the 31st parallel  10  June 1  1796 The Southwest Territory was admitted as the 16th state  Tennessee  April 7  1798 Due to the Yazoo Land Fraud  an act was signed by President John Adams  authorizing him to appoint commissioners to negotiate with Georgia about ceding its western land  The act created Mississippi Territory in the region ceded by West Florida  corresponding to roughly the southern third of present day Mississippi and Alabama except their panhandles  which were part of West Florida  11   edit  1800s July 4  1800 Indiana Territory was formed from the western portion of Northwest Territory  12  It corresponded to present day Illinois  Indiana  northeastern Minnesota  and Wisconsin  as well as the western half of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and all but the eastern tip of the Upper Peninsula  Northwest Territory was left with only most of Ohio and the rest of Michigan  July 10  1800 Connecticut ceded its Western Reserve to the federal government  which made it part of Northwest Territory  and is the northeastern part of present day Ohio  13  October 1  1800 The secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso transferred the colony of Louisiana from Spain to France  Its boundaries were not specified and control was not actually transferred until the Louisiana Purchase  14  April 26  1802 Georgia finally ceded its western claims  the Yazoo Lands  to the federal government  where it became unorganized land  15  March 1  1803 The southeastern portion of Northwest Territory was admitted as the 17th state  Ohio  The remainder of Northwest Territory was transferred to Indiana Territory  12  April 30  1803 The Louisiana Purchase was made  expanding the United States west of the Mississippi River  There was a dispute with West Florida over how much land east of the Mississippi River it included  16  West of the Mississippi  it was defined as the Mississippi Basin  whose extent was not known at the time and extends slightly north of the modern Canada US border  17  It consisted of the whole of present day Arkansas  Kansas  Iowa  Missouri  Nebraska  and Oklahoma  and portions of Colorado  Louisiana  Minnesota  Montana  New Mexico  North Dakota  South Dakota  Texas and Wyoming  It also included the southernmost portions of the present day Canadian provinces of Alberta  Manitoba  and Saskatchewan  March 27  1804 The unorganized land ceded by Georgia was added to Mississippi Territory  consisting of the whole of present day Mississippi and Alabama  minus their panhandles which were still part of West Florida  18  October 1  1804 The Louisiana Purchase was split into the District of Louisiana  which was temporarily under the authority of Indiana Territory  and the organized Territory of Orleans  which corresponded to part of present day Louisiana with a small portion of Texas  19  The western border of Orleans Territory caused further conflict with New Spain  specifically over the region between the Sabine River on the west and the Arroyo Hondo  River  on the east  which became known as the Sabine Free State  This land was later confirmed as U S  territory by the Adams On s Treaty of 1819  January 11  1805 Michigan Territory was split from Indiana Territory  including the whole of the lower peninsula of present day Michigan but only that eastern tip of the upper peninsula which was held by the Northwest Territory after Indiana Territory had been split from it  12  July 4  1805 The District of Louisiana was organized as Louisiana Territory  20  March 1  1809 Illinois Territory was split from Indiana Territory  Illinois Territory included present day Illinois  northeastern Minnesota  and Wisconsin  Indiana Territory included the present day borders of Indiana  with its western and eastern borders continuing northward  thus  it also included the central portion of the upper peninsula of Michigan  as well as Door Peninsula of present day Wisconsin  12   edit  1810s April 1810

claims to Texas to Spain  moved portions of present day Colorado  Oklahoma  and Wyoming  and all of New Mexico and Texas  to New Spain  and all of Spanish Florida to the United States  28  The new borders intruded on Arkansaw Territory s Miller County  created on April 1  1820  which dipped below the Red River and into land now ceded to Spain  However  the remoteness of the region caused no serious conflict with Spain  29  August 10  1821 The southeastern corner of Missouri Territory was admitted as the 24th state  Missouri  The remainder became unorganized  Missouri did not include its northwestern triangle at this point  that being added later in the Platte Purchase  30  September 16  1821 Ukase of 1821 attempts to forbid non Russian ships from approaching the Northwest Coast  Only

as already readmitted  To view a detailed animated map depicting the various state readmission during Reconstruction see CSA states evolution  May 5  1866 Nevada s eastern border was moved from the
