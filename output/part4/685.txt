includes the adjoining countries to the west and the east  Topographically  it is dominated by the Indian Plate  which rises above sea level as the Indian subcontinent south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush  South Asia is surrounded  clockwise  from west  by Western Asia  Central Asia  Eastern Asia  Southeastern Asia and the Indian Ocean  According to the United Nations geographical region classification  2  Southern Asia comprises the countries of Afghanistan  Bangladesh  Bhutan  India  Iran  Maldives  Nepal  Pakistan  and Sri Lanka  By other definitions and interpretations  see below   Burma and Tibet are also sometimes included in the region of South Asia  South Asia is home to well over one fifth of the world s population  making it both the most populous and most densely populated geographical region in the world  3  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation is an economic cooperation organization in the region  Contents 1 Definitions 1 1 Indian

Asia  Along with a number of core countries  South Asia differs in inclusion by different clubbing of countries  though essentially it mostly encompasses countries that were part of the former British Empire in the region  4  including the current territories of India  Pakistan  and Bangladesh at the core  but also including Sri Lanka  Burma and Sikkim  now a state of India   5  The Aden Colony  British Somaliland and Singapore  though administered at various times under the Raj have not been proposed as any part of South Asia  6  The Raj also encompassed the 562 protected princely states that were not directly ruled by the Raj  7  some of which joined the Union of India  including Hyderabad State  Kingdom of Mysore  Baroda  Gwalior and a part of the State of Jammu and Kashmir   while some joined the Dominion of Pakistan  including Bahawalpur  Kalat  Khayrpur  Swat and parts of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir    8  9 Sikkim joined India in 1975  10 One part of Jammu and Kashmir became a part of China  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation  SAARC   a contiguous block of countries  started in with seven countries   Bangladesh  Bhutan  India  the Maldives  Nepal  Pakistan and Sri Lanka   when it was established in 1985  but was extended to include Afghanistan as an eighth member in 2006  11  12  The World Bank grouping includes only the original seven members of SAARC  and leaves Afghanistan out  13  This bloc of countries include three independent countries that were not under the British rule   Nepal  Bhutan and Afghanistan  The South Asia Free Trade Agreement endorsed by SAARC has been signed by the seven original members of the organization  though it has a special provision for the Maldives  14  The United Nations Population Information Network  POPIN  includes Afghanistan  Bangladesh  Burma  India  Iran  Nepal  Pakistan and Sri Lanka as part of South Asia  while Maldives  in view of its characteristics  was admitted as a member country of the Pacific POPIN subregional network in principle  15  The British Indian Ocean Territory is connected to the region by a publication of Jane s for security considerations  16  The United Nations scheme of sub regions include all eight members of the SAARC as part of Southern Asia  along with Iran  17  while the Hirschmann Herfindahl Index of United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific for the region includes only the original seven signatories of SAARC  18  A lack of coherent definition for South Asia has resulted in not only a lack of academic studies  but also in a lack interest for such studies  19  Identification with a South Asian identity was also found to be significantly low among respondents in a two year survey across Bangladesh  India  Nepal  Pakistan  and Sri Lanka  20  See also  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and South Asian Economic Union  edit  Indian subcontinent Main article  Indian subcontinent The  Indian subcontinent  is a semantic term referring to the large  self contained landmass which covers most of South Asia  By dictionary entries  the term subcontinent signifies  having a certain geographical or political independence  from the rest of the continent  21  or  a vast and more or less self contained subdivision of a continent   22  The terms  Indian subcontinent  and  South Asia  are used interchangeably  23  24  25  26  27  Due to political sensitivities  some prefer to use the terms  South Asian Subcontinent   28  28  29  the  Indo Pak Subcontinent   30   the Subcontinent   or simply  South Asia  31  over the term  Indian subcontinent   According to historians Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal  Indian Subcontinent has come to be known as South Asia  in more recent and neutral parlance   31 Indologist Ronald B  Inden argues that the usage of the term  South Asia  is getting more widespread since it clearly distinguishes the region from East Asia  32  some academics hold that the term  South Asia  is in more common use in Europe and North America  rather than the terms  Subcontinent  or the  Indian Subcontinent   33  34  Like South Asia  the definition of the geographical extent of Indian subcontinent varies  Historically forming the whole territory of Greater India  now it generally comprises the countries of India  Pakistan  and Bangladesh  35  prior to 1947  the three nations were historically combined and constituted British India  It almost always also includes Nepal  Bhutan  and the island country of Sri Lanka 36  and may also include Afghanistan and the island country of Maldives  23  37  38  The region may also include the disputed territory of Aksai Chin  which was part of the British Indian princely state of Jammu and Kashmir  but is now administered as part of the Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang  39  A booklet published by the United States Department of State in 1959 includes Afghanistan  Ceylon  Sri Lanka   India  Nepal  and Pakistan  including East Pakistan  now Bangladesh  as part of the  Subcontinent of South Asia   40  When the term Indian subcontinent is used to mean South Asia  the islands countries of Sri Lanka and the Maldives may sometimes not be included  23  while Tibet and Nepal may be included 41  or excluded 42  intermittently  depending on the context   edit  Definition by South Asian Studies programs See also  Indology When the Centre of South Asian Studies at the University of Cambridge established in 1964  it was primarily responsible for promoting within the University the study of India  Pakistan  Sri Lanka  Bangladesh  the Himalayan Kingdoms  Nepal  Bhutan  and Sikkim 43    and Burma  now officially Myanmar   But  over the years it has also extended its activities to include Thailand  Malaysia  Singapore  Vietnam  Cambodia  Laos  Indonesia  the Philippines and Hong Kong  44  The Centers for South Asian Studies at both University of Michigan and University of Virginia include Tibet along with seven members of SAARC in their research programs  but leave the Maldives out  45  46  The South Asian Studies Program of Rutgers University and the University of California  Berkeley Center for South Asia Studies do the same without leaving out the Maldives  47  48  while the South Asian Studies Program of Brandeis University defines the region as comprising  India  Pakistan  Bangladesh  Sri Lanka  Nepal  Bhutan  and in certain contexts Afghanistan  Burma  Maldives and Tibet   49  The similar program of Columbia University also includes Tibet  but leaves out both Afghanistan and the Maldives  50   edit  Geography See also  Geography of India  Geography of Pakistan  Geography of Bangladesh  Geography of Bhutan  Geography of Sri Lanka  and Geography of Nepal

South Asia had never been a coherent geopolitical region  it has a distinct geographical identity  52  The boundaries of South Asia vary based on how the region is defined  South Asia s northern  eastern  and western boundaries vary based on definitions used  while the Indian Ocean is the southern periphery  Most of this region rests on the Indian Plate and is isolated from the rest of Asia by mountain barriers  53  54  The Indian Plate includes most of South Asia  forming a land mass which extends from the Himalayas into a portion of the basin under the Indian Ocean  including parts of South China and Eastern Indonesia  as well as Kuen Lun and Karakoram ranges   55  56  57  and extending up to but not including Ladakh  Kohistan  the Hindu Kush range and Balochistan  58  59  60  It may be noted that geophysically the Yarlung Tsangpo River river in Tibet is situated at the outside of the border of the Subcontinental structure  while the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan are situated inside that border  61  Much of the region comprises a peninsula in south central Asia  rather resembling a diamond which is delineated by the Himalayas on the north  the Hindu Kush in the west  and the Arakanese in the east  62  and which extends southward into the Indian Ocean with the Arabian Sea to the southwest and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast  23  35  Per the UN  the wider subregion s northern frontier is the Himalayas and southerly post Soviet states of Central Asia  Tajikistan  Uzbekistan  and Turkmenistan  bordering northern Afghanistan and Iran   its western boundary is the westerly border of Iran  with Azerbaijan  Armenia  Turkey  and Iraq   and its eastern boundary is the westerly border of Burma  with India and Bangladesh   Most of this region is a subcontinent resting on the Indian Plate  the northerly portion of the Indo Australian Plate  separated from the rest of the Eurasian Plate  It was once a small continent before colliding with the Eurasian Plate about 50 55 million years ago and giving birth to the Himalayan range and the Tibetan plateau  It is the peninsular region south of the Himalayas and Kuen Lun mountain ranges and east of the Indus River and the Iranian Plateau  extending southward into the Indian Ocean between the Arabian Sea  to the southwest  and the Bay of Bengal  to the southeast   The region is home to an astounding variety of geographical features  such as glaciers  rainforests  valleys  deserts  and grasslands that are typical of much larger continents  It is surrounded by three water bodies   the Bay of Bengal  the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea  The climate of this vast region varies considerably from area to area from tropical monsoon in the south to temperate in the north  The variety is influenced by not only the altitude  but also by factors such as proximity to the sea coast and the seasonal impact of the monsoons  Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon period s   The northern belt of Indo Gangetic plains also is hot in summer  but cooler in winter  The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalyan ranges  As the Himalayas block the north Asian bitter cold winds  the temperatures are considerably moderate in the plains down below  For most part  the climate of the region is called the Monsoon climate  which keeps the region humid during summer and dry during winter  and favors the cultivation of jute  tea  rice  and various vegetables in this region   edit  History Further information  History of South Asia Map of South Asia illustrating stability and historical permanency of the regional cultural frontiers and areas  The remote pre history of South Asia culminates in the Indus Valley Civilization  which is followed by the legends of ancient Vedic period and the sketchy references to the rise and fall of Mahajanapadas   the precursors of regional kingdoms and later ancient empires   ending in the historical accounts of medieval empires and the arrival of European traders who later became the rulers  Almost all South Asian countries were under direct or indirect European Colonial subjugation at some point  Much of modern India  Pakistan  Bangladesh and Burma were gradually occupied by Great Britain   starting from 1757  reaching their zenith in 1857 and ruling till 1947  Nepal and Bhutan were to some extent protectorates of Great Britain until after World War II  In the millennia long history of South Asia  this European occupation period is rather short  but its proximity to the present and its lasting impact on the region make it prominent  The network of means of transportation and communication as well as banking and training of requisite workforce  and also the existing rail  post  telegraph  and education facilities have evolved out of the base established in the colonial era  often called the British Raj  As an aftermath of World War II  most of the region gained independence from Europe by the late 1940s  Since 1947  most South Asian countries have achieved tremendous progress in all spheres  citation needed  Most notable achievements are in the fields of education  industry  health care  information technology and other services based on its applications  research in the fields of cutting edge sciences and technologies  defence related self reliance projects  international global trade and business enterprises and outsourcing of human resources  Areas of difficulty remain  however  including religious extremism  high levels of corruption  disagreements on political boundaries  and inequitable distribution of wealth   edit  Territory and region data 2009 referenced population figures except where noted   edit  Core countries With the

nations of Bangladesh  Bhutan  India  Maldives  Nepal  Pakistan  and Sri Lanka  is ethnically diverse  with more than 2 000 ethnic entities with populations ranging from hundreds of millions to small tribal groups  South Asia has been invaded and settled by many ethnic groups over the centuries   including various Dravidian  Indo Aryan and Iranian groups   and amalgamation of Dravidian  Indo Aryan and native societies has produced composite cultures with many common traditions and beliefs  But  the traditions of different ethnic groups in South Asia have diverged throughout earlier times  sometimes giving rise to strong local traditions such as the distinct South Indian culture  Other ethnic groups  successively streaming in later mainly from Central Asia and Iran  e g  Sakas  Kushans  Huns etc  influenced pre existing South Asian cultures  Among the last of these new arrivals were the Arabs followed by the Turks  the Pashtuns and the Moghuls  However  Arab influence remained relatively limited in comparison to that of the Turks  Pashtuns and Moghuls  who brought in much cultural influence and contributed to the birth of Urdu  a syncretic language of combined Indo Persian heritage  which is widely spoken today  Ethnic Englishmen and other Britons are now practically absent after their two centuries long colonial presence  although they have left an imprint of western culture in the elite society   edit  Languages See also  Languages of South Asia The largest spoken language in this region is now Hindust n   its speakers numbering almost 422 million  75  the second largest spoken language is Bengali  with about 210 million speakers  76 Urdu is also a major language spoken in the subcontinent  especially in Pakistan and India  and is similar linguistically to Hindi  Hindi and Urdu together make up Hindust n   Hindi is spoken in some states of India  and is similar linguistically to Urdu  Many people are not aware of the fact that most of the Indians speak local languages and are not familiar with Hindi  Other languages of this region fall into a few major linguistic groups  the Dravidian languages and the Indo Aryan languages  a sub branch of the Indo Iranian branch of the Indo European languages  The other great sub branch of Indo Iranian  the Iranian languages  also have significant minority representation in South Asia  with Pashto and Balochi being widely spoken along the northwestern fringes of the region  in modern day Pakistan  Many Tibeto Burman ethnic groups  who are speakers of their language group  are found in northeast India  Tibet  Nepal  and Bhutan  Other small groups  speaking Austro Asiatic languages  are also present in South Asia  English is another language which dominates South Asia  especially as a medium of advanced education and government administration  Most of South Asia writes using various abugidas of Br hm  origin while languages such as Urdu  Pashto  and Sindhi use derivatives of the Perso Arabic script  Not all languages in South Asia follow this strict dichotomy though  For example  Kashmiri is written in both the Perso Arabic script and in the Devanagari script  The same can be said for Punjabi  which is written in both Shahmukhi and Gurmukh   Dhivehi is written in a script called T na that shows characteristics of both the Arabic alphabet and of an abugida    File     edit  Religions Further information  Religion in Bangladesh  Religion in Bhutan  Religion in India  Religion in Nepal  Religion in Pakistan  and Religion in Sri Lanka In South Asia Hinduism and Islam and in some of its countries Buddhism are the dominant religions  Other Indian religions and Christianity are practiced by significant number of people  Historically  fusion of Indo Aryan Vedic religion with native South Asian non Vedic Shramana traditions and other Dravidian and local tribal beliefs gave rise to the ancient religions of Hinduism and Jainism  As a consequence  these two religions share many similar cultural practices  festivals and traditions  Arabs brought the Abrahamic religion of Islam to South Asia  first in the present day Kerala and the Maldive Islands and later in Sindh  Balochistan and much of Punjab  Subsequently  Muslim Turks Pashtuns Moghuls furthered it not only among the Punjabi and Kashmiri people but also throughout the Indo Gangetic plains and farther east

Africa  Three South Asian nations   Bangladesh  Bhutan and Nepal   are characterized as least developed country  Poverty is commonly spread within this region  According to the poverty data of World Bank  more than 40  of the population in the region lived on less than the International Poverty Line of  1 25 per day in 2005  compared to 50  of the population in Sub Saharan Africa  90  There are

region  US  1 54 trillion  and makes up almost 82  of the South Asian economy  it is the world s 4th largest in nominal terms and 3rd largest by purchasing power adjusted exchange rates  Pakistan has the next largest economy and the 5th highest GDP per capita in the region  92  followed by Bangladesh  If Iran is counted  it will become the second largest in terms of region and the economy   According to a World Bank report in 2007  South Asia is the least integrated region in the world  trade between South Asian states is only 2  of the region s combined GDP  compared to 20  in East Asia  The Economist has blamed this on Indian neglect of its neighbors  93   edit  Governance India 94  and Pakistan 95  96  are the dominant political powers in the region  India is by far the largest country in the area covering around three fourths the land area of the subcontinent  97  It also has the largest population of around three times the combined population of the 6 other countries in the subcontinent  98  India is also the most populous democracy in the world 99  and is a nuclear power  The second largest country in the subcontinent in terms of area and population is Pakistan and has traditionally maintained the balance of power in the region due to its strategic relationships with nearby Arab states 100  and neighboring China  101 Pakistan is the 6th 102  most populous country in the world and is also a nuclear power  Bangladesh is the third largest populous country in the region  The single largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations is Pakistan  103  Diplomacy among the countries of South Asia has been mainly driven by populist politics  with the center stage taken by India Pakistan conflict ever since their independence in 1947  and then the creation of Bangladesh under tense circumstances in 1971  While the elite rulers of Pakistan chose the USA led bloc during the cold war era  India formed the Non Aligned Movement  The political situation in Sri Lanka has been dominated by a increasingly assertive Sinhalese nationalism  and the emergence of a Tamil separatist movement under LTTE  which was suppressed recently  Burma s politics is dominated by a military Junta  which has sidelined the democratic forces led by Aung San Suu Kyi   edit  Health and nutrition There are 421 million MPI poor people in eight Indian states
