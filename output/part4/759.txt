American cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart  originally from Ludwigsburg  Germany  who launched a fine chemicals business  Charles Pfizer and Company  from a building at the intersection of Harrison Avenue and Bartlett Street 8  in Williamsburg  Brooklyn in 1849  There  they produced an antiparasitic called santonin  This was an immediate success  although it was the production of citric acid that really kick started Pfizer s growth in the 1880s  Pfizer continued to buy property to expand its lab and factory on the block bounded by Bartlett Street  Harrison Avenue  Gerry Street  and Flushing Avenue  That facility was used by Pfizer until 2005  when Pfizer closed its original plant along with several others  Pfizer established its original administrative headquarters at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan  8  By 1906  sales totaled nearly  3 million  World War I caused a shortage of calcium citrate that Pfizer imported from Italy for the manufacture of citric acid  and the company began a search for an alternative supply  Pfizer chemists learned of a fungus that ferments sugar to citric acid and were able to commercialize production of citric acid from this source in 1919  As a result Pfizer developed expertise in fermentation technology  These skills were applied to the mass production of penicillin during World War II  in response to a need from the U S  government  The antibiotic was needed to treat injured Allied soldiers  In fact  most of the penicillin that went ashore with the troops on D Day was made by Pfizer  Following the success of penicillin production in the 1940s  penicillin became very inexpensive and Pfizer made very little profit for its efforts  As a result  in the late 1940s Pfizer decided to search for new antibiotics with greater profit potential  The discovery and commercialization of Terramycin  oxytetracycline  by Pfizer in 1950 moved the company on the path of change from a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research based pharmaceutical company  To augment its research in fermentation technology  Pfizer began a program to discover drugs through chemical synthesis  Pfizer also established an animal health division in 1959 with an 700 acre  2 8 km2  farm and research facility in Terre Haute  Indiana  By the 1950s  Pfizer was established in Belgium  Brazil  Canada  Cuba  Iran  Mexico  Panama  Puerto Rico  Turkey and the United Kingdom  In 1960  the Company moved its medical research laboratory operations to a new facility in Groton  Connecticut  In 1980 Pfizer launched Feldene  piroxicam   a prescription anti inflammatory medication that became Pfizer s first product to reach a total of a billion United States dollars in sales  During the 1980s and 1990s Pfizer underwent a period of growth sustained by the discovery and marketing of Zoloft  Lipitor  Norvasc  Zithromax  Aricept  Diflucan  and Viagra  Pfizer has recently grown by mergers  including those with Warner Lambert  2000   with Pharmacia  2003   and with Wyeth  2009   A July 2010 article in BusinessWeek reported that Pfizer was seeing more success in its battle against makers of counterfeit prescription drugs by pursuing civil lawsuits rather than criminal prosecution  Pfizer has hired customs and narcotics experts from all over the globe to track down fakes and assemble evidence that can be used to pursue civil suits for trademark infringement  Since 2007  Pfizer has spent  3 3 million on investigations and legal fees and recovered about  5 1 million  with another  5 million tied up in ongoing cases  9  In February 2011 it was announced that it was to close its research and development facility in Kent  which employs 2 400 people  10  On April 2011 Pfizer Inc has agreed to sell their world s largest maker of hard capsules Capsugel unit for about  2 38 billion to private equity firm KKR  amp  Co  The cash will be used for a part of share buyback about  5 billion planned for 2011  11   edit  Corporate structure Pfizer

Mergers  edit  Warner Lambert   Parke Davis   Agouron Warner Lambert was founded as a drug store in 1856 in Philadelphia by William R  Warner  Inventing a tablet coating process gained Warner a place in the Smithsonian Institution  Parke Davis was founded in Detroit in 1866  by Hervey Parke and George Davis  Warner Lambert took over Parke Davis in 1976  and acquired Wilkinson Sword in 1993 and Agouron in 1999  In 2000 Pfizer took over Warner Lambert  16   edit  Pharmacia   Upjohn   Searle This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Searle was founded in Omaha  Nebraska  in 1888  The founder was Gideon Daniel Searle  In 1908  the company was incorporated in Chicago  In 1941  the company established headquarters in Skokie  Illinois  It was acquired by the Monsanto Company  headquartered in St  Louis  in 1985  The Upjohn Company was a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm founded in 1886 in Kalamazoo  Michigan by Dr  William E  Upjohn  an 1875 graduate of the University of Michigan medical school  The company was originally formed to make friable pills  which were specifically designed to be easily digested  In 1995  Upjohn merged with Pharmacia  to form Pharmacia  amp  Upjohn  Pharmacia was created in April 2000 through the merger of Pharmacia  amp  Upjohn with the Monsanto Company and its G D  Searle unit  The merged company was based in Peapack  New Jersey  The agricultural division was spun off from Pharmacia  as Monsanto  in preparation for the close of the acquisition by Pfizer  17  Brooklyn  NY building In 2002  Pfizer merged with Pharmacia  The merger was again driven in part by the desire to acquire full rights to a product  this time Celebrex  celecoxib   the COX 2 selective inhibitor previously jointly marketed by Searle  acquired by Pharmacia  and Pfizer  In the ensuing years  Pfizer commenced with a massive restructuring resulting in numerous site closures and loss of jobs including  Terre Haute  IN  Holland  MI  Groton  CT  Brooklyn  NY  Sandwich  UK and Puerto Rico  In 2008  Pfizer announced 275 job cuts at the Kalamazoo manufacturing facility  Kalamazoo was previously the world headquarters for the Upjohn Company  18   edit  SUGEN Main article  SUGEN SUGEN was a company focused on protein kinase inhibitors  founded in 1991 in Redwood City  California and acquired by Pharmacia in 1999  The company pioneered the use of ATP mimetic small molecules to block signal transduction  After the Pfizer merger  the SUGEN site was shut down in 2003  with the loss of over 300 jobs  and the transfer of several programs to Pfizer  These included sunitinib  Sutent   which was approved for human use by the FDA in January 2006  passed  1 bn in annual revenues for Pfizer in 2010  19  A related compound SU11654  Toceranib  was also approved for canine tumors  and the ALK inhibitor Crizotinib also grew out of a SUGEN program 20   edit  Wyeth On January 26  2009  after more than a year of talks between the two companies  Pfizer agreed to buy pharmaceuticals rival Wyeth for a combined US 68 billion in cash  shares and loans  including some US 22 5 billion lent by five major Wall Street banks  The deal would cement Pfizer s place as the largest pharmaceutical company in the world  with the merged company generating over US 20 billion in cash each year  and represents the largest corporate merger since AT amp T and BellSouth s US 70 billion deal in March 2006  21  Wyeth s management team is expected to depart following the merger  The combined company could save US 4 billion annually through the streamlining of operations  however  as part of the deal  both companies must repatriate billions of dollars in revenue from foreign sources to the United States  which will result in higher tax costs  The acquisition was completed on October 15  2009 making Wyeth a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer  7   edit  Critics of the merger The merger received a vast array of criticism  Harvard Business School s Gary Pisano told The Wall Street Journal  The record of big mergers and acquisitions in Big Pharma has just not been good  There s just been an enormous amount of shareholder wealth destroyed  22  The Warner Lambert and Pharmacia mergers do not appear to have achieved gains for shareholders so it is unclear who will benefit from the Wyeth Pfizer merger to many critics  23   edit  King Pharma In October 2010  Pfizer agreed to buy King Pharmaceuticals for  3 6 billion in cash or  14 25 per share  an approximately 40  premium over King s closing share price 11th october 2010  24   edit  Development of torcetrapib Development of torcetrapib  a drug that increases production of HDL  or  good cholesterol   which reduces LDL thought to be correlated to heart disease  was cancelled in December 2006  During a Phase III clinical trial involving 15 000 patients there were more deaths than expected in the group that took the medicine  and a 60  increase in deaths was seen among patients taking torcetrapib plus Lipitor versus Lipitor alone  There was no suggestion these results called into question the safety of Lipitor  Pfizer lost nearly  1 billion invested developing the failed drug  and the market value of the company plummeted in the aftermath  25  26  27   edit  Pharmaceuticals Pfizer had the greatest number of blockbuster products in 2009

aforementioned Wyeth merger  Pfizer announced it will close its research and development headquarters in New London  Connecticut  moving employees to nearby Groton   edit  Quigley Co  Pfizer acquired Quigley in 1968  and the division sold asbestos containing insulation products until the early 1970s  34  Asbestos victims and Pfizer have been negotiating a settlement deal which calls for Pfizer to pay  430 million to 80 percent of existing plaintiffs  It will also place an additional  535 million into an asbestos settlement trust that will compensate future plaintiffs as well as the remaining 20 percent of current plaintiffs with claims against Pfizer and Quigley  The compensation deal is worth  965 million all up  Of that  535 million   405 million is in a 40 year note from Pfizer  while  100 million will come from insurance policies   edit  Bjork Shiley heart valve Pfizer purchased Shiley in 1979 at the onset of its Convexo Concave valve ordeal  involving the Bjork Shiley heart valve  Approximately 500 people died when defective valves failed and  in 1994  the United States ruled against Pfizer for   200 million  35  36   edit  Political lobbying Pfizer is a leading member of the U S  Global Leadership Coalition  a Washington D C  based coalition of over 400 major companies and NGOs that advocates for a larger International Affairs Budget  which funds American diplomatic  humanitarian  and development efforts abroad  37  Pfizer is one of the single largest lobbying interests in United States politics  For example in the first 9 months of 2009 Pfizer spent over  16 3 million on lobbying US congressional lawmakers  making them the sixth largest lobbying interest in the US  following Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  PhRMA   which ranked fourth but also represents many of their interests   A spokeswoman for Pfizer said the company  wanted to make sure our voice is heard in this conversation  in regards to the companies expenditure of  25 million in 2010 to lobby health care reform  38  Pfizer s primary interests are opposition of Congressional efforts to attach a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and opposition to generic drugs entering US markets  39  Pfizer also purportedly proposed a ban on all lawsuits against manufacturers of body implant parts which was proposed in the United States Congress as part of tort reform legislation  40  According to U S  State Department cables released by the whistle blowing site WikiLeaks  Pfizer  lobbied against New Zealand getting a free trade agreement with the United States because it objected to New Zealand s restrictive drug buying rules and tried to get rid of New Zealand s former health minister  Helen Clark  in 1990  41  42   edit  Off label promotional practices Access to pharmaceutical industry documents has revealed marketing strategies used to promote Neurontin for off label use  43  In 1993  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approved gabapentin  Neurontin  Pfizer  only for treatment of seizures  Warner Lambert  which merged with Pfizer in 2000  used activities not usually associated with sales promotion  including continuing medical education and research  sponsored articles about the drug for the medical literature  and alleged suppression of unfavorable study results  to promote gabapentin  Within 5 years the drug was being widely used for the off label treatment of pain and psychiatric conditions  In 2004  Warner Lambert admitted to charges that it violated FDA regulations by promoting the drug for pain  psychiatric conditions  migraine  and other unapproved uses  and paid  430 million to resolve criminal and civil health care liability charges  44  45  Today it is a mainstay drug for migraines  even though it was not approved for such use in 2004  46   edit  Bextra settlement of off label marketing investigation In September 2009  the United States Department of Justice announced that Pfizer had agreed to pay  2 3 billion to settle civil and criminal allegations that it had illegally marketed four drugs  Bextra  Geodon  Zyvox  and Lyrica  with the intent to defraud or mislead  by promoting the drugs for non approved uses examples needed   this marks Pfizer s fourth such settlement in a decade  4  5  32  Pharmacia  amp  Upjohn Company  Inc   a Pfizer subsidiary  agreed to plead guilty to mis branded promotion of Bextra  a felony violation of the Food  Drug and Cosmetic Act  The criminal fine accounts for  1 3 billion of the settlement  and is the largest criminal penalty ever imposed in American history  47  Pfizer has entered an extensive corporate integrity agreement  CIA  with the Office of Inspector General and will be required to make substantial structural reforms within the company  and maintain the Pfizer website  www pfizer com pmc  to track the company s post marketing commitments  Pfizer must also put a searchable database of all payments to physicians the company has made on the Pfizer website by March 31  2010  48  In addition  two former employees were separately indicted and sentenced for their role in marketing of Bextra  A former District Sales manager was found guilty of obstruction of justice for destroying documents pertinent to the investigation  and a Regional Sales Manager pled guilty to the distribution of a mis branded product  49  50  The case is the largest civil settlement against a pharmaceutical company as well  51  Pfizer paid a  1 billion civil fine to settle allegations it had illegally promoted the drugs for uses that were not approved by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and caused false claims to be submitted to Federal and State programs including but not limited to Medicare and Medicaid  Under the False Claims Act  damages can be assessed for violations of the federal Anti Kickback statute  42 U S C    1320a 7b b  52  and the off label marketing provision within the Federal Food  Drug  and Cosmetic Act   FDCA    21 U S C    301 97  53  Six whistle blowers will receive  102 million for their participation in the civil investigation  and John Kopchinski  a former sales representative  will receive  51 5 million for his allegations involving the marketing of Bextra  54  CNN reported that Pharmacia  amp  Upjohn  not Pfizer itself  pleaded guilty because prosecutors thought Pfizer was  too big to nail   Companies convicted of major health care fraud are automatically barred from billing Medicare and Medicaid for their products  Prosecutors feared that Pfizer would collapse if it pleaded guilty  and felt that the risk of harm to patients was too great  A CNN investigation revealed that Pharmacia  amp  Upjohn Company is little more than a shell corporation Pfizer uses to plead guilty  it was first created in 2007 as the defendant in a kickback case  55   edit  Nigeria In 1996  an outbreak of measles  cholera  and bacterial meningitis occurred in Nigeria  Pfizer representatives traveled to Kano  Nigeria to administer an experimental antibiotic  trovafloxacin  to approximately 200 children  Local Kano officials report that more than 50 children died in the experiment  while many others developed mental and physical deformities  56  In 2001  families of the children  as well as the governments of Kano and Nigeria  filed lawsuits regarding the treatment  57  Representing the government is Babatunde Irukera  According to news reports    r esearchers did not obtain signed consent forms  and medical personnel said Pfizer did not tell parents their children were getting the experimental drug   58  The lawsuits also accuse Pfizer of using the outbreak to perform unapproved human testing  as well as allegedly under dosing a control group being treated with traditional antibiotics in order to skew the results of the trial in favor of Trovan  Pfizer denied these claims  and subsequently produced an approval letter for testing from the Nigerian Ethics Committee  The Nigerian government insisted that it was a fake and a panel of Nigerian medical experts agreed that the letter had been concocted and backdated by the company s lead researcher in Kano  They went on to conclude that Pfizer never obtained authorization from the Nigerian government to give the unproven drug to children and infants  59  In 2007  Pfizer published a Statement of Defense letter  60  The letter makes several claims  including that Pfizer donated 18 million in Nigerian Naira  NGN   about  216 000 in 1996 US dollars  USD    61  that the drug s oral form was presented as safer and easier to administer  that the administration of Trovan saved lives  and that no unusual side effects  unrelated to meningitis  were observed after 4 weeks  A more likely reason for Pfizer s insistence on the oral form is the result of testing trovafloxacin intravenously in 1995  which found that the drug precipitated in saline  making it ineffective in patients receiving IV fluids  This is inferred from an FDA Warning Letter 62  to ex CEO William C  Steere  regarding Trovan s compatibility with saline etc   which was omitted from Trovan s labeling until January 1999  shortly after Pfizer received the letter  In June 1999  the FDA released a public health statement warning against the use of Trovan except in life or death situations  due to high risk of liver failure  In some cases  liver damage occurred after only two days of treatment  63  In June 2010 the US Supreme Court rejected Pfizer s appeal against a ruling allowing lawsuits by the Nigerian families to proceed  64  In December 2010 WikiLeaks released US diplomatic cables  which indicate that Pfizer had  used dirty tricks to avoid clinical trial payout   The company had hired investigators to find evidence of corruption against the Nigerian attorney general to persuade him to drop legal action  65 Washington Post reporter Joe Stephens  who helped break the story in 2000  called these actions  dangerously close to blackmail   58  In response the company has released a press statement describing the allegations as  preposterous  and stating that they acted in good faith  66   edit  Lawsuit over GMO virus A scientist claims she was infected by a genetically modified virus while working for Pfizer  In her federal lawsuit she says she has been intermittently paralyzed by the Pfizer designed virus   McClain  of Deep River  suspects she was inadvertently exposed  through work by a former Pfizer colleague in 2002 or 2003  to an engineered form of the lentivirus  a virus similar to the one that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome  or AIDS   67   edit  Blue Cross Blue Shield lawsuit Health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield  BCBS  filed a lawsuit against Pfizer for reportedly illegally marketing their drugs Bextra  Geodon and Lyrica  BCBS is reporting that Pfizer used  kickbacks  and wrongly persuaded doctors to prescribe the drugs  68  69  FiercePharma reported that  According to the suit  the drugmaker not only handed out those  misleading  materials on off label uses  but sent doctors on Caribbean junkets and paid them  2 000 honoraria in return for their listening to lectures about Bextra  More than 5 000 healthcare professionals were entertained at meetings in Bahamas  Virgin Islands and across the U S   the suit alleges   70  Pfizer has had similar cases brought against it which it has settled with the US federal government and with more than 40 US states  71  Pfizer denies the allegations   edit  Wyeth s Rapamune A  whistleblower suit  was filed in 2005 against Wyeth  which was acquired by Pfizer  alleging that the company illegally marketed their drug Rapamune  Wyeth is targeted in the suit for off label marketing  targeting specific doctors and medical facilities to increased sales of Rapamune  trying to get current transplant patients to change from their current transplant drugs to Rapamune and for specifically targeting African Americans  According to the whistleblowers  Wyeth also provided doctors and hospitals with kickbacks to prescribe the drug in the form of grants  donations and other money  72  73  A US House of Representatives committee  led by Rep  Edolphus Towns is currently when   investigating Pfizer for these abuses  74  75   edit  Research and development Pfizer s human research and development

development  R amp D  in 2007  Pfizer has the industry s largest pharmaceutical R amp D organization  Pfizer Global Research and Development  77  In 2007  Pfizer announced plans to close or sell on the Loughbeg API facility  located at Loughbeg  Ringaskiddy Co Cork Ireland by mid to end of 2008 In 2007  Pfizer announced plans to completely close the Ann Arbor  Nagoya and Amboise Research facilities by the end of 2008  eliminating 2 160 jobs and idling the  300 million dollar Michigan facility  which had seen millions of dollars of expansion in recent years  78  On June 18  2007 Pfizer announced it will move the Sandwich  England Animal Health Research  VMRD  division to Kalamazoo  Michigan  79  On February 1  2011 Pfizer announced that it was to pull out of its UK Research and Development centre at Sandwich  Kent  with the loss of 2 400 jobs  80  On September 1  2011 Pfizer announced that it has agreed to a 10 year lease of more than 180 000 square feet of research space from MIT in a building to be constructed at 610 Main Street South  just north of the MIT campus in Cambridge  Massachusetts  US  The space will house Pfizer s Cardiovascular  Metabolic and Endocrine Disease Research Unit and its Neuroscience Research Unit   and Pfizer anticipates moving into the space once it is completed in late 2013  81  Pipeline  dimebon tanezumab  edit  Environmental record According to the EPA  Pfizer is among the top ten companies in America with the most numerous emissions sources  82  A landfill and two wastewater lagoons in Ledyard  CT near the Pfizer plant in Groton  Connecticut  are a source of groundwater pollution in the area  According to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection  CT DEP   the Pfizer site is active under the CT DEP Site Remediation program  83  In June 2002  a chemical explosion at the Groton plant injured seven people and caused the evacuation of over 100 homes in the surrounding area  84  Pfizer has provided funding to the Competitive Enterprise Institute  Pfizer purchased a pharmaceutical company named Wyeth in 2009  Included in Wyeth s liabilities is the American Cyanamid site in Bridgewater  New Jersey  This site is highly toxic and an EPA declared Superfund site  Pfizer has since attempted to remediate this land in order to clean and develop it for future profits and potential public uses  Members of the surrounding communities have stated that the EPA has been coerced into accepting a plan that is affordable for Pfizer but is not a complete proper remediation plan for the site  detrimental to the interest of the community  The EPA has suggested a remediation plan that includes environmental caps and redeveloping a portion of it in the future  This redevelopment will occur on the site which is located within a flood plain  something the EPA failed to address in their feasibility study released in early 2012  The mayor of Bridgewater  the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection  and other key community leaders also came out to endorse the plan without considering the amount of increased flooding that is going to take place if such a plan is implemented  A petition to the EPA as well as other key officials can be found on change org edisonwetlands website   85   edit  Employment and diversity Pfizer received a 100  rating on the Corporate Equality Index released by the Human Rights Campaign starting in 2004  the third year of the report  In 2007  Pfizer s Canadian division was named one of Canada s Top 100 Employers  as published in Maclean s magazine  the only research based pharmaceutical company to receive this honor  86  In 2008  there was controversy  including inquiries from members of Congress  around Pfizer s practice of replacing US workers with H

the elimination of the Pfizer monopoly on selling fluconazole in Thailand  and the price of the antifungal drug decreased from 200 baht to 6 5 baht in nine months  vastly expanding access to the

United States  46 percent of all new HIV AIDS cases occur in the South  From 2003 to 2006 the Pfizer Foundation has funded 23 innovative HIV AIDS prevention programs and strengthened the capacity of community based organizations to reach and serve their communities   89  Since 2003  Pfizer has committed a  3 million grant toward supporting the Southern HIV AIDS Prevention Initiative  However  there were criticisms of the way Pfizer was testing its AIDS drug   The European AIDS Treatment Group  EATG   collection of activists from 31 European Countries  90  said the design of the trial for Pfizer s CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc  previously known as UK 427 857  is putting people with HIV infection at unnecessary risk of developing AIDS   91  On June 20  2007  Pfizer received an approvable letter for maraviroc from the FDA advisory board  The letter was a product of expedited review of the novel HIV compound  92  In 2001  Pfizer asked the U S  government to pressure the Brazilian government against issuing compulsory licenses for the patents on the AIDS drug nelfinavir  citation needed  In November 2009 Pfizer formed a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline to create ViiV
