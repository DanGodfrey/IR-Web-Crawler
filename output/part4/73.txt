on September 18  1851  by journalist and politician Henry Jarvis Raymond  who was then a Whig and who would later be the second chairman of the Republican National Committee  and former banker George Jones as the New York Daily Times  Sold at an original price of one cent per copy  the inaugural edition attempted to address the various speculations on its purpose and positions that preceded its release  10  We shall be Conservative  in all cases where we think Conservatism essential to the public good  and we shall be Radical in everything which may seem to us to require radical treatment and radical reform  We do not believe that everything in Society is either exactly right or exactly wrong  what is good we desire to preserve and improve  what is evil  to exterminate  or reform  The paper changed its name to The New York Times in 1857  The newspaper was originally published every day except Sunday  but on April 21  1861  due to the demand for daily coverage of the Civil War  The New York Times  along with other major dailies  started publishing Sunday issues  One of the earliest public controversies in which the paper was involved was the Mortara Affair  an affair that was the object of 20 editorials in The New York Times alone  11  The paper s influence grew during 1870 71  when it published a series of expos s of Boss Tweed that led to the end of the Tweed Ring s domination of New York s City Hall  12  In the 1880s  The New York Times transitioned from supporting Republican candidates to becoming politically independent  in 1884  the paper supported Democrat Grover Cleveland in his first presidential election  While this move hurt The New York Times  readership  the paper regained most of its lost ground within a few years  13 The New York Times was acquired by Adolph Ochs  publisher of the Chattanooga Times  in 1896  The following year  he coined the paper s slogan   All The News That s Fit To Print   13  this was a jab at competing papers such as Joseph Pulitzer s New York World and William Randolph Hearst s New York Journal which were known for lurid yellow journalism  Under his guidance  The New York Times achieved international scope  circulation  and reputation  In 1904  The New York Times received the first on the spot wireless transmission from a naval battle  a report of the destruction of the Russian fleet at the Battle of Port Arthur in the Yellow Sea from the press boat Haimun during the Russo Japanese war  In 1910  the first air delivery of The New York Times to Philadelphia began  13 The New York Times  first trans Atlantic delivery to London occurred in 1919  In 1920  a  4 A M  Airplane Edition  was sent by plane to Chicago so it could be in the hands of Republican convention delegates by evening  14  In the 1940s  the paper extended its breadth and reach  The crossword began appearing regularly in 1942  and the fashion section in 1946  The New York Times began an international edition in 1946  The international edition stopped publishing in 1967  when The New York Times joined the owners of the New York Herald Tribune and The Washington Post to publish the International Herald Tribune in Paris  The paper bought a classical radio station  WQXR  in 1946  15  In addition to owning WQXR  the newspaper also formerly owned its AM sister  WQEW  1560 AM   16  The classical music radio format was simulcast on both frequencies until the early 1990s  when the big band and standards music format of WNEW AM  now WBBR  moved from 1130 AM to 1560  The AM radio station changed its call letters from WQXR to WQEW  17  By the beginning of the 21st century  The New York Times was leasing WQEW to ABC Radio for its Radio Disney format  which continues on 1560 AM  Disney became the owner of WQEW in 2007  16  On July 14  2009 it was announced that WQXR was to be sold to WNYC  who on October 8  2009 moved the station to 105 9 FM and began to operate the station as a non commercial  18  The New York Times newsroom  1942 A speech in the newsroom after announcement of Pulitzer Prize winners  2009 The New York Times is third in national circulation  after USA Today and The Wall Street Journal  The newspaper is owned by The New York Times Company  in which descendants of Adolph Ochs  principally the Sulzberger family  maintain a dominant role  As of December 26  2010  2010  12 26  ref   the paper reported a circulation of 906 100 copies on weekdays and 1 356 800 copies on Sundays  19  According to a 2009 The New York Times article circulation has dropped 7 3 percent to about 928 000  this is the first time since the 1980s that it has fallen under one million  5  In the New York City metropolitan area  the paper costs  2 50 Monday through Saturday and  5 on Sunday  The New York Times has won 106 Pulitzer Prizes  more than any other newspaper  20  21  In 2009  The New York Times began production of local inserts in regions outside of the New York area  Beginning October 16  2009  a two page  Bay Area  insert was added to copies of the Northern California edition on Fridays and Sundays  The New York Times commenced production of a similar Friday and Sunday insert to the Chicago edition on November 20  2009  The inserts consist of local news  policy  sports  and culture pieces  usually supported by local advertisements  In addition to its New York City headquarters  The New York Times has 10 news bureaus in New York State  11 national news bureaus and 26 foreign news bureaus  19 The New York Times reduced its page width to 12 inches  300 mm  from 13 5 inches  340 mm  on August 6  2007  adopting the width that has become the U S  newspaper industry standard  22  Because of its steadily declining sales attributed to the rise of online alternative media and social media  The New York Times has been going through a downsizing for several years  offering buyouts to workers and cutting expenses  23  in common with a general trend among print newsmedia  The newspaper s first building was located at 113 Nassau Street in New York City  In 1854  it moved to 138 Nassau Street  and in 1858 it moved to 41 Park Row  making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use  24  The paper moved its headquarters to 1475 Broadway in 1904  in an area called Long Acre Square  that was renamed to Times Square  The top of the building is the site of the New Year s Eve tradition of lowering a lighted ball  that was started by the paper  The building is also notable for its electronic news ticker  where headlines crawled around the outside of the building  It is still in use  when   but is not operated by The New York Times  After nine years in Times Square  an Annex was built at 229 West 43rd Street  After several expansions  it became the company s headquarters in 1913  and the building on Broadway was sold in 1961  Until June 2007  The New York Times  from which Times Square gets its name  was published at offices at West 43rd Street  It stopped printing papers there on June 15  1997  25  The newspaper remained at that location until June 2007  when it moved three blocks south to 620 Eighth Avenue between West 40th and 41st Streets  in Manhattan  The new headquarters for the newspaper  The New York Times Building  is a skyscraper designed by Renzo Piano  26  27   edit  Times v  Sullivan Main article  New York Times Co  v  Sullivan The paper s involvement in a 1964 libel case helped bring one of the key United States Supreme Court decisions supporting freedom of the press  New York Times Co  v  Sullivan  In it  the United States Supreme Court established the  actual malice  standard for press reports about public officials or public figures to be considered defamatory or libelous  The malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity  Because of the high burden of proof on the plaintiff  and difficulty in proving what is inside a person s head  such cases by public figures rarely succeed  28   edit  The Pentagon Papers Main article  Pentagon Papers In 1971  the Pentagon Papers  a secret United States Department of Defense history of the United States  political and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1971  were given   leaked   to Neil Sheehan of The New York Times by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg  with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them  The New York Times began publishing excerpts as a series of articles on June 13  Controversy and lawsuits followed  The papers revealed  among other things  that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over Laos  raids along the coast of North Vietnam  and offensive actions taken by U S  Marines well before the public was told about the actions  and while President Lyndon B  Johnson had been promising not to expand the war  The document increased the credibility gap for the U S  government  and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration to fight the on going war  29  When The New York Times began publishing its series  President Richard Nixon became incensed  His words to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger included  people have gotta be put to the torch for this sort of thing     and  let s get the son of a bitch in jail   30  After failing to get The New York Times to stop publishing  Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that The New York Times cease publication of excerpts  The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system  On June 18  1971  The Washington Post began publishing its own series  Ben Bagdikian  a Post editor  had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg  That day the Post received a call from the Assistant Attorney General  William Rehnquist  asking them to stop publishing  When the Post refused  the U S  Justice Department sought another injunction  The U S  District court judge refused  and the government appealed  On June 26  1971 the U S  Supreme Court agreed to take both cases  merging them into New York Times Co  v  United States 403 US 713  On June 30  1971  the Supreme Court held in a 6 3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required  The justices wrote nine separate opinions  disagreeing on significant substantive issues  While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the First Amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech  many felt it a lukewarm victory  offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake  29   edit  Discrimination in employment Discriminatory practices restricting women in editorial positions were part of the history  correlating with effects on the journalism published at the time  The newspaper s first general woman reporter was Jane Grant  who described her experience afterwards  She wrote   In the beginning I was charged not to reveal the fact that a female had been hired   Other reporters nicknamed her Fluff and she was subjected to considerable hazing  Because of her gender  promotions were out of the question  according to the then managing editor  She was there for fifteen years  interrupted by World War I  31  In 1935  Anne McCormick wrote to Arthur Hays Sulzberger   I hope you won t expect me to revert to  woman s point of view  stuff   32  Later  she interviewed major political leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues did   Even those who witnessed her in action were unable to explain how she got the interviews she did   33  Said Clifton Daniel    After World War II   I m sure  chancellor of West Germany Konrad  Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch  She never had to grovel for an appointment   34  Covering world leaders  speeches after World War II at the National Press Club was limited to men  by a Club rule  When women were eventually allowed in to hear the speeches  they still were not allowed to ask the speakers questions  although men were allowed and did ask  even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work  35 Times reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the Club after covering one speech on assignment  36 Nan Robertson s article on the Union Stock Yards  Chicago  was read aloud as anonymous by a professor  who then said    It will come as a surprise to you  perhaps  that the reporter is a girl   he began     G asps  amazement in the ranks   She had used all her senses  not just her eyes  to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards  She chose a difficult subject  an offensive subject  Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you    37 The New York Times hired Kathleen McLaughlin after ten years at the Chicago Tribune  where   s he did a series on maids  going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs   38   edit  Ownership The New York Times headquarters 620 Eighth Avenue The Ochs Sulzberger family  one of the United States s newspaper dynasties  has owned The New York Times since 1896  13  After the publisher went public in the 1960s  the family continued to exert control through its ownership of the vast majority of Class B voting shares  Class A shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights while Class B shareholders are allowed open voting rights  Dual class structures caught on in the mid 20th century as families such as the Grahams of The Washington Post Company sought to gain access to public capital without losing control  Dow Jones  amp  Co   publisher of The Wall Street Journal  had a similar structure and was controlled by the Bancroft family  the company was later bought by the News Corporation in 2007  39  The Ochs Sulzberger family trust controls roughly 88 percent of the company s class B shares  Any alteration to the dual class structure must be ratified by six of eight directors who sit on the board of the Ochs Sulzberger family trust  The Trust board members are Daniel H  Cohen  James M  Cohen  Lynn G  Dolnick  Susan W  Dryfoos  Michael Golden  Eric M  A  Lax  Arthur O  Sulzberger  Jr  and Cathy J  Sulzberger  40  Turner Catledge  the top editor at The New York Times for almost two decades  wanted to hide the ownership influence  Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor  each containing suggestions  instructions  complaints  and orders  When Catledge would receive these memos he would erase the publisher s identity before passing them to his subordinates  Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher s name from the memos it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner  41   edit  Content  edit  Sections The newspaper is organized in three sections  including the magazine  News  Includes International  National  Washington  Business  Technology  Science  Health  Sports  The Metro Section  Education  Weather  and Obituaries  Opinion  Includes Editorials  Op Eds and Letters to the Editor  Features  Includes Arts  Movies  Theatre  Travel  NYC Guide  Dining  amp  Wine  Home  amp  Garden  Fashion  amp  Style  Crossword  The New York Times Book Review  The New York Times Magazine  and Sunday Review  Some sections  such as Metro  are only found in the editions of the paper distributed in the New York New Jersey Connecticut Tri State Area and not in the national or Washington  D C  editions  Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers  The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist  nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section  In September 2008  The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6  2008  in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area  The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International   National news section and combined Sports and Business  except Saturday through Monday  when Sports is still printed as a standalone section   This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri State Area  The presses used by The New York Times allow four sections to be printed simultaneously  as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday  the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together  The changes will allow The New York Times to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday  in addition to Saturday  The New York Times  announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged  with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses  42  According to Russ Stanton  editor of the Los Angeles Times  a competitor  the newsroom of The New York Times is twice the size of the Los Angeles Times  which currently has a newsroom of 600  43   edit  Style When referring to people  The New York Times generally uses honorifics  rather than unadorned last names  except in the sports pages  Book Review and Magazine   It stayed with an eight column format until September 1976  years after other papers had switched to six  44  and it was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography  with the first color photograph on the front page appearing on October 16  1997  45  In the absence of a major headline  the day s most important story generally appears in the top right hand column  on the main page  The typefaces used for the headlines are custom variations of Cheltenham  The running text is set at 8 7 point Imperial  46  Joining a roster of other major American newspapers in recent when   years  including USA Today  The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post  The New York Times announced on July 18  2006  that it would be narrowing the width of its paper by six inches  In an era of dwindling circulation and significant advertising revenue losses for most print versions of American newspapers  the move  which was also announced would result in a 5 percent reduction in news coverage  would have a target savings of  12 million a year for the paper  47  The change from the traditional 54 inches  1 4 m  broadsheet style to a more compact 48 inch web width was addressed by both Executive Editor Bill Keller and The New York Times President Scott Heekin Canedy in memos to the staff  Keller defended the  more reader friendly  move indicating that in cutting out the  flabby or redundant prose in longer pieces  the reduction would make for a better paper  Similarly  Keller confronted the challenges of covering news with  less room  by proposing more  rigorous editing  and promised an ongoing commitment to  hard hitting  ground breaking journalism   48  The official change went into effect on August 6  2007  49  The New York Times printed a display advertisement on its first page on January 6  2009  breaking tradition at the paper  50  The advertisement for CBS was in color and was the entire width of the page  51  The newspaper promised it would place first page advertisements on only the lower half of the page  50   edit  Reputation and awards It maintains bureaus across a large platform of politically and socially important locations  The New York Times has established links regionally with 16 bureaus in New York State  nationally  with 11 bureaus within the United States  and globally  with 26 foreign news bureaus  The recipient of 106 Pulitzer Prizes  The New York Times won three awards in the 2010 version of the proceedings  Sheri Fink was awarded the best investigative report  given for her piece on the reaction and dedication of a hospital after Hurricane Katrina  Michael Moss was recognised for his contribution to explanatory reporting and ensuing policy  given for his coverage of the trials experienced a young salmonella victim paralysed by E  coli  His article led to significant changes in federal regulation on the matter  Matt Richtel was also credited for his article on the dangerous effects of using a cellphone while driving   edit  Web presence The New York Times has had a strong presence on the Web since 1996  and has been ranked one of the top Web sites  Accessing some articles requires registration  though this could be bypassed in some cases through Times RSS feeds  52  The website had 555 million pageviews in March 2005  53  The domain nytimes com attracted at least 146 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete com study  The New York Times Web site ranks 59th by number of unique visitors  with over 20 million unique visitors in March 2009 making it the most visited newspaper site with more than twice the number of unique visitors as the next most popular site  54  Also  as of May 2009 update   nytimes com produced 22 of the 50 most popular newspaper blogs  55  In September 2005  the paper decided to begin subscription based service for daily columns in a program known as TimesSelect  which encompassed many previously free columns  Until being discontinued two years later  TimesSelect cost  7 95 per month or  49 95 per year  56  though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty  57  58  To work around this  bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material  59  and at least one site once compiled links of reprinted material  60  On September 17  2007  The New York Times announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site  effective at midnight the following day  reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site  61  In addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers  The New York Times news archives from 1987 to the present are available at no charge  as well as those from 1851 to 1922  which are in the public domain  62  63  Access to the Premium Crosswords section continues to require either home delivery or a subscription for  6 95 per month or  39 95 per year  Times columnists including Nicholas Kristof and Thomas Friedman had criticized TimesSelect  64  65  with Friedman going so far as to say  I hate it  It pains me enormously because it s cut me off from a lot  a lot of people  especially because I have a lot of people reading me overseas  like in India     I feel totally cut off from my audience   66  The New York Times was made available on the iPhone and iPod Touch in 2008  67  and on the iPad mobile devices in 2010  68  The New York Times is also the first newspaper to offer a video game as part of its editorial content  Food Import Folly by Persuasive Games  69  reCAPTCHA is currently helping to digitize old editions of The New York Times  70   edit  Mobile presence The Times Reader is a digital version of The New York Times  It was created via a collaboration between the newspaper and Microsoft  Times Reader takes the principles of print journalism and applies them to the technique of online reporting  Times Reader uses a series of technologies developed by Microsoft and their Windows Presentation Foundation team  It was announced in Seattle in April 2006 by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr   Bill Gates  and Tom Bodkin  In 2009 the Times Reader 2 0 was rewritten in Adobe AIR  71  In 2008  The New York Times created an app for the iPhone and iPod touch which allowed users to download articles to their mobile device enabling them to read the paper even when they were unable to receive a signal  In April 2010  The New York Times announced it will begin publishing daily content through an iPad app  72  As of October 2010 update   The New York Times iPad app is ad supported and available for free without a paid subscription  but translated into a subscription based model in 2011  68  In 2010  the New York Times also launched an App for Android smartphones   edit  In Moscow Communication with its Russian readers is a special project of The New York Times launched in February 2008  guided by Clifford J  Levy  Some Times articles covering the broad spectrum of political and social topics in Russia are being translated into Russian and offered for the attention of Russia s bloggers in The New York Times community blog  73  After that  selected responses of Russian bloggers are being translated into English and published at The New York Times site among comments from English readers  74  75   edit  Pricing Facing falling print advertising revenue and projections of continued decline  a paywall was instituted in 2011 which  as of March  2012  was modestly successful  garnering several hundred thousand subscriptions and about  100 million in revenue  76  The paywall was announced on March 17  2011  that starting on March 28  2011  March 17  2011 for Canada   it would charge frequent readers for access to its online content  9  Readers would be able to access up to 20 articles each month without charge   Although beginning in April  2012  the number of free access articles will be halved to just 10 articles per month   Any reader who wanted to access more would have to pay for a digital subscription  This plan would allow free access for occasional readers  but produce revenue from  heavy  readers  Depending on the package selected  digital subscriptions rates for four weeks range from  15 to  35  Subscribers to the print edition of the newspaper would get full access without any additional fee  Some content  such as the front page and the section fronts will remain free  as well as the Top News page on mobile apps  77   edit  Missed print dates Due to strikes  the regular edition of The New York Times was not printed during the following periods  78  December 9  1962 to March 31  1963  Only a western edition was printed due to the 1962 63 New York City newspaper strike  September 17  1965 to October 10  1965  An international edition was printed  and a weekend edition replaced the Saturday and Sunday papers  August 10  1978 to November 5  1978  A multi union strike shut down the three major New York City newspapers  No editions of The New York Times were printed  Two months into the strike  a parody of The New York Times called Not The New York Times was given out in New York  with contributors such as Carl Bernstein  Christopher Cerf  Tony Hendra and George Plimpton  No editions were printed on January 2 of 1852 1853 and of 1862 1867  No editions were printed on July 5 of 1861 1865   edit  Issues over coverage  edit  Political persuasion overall The New York Times has been variously described as having a liberal bias or described as being a liberal newspaper  79  80  According to a 2007 survey by Rasmussen Reports of public perceptions of major media outlets  40  believe The New York Times has a liberal slant and 11  believe it has a conservative slant  81  In December 2004 a University of California  Los Angeles study gave The New York Times a score of 73 7 on a 100 point scale  with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal  82  The validity of the study has been questioned by various organizations  including the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America  83  In mid 2004  the newspaper s then public editor  ombudsman   Daniel Okrent  wrote a piece in which he concluded that The New York Times did have a liberal bias in coverage of certain social issues such as permitting gay marriage  He stated that this bias reflected the paper s cosmopolitanism  which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City  Okrent did not comment at length on the issue of bias in coverage of  hard news   such as fiscal policy  foreign policy  or civil liberties  but did state that the paper s coverage of the Iraq war was insufficiently critical of the Bush administration  84   edit  On nations and ethnicities  edit  Iraq War Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overtly favorable to the Bush administration s position  for which The New York Times was forced to apologize  85  86  One of Miller s prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi  who after the U S  occupation became the interim oil minister of Iraq and is now head of the Iraqi Services Committee  87   edit  Israel coverage For its coverage of the Israeli Palestinian conflict  some have claimed that the paper is pro Palestinian  and others have claimed that it is pro Israel  88  89  A controversial book  The Israel Lobby and U S  Foreign Policy  by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt  alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even handed and is generally pro Israel  90  On the other hand  the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti Semitic  91  Prime Minister of Israel  Benjamin Netanyahu  has rejected a proposal to write an article for the paper on grounds of lack of objectivity  A note sent to the paper claimed that out of 20 opinion articles about Israel  19 have been critical of its policy  92  Another example presented  where Thomas Friedman commentated that praise awarded to Netanyahu during a speech at congress was  paid for by the Israel lobby   elicited an apology and clarification from its writer  93  The New York Times  public editor Clark Hoyt concluded in his January 10  2009  column   Though the most vociferous supporters of Israel and the Palestinians do not agree  I think The New York Times  largely barred from the battlefield and reporting amid the chaos of war  has tried its best to do a fair  balanced and complete job   and has largely succeeded    94   edit  Central America in 1980s Fairness and Accuracy
