Fixed wing aircraft From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia    Redirected from Airplanes  Jump to  navigation  search  Aeroplane  and  Airplane  redirect here  For other uses  see Aeroplane  disambiguation  and Airplane  disambiguation   A Boeing 737 airliner   an example of a fixed wing aircraft A fixed wing aircraft is an aircraft capable of flight using wings that generate lift due to the vehicle s forward airspeed and the shape of the wings  Fixed wing aircraft are distinct from rotary wing aircraft in which wings rotate about a fixed mast and ornithopters in which lift is generated by flapping wings  A powered fixed wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller is typically called an aeroplane  airplane  or simply a plane  Other types of powered fixed wing aircraft include powered paragliders and ground effect vehicles  Unpowered fixed wing aircraft  including gliders  paragliders  hang gliders and kites  can use moving air to gain height  Most fixed wing aircraft are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft  but some are designed to be remotely or computer controlled  Contents 1 Nomenclature 2 History 2 1 Kites 2 2 Gliders and

plural with no  s   The term fixed wing refers to non rotary wing aircraft  but the wings are not necessarily rigid  kites  hang gliders and historical aircraft using wing warping or where wings are progressively rotated or extended are all regarded as fixed wing aircraft  but flapping wings are not considered fixed   edit  History Main articles  Aviation history and Early flying machines  edit  Kites Kites were used approximately 2 800 years ago in China  where materials ideal for kite building were readily available  Alternatively  other authors hold that leaf kites existed far before that time in what is now Indonesia  based on their interpretation of cave paintings on Muna Island off Sulawesi  1  By at least 549 AD paper kites were being flown  as it was recorded in that year a paper kite was used as a message for a rescue mission  2  Ancient and medieval Chinese sources list other uses of kites for measuring distances  testing the wind  lifting men  signalling  and communication for military operations  2  The earliest known Chinese kites were flat  not bowed  and often rectangular  Later  tailless kites incorporated a stabilizing bowline  Boys flying a kite in 1828 Germany  by Johann Michael Voltz Stories of kites were brought to Europe by Marco Polo towards the end of the 13th century  and kites were brought back by sailors from Japan and Malaysia in the 16th and 17th centuries  3  Although they were initially regarded as mere curiosities  by the 18th and 19th centuries kites were being used as vehicles for scientific research  3  The period from 1860 to about 1910 became the  golden age of kiting   Kites started to be used for scientific purposes  especially in meteorology  aeronautics  wireless communications and photography  reliable manned kites were developed as well as power kites  World War II saw a limited use of kites for military purposes  see Focke Achgelis Fa 330 for example   Since then they are used mainly for recreation due to a vast improvement in technology   edit  Gliders and powered models Many stories from antiquity involve flight  such as the Greek legend of Icarus and Daedalus  and the Vimana in ancient Indian epics  Around 400 BC in Greece  Archytas was reputed to have designed and built the first artificial  self propelled flying device  a bird shaped model propelled by a jet of what was probably steam  said to have flown some 200 m  660 ft   4  5  This machine may have been suspended for its flight  6  7  Some of the earliest recorded attempts with gliders were those by the 9th century poet Abbas Ibn Firnas and the 11th century monk Eilmer of Malmesbury  both experiments injured their pilots  8 Leonardo da Vinci researched the wing design of birds and designed a man powered aircraft in his Codex on the Flight of Birds  1502   Le Bris and his glider  Albatros II  photographed by Nadar  1868 In 1799  Sir George Cayley set forth the concept of the modern aeroplane as a fixed wing flying machine with separate systems for lift  propulsion  and control  9  10  Cayley was building and flying models of fixed wing aircraft as early as 1803  and he built a successful passenger carrying glider in 1853  11  In 1856  Frenchman Jean Marie Le Bris made the first powered flight  by having his glider  L Albatros artificiel  pulled by a horse on a beach  citation needed  In 1883  the American John J  Montgomery made a controlled flight in a glider  citation needed  Other aviators who made similar flights at that time were Otto Lilienthal  Percy Pilcher  and Octave Chanute  Sir Hiram Maxim built a craft that weighed 3 5 tons  with a 110 foot  34 meter  wingspan that was powered by two 360 horsepower  270 kW  steam engines driving two propellers  In 1894  his machine was tested with overhead rails to prevent it from rising  The test showed that it had enough lift to take off  The craft was uncontrollable  which Maxim  it is presumed  realized  because he subsequently abandoned work on it  12  In the 1890s  Lawrence Hargrave conducted research on wing structures and developed a box kite that lifted the weight of a man  His box kite designs were widely adopted and became the prevalent type of aircraft until 1909  verification needed  Although he also developed a type of rotary aircraft engine  he did not create and fly a powered fixed wing aircraft  13  Between 1867 and 1896 the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal developed heavier than air flight  He was the first person to make well documented  repeated  successful gliding flights   edit  Powered flight Wright Flyer III piloted by Orville Wright over Huffman Prairie  October 4  1905 The Wright brothers flights in 1903 are recognized by the F d ration A ronautique Internationale  FAI   the standard setting and record keeping body for aeronautics  as  the first sustained and controlled heavier than air powered flight   14  By 1905  the Wright Flyer III was capable of fully controllable  stable flight for substantial periods  The Wright brothers credited Otto Lilienthal as a major inspiration for their decision to pursue manned flight  In 1906  Alberto Santos Dumont made what has been claimed as the first airplane flight unassisted by catapult 15  and set the first world record recognized by the A ro Club de France by flying 220 metres  720 ft  in less than 22 seconds  16  This flight was also certified by the FAI  17  18  The Bleriot VIII design of 1908 was an early aircraft design that had the modern monoplane tractor configuration  It had movable tail surfaces controlling both yaw and pitch  a form of roll control supplied either by wing warping or by ailerons and controlled by its pilot with a joystick and rudder bar  It was an important predecessor of his later Bleriot XI Channel crossing aircraft of the summer of 1909  19  World War I served as a testbed for the use of the aircraft as a weapon  Initially seen by the generals as a  toy   aircraft demonstrated their potential as mobile observation platforms  then proved themselves to be machines of war capable of causing casualties to the enemy  The earliest known aerial victory with a synchronised machine gun armed fighter aircraft occurred in 1915  by German Luftstreitkr fte Leutnant Kurt Wintgens  Fighter aces appeared  the greatest  by number of air victories  was Manfred von Richthofen  Following WWI  aircraft technology continued to develop  Alcock and Brown crossed the Atlantic non stop for the first time in 1919  The first commercial flights took place between the United States and Canada in 1919  Aircraft had a presence in all the major battles of World War II  They were an essential component of the military strategies of the period  such as the German Blitzkrieg or the American and Japanese aircraft carrier campaigns of the Pacific  The first jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He 178  which was tested in 1939  In 1943  the Messerschmitt Me 262  the first jet fighter aircraft  went into service in the German Luftwaffe  In October 1947  the Bell X 1 was the first aircraft to exceed the speed of sound  citation needed  In 1948 49  aircraft transported supplies during the Berlin Blockade  New aircraft types  such as the B 52  were produced during the Cold War  The first jet airliner  the de Havilland Comet  was introduced in 1952  The Boeing 707  the first widely successful commercial jet  was in commercial service for more than 50 years  from 1958 to 2010  The Boeing 747 was the world s biggest passenger aircraft from 1970 until it was surpassed by the Airbus A380 in 2005   edit  Classes of fixed wing aircraft  edit  Airplane aeroplane An airplane  also known as an aeroplane or simply a plane  is a powered fixed wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller  Planes come in a variety of sizes  shapes  and wing configurations  The broad spectrum of uses for planes includes recreation  transportation of goods and people  military  and research   edit  Etymology and usage First attested in English in late 19th century  the word aeroplane derives from the French a roplane  which comes from the Greek      a r    air  20    either Latin planus   level   21  or Greek         planos    wandering   22  23   Aeroplane  originally referred just to the wing  as it is a plane moving through the air  24  In an example of synecdoche  the word for the wing came to refer to the entire aircraft  In the United Kingdom and most of the Commonwealth  the term aeroplane is used for powered fixed wing aircraft  In the United States and Canada  the term airplane is applied to these aircraft   edit  Overview An IAI Heron   an unmanned aerial vehicle with a twin boom configuration Below is an overview of the most common structures  controls  and instruments of planes  Note that many gliders or sailplanes exhibit the same variety in structure  and share many of the same controls and instruments  Structure The most common configuration of a plane includes  A fuselage  a long  thin body  often cylindrical  and usually with tapered or rounded ends to make its shape aerodynamically smooth  The fuselage may contain the flight crew  passengers  cargo or payload  fuel and engines the aircraft is designed for or they may be attached to it  The pilots of manned aircraft operate them from a cockpit located at the front or top of the fuselage and equipped with controls and usually windows and instruments  A plane may have more than one fuselage  or it may be fitted with booms with the tail located between the booms to allow the extreme rear of the fuselage to be useful for a variety of purposes  A Tornado F3 with variable sweep wings in the swept back position A large horizontal wing with an airfoil cross section shape  The wing deflects air downward as the plane moves forward  generating lifting force to support it in flight  The wing also stabilises the plane s roll  tilt left or right   and the wing mounted ailerons control rotation about the roll axis  A wide variety of wing configurations  e g   multiplane aircraft and delta wing planform  have been used  The An 225 Mriya  which can carry a 250 tonne payload  has two vertical stabilisers  A vertical stabiliser a vertical surface mounted at the rear of the plane and typically protruding above it  The vertical stabilizer stabilises the plane s yaw  turn left or right  and mounts the rudder which controls its rotation along that axis  A horizontal stabiliser or elevator  or tailplane  mounted at the tail of the plane  near the vertical stabilizer  The horizontal stabilizer is used to stabilise the plane s pitch  tilt up or down  and mounts the elevators which provide pitch control  A fixed portion of the elevators may be omitted in which case it is termed an all flying tail  Some planes use a front mounted canard instead of a rear mounted horizontal stabilizer  One or more engines that provide thrust to push the plane forward through the air  The most common propulsion units are propellers  powered by reciprocating or turbine engines  and jet engines  which provide thrust directly from the engine and usually also from a large fan mounted within the engine   The Blohm  amp  Voss BV 141 is unusual in being asymmetrical  Landing gear  a set of wheels  skids  or floats that support the plane while it is on the surface  On seaplanes the bottom of the fuselage or floats  pontoons  support it while on the water  On some planes the landing gear retract during flight to reduce drag  There are many different configurations of planes  A plane may have two or more fuselages  or additional pods or booms  Some planes have more than one horizontal or vertical stabilizer  while V tail planes combine the horizontal and vertical stabilizers into a pair of diagonal surfaces  While all of the above items are essential   there have been planes flown that have dispensed with any one of the components listed  by modifying other components to fulfill the missing components function  A flying wing plane has no discernible fuselage structure and horizontal or vertical stabilizers  though it may have small blisters or pods  The opposite of this is a lifting body which has no wings  though it may have small stabilising and control surfaces  Delta wing planes often dispense with the horizontal stabilizer and a few planes have even dispensed with the vertical stabilizer  Most planes are largely symmetrical along a plane of symmetry  excepting the propeller and minor alterations to counteract the effects of the spinning propeller  Controls Main article  Aircraft flight control system Typical light aircraft cockpit with control yokes A number of controls allow pilots to direct planes in the air  The controls found in a typical plane are as follows  A yoke or joystick  which controls rotation of the plane about the pitch and roll axes  A yoke resembles a steering wheel  and a control stick is a joystick  The pilot can pitch the plane down by pushing on the yoke or stick  and pitch the plane up by pulling on it  Rolling the plane is accomplished by turning the yoke in the direction of the desired roll  or by tilting the control stick in that direction  Pitch changes are used to adjust the altitude and speed of the plane  roll changes assist the plane in turning in conjunction with the rudder  Control sticks and yokes are usually positioned between the pilot s legs  however  a sidestick is a type of control stick that is positioned on either side of the pilot  Jet trainer cockpit showing stick and instruments Modern glass cockpit   the screens display the same information as dials would have Rudder pedals  which control rotation of the plane about the yaw axis  There are two pedals that pivot so that when one is pressed forward the other moves backward  and vice versa  The pilot presses on the right rudder pedal to make the plane yaw to the right  and on the left pedal to make it yaw to the left  The rudder is used mainly to balance the plane in turns  or to compensate for winds or other effects that tend to turn the plane about the yaw axis  Several planes including the Ercoupe dispensed with rudder pedals by linking the rudders to the ailerons for simplicity  A Throttle or thrust lever for each engine  These control the power produced by the engines and hence airspeed  On piston engine powered planes Engine Mixture Control levers will also be present  Brakes  used to slow and stop the plane on the ground  and sometimes for turns on the ground  These were largely standardized during World War I   prior to which many plane manufacturers had their own systems  Other controls can include  Flap levers  which are used to control the position of flaps on the wings  Spoiler levers  which are used to control the position of spoilers on the wings  and to arm their automatic deployment in planes designed to deploy them upon landing  The spoilers reduce lift for landing  Trim controls  which usually take the form of knobs or wheels and are used to adjust pitch  roll  or yaw trim  These are often connected to small airfoils on the trail edge of the control surfaces called  trim tabs   Trim is used to reduce the amount of pressure on the control forces needed to maintain a steady course  A tiller  a small wheel or lever used to steer the plane on the ground in conjunction with or instead of the rudder pedals  primarily found on larger aircraft   Undercarriage retraction levers  to raise or lower the undercarriage  for reduced drag while in flight  A parking brake  used to prevent the plane from rolling when it is parked on the ground  The controls may allow full or partial automation of flight  such as an autopilot  a wing leveler  or a flight management system  Pilots adjust these controls to select a specific attitude or mode of flight  and then the associated automation maintains that attitude or mode until the pilot disables the automation or changes the settings  In general  the larger and or more complex the plane  the greater the amount of automation available to pilots  On a plane with a pilot and copilot  or instructor and trainee  the plane is made capable of control without the crew changing seats  The most common arrangement is two complete sets of controls  one for each of two pilots sitting side by side  but in some planes  military fighter aircraft  some taildraggers and aerobatic aircraft  the dual sets of controls are arranged one in front of the other  in tandem   A few of the less important controls may not be present in both positions  and one position is usually intended for the pilot in command  e g   the left  captain s seat  in jet airliners   Some small planes use controls that can be moved from one position to another  such as a single yoke that can be swung into position in front of either the left seat pilot or the right seat pilot  e g   Beechcraft Bonanza   Planes that require more than one pilot usually have controls and displays intended to suit each pilot position  but still with sufficient duplication so that any of the pilots can fly the plane alone in an emergency  For example  in jet airliners  the controls on the left  captain s  side include both the basic controls and those normally manipulated by the pilot in command  such as the tiller  whereas those of the right  first officer s  side include the basic controls again and those normally manipulated by the copilot  such as flap levers  The unduplicated controls that are required for flight are positioned so that they can be reached by either pilot  but they are often designed to be more convenient to the pilot who manipulates them under normal conditions  An unmanned aircraft is controlled remotely or via means such as gyroscopes or other forms of autonomous control  Instruments Instruments provide information to the pilot and the co pilot  Flight instruments provide information about the plane s speed  direction  altitude  and orientation  Powerplant instruments provide information about the status of the plane s engines and APU  Systems instruments provide information about the plane s other systems  such as fuel delivery  electrical  and pressurisation  Navigation and communication instruments include all the plane s radios  Instruments may operate mechanically or electrically  requiring 12VDC  24VDC  or 400 Hz power systems  25  A plane that uses computerised CRT or LCD displays almost exclusively is said to have a glass cockpit  Six basic flight instruments The six basic instruments  sometimes referred to as the six pack  include  26  An airspeed indicator  which indicates the speed at which the plane is moving through the surrounding air  An altimeter  which indicates the altitude or height of the plane above mean sea level  A heading indicator   sometimes referred to as a  directional gyro  DG     which indicates the magnetic compass heading that the plane s fuselage is pointing towards  The actual direction the plane is flying towards is affected by the wind conditions  An attitude indicator  sometimes called an artificial horizon  which indicates the exact orientation of the plane about its pitch and roll axes  A vertical speed indicator  which shows the rate at which the plane is climbing or descending  A turn coordinator  or turn and bank indicator which helps the pilot maintain the plane in a coordinated attitude while turning  Other instruments might include  A 2 way radio to enable communications with other planes and air traffic control  Planes built before World War II may not have been equipped with a radio but they are nearly essential now  A horizontal situation indicator  shows the position and movement of the plane as seen from above with respect to the ground  including course heading and other information  Instruments showing the status of each engine in the plane  operating speed  thrust  temperature  rpms  and other variables   Combined display systems such as primary flight displays or navigation displays  Information displays such as on board weather radar displays  A radio direction finder which indicates the direction to one or more radio beacons and which can be used to determine the plane s position  A satellite navigation system to provide an accurate position  Design and construction Main article  Aerospace manufacturer This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   May 2009  Most planes are constructed by companies with the objective of producing them in quantity for customers  The design and planning process  including safety tests  can last up to four years for small turboprops  and up to 12 years for planes with the capacity of the A380  During this process  the objectives and design specifications of the plane are established  First the construction company uses drawings and equations  simulations  wind tunnel tests and experience to predict the behavior of the plane  Computers are used by companies to draw  plan and do initial simulations of the plane  Small models and mockups of all or certain parts of the plane are then tested in wind tunnels to verify its aerodynamics  When the design has passed through these processes  the company constructs a limited number of these planes for testing on the ground  Representatives from an aviation governing agency often make a first flight  The flight tests continue until the plane has fulfilled all the requirements  Then  the governing public agency of aviation of the country authorises the company to begin production of the plane  In the United States  this agency is the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA   and in the European Union  Joint Aviation Authorities  JAA   In Canada  the public agency in charge and authorising the mass production of planes is Transport Canada  In the case of the international sales of planes  a license from the public agency of aviation or transports of the country where the plane is also to be used is necessary  For example  planes from Airbus need to be certified by the FAA to be flown in the United States and vice versa  planes of Boeing need to be approved by the JAA to be flown in the European Union  Quieter planes are becoming more and more needed due to the increase in air traffic  particularly over urban areas  as aircraft noise pollution is a major concern  Small planes can be designed and constructed by amateurs as homebuilts  Other homebuilt aircraft can be assembled using pre manufactured kits of parts that can be assembled into a basic plane and must then be completed by the builder  There are few companies that produce planes on a large scale  However  the production of a plane for one company is a process that actually involves dozens  or even hundreds  of other companies and plants  that produce the parts that go into the plane  For example  one company can be responsible for the production of the landing gear  while another one is responsible for the radar  The production of such parts is not limited to the same city or country  in the case of large plane manufacturing companies  such parts can come from all over the world  The parts are sent to the main plant of the plane company  where the production line is located  In the case of large planes  production lines dedicated to the assembly of certain parts of the plane can exist  especially the wings and the fuselage  When complete  a plane is rigorously inspected to search for imperfections and defects  After approval by inspectors  the plane is put through a series of flight tests to assure that all systems are working correctly and that the plane handles properly  Upon passing these tests  the plane is ready to receive the  final touchups   internal configuration  painting  etc    and is then ready for the customer   edit  Number of wings Main article  Wing configuration Monoplanes Captured Morane Saulnier L wire braced parasol monoplane A monoplane has one main set of wing surfaces  which contrasts with a biplane or triplane  Since the late 1930s the monoplane has been the most common form of plane  The earliest monoplanes were braced with wires running outside the wing  however  lack of knowledge concerning the stresses a wing was subject to resulted in many failures  and in the United Kingdom the Royal Flying Corps banned their use  The cantilever low wing Curtiss P 40 The airfoil sections in use at the time were very thin  and could not have a cantilever structure installed within and so attempts were made to provide a stronger structure by adding an external truss   structurally a biplane  but lacking the lower wing  This configuration adds a lot of drag  Junkers began experimenting with thicker airfoils  which had previously been ignored as being unlikely to be efficient  With the thicker airfoils  a cantilever structure contained entirely within the wing was possible  and it had the added bonus that thick airfoils were more efficient than the thin ones previously in use  The defeat of Germany  where all of the research into cantilever monoplanes was occurring  and conservatism in the aviation industry ensured that biplanes would continue to dominate for the next 20 years  Monoplanes can be differentiated in where the wings attach to the fuselage  the actual point of attachment is called the wing root  They are generally divided into those where the wing is joined at the bottom of the fuselage  part way up the fuselage  mounted above the fuselage middle  level with the top of the fuselage  or above the fuselage  Biplanes Reproduction of a Sopwith Camel biplane A biplane has two main wings  with one directly above the other  The Wright brothers  Wright Flyer used a biplane design  as did most aircraft in the early years of aviation  The primary reason many early planes were biplanes was that the two wing configuration had a structural advantage over monoplanes  since both wings formed a Pratt truss  which was immensely strong  Due to the struts and the extra lifting surface  however  biplanes produce more drag and thus tend to be slower  Some later biplanes replaced the Pratt truss with a Warren truss which reduced the drag associated with the struts  however it wasn t enough to keep it competitive with cantilever monoplanes which superseded it for most purposes in the late 1930s  Its compact span for a given lifting area allows for great maneuverability and it is still used for aerobatics aircraft and crop dusting  A sesquiplane is a specific type of biplane  where the  usually  lower wing is significantly smaller than the upper wing  Triplanes and multiplanes Flyable reproduction of a Fokker Dr I triplane aircraft of World War I A triplane is equipped with three vertically stacked wing planes  Tailplanes and canard foreplanes are not included in this count unless they overlap with other wings  nor usually are airfoil fairing on axles  Only a very small number of triplanes were ever built  but the format does have the advantage of allowing an aircraft a high degree of maneuverability combined with a very good climb rate  Due to the drag  however  as with biplanes  this type is obsolete and almost never used except in recreations  such as the Fokker Dr I and Sopwith Triplane  A multiplane has more than three wings  but is a rarely used format  as all of the disadvantages of the triplane are even more pronounced   edit  Wing geometry Main article  Wing Straight wing A straight wing is a wing planform in which the centre of lift across the wing forms a straight line from wingtip to wingtip  or nearly so  This was the dominant form of wing until early transsonic aircraft adopted swept wings to reduce transsonic drag  Modern fighters were able to readopt straight wings thanks to advances in both aircraft structures and aerodynamic high lift devices  Swept wing A swept wing is a wing planform is which the wings are angled backwards so that the tips are closer to the tail than the roots  resembling an arrow  This was done to reduce the drag associated when approaching supersonic speeds and is the form primarily used on airliners and other jet transports  A variant of the swept wing is the forward swept wing in which the wings are angled forwards  This has serious structural implications and so hasn t been used very much  but has been tried because a regular swept wing has poor stall characteristics  When an aircraft s lift is less than what is required for it to continue flying and stalls  ideally the nose should drop  which allows the aircraft to regain flying speed  In a swept wing aircraft  the normal result of a stall is for the nose to go up  making recovery difficult  Variable geometry Two Dassault Mirage G prototypes  one with wings swept Variable geometry aircraft have wing configurations that can be changed in flight  A variable sweep wing is a wing that may be swept back and then returned to its original position during flight  While variable sweep provides many advantages  particularly in takeoff distance  load carrying ability  and the fast  low level penetration role  the configuration imposes a considerable penalty in weight and complexity  The advent of relaxed stability flight control systems in the 1970s negated many of the disadvantages of a fixed platform  No new variable sweep wing aircraft have been built since the Tu 160  A variable camber wing changes the camber of the airfoil  and varies the area and camber of the wing  The various flaps and slats on the control surfaces of modern commercial airliners perform a similar function  Oblique wing on a NASA AD 1 A variable incidence wing has an adjustable angle of incidence  the angle between the wing and the fuselage  in order to reduce landing and take off distances  The necessary components add extra weight to the aircraft and increase maintenance costs so only a few aircraft designs  most notably the Martin XB 51 and F 8 Crusader  have used variable incidence wings  An oblique wing  also called a slew wing  is a variable geometry wing concept  On an aircraft so equipped  the wing is designed to rotate on center pivot  so that one tip is swept forward while the opposite tip is swept aft  By changing its sweep angle in this way  drag can be reduced at high speed  with the wing swept  without sacrificing low speed performance  with the wing perpendicular   Delta wing The delta wing Avro Vulcan bomber A delta wing is a wing planform in the form of a triangle  It is named for its similarity in shape to the Greek uppercase letter delta     and has many advantages over other configurations  The delta wing has more internal volume to carry fuel or internal weapons than a wing of a similar thickness to chord ratio  while also allowing wing loading to be reduced for the amount of drag produced in level flight  If its leading edge is raked back enough  it will escape the shock wave formed at the nose of the aircraft as transonic speeds are reached  reducing drag considerably  and the center of lift moves less than on conventionally configured aircraft  reducing trim drag  27  As the angle of attack increases  the leading edge of the wing generates a vortex which smooths the airflow  giving the delta a very high stall angle at the cost of high induced drag which allows a larger range in speed than a conventional wing intended for high speed flight  Pure delta wings fell out of favour somewhat due to poor gust response characteristics at low altitudes  they get bounced around a lot and so must fly slower and higher  and advances in high lift devices  however many of the advantages have been retained by use of leading edge root extensions  which act in the same manner and many modern fighter aircraft  such as the JAS 39 Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon use a delta wing  often in conjunction with a canard   edit  Airframe configuration Canard Main article  Canard  aeronautics  Canards on the Saab Viggen Canard is an airframe configuration in which the forward surface is smaller than the rearward  the former being known as the  canard   while the latter is the main wing  In contrast  a conventional aircraft has a small horizontal stabilizer behind the main wing  28  29  30  Canard designs fall into two main classes  the lifting canard and the control canard  31  With a lifting canard  the weight of the aircraft is shared between the main wing and the canard wing  In the control canard  most of the weight of the aircraft is carried by the main wing and the canard wing is used primarily for longitudinal control during maneuvering  Thus  a control canard mostly operates only as a control surface and is usually at zero angle of attack  Tandem wing Main article  Tandem wing A tandem wing aircraft A tandem wing aircraft has two sets of wings  arranged one in front of the other rather than overlapping each other  NASA research has shown that they must be of different lifting characteristics otherwise a severe oscillation will develop  which has limited their use  A tandem wing can be distinguished from a canard by the location of the pitch controls  elevators  on the rear flying surface  A tandem wing may have the front wing larger than the rear  or the reverse  They have the advantage of normally using fewer struts than biplanes  but the induced drag of having multiple wings is still present  though interactions between the wings may reduce this over a conventional biplane  Flying wing Main article  Flying wing The US produced B 2 Spirit  a strategic bomber using a flying wing configuration which is capable of intercontinental missions A flying wing is a tailless aircraft which has no definite fuselage  with most of the crew  payload and equipment being housed inside the main wing structure  28  The flying wing configuration was studied extensively in the 1930s and 1940s  notably by Jack Northrop and Cheston L  Eshelman in the United States  and Alexander Lippisch and the Horten brothers in Germany  After the war  a number of experimental designs were based on the flying wing concept  but the known difficulties remained intractable  Some general interest continued until the early 1950s but designs did not necessarily offer a great advantage in range and presented a number of technical problems  leading to the adoption of  conventional  solutions like the Convair B 36 and the B 52 Stratofortress  Due to the practical need for a deep wing  the flying wing concept is most practical for designs in the slow to medium speed range  and there has been continual interest in using it as a tactical airlifter design  Interest in flying wings was renewed in the 1980s due to their potentially low radar reflection cross sections  Stealth technology relies on shapes which only reflect radar waves in certain directions  thus making the aircraft hard to detect unless the radar receiver is at a specific position relative to the aircraft   a position that changes continuously as the aircraft moves  This approach eventually led to the Northrop B 2 Spirit stealth bomber  In this case the aerodynamic advantages of the flying wing are not the primary needs  However  modern computer controlled fly by wire systems allowed for many of the aerodynamic drawbacks of the flying wing to be minimised  making for an efficient and stable long range bomber  Blended wing body Main article  Blended wing Computer generated model of the Boeing X 48 Blended wing body aircraft have a flattened and airfoil shaped body  which produces most of the lift to keep itself aloft  and distinct and separate wing structures  though the wings are smoothly blended in with the body  Thus blended wing bodied aircraft incorporate design features from both a futuristic fuselage and flying wing design  The purported advantages of the blended wing body approach are efficient high lift wings and a wide airfoil shaped body  This enables the entire craft to contribute to lift generation with the result of potentially increased fuel economy  Lifting body The Martin Aircraft Company X 24 was built as part of a 1963 to 1975 experimental US military program  Main article  Lifting body A lifting body is a configuration in which the body itself produces lift  In contrast to a flying wing  which is a wing with minimal or no conventional fuselage  a lifting body can be thought of as a fuselage with little or no conventional wing  Whereas a flying wing seeks to maximize cruise efficiency at subsonic speeds by eliminating non lifting surfaces  lifting bodies generally minimize the drag and structure of a wing for subsonic  supersonic  and hypersonic flight  or  spacecraft re entry  All of these flight regimes pose challenges for proper flight stability  Lifting bodies were a major area of research in the 1960s and 70s as a means to build a small and lightweight manned spacecraft  The US built a number of famous lifting body rocket planes to test the concept  as well as several rocket launched re entry vehicles that were tested over the Pacific  Interest waned as the US Air Force lost interest in the manned mission  and major development ended during the Space Shuttle design process when it became clear that the highly shaped fuselages made it difficult to fit fuel tankage   edit  Propulsion See also  Powered aircraft and Aircraft engine Propeller engines An Antonov An 2 biplane Smaller and older propeller planes make use of reciprocating engines  or piston engines  to turn a propeller to create thrust  The amount of thrust a propeller creates is determined by its disk area   the area in which the blades rotate  If the area is too small  efficiency is poor  and if the area is large  the propeller must rotate at a very low speed to avoid going supersonic and creating a lot of noise  and not much thrust  Because of this limitation  propellers are favoured for planes which travel at below mach  5  while jets are a better choice above that speed  Propeller engines may be quieter than jet engines  though not always  and may cost less to purchase maintain and so remain common on light general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna 172  Larger modern propeller planes such as the Dash 8 use a jet engine to turn the propeller  primarily because an equivalent piston engine in power output would be much larger and more complex  Jet engines The Concorde supersonic airliner Jet aircraft are propelled by jet engines  which are used because the aerodynamic limitations of propellers do not apply to jet propulsion  These engines are much more powerful than a reciprocating engine for a given size or weight and are comparatively quiet and work well at higher altitude  Most modern jet planes use turbofan jet engines which balance the advantages of a propeller  while retaining the exhaust speed and power of a jet  This is essentially a ducted propeller attached to a jet engine  much like a turboprop  but with a smaller diameter  When installed on an airliner  it is efficient so long as it remains below the speed of sound  or subsonic   Jet fighters and other supersonic aircraft that do not spend a great deal of time supersonic also often use turbofans  but to function  air intake ducting is needed to slow the air down so that when it arrives at the front of the turbofan  it is subsonic  When passing through the engine  it is then re accelerated back to supersonic speeds  To further boost the power output  fuel is dumped into the exhaust stream  where it ignites  This is called an afterburner and has been used on both pure jet aircraft and turbojet aircraft although it is only normally used on combat aircraft due to the amount of fuel consumed  and even then may only be used for short periods of time  Supersonic airliners  e g  Concorde  are no longer in use largely because flight at supersonic speed creates a sonic boom which is prohibited in most heavily populated areas  and because of the much higher consumption of fuel supersonic flight requires  Jet aircraft possess high cruising speeds  700 to 900 km h  430 to 560 mph   and high speeds for takeoff and landing  150 to 250 km h  93 to 160 mph    Due to the speed needed for takeoff and landing  jet aircraft use flaps and leading edge devices to control of lift and speed  Many also use thrust reversers to slow down the aircraft upon landing  Electric engines An electric aircraft runs on electric motors rather than internal combustion engines  with electricity coming from fuel cells  solar cells  ultracapacitors  power beaming  32  or batteries  Currently  flying electric aircraft are mostly experimental demonstrators  including manned and unmanned aerial vehicles  Rocket engines Bell X 1 in flight  1947 In World War II  the Germans deployed the Me 163 Komet rocket powered aircraft  The first plane to break the sound barrier in level flight was a rocket plane   the Bell X 1  The later North American X 15 broke many speed and altitude records and laid much of the groundwork for later aircraft and spacecraft design  Rocket aircraft are not in common usage today  although rocket assisted take offs are used for some military aircraft  Recent rocket aircraft include the SpaceShipOne and the XCOR EZ Rocket  Ramjet and scramjet engines Artist s concept of X 43A with scramjet attached to the underside A ramjet is a form of jet engine that contains no major moving parts and can be particularly useful in applications requiring a small and simple engine for high speed use  such as missiles  The D 21 Tagboard was an Mach 3  reconnaissance drone that was cancelled in 1971  The SR 71 s engines ran 80  as ramjets at high speeds  Scramjet aircraft are in the experimental stage  A scramjet has a very simple engine design  It works by air being forced into one side of a tube like engine  That air is ignited by fuel  causing it to come out hotter and faster on the other side  This engine requires high speed in order to work  but it is suitable for the speeds at which it travels  The NASA X 43 is an experimental unmanned scramjet with a world speed record for a jet powered aircraft   Mach 9 7  nearly 12 000 kilometres per hour  7 500 mph  at an altitude of about 36 000 metres  118 000 ft   The X 43A set the flight speed record in 2004   edit  Safety Main article  Air safety When risk is measured by deaths per passenger kilometer  air travel is approximately 10 times safer than travel by bus or rail  However  when using the deaths per journey statistic  air travel is significantly more dangerous than car  rail  or bus travel  33  Air travel insurance is relatively expensive for this reason  insurers generally use the deaths per journey statistic  34  There is a significant difference between the safety of airliners and that of smaller private planes  with the per mile statistic indicating that airliners are 8 3 times safer than smaller planes  35   edit  Powered paraglider Main article  Powered paragliding Powered paragliding  also known as paramotoring  is a form of ultralight aviation where the pilot wears a motor on his back  a paramotor  which provides enough thrust to take off using an adapted paraglider or paramotor wing  As in paragliding  the pilot of a powered paraglider sits suspended beneath the inflated paraglider wing during flight   edit  Ground effect vehicle Main article  Ground effect vehicle A ground effect vehicle is an aircraft that attains level flight near the surface of the earth  making use of the ground effect   an aerodynamic interaction between the wings and the earth s surface   edit  Glider A glider  sailplane  being winch launched Main article  Glider  aircraft  Gliders are heavier than air craft that are supported in flight by the dynamic reaction of the air against their lifting surfaces  and whose free flight does not depend on an engine  Some gliders have engines for extending their flights and some have engines powerful enough to launch  As is the case with planes  there are a wide variety of glider types differing in the construction of their wings  aerodynamic efficiency  location of the pilot and controls  Gliders are principally used recreationally  but are also used for recovering spacecraft  Perhaps the most familiar type is the paper plane  After launch  further energy is obtained through the skillful exploitation of rising air in the atmosphere  Gliders that are used for the sport of gliding have high aerodynamic efficiency  The highest lift to drag ratio is 70 1  though 50 1 is more common  Glider flights of thousands of kilometres at average speeds over 200 km h have been achieved  The glider is most commonly launched by a tow plane or by a winch  Some gliders  called motor gliders  are equipped with engines  often retractable   and some are capable of self launching  The most numerous unpowered aircraft are hang gliders and paragliders  These are foot launched and are in general slower  smaller  and less expensive than sailplanes  Hang gliders most often have flexible wings given shape by a frame  though some have rigid wings  Paragliders have no frames in their wings  Military gliders have been used in war to deliver assault troops  and specialised gliders have been used in atmospheric and aerodynamic research  Rocket powered aircraft and spaceplanes have also made unpowered landings  Gliders and sailplanes can share a number of features in common with powered aircraft  including many of the same types of fuselage and wing structures  For example  the Horten H IV was a tailless flying wing glider  and the delta wing shaped orbiter of the Space Shuttle flew much like a conventional glider in the lower atmosphere  Many gliders also use similar controls and instruments as powered craft   edit  Paraglider Main article  Paraglider A paraglider is a lightweight  free flying  foot launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure  36  The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a hollow fabric wing whose shape is formed by its suspension lines  the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside  Paragliding is most often a recreational activity   edit  Hang glider Main article  Hang glider A hang glider  also known as Delta plane or Deltaplane  is a glider aircraft in which the pilot is ensconced in a harness suspended from the airframe  and exercises control by shifting body weight in opposition to a control frame  Most modern hang gliders are made of an aluminium alloy or composite framed fabric wing  Pilots have the ability to soar for hours  gain thousands of metres of altitude in thermal updrafts  perform aerobatics  and glide cross country for hundreds of kilometres   edit  Kite A kite in flight Main article  Kite A kite is a tethered fixed wing aircraft  37  The necessary lift that makes the kite wing fly is typically generated when air flows over and under the kite s wing  producing low pressure above the wing and high pressure below it  This deflection also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind  The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of the one or more lines or tethers attached to the wing  Kites may be flown for recreational  artistic  or other purposes   edit  See also Aviation portal Aircraft flight mechanics Airliner Aviation Aviation and the environment Aviation history Fuel
