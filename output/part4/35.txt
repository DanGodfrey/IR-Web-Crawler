the Silver Age After achieving great success in 1956 in reviving the Golden Age character The Flash  DC editor Julius Schwartz looked toward recreating the Green Lantern from the Golden Age of Comic Books  citation needed  Like The Flash  Schwartz wanted this new character to have a different secret identity  origin  and personality than his 1940s counterpart  A long time science fiction fan and literary agent  Schwartz wanted a more sci fi based Green Lantern  as opposed to the mystical powers of Alan Scott  the forties Green Lantern  He enlisted writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane  who in 1959 would reintroduce Green Lantern to the world in Showcase  22  September October 1959   The character was a success  and it was quickly decided to follow up his three issue run on Showcase with a self titled series  Green Lantern  1 began in July August 1960 and would continue until  84 in April May 1972  Cover to Showcase  22  October 1959   the first appearance of Hal Jordan  Art by Gil Kane  This creative team was responsible for introducing many of the major characters in Hal Jordan s life  First and foremost was Carol Ferris  Jordan s love interest  She was in charge of Ferris Aircraft  and as such  Hal s boss  While she preferred Green Lantern to Hal Jordan  she took an active role in trying to win him over  even going so far as to propose to him in the old Leap Year tradition  Although she gave Jordan some attention  her job and company always came first  Ferris was a strong willed woman of authority at a time when this was rare  especially in comic books  Another unique addition to Green Lantern s supporting cast was his best friend  Tom Kalmaku  who was both Hal s mechanic and the chronicler of his super hero adventures  after succeeding in working out his identity  An Inuit  Eskimo  from Alaska  Tom s nickname was  Pie  or  Pieface   in reference to Eskimo Pie ice cream sandwiches  Like  Chop Chop  from the Blackhawk comics  this nickname is today understandably viewed as racist and has been downplayed by most modern writers  citation needed  However  unlike  Chop Chop   Tom was actually a competent and intelligent character with a well rounded personality  not a stereotypical buffoon  Despite the unfortunate nickname  Tom Kalmaku was among the first minority characters to be portrayed in this manner and broke new ground for mainstream comic books  Tom would later be followed by another trail blazing minority character  John Stewart  the first African American super hero of the DC Universe  Jordan s masters  the mysterious Guardians of the Universe  were physically based on David Ben Gurion  the first Prime Minister of Israel  and were developed from an idea Schwartz and Broome had originally conceived years prior in a story featuring Captain Comet in Strange Adventures  22  July  1952  entitled  Guardians of the Clockwork Universe   3  Schwartz and company also allowed Jordan to have a family  which was another rare thing at this time in superhero comics  While he didn t have a wife or children of his own  he had many interactions with his two older brothers  Jack  a district attorney  and Jim  a more comical figure  A reporter  Sue Williams  suspected Jim of being Green Lantern due to his appearance and his reputation of being scatterbrained  Starting in issue  17  Gardner Fox joined the book to share writing duties with John Broome  The quartet of Schwartz  Broome  Fox  and Kane remained the core creative team until 1970   edit   Relevant comics  Starting with issue  76  Dennis O Neil took over scripting and Neal Adams  who had drawn the cover of issue  63  became the series  artist  This issue is one of the comics which is considered to have ushered in the Bronze Age of Comic Books  citation needed  The collaboration of O Neil and Adams produced the most famous and celebrated runs on Green Lantern  citation needed  Julius Schwartz remained editor and hand selected the two citation needed  to revitalize the title  the sales of which had been slipping  O Neil and Adams had already begun preparation for the classic run in the form of their re workings of another DC superhero  the archer Green Arrow  Three panels ushering in the O Neil Adams run in Green Lantern  76  Wanting to represent his own political beliefs in comics and take on social issues of the late sixties and early seventies  O Neil devised the idea of pitting Hal Jordan  who as an intergalactic cop stood for not only law and order but The Establishment  against Oliver Queen  Green Arrow   who O Neil had characterized as an outspoken liberal and stood for the counter culture movement  citation needed  The first issue he wrote had Green Lantern capturing a street punk who was pushing around a man  All around him  people start throwing things at the bewildered Jordan  As he steps in to attack  he is stopped by Green Arrow  who explains that the man he defended was a slum lord and goes even further to show Lantern the conditions of the slum  At the roof  in a now famous scene  an elderly African American man grills Jordan as to why he allowed segregation against African Americans to continue on Earth  when he saved  the orange skins  and  the purple skins  from exactly that  Following Schwartz s approval of the story  Neal Adams was brought in to replace Kane  much to O Neil s surprise  The pair had previously done a Batman  where Adams successfully reconstructed the character into a more dramatic  Dark Knight    and Adams had redesigned Green Arrow s costume  The pair tackled a social issues including corruption  sexism  cults  consumerism  the environment  racism  poverty  and even  subtly  child molestation  citation needed  However  none were more shocking and controversial citation needed  than the issue explored in the famous  Snowbirds Don t Fly  issues  85 and  86  Neal Adams drew the cover  which showed Green Arrow s youthful side kick  Speedy  shooting heroin  Editor Julius Schwartz did not want it published  citation needed  Neither did publisher Carmine Infantino  citation needed  But over at Marvel Comics  Stan Lee had green lit The Amazing Spider Man  96  which featured pills and presented an anti drug message without the Comics Code Authority seal  Facing opposition and controversy  the Comics Code Authority revised its rules in regard to what could and could not be presented in comic books and  while still restrictive  became more lenient  As a result  citation needed  DC Comics approved Adams  cover and O Neil wrote a two part story involving drugs with Speedy being hooked  New York Mayor John V  Lindsay wrote a letter to DC Comics in response to the issue commending them  which was printed in issue  86  Due to low sales Green Lantern Green Arrow was cancelled  Schwartz had a reprint of an older story published for issue  88 and saw the comic he began back in 1959 come to an end in 1972 with issue  89  However  he had O Neil and Adams do one last story together  stretched out over Flash  217 219 as a backup story  Green Lantern continued to appear in backup stories of Flash from 1972 until the Green Lantern title was resumed in 1976   edit  1980s exile From Green Lantern  151  April 1982  until  172  January 1984   Jordan was exiled into space for a year by the Guardians in order to prove his loyalty to the Green Lantern Corps  having been accused of paying too much attention to Earth when he had an entire  sector  of the cosmos to patrol  When he returned to Earth  he found himself embroiled in a dispute with Carol Ferris  Faced with a choice between love and the power ring  Jordan chose to resign from the Corps  The Guardians called upon Jordan s backup  John Stewart  to regular duty as his replacement  In 1985  the  Crisis on Infinite Earths  storyline that rebooted much of DC Comics  character continuity saw Jordan again take up the mantle of Green Lantern  The new Corps  with seven members residing on Earth  included several aliens  John Stewart  and Guy Gardner  Jordan became romantically involved with an alien Lantern named Arisia  for which he came under fire  a difference in time between Earth and her planet meant that in Earth years  she was over 250 years old  while on her planet she was only 14 years old  The alien Lanterns took a more direct hand in human affairs  a fact not appreciated by human governments   Kilowog helped create the Rocket Reds for the Soviet Union   Eventually  the Earth corps broke up  several members returning to their home sectors  The Guardians soon returned to this dimension  and Jordan worked with them to rebuild the fractured Corps   edit  1990s During this time  the character s origin story is re told and expanded in two limited series by Gerard Jones  Emerald Dawn and Emerald Dawn II  The first series expanded the role of the Corps in his origin and also provided more details about his childhood and his relationship with his father and brothers  while the sequel detailed the role of Jordan in the downfall of Sinestro  In the 1992 prestige format graphic novel Green Lantern  Ganthet s Tale  ISBN 1 56389 026 7   story by Larry Niven  script  amp  art by John Byrne   Hal Jordan first encounters Ganthet  one of the Guardians of the Universe  He asks Hal to help Ganthet battle a renegade Guardian  Dawlakispokpok  or Dawly  for short  who has attempted to use a time machine to change history  Cover to Green Lantern  vol  3   50  March 1994   Hal Jordan becomes Parallax  Art by Darryl Banks  In the 1993 Reign of the Supermen  storyline  the villainous Hank Henshaw disguised as a reborn Cyborg Superman enlists the alien tyrant Mongul and his forces and comes to Earth in a plot to take advantage of the death of Superman  In the process  Coast City  Jordan s former home  is destroyed and all of its seven million inhabitants murdered  bringing Jordan to take revenge on Mongul  who has replaced it with Engine City  with which he plans to turn Earth into a new Warworld  Jordan was off world at the time of the attack on his hometown  having returned well after its destruction  Angered  he flies into Engine City and makes short work of Mongul s guards  Jordan then bum rushes Mongul  who at that moment was seconds away from killing a weakened Superman  Since Mongul s skin pigment was yellow and Engine City was powered by Kryptonite gas  Jordan had a somewhat difficult time fighting the hulking alien  After the fight results in Jordan s arm and knee being broken  he takes advantage of Mongul s arrogance and uses his ring to create power armor for himself with which he used to lift Steel s  John Henry Irons   hammer and strike Mongul with it  The blow was so powerful that the hammer was shattered into pieces and Mongul was knocked out and eventually incarcerated  It was later revealed that the Cyborg Superman s wife came from Coast City  and he destroyed it as he wanted to remove all traces of his past life  4  This leads into the Emerald Twilight three part arc  Jordan uses his power ring to recreate Coast City as an instrument in the process of overcoming his grief  talking to ring created versions of his old girlfriend and parents  After his ring s power expires a projection of a Guardian appears and admonishes him for using the ring for personal gain and summons him to Oa for trial  5  Angered at what he sees as the Guardians  ungrateful and callous behavior  Jordan absorbs the energy from the Guardian s projection  goes insane and attacks Oa to seize the full power of the Central Battery  destroying the Corps in the process  taking their power rings as his own and leaving them to die in space  and ending the arc when he kills Kilowog  Sinestro who has been resurrected to fight him but has his neck snapped  and all the Guardians except for Ganthet who was protected by the other Guardians and survived without Jordan s knowledge  6  He then renounces his life as Green Lantern  adopting the name Parallax after absorbing the Power Battery s vast powers  After he emerges from the Central Power Battery  he walks past and looks at the dead Guardians and steps on his former ring  crushing it in the process  Jordan is replaced by Kyle Rayner by Ganthet as the Green Lantern of Earth when Rayner comes into possession of the last power ring  created from the shattered remains of Jordan s  Shortly afterward  Guy Gardner has visions of the Green Lantern Corps  destruction and his yellow power ring s energy  being powered by residual Green Lantern s energy  starts to fluctuate  Soon after  Gardner goes to Oa to investigate  He brings Martian Manhunter  Darkstar  Ferrin Colos   The Ray  Wonder Woman  Captain Atom  Alan Scott and Arisia with him for back up  Upon arrival they discover Kilowog s corpse  Jordan uses the element of surprise  attacks them  and quickly and easily defeats them  Although Guy tricks Hal into thinking that he is dead by making a fake dead construct of himself  He engages in battle with Parallax  absorbing his energy as they fight  But ultimately Jordan is too powerful for Gardner and defeats him in minutes  destroying his yellow power ring and punching out his eye putting Guy in a coma  After the battle Hal sends them all back to Earth warning them to leave him alone in the future  Not long afterwards  Parallax attempts to rewrite history to his own liking with the help of Extant in Zero Hour  Crisis in Time  Parallax destroys the Time Trapper and attempts to remake the universe into a perfect  peaceful place  The process causes time disruptions throughout time  Superman  Kyle Rayner and Metron call upon Earth s heroes to stop this crisis  Parallax reveals himself as the enemy by knocking out Superman with a single blow  Parallax and Exant battle the wide array of heroes  They are eventually defeated  with Green Arrow shooting an arrow into Jordan s heart as Kyle Rayner holds him in a full nelson  Later  in the 1996 Final Night miniseries crossover storyline  Jordan returns when the Earth s sun is in danger of going out  He starts to reevaluate himself and the decisions he s made and attacks and kills the Cyborg Superman  although he is later revealed to be alive  and visits John Stewart in the hospital who was recently paralyzed in battle  Jordan talks to his old friend for a final time and uses his powers to heal his paralysis  He then uses what appears to be the last of his powers and sacrifices his life to reignite the Sun  which had been extinguished by the Sun Eater   During the Emerald Knights storyline  when Kyle Rayner goes on an accidental time travelling trip  he ends up unintentionally drawing a past version of Hal into the present where Hal is shocked to learn of the crimes his future self had committed as Parallax  7  Although Hal briefly thought about remaining in the present to escape his actions as Parallax  Parallax s appearance in the present  while preparing to recreate the universe  he had been travelling back to his present from the future and became aware of his younger self existing where he shouldn t  8  forced Kyle to realise that

 July 2005   making Hal Jordan once again a Green Lantern and his past homicidal actions retconned to be the result of Parallax  now revealed to be caused by Hal having been  infected  by an ancient  nearly forgotten fear entity that had possessed him rather than Hal s own free will  which practically ignores Hal s heroic actions of healing John Stewart  reigniting the Sun and his misguided but

to the nearly deserted Coast City  which is slowly being rebuilt  He has been reinstated as a Captain in the United States Air Force  and works in the Test Pilot Program at Edwards Air Force Base  The

Friends Green Lantern was featured as a  guest hero  in The All New Super Friends Hour  Unfortunately  his powers were consistently misrepresented  such creating vehicles for transportation with his
