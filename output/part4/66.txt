Company  Founder Hungarian born Adolph Zukor  who had been an early investor in nickelodeons  saw that movies appealed mainly to working class immigrants  2  With partners Daniel Frohman and Charles Frohman he planned to offer feature length films that would appeal to the middle class by featuring the leading theatrical players of the time  leading to the slogan  Famous Players in Famous Plays    By mid 1913  Famous Players had completed five films  and Zukor was on his way to success  That same year  another aspiring producer  Jesse L  Lasky  opened his Lasky Feature show Company with money borrowed from his brother in law  Samuel Goldfish  later known as Samuel Goldwyn  The Lasky company hired as their first employee a stage director with virtually no film experience  Cecil B  DeMille  who would find a suitable location site in Hollywood  near Los Angeles  for his first feature film  The Squaw Man  Older Paramount logo  based on a design by founder W  W  Hodkinson in 1914  This print logo was featured onscreen during the main titles  and featured in advertising  until 1968  Beginning in 1914  both Lasky and Famous Players released their films through a start up company  Paramount Pictures Corporation  organized early that year by a Utah theatre owner  W  W  Hodkinson  who had bought and merged several smaller firms  Hodkinson and actor  director  producer Hobart Bosworth had started production of a series of Jack London movies  Paramount was the first successful nation wide distributor  until this time  films were sold on a state wide or regional basis which had proved costly to film producers  Also  Famous Players and Lasky were privately owned while Paramount was a corporation  Soon the ambitious Zukor  unused to taking a secondary role  began courting Hodkinson and Lasky  On September 28  1916  Zukor maneuvered a three way merger of his Famous Players  the Lasky Company  and Paramount  The new company  Famous Players Lasky Corporation  grew quickly  with Lasky and his partners Goldwyn and DeMille running the production side  Hiram Abrams in charge of distribution  and Zukor making great plans  With only the exhibitor owned First National as a rival  Famous Players Lasky and its  Paramount Pictures  soon dominated the business   edit  1921 1930  The rise Lasky s original studio  a k a    The Barn   as it appeared in the mid 1920s  The Taft building  built in 1923  is visible in the background  Because Zukor believed in stars  he signed and developed many of the leading early stars  including Mary Pickford  Marguerite Clark  Pauline Frederick  Douglas Fairbanks  Gloria Swanson  Rudolph Valentino  and Wallace Reid  With so many important players  Paramount was able to introduce  block booking   which meant that an exhibitor who wanted a particular star s films had to buy a year s worth of other Paramount productions  It was this system that gave Paramount a leading position in the 1920s and 1930s  but which led the government to pursue it on antitrust grounds for more than twenty years  The driving force behind Paramount s rise was Zukor  All through the teens and twenties  he built a mighty theatrical chain of nearly 2 000 screens  ran two production studios  and became an early investor in radio  taking a 50  interest in the new Columbia Broadcasting System in 1928  selling it within a few years  this would not be the last time that Paramount and CBS crossed paths  as time proved   By acquiring the successful Balaban  amp  Katz chain in 1926  he gained the services of Barney Balaban   who would eventually become Paramount s president in 1936   his brother A  J  Balaban   who would eventually supervise all stage production nationwide and produce talkie shorts   and their partner Sam Katz  who would run the Paramount Publix theatre chain from New York City  Zukor also hired independent producer B  P  Schulberg  an unerring eye for new talent  to run the new West Coast studio  This new 26 acre studio  at 5555 Melrose Avenue  cost  1 million  3  In 1927  Famous Players Lasky took on the name Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation  Three years later  because of the importance of the Publix theater chain  it was later known as Paramount Publix Corporation  Also in 1928  Paramount began releasing Inkwell Imps animated cartoons produced by Max and Dave Fleischer s Fleischer Studios in New York City  The Fleischers  veterans in the animation industry  would prove to be among the few animation producers capable of challenging the prominence of Walt Disney  The Paramount newsreel series Paramount News ran from 1927 to 1957   edit  1931 1940  Receivership Eventually  Zukor shed most of his early partners  the Frohman brothers  Hodkinson and Goldwyn were out by 1917 while Lasky hung on until 1932  when  blamed for the near collapse of Paramount in the Depression years  he too was tossed out  Zukor s over expansion and use of overvalued Paramount stock for purchases led the company into receivership in 1933  A bank mandated reorganization team  led by John Hertz and Otto Kahn kept the company intact  and  miraculously  kept Zukor on  In 1935  Paramount Publix went bankrupt  in 1936  Barney Balaban became president  and Zukor was bumped up to chairman of the board  In this role  Zukor reorganized the company as Paramount Pictures  Inc  and was able to successfully bring the studio out of bankruptcy  As always  Paramount films continued to emphasize stars  in the 1920s there were Swanson  Valentino  and Clara Bow  By the 1930s  talkies brought in a range of powerful new draws  Miriam Hopkins  Marlene Dietrich  Mae West  Gary Cooper  Claudette Colbert  the Marx Brothers  Dorothy Lamour  Carole Lombard  Bing Crosby  the band leader Shep Fields and the famous Argentine tango singer Carlos Gardel among them  In this period Paramount can truly be described as a movie factory  turning out sixty to seventy pictures a year  Such were the benefits of having a huge theater chain to fill  and of block booking to persuade other chains to go along  In 1933  Mae West would also add greatly to Paramount s success with her movies She Done Him Wrong and I m No Angel  4  5  However  the sex appeal West gave in these movies would also lead to the enforcement of the Production Code  as the newly formed organization the Catholic Legion of Decency threatened a boycott if it was not enforced  6  Paramount cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios continued to be successful  with characters such as Betty Boop and Popeye the Sailor becoming widely successful  One Fleischer series  Screen Songs  featured live action music stars under contract to Paramount hosting sing alongs of popular songs  However  a huge blow to Fleischer Studios occurred in 1934  after the Production Code was enforced and Betty Boop s popularity declined as she was forced to have a more tame personality and wear a longer skirt  7  The animation studio would rebound with Popeye  and in 1935  polls showed that Popeye was even more popular than Mickey Mouse  8  After an unsuccessful expansion into feature films  as well as the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer were no longer speaking to one another  Fleischer Studios was acquired by Paramount  which renamed the operation Famous Studios  That incarnation of the animation studio continued cartoon production until 1967  but has been historically dismissed as having largely failed to maintain the artistic acclaim the Fleischer brothers achieved under their management  9  The original Paramount logo seen on 1930s movies and Popeye shorts  edit  1941 1950  United States v  Paramount Pictures  Inc  In 1940  Paramount agreed to a government instituted consent decree  block booking and  pre selling   the practice of collecting up front money for films not yet in production  would end  Immediately Paramount cut back on production  from sixty plus pictures to a more modest twenty annually in the war years  Still  with more new stars like Bob Hope  Alan Ladd  Veronica Lake  Paulette Goddard  and Betty Hutton  and with war time attendance at astronomical numbers  Paramount and the other integrated studio theatre combines made more money than ever  At this  the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department decided to reopen their case against the five integrated studios  Paramount also had a monopoly over Detroit movie theaters through subsidiary company United Detroit Theaters as well  10  This led to the Supreme Court decision United States v  Paramount Pictures  Inc   1948  holding that movie studios could not also own movie theater chains  This decision broke up Adolph Zukor s creation and effectively brought an end to the classic Hollywood studio system   edit  1951 1966  Split and after With the separation of production and exhibition forced by the U S  Supreme Court  Paramount Pictures Inc  was split in two  Paramount Pictures Corporation was formed to be the production distribution company  with the 1 500 screen theater chain handed to the new United Paramount Theaters on December 31  1949  Leonard Goldenson  who had headed the chain since 1938  remained as the new company s president  The Balaban and Katz theatre division was spun off with UPT  its trademark eventually became the property of the Balaban and Katz Historical Foundation  The Foundation has recently acquired ownership of the Famous Players Trademark  Cash rich and controlling prime downtown real estate  Goldenson began looking for investments  Barred from film making by prior anti trust rulings  he acquired the struggling ABC television network in February 1953  leading it first to financial health  and eventually  in the mid 1970s  to first place in the national Nielsen ratings  before selling out to Capital Cities in 1985  United Paramount Theaters was renamed ABC Theaters in 1965 and was sold to businessman Henry Plitt in 1974  The movie theater chain was renamed Plitt Theaters  In 1985  Cineplex Odeon Corporation merged with Plitt  In later years  Paramount s TV division would develop a strong relationship with ABC  providing many hit series to the network   edit  The DuMont fiasco Paramount Pictures had been an early backer of television  launching experimental stations in 1939 in Los Angeles and Chicago  The Los Angeles station eventually became KTLA  the first commercial station on the West Coast  The Chicago station got a commercial license as WBKB in 1943  but was sold to UPT along with Balaban  amp  Katz in 1948  resold to CBS  and eventually became WBBM TV  In 1938  Paramount bought a stake in television manufacturer DuMont Laboratories  Through this stake  it became a minority owner of the DuMont Television Network  However  Paramount proved to be a timid and obstructionist partner  Its minority stake hampered DuMont s efforts to expand  KTLA and WBBM were recognized by the FCC as DuMont O amp O stations  even though the former was only an affiliate in 1947 and the latter never carried a DuMont program  Since DuMont already owned three stations  the FCC did not allow DuMont to buy any more stations as long as Paramount owned a portion of DuMont  However  Paramount refused to sell  It also refused to help DuMont as it sank during the 1950s  11  12  Most importantly  when DuMont agreed in principle to merge with ABC in 1953  Paramount vetoed the deal in part due to an earlier FCC ruling that Paramount controlled DuMont  Within two years of the failed ABC deal  DuMont was no more  In 1951  Paramount bought a stake in International Telemeter  an experimental pay TV service which operated with a coin inserted into a box  The service began operating in Palm Springs  California on November 27  1953  but due to pressure from the FCC and theater owners  the service ended on May 15  1954  With the loss of the theater chain  Paramount Pictures went into a decline  cutting studio backed production  releasing its contract players  and making production deals with independents  By the mid 1950s  all the great names were gone  only C B  DeMille  associated with Paramount since 1913  kept making pictures in the grand old style  Despite Paramount s losses  DeMille would  however  give the studio some relief and create his most successful film at Paramount  a 1956 remake of his 1923 film The Ten Commandments  13  Like some other studios  Paramount saw little value in its film library  see below for more info on the early Paramount library   DeMille died in 1959   edit  1966 1970  Early Gulf Western era By the early 1960s  Paramount s future was doubtful  The high risk movie business was wobbly  the theater chain was long gone  investments in DuMont and in early pay television came to nothing  Even the flagship Paramount building in Times Square was sold to raise cash  as was KTLA  sold to Gene Autry in 1964 for a then phenomenal  12 5 million   Founding father Adolph Zukor  born in 1873  was still chairman emeritus  he referred to chairman Barney Balaban  born 1888  as  the boy   Such aged leadership was incapable of keeping up with the changing times  and in 1966  a sinking Paramount was sold to Charles Bluhdorn s industrial conglomerate  Gulf   Western Industries Corporation  Bluhdorn immediately put his stamp on the studio  installing a virtually unknown producer named Robert Evans as head of production  Despite some rough times  Evans held the job for eight years  restoring Paramount s reputation for commercial success with The Odd Couple  Love Story  Chinatown  and Rosemary s Baby  14  Gulf   Western Industries also bought the neighboring Desilu television studio  once the lot of RKO Pictures  from Lucille Ball in 1967  Using some of Desilu s established shows such as Star Trek  Mission  Impossible  and Mannix as a foot in the door at the networks  the newly reincorporated Paramount Television eventually became known as a specialist in half hour situation comedies  15   edit  1971 1980  CIC Formation  amp  High Concept era In 1970  Paramount teamed with Universal Studios to form Cinema International Corporation  a new company that would distribute films by the two studios outside the United States  Metro Goldwyn Mayer would become a partner in the mid 1970s  Both Paramount and CIC entered the video market with Paramount Home Video  now Paramount Home Entertainment  and CIC Video  respectively  Robert Evans quit as head of production in 1974  his successor  Richard Sylbert  proved to be too literary and too tasteful for Gulf   Western s Bluhdorn  By 1976  a new  television trained team was in place headed by Barry Diller and his  Killer Dillers   as they were called by admirers or  Dillettes  as they were called by detractors  These associates  made up of Michael Eisner  Jeffrey Katzenberg  Dawn Steel and Don Simpson would each go on and head up major movie studios of their own later in their careers  The 1968 2011 Paramount print logo was used at the start and end of most films between 1975 and 1986  It is used on Home Video releases  even after Gulf Western and Paramount Communications ownership ended The Paramount specialty was now simpler   High Concept  pictures such as Saturday Night Fever and Grease hit big  hit hard and hit fast all over the world  and Diller s television background led him to propose one of his longest standing ideas to the board  a fourth commercial network  But neither the board nor Bluhdorn himself accepted Diller s repeated advancements of this idea and neither did Bluhdorn s successor  Martin Davis  But Diller believed strongly in the concept  and so took his fourth network idea with him when he moved to 20th Century Fox in 1984  where Fox s then freshly installed proprietor  Rupert Murdoch was a more interested listener  Meanwhile  concentrating on hot films  Paramount was met with critical success with the release of The Godfather  based on the popular novel  However  the television division would be playing catch up for over a decade after Diller s departure in 1984 before launching its own television network   UPN   in 1995  Lasting eleven years before being merged with The WB network to become The CW in 2006  UPN would feature many of the shows it originally produced for other networks  and would take numerous gambles on series such as Star Trek  Voyager  and Star Trek  Enterprise that would have otherwise either gone direct to cable or become first run syndication to independent stations across the country  UPN was able to host a proven winner when it picked up the final two seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer  Paramount Pictures was not connected to Paramount Records until it purchased the rights to use the name  but not its catalog  in the late 1960s  The Paramount name was used for soundtrack albums and some pop re issues from the Dot Records catalog which Paramount had acquired in 1958  By 1970  Dot had become an all country label 16  and in 1974  Paramount sold all of its record holdings to ABC Records  which in turn was sold to MCA  now Universal Music Group  in 1979   edit  1980 1994  Continuous success Paramount s successful run of pictures extended into the 1980s and 1990s  generating hits like Airplane   American Gigolo  Ordinary People  An Officer and a Gentleman  Flashdance  Terms of Endearment  Footloose  Pretty in Pink  Fatal Attraction  the Friday the 13th slasher series  as well as Raiders of the Lost Ark and its sequels  Other examples are the Star Trek series and a string of films starring comedian Eddie Murphy like Trading Places  Coming To America  and Beverly Hills Cop and its sequels  While the emphasis was decidedly on the commercial  there were occasional less commercial but more artistic and intellectual efforts like I m Dancing as Fast as I Can  Atlantic City  Reds  Witness  Children of a Lesser God and The Accused  During this period  responsibility for running the studio passed from Eisner and Katzenberg to Frank Mancuso Sr   1984  and Ned Tanen  1984  to Stanley Jaffe  1991  and Sherry Lansing  1992   More so than most  Paramount s slate of films included many remakes and television spinoffs  while sometimes commercially successful  there have been few compelling films of the kind that once made Paramount the industry leader  The studio even had its share of box office flops such as Grease 2  Clue and a few others  In 1981  Cinema International Corporation was reorganized as United International Pictures  This was necessary because MGM had merged with United Artists which had its own international distribution unit  but MGM was not allowed to leave the venture at the time  they finally did in 2001  switching international distribution to 20th Century Fox   In 1985  Dawn Steel became head of Motion Picture Production  When Charles Bluhdorn died unexpectedly  his successor Martin Davis dumped all of G W s industrial  mining  and sugar growing subsidiaries and refocused the company  renaming it Paramount Communications in 1989  With the influx of cash from the sale of G W s industrial properties in the mid 1980s  Paramount bought a string of television stations and KECO Entertainment s theme park operations  renaming them Paramount Parks  In 1993  Sumner Redstone s entertainment conglomerate Viacom made a bid for a merger with Paramount Communications  this quickly escalated into a bidding war with Barry Diller s QVC  But Viacom prevailed  ultimately paying  10 billion for the Paramount holdings  Paramount is the last major film studio located in Hollywood proper  When Paramount moved to its present home in 1927  it was in the heart of the film community  Since then  former next door neighbor RKO closed up shop in 1957  Warner Bros   whose old Sunset Boulevard studio was sold to Paramount in 1949 as a home for KTLA  moved to Burbank in 1930  Columbia joined Warners in Burbank in 1973 then moved again to Culver City in 1989  and the Pickford Fairbanks Goldwyn United Artists lot  after a lively history  has been turned into a post production and music scoring facility for Warners  known simply as  The Lot   For a time the semi industrial neighborhood around Paramount was in decline  but has now come back  The recently refurbished studio has come to symbolize Hollywood for many visitors  and its studio tour is a popular attraction   edit  1994 2004  Dolgen Lansing and  old  Viacom era During this time period  Paramount Pictures went under the guidance of Jonathan Dolgen  chairman and Sherry Lansing  president  17  18  During their administration over Paramount  the studio had an extremely successful period of films with two of Paramount s ten highest grossing films being produced during this period  19  The most successful of these films  Titanic  a joint production with 20th Century Fox  became the highest grossing film up to that time  grossing over  1 8 billion worldwide  20  Also during this time  three Paramount Pictures films won the Academy Award for Best Picture  Titanic  Braveheart  and Forrest Gump  Dolgen and Lansing also presided over the production and release of other films including Saving Private Ryan  with DreamWorks   as well as the Mission  Impossible films  Paramount s most important property  however  was Star Trek  Studio executives had begun to call it  the franchise  in the 1980s due to its reliable revenue  and other studios envied its  untouchable and unduplicatable  success  By 1998 Star Trek TV shows  movies  books  videotapes  and licensing provided so much of the studio s profit that  it is not possible to spend any reasonable amount of time at Paramount and not be aware of  its  presence   filming for Star Trek  Voyager and Star Trek  Deep Space Nine required up to nine of the largest of the studio s 36 sound stages  21  22  49 50 54 In 1995  Viacom and Chris Craft Industries  United Television launched United Paramount Network  UPN  with Star Trek  Voyager as its flagship series  fulfilling Barry Diller s plan for a Paramount network from 25 years earlier  In 1999  Viacom bought out United Television s interests  and handed responsibility for the start up network to the newly acquired CBS unit  which Viacom bought in 1999   an ironic confluence of events as Paramount had once invested in CBS  and Viacom had once been the syndication arm of CBS as well  23  In 2002  Paramount  Buena Vista Distribution  20th Century Fox  Sony Pictures  Universal Studios  and Warner Bros  formed the Digital Cinema Initiative  24  DCI was created  to establish and document voluntary specifications for an open architecture for digital cinema that ensures a uniform and high level of technical performance  reliability and quality control   24   edit  2005 present  Paramount today  edit  CBS Corporation Viacom split Reflecting in part the troubles of the broadcasting business  in 2005 Viacom wrote off over  28 billion from its radio acquisitions and  early that year  announced that it would split itself in two  The split was completed in January 2006  Among the assets that went to the new CBS Corporation are the CBS television and radio networks  the Infinity radio station chain  now CBS Radio   Paramount Television  now CBS Television Studios   UPN  which merged with Time Warner s The WB to become The CW   and the Showtime Networks pay TV unit which includes Showtime  The Movie Channel and Flix  CBS was also given control of Paramount Parks which it sold to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company in June 2006 for  1 24 billion  Paramount Pictures is now lumped in with MTV  BET Nickelodeon and other highly profitable channels owned by the new Viacom  With the announcement of the split of Viacom  Dolgen and Lansing were replaced by former television executives Brad Grey and Gail Berman  The decision was made to split Viacom into two companies  which in turn led to a dismantling of the Paramount Studio Paramount TV infrastructure  with the current Paramount  consisting only of the movie studio  retaining only about one quarter its former size under Dolgen and Lansing  The Paramount Television studio was made part of CBS in the split and the remaining businesses were sold off or parceled out to other operating groups  Paramount s home entertainment unit continues to distribute the Paramount TV library through CBS DVD  as both Viacom and CBS Corporation are controlled by Michael Redstone s National Amusements  In 2009  CBS stopped using the Paramount name in its series and changed the name of the production arm to CBS Television Studios  eliminating the Paramount name from television  to distance itself from the latter  It is one of only 2 of the Big Six to have this fate  the other being Columbia Pictures  although unlike Paramount  it is still a direct sister to its former TV arm    edit  Joint venture with DreamWorks On December 11  2005  The Paramount Motion Pictures Group announced that it had purchased DreamWorks SKG  which was co founded by former Paramount executive Jeffrey Katzenberg  in a deal worth  1 6 billion  The announcement was made by Brad Grey  chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures  who noted that enhancing Paramount s pipeline of pictures is a  key strategic objective in restoring Paramount s stature as a leader in filmed entertainment   The agreement does not include DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc   the most profitable part of the company that went public the previous year  Under the deal  Paramount is required to distribute the DreamWorks animated films for a small fee intended only to cover Paramount s out of pocket costs with no profit to the studio  including the Shrek franchise  and ending for the 2004 installment  Shrek 2   The first film distributed under this deal is Over the Hedge  The deal closed on February 6  2006  This acquisition was seen at the time as a stopgap measure as Brad Grey had been unsuccessful in assembling sufficient films for production and distribution and the DreamWorks films would fill the gap  On October 6  2008  Paramount and DreamWorks announced the joint venture was ending and that DreamWorks would be seeking new distributors for its films  25   edit  UIP  Famous Music and Digital Entertainment Grey also broke up the famous UIP international distribution company  the most successful international film distributor in history  after a 25 year partnership with Universal Studios and has started up a new international group  As a consequence Paramount fell from No 1 in the international markets to the lowest ranked major studio in 2006 but recovered in 2007 if the DreamWorks films  acquired by Paramount but still distributed internationally by Universal  are included in Paramount s market share  UIP still does business in smaller markets  Grey also launched a Digital Entertainment division to take advantage of emerging digital distribution technologies  This led to Paramount becoming the second movie studio to sign a deal with Apple Inc  to sell its films through the iTunes store  They also signed an exclusive agreement with the failed HD DVD consortium and subsequently gave up the guarantees they had received and will now release in the Blu ray format  Also  in 2007  Paramount sold another one of its  heritage  units  Famous Music  to Sony ATV Music Publishing  best known for publishing many songs by The Beatles  and for being co owned by Michael Jackson   ending a nearly eight decade run as a division of Paramount  being the studio s music publishing arm since the period when the entire company went by the name  Famous Players   An additional legacy unit  Famous Players Theaters  Canada  was sold in 2005 to its competitor Cineplex Odeon Corporation  These theaters had been in the company since the days of silent movie  When the 1949 Paramount Consent Decree forced divestiture by the studios  it did not apply outside the US so Paramount kept its Canadian theater subsidiary   edit  Insurge Pictures Main article  Insurge Pictures In March 2010  Paramount founded Insurge Pictures  26  an independent distributor of  micro budget  films  27  The distributor planned ten movies with budgets of  100 000 each  28   edit  Animation division In July 2011  in the wake of critical and box office success of the animated feature  Rango  and the possible departure of DreamWorks Animation upon completion of their distribution contract in 2012  Paramount announced the formation of a new division  devoted to the creation of animated productions  29  It marks Paramount s return to having its own animated division for the first time since 1967  when Paramount Cartoon Studios shut down  it was formerly Famous Studios until 1956   In October 2011  Paramount named a former president of Walt Disney Feature Animation  David Stainton  president of Paramount Animation  30  In February 2012  Stainton resigned for personal reasons  31  It was also announced that The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 2  a sequel to 2004 s The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie   based upon the popular Nickelodeon TV show  SpongeBob SquarePants  will be the studio s first movie and will be released in 2014  32   edit  The Paramount library This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  This section may contain original

December 2011  Through a series of mergers and acquisitions  many of Paramount s early cartoons  shorts  and feature films are owned by numerous entities In the 1950s  as a consequence of the 1948 Supreme Court verdict  the studio saw little value in its library  and decided to sell off its back catalog  Balaban  consistent with his other decisions to sell off rights and dismantle Paramount s library  was of the opinion that there was no future economic value to  old  movies  This  strategy  of the gradual dismantling Paramount s assets and library has continued under current Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman who not only split the company in half and gave the television library and distribution rights to the feature films to CBS  but also sold off the Company s music library  Famous Music  Except for the Superman cartoons and the features sold to MCA  to end up with Universal   most television prints of these films have had their titles remade to remove most traces of their connection to Paramount   the original copyright lines were left intact on Popeye cartoons  the Popeye cartoons have been restored for DVD release with the original Paramount titles   As for distribution of the material Paramount itself still owns  it has been split in half  with Paramount themselves owning theatrical rights  But from 2006 2009  the library was distributed by CBS Television Distribution  the television distribution arm of CBS Paramount Television  now CBS Television Studios    the films are now distributed by Trifecta Entertainment  amp  Media on television   edit  Short subjects and

short subjects released before October 1950  exceptions are noted below   in 1955  Some lesser known features were included in this deal as well  such as It s a Wonderful Life  U M  amp M  was later sold to National Telefilm Associates  or NTA for short  NTA changed its name to Republic Pictures  which was previously the name of a minor film studio  whose backlog had been sold to NTA  in 1986  sold to Spelling Entertainment  Inc  in 1994  and was sold to Viacom in 1999  hence all the material sold to U M  amp M  would return to Paramount  though  except for few other films  video rights belong to Lionsgate   Popeye and Superman  However  not all pre 10 50 Paramount cartoons went to U M  amp M   to end up with Republic   The Popeye cartoons were sold to Associated Artists Productions in 1956  which also purchased most of the pre 1950 features and shorts by Warner Bros  Pictures  Meanwhile  the rights to the Superman cartoons returned to National Comics  who licensed the syndication rights to Flamingo Films  distributors of the Superman television series  The Popeye cartoons passed on to United Artists in 1958 after its purchase of a a p   then to MGM in 1981 after they purchased UA  After Ted Turner failed in an attempt to buy MGM UA Entertainment Co  in 1986  he settled for ownership of the library  which included the a a p  library  Turner Entertainment  the holding company for Turner s film library  would later be sold to Time Warner  Turner technically holds the rights to the Popeye cartoons today  but sales and distribution is in the hands of Warner Bros  Entertainment  WB also owns Superman s publisher  DC Comics  and although the Superman cartoons are now in the public domain  WB owns the original film elements  Harveytoons  The rest of the post September 1950 cartoons by Famous Studios that were released prior to April 1  1962  except some special releases  were sold to Harvey Comics  along with all rights to Famous  characters Casper the Friendly Ghost  Little Audrey  Herman and Katnip  et al   in 1958  which were retitled  Harveytoons  for television distribution after 1959  beginning with their exposure on Matty s Funday Funnies   and are now owned by Classic Media  A few live action short subjects were apparently included in this package as well  as searches in the Library of Congress Copyright Catalog indicate   edit  EMKA  Ltd  When the talent agency Music Corporation of America  better known as MCA   then wielding major influence on Paramount policy  offered  50 million for 750 features released prior to December 1  1949  with payment to be spread over many years   a cash strapped Paramount thought it had made the best possible deal  To address anti trust concerns  MCA set up a separate company  EMKA  Ltd   to sell these films to television  The deal included such notable Paramount films as the early Marx Brothers films  most of the Bob Hope Bing Crosby  Road  pictures  and such Oscar contenders as Double Indemnity  The Lost Weekend  and The Heiress  MCA later admitted that over the next forty years it took in more than a billion dollars in rentals of these supposedly  worthless  pictures  MCA later purchased the US branch of Decca Records  which owned Universal Studios  now a part of NBCUniversal   and thus Universal now owns these films  though EMKA continues to hold the copyright and technically are part of the television unit of NBC Universal  Some of these films would get remade by Universal in later years  either as theatrical releases  such as Meet Joe Black  a remake of Death Takes a Holiday   or for television  Yet a few other films became adapted by Revue Studios  now Universal Television  as television series   edit  Exceptions in pre 1950 library Paramount retained the rights to several films released between 1948 and 1949  including You Came Along  I Walk Alone  Sorry  Wrong Number  The Accused  Rope of Sand  My Friend Irma  Red  Hot and Blue  Top o  the Morning  Bride of Vengeance  Samson and Delilah and Dear Wife  Most of these were produced independently by Hal B  Wallis Productions  and picked up for distribution by Paramount  Several feature films ended up in Republic s possession  as stated above   yet others had been retained by Paramount due to other rights issues  such as The Buccaneer and The Miracle of Morgan s Creek   it is presumed these remained under Paramount ownership so that remakes could be filmed for release in 1958  without having to license the rights   Paramount has retained the rights to some of its silent films  including 1927 s Wings  the first Academy Award winner for Best Picture  and Josef von Sternberg films Underworld  The Last Command  and The Docks of New York  However  many others are either lost or in the public domain  in fact  per US law  all films released before 1923 are in the public domain   Several pre 1950 talkies were sold to other studios for remakes  among them Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  1931  and Make Me a Star  1932  to MGM  The Letter  1929   A Farewell to Arms  1932  and One Sunday Afternoon  1933  to Warner Brothers  and  The Dance of Life  1929   The Story of Temple Drake  1933  and  Swing High  Swing Low  1937  to 20th Century Fox  Also excluded were several films in the Zane Grey western series  including To the Last Man  1932   that were licensed to a theatrical reissue distributor at the time of the MCA deal  as well as all the Hopalong Cassidy films purchased by star William Boyd  and are currently under the control of U S  Television Office  founded by Boyd  The pre 1948 B pictures from Pine Thomas Productions were also sold off to TV syndicators before the MCA deal  as was Paramount s Bulldog Drummond series  the latter of which is now owned by Janus Films  Two Max Fleischer features  Gulliver s Travels  1939  and Hoppity Goes to Town  1941  were previously sold to NTA along with a few independent productions released by Paramount like One Third of a Nation  1939   as well as some features acquired by the studio after their theatrical release  including The Bells of St  Mary s  1945  and Good Sam  1947   both originally distributed by RKO Radio Pictures   Paramount sold three features   I Married a Witch  The Crystal Ball and Young and Willing   to United Artists  along with five Harry Sherman produced westerns and 13 Hopalong Cassidys  beginning in 1942 when that studio needed product to release  and Paramount had a surplus  These films would not end up under EMKA ownership  Except for the Cassidys  these are now owned by Castle Hill Productions  with video rights to some licensed to The Criterion Collection  Three series of shorts produced by Jerry Fairbanks  Unusual Occupations  Speaking of Animals  and Popular Science  are owned by Shields Pictures  All the Harold Lloyd features  silents and talkies  released by Paramount are owned by the Harold Lloyd Trust except for The Milky Way  1936   acquired by Samuel Goldwyn Productions for a remake and now in the public domain  and Professor Beware  1938   which is owned by EMKA Universal Television  The Road to Rio  1947  and My Favorite Brunette  1948  were owned by Bob Hope Enterprises but fell into the public domain after their copyrights weren t renewed  However  the original elements are currently with Sony Pictures Entertainment  in partnership with FremantleMedia North America    edit  Post 1950 rights changes Rights to some of Paramount s films from 1950 onward would also change hands   edit  Alfred Hitchcock Most notably  the rights to four Paramount films directed by Alfred Hitchcock   Rear Window  1954   The Trouble With Harry  1956   The Man Who Knew Too Much  1956   and Vertigo  1958  were owned by the director himself  In the early 1970s  Hitchcock pulled the remaining films out of circulation  Following Hitchcock s death  Universal  which had previously purchased the rights to Psycho  1960   eventually acquired the distribution rights to the four other films  along with a former WB feature  Rope  in 1983 from the Hitchcock estate  which still holds all other ancillary rights to these films the estate is overseen by his daughter  Patricia   However  one Hitchcock film  To Catch a Thief  1955   is still under Paramount s ownership  since Paramount is the copyright owner of the film   edit  Jerry Lewis Paramount s association with the comedian Jerry Lewis  whose York Pictures Productions produced The Nutty Professor among other films  ended in the 1970s  and the rights to these films were given back to Lewis  As a consequence  the hit remake starring Eddie Murphy were released by Universal Pictures  This reversion to Jerry Lewis resulted from a promise made by then Paramount CEO Barney Balaban who gratuitously offered to give the rights back to Lewis as a birthday present  Paramount  however  has retained full distribution rights to the Lewis films under license from Lewis s company  York Pictures Corporation  33   edit  Other films One Paramount film  Becket is under different ownership  The film s copyright  originally registered by Paramount in 1964  was renewed by  Classic Photoplays  Inc   in 1992  34  U S  home video distribution rights have been licensed to MPI Home Video  Paramount owned most rights to the Elvis Presley film Loving You  including distribution and partial ownership of its copyright  35 NBC later acquired the rights to the film around the time it first aired on the network  NBC licensed television syndication rights to NBCUniversal Television Distribution and US video distribution to Lionsgate   edit  Miscellaneous exceptions Some of Bob Hope s films originally released by Paramount  including The Seven Little Foys and The Lemon Drop Kid  were owned by Hope himself  the copyrights were later transferred to Columbia Pictures Television  Distribution rights are split between Sony Pictures Entertainment and FremantleMedia  both successors in interest to a joint venture called Colex Enterprises  which had consisted of respective predecessor companies CPT and LBS Communications  Hope s other films  My Favorite Brunette and Road to Bali  are in the public domain  but CPT has the original elements   edit  Titles merely distributed by Paramount A number of films produced by independent companies and merely distributed by Paramount would also end up with other companies  Psycho  a Paramount release  was produced independently by Alfred Hitchcock s Shamley Productions  Hitchcock later sold Shamley to MCA in 1964  thus  Universal now owns the film  The 1971 film Willy Wonka  amp  the Chocolate Factory was produced by Wolper Productions  Warner Bros  acquired the rights to the film from the film s financer The Quaker Oats Company in 1977  around the same time they bought out Wolper itself   after Paramount no longer had any interest to own the distribution rights to the film due to the initial failure of Willy Wonka  WB also owns the rights to several films originally distributed by Paramount that were produced by Lorimar Productions  which was sold to WB in 1989  Titles included in this library are S O B   the 1981 remake of The Postman Always Rings Twice  WB also owns the 1946 MGM version through Turner   The Sea Wolves  and Escape to Victory  a k a  Victory   The Patrick Garland version of A Doll s House

each distributing some titles in North America   Paramount also no longer owns North American rights to Meatballs  US intellecutal property rights are owned by Lionsgate  as successor in interest to Canadian financed films by producers John Dunning  amp  Andre Link and their company Cinepix  Lionsgate has in turn licensed DVD rights to Sony Pictures Home Entertainment  Paramount still controls international rights  and picked up remake rights when Lionsgate put the project in turnaround  Lionsgate now controls most rights to the 1987 Vietnam War film Hamburger Hill through an equity investment Vestron Video made with its production outfit RKO Pictures  though Paramount retains TV and Internet rights  Rights to the 1964 films The Fall of the Roman Empire and Circus World were owned by these films  producer Samuel Bronston  Bronston sold those rights to his creditors after he filed for bankruptcy  US distribution rights were licensed years later to Miramax  After its founders Bob and Harvey Weinstein split from Disney  they formed The Weinstein Company  who currently owns the US distribution rights  Distribution in other countries are with different companies  Foreign rights to the 1975 Robert Altman film Nashville  are currently owned by ABC  via Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures   but Paramount still owns North American rights  both Paramount and ABC share copyrights    edit  Films bought by Paramount in later years In 1947  the studio acquired Frank Capra s production company  Liberty Films  which produced only 2 films in the 1940s  It s a Wonderful Life  released originally by RKO Radio Pictures  and State of the Union  released originally by Metro Goldwyn Mayer  the latter made under Paramount ownership   Liberty Films was closed in April 1951 and the former film was sold to U M  amp M  T V  Corp  and later NTA and is back under Paramount distribution  on behalf of Republic Pictures  EMKA NBCUniversal owns the latter presently  In the 1970s  Paramount acquired the rights to the Frank Capra film Broadway Bill  which was originally released by Columbia Pictures   Paramount had remade the film as Riding High in 1950  In 2004  Paramount bought all worldwide distribution rights to the original 1975 version of The Stepford Wives  also released by Columbia   in connection with the release of the remake  The company owns DVD rights to many films produced by Full Moon Entertainment  due to a deal made with the company years before  Paramount also owns DVD rights to several films released by Miramax Films prior to that firm s acquisition by Disney in 1993  also a result of a deal  Paramount owns the film libraries of many other companies that were absorbed into Republic  see the Republic Pictures and Spelling Entertainment articles for more info   again with DVD rights licensed to Lionsgate  The company owns the film libraries of Rysher Entertainment and Bing Crosby Productions  which had been merged with Rysher in the 1990s    such titles include Walking Tall and the international rights to It Takes Two  Paramount also owns  through the Viacom merger  US distribution rights to the 1951 film The African Queen  originally distributed by United Artists  the international rights are with ITV Global Entertainment   After its initial release  Paramount bought the worldwide distribution rights to Francis Ford Coppola s 1979 Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now  on behalf of Coppola s company American Zoetrope   To fund the release of the  redux  version  Paramount and Coppola sold the international rights  to both the original and  redux  versions  to a joint venture of Miramax Films and StudioCanal  As a result  various other companies control the international distribution rights to Apocalypse Now  in some countries  each version has a different distrbutor   American Zoetrope has recently signed a distribution deal with Lionsgate  Lionsgate released the film on Blu Ray on October 19  2010  36  After Miramax was sold  StudioCanal assumed some of its rights outside the US as well   edit  Films only owned by Paramount for TV and digital distribution Paramount  through several transactions  acquired underlying TV and digital distribution rights to many films controlled by other companies for domestic theatrical and DVD distribution and or other international rights  Through the merger with Viacom  they gained U S  rights to the majority of the Cannon Films library  except Lifeforce  where some of said rights are owned by Sony via its initial US theatrical distribution by TriStar  once posting it on the website Crackle   owned for other media by MGM  who also posted Lifeforce on Hulu   Notably  this allowed Paramount to have some involvement in the Superman franchise for the first time since selling off the Fleischer Famous cartoons  They gained television rights to the fourth Superman film as part of the Cannon library  as well as Superman III and Supergirl   both of which were produced by the Salkinds  The latter two titles are now owned by WB for all media  but Superman IV is still part of Paramount s library for over the air TV and digital rights  though WB did handle these rights for a three year license 2006 09   The Viacom merger also gave Paramount the TV rights to the pre 1984 New World Pictures library  under license from Roger Corman  the company s founder  Paramount has also acquired  through Trifecta Entertanment  amp  Media  the US TV and digital rights to most of the Carolco Pictures catalog  under license from StudioCanal  as a result of acquiring Spelling Entertainment Group  whose Worldvision Enterprises division had been distributing the Carolco library  Notable titles include the first three Rambo films  Basic Instinct  Terminator 2  Judgment Day  Angel Heart  Total Recall  L A  Story  and The Doors  Paramount has TV and digital rights to some films in the Nelson Entertainment catalog  also as a result of the Viacom merger  37  including the Bill  amp  Ted films   all other rights  including Nelson s later films and the copyright to Bill  amp  Ted s Bogus Journey  reside with MGM  several other Nelson films are owned by Paramount for TV and digital distribution through the Spelling merger  as Worldvision at one point had rights to some Nelson films as well   Paramount also has TV digital rights to Dead Man Walking  originally from PolyGram Filmed Entertainment  MGM owns other ancillary rights  These are just few examples of what Paramount controls only for TV and digital distribution  Television rights to Paramount s library  included properties owned outright  and those only for certain media  are currently held on Paramount s behalf by Trifecta Entertainment  amp  Media  Trifecta had inherited this library from CBS Television Distribution in 2009    edit  DreamWorks In 2006  as mentioned earlier  Paramount became the parent of DreamWorks SKG  Soros Strategic Partners and Dune Entertainment II soon afterwards acquired controlling interest in the live action films released through September 16  2005  the latest film in this package was Just Like Heaven  The remaining live action films through March 2006 remained under direct Paramount control  However  Paramount does own distribution  and other ancillary  rights to the Soros Dune films  Even as DreamWorks switches distribution of live action films that are not part of existing franchises to Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures  Paramount will continue to own the films released before the merger  and the films that Paramount themselves distributed  including sequel rights  such films as Little Fockers will be distributed by Paramount and DreamWorks  since it is a sequel to an existing DreamWorks film   in this case  Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers  though Paramount will only own international rights to this title  whereas Universal Studios will handle domestic distribution 38    As for the DreamWorks Animation library  it is likely that Paramount only owns distribution rights at present  The current contract is up after 2012  It is not known whether Paramount will continue its relationship with DreamWorks Animation after that point  especially with the above announcement by Paramount of their plans for their own inhouse animation department  but until then  DWA s films are part of Paramount s library   edit  The CBS library Independent company Hollywood Classics now represents Paramount in the theatrical distribution of all the films produced by the various motion picture divisions of CBS over the years  as a result of the Viacom CBS merger  Paramount  via CBS DVD  has outright video distribution to the aforementioned CBS library with few exceptions for example  the original Twilight Zone DVDs are handled by Image Entertainment  Until 2009  the video rights to My Fair Lady were with original theatrical distributor Warner Bros   under license from CBS  the video license to that film has now reverted to CBS DVD under Paramount   The CBS produced owned films  unlike other films in Paramount s library  are still distributed by CBS Television Distribution on TV  and not by Trifecta Entertainment  amp  Media  because CBS  or a subdivision  is the copyright holder for these films   edit  FanRocket In early 2008  Paramount partnered with Los Angeles based developer FanRocket to make short scenes taken from its film library available to users on Facebook  The application  called VooZoo  allows users to send movie clips to other Facebook users and to post clips on their profile pages  39  Paramount engineered a similar deal with Makena Technologies to allow users of vMTV and There com to view and send movie clips  40   edit  Logo Artist Dario Campanile standing in front of the artwork he created for Paramount Studios for their 75th Anniversary logo redesign  The painting was used as the source for subsequent logo animation  The original is on display at Paramount Studios  The distinctively pyramidal Paramount mountain has been the company s logo since its inception and is the oldest surviving Hollywood film logo  The logo appeared at the start of many cartoons  In the sound era  the logo was accompanied by a fanfare called Paramount on Parade after the film of the same name  released in 1930  The words to the fanfare  originally sung in the 1930 film  were  Proud of the crowd that will never be loud  it s Paramount on Parade   Legend has it that the mountain is based on a doodle made by W  W  Hodkinson during a meeting with Adolph Zukor  It is said to be based on the memories of his childhood in Utah  Some claim that Utah s Ben Lomond is the mountain Hodkinson doodled  and that Peru s Artesonraju 41  is the mountain in the live action logo  while others claim that the Italian side of Monviso inspired the logo  Some editions of the logo bear a striking resemblance to the Pfeifferhorn  42  another Wasatch Range peak  Paramount logo in use until the last days of 2011  The coloring for this logo was introduced in 2002 for Paramount s 90th anniversary  The motion picture logo has gone through many changes over the years  The logo began as a somewhat indistinct charcoal rendering of the mountain ringed with superimposed stars  The logo originally had twenty four stars  as a tribute to the then current system of contracts for actors  since Paramount had twenty four stars signed at the time  In movies of the late 1920s and early  30s  the number of stars encircling the mountain sometimes varied  As an example  twenty five stars are seen in the logo displayed at the end of the Marx Brothers The Cocoanuts  1929   and twenty three are visible at the beginning of Horse Feathers  1932   In 1952  the logo was redesigned as a matte painting created by Jan Domela  A newer  more realistic looking logo debuted in 1953 for Paramount films made in 3D  It was later reworked in 1954 for Paramount films made in widescreen process VistaVision  The text  VistaVision   Motion Picture High Fidelity  was often imposed over the Paramount logo briefly before dissolving into the title sequence  In 1968  the logo was modified again  the text now read  Paramount  instead of  A Paramount Picture Release   and the byline  A Gulf Western Company  appeared on the bottom  The logo was given another modification in 1974  with the number of stars being reduced to 22  and the Paramount text and Gulf Western byline appearing in different fonts  A stylized version of the mountain was featured in Cecil B  DeMille s The Ten Commandments  The mountain retained its conical shape but with a red granite tone and a more angular summit under a red clouded sky to suggest the appearance of Mount Sinai for this single motion picture  Its circle of stars faded in with the announcement   Paramount Presents   A Cecil B  DeMille Production   In 1975  the logo was simplified in a shade of blue  adopting the modified design of the 1968 print logo  which was in use for many decades afterward  The studio introduced a new logo in 1986 in preparation for their 75th anniversary  with a computer generated lake and stars  This version of the Paramount logo was designed by Dario Campanile and animated by Apogee  Inc  for this logo  the stars would move across the screen into the arc shape instead of it being superimposed over the mountain as it was before  When Gulf   Western became Paramount Communications  and continuing until 2002  the Paramount logo would appear first followed by the underline and the byline beneath it  An enhanced version of this logo debuted in 1999  For the company s 90th anniversary  in 2002  a completely new version of the logo was introduced in which shooting stars would fall from a night sky to form the arc while the Paramount logo would fly into place between them  The Viacom byline was changed several years after the company s 2005 split  In December 2011  in celebration of the company s 100th anniversary  a new logo 43  44  45  was animated by Devastudios  Inc  46  The new logo includes a surrounding mountain range and the sun shining in the background  Michael Giacchino composed the logo s new fanfare  The first film to introduce the 100th Anniversary logo was Mission  Impossible   Ghost Protocol  only with a different fanfare  The logo will include the words  100 Years  until the beginning of 2013  when they will be removed  47   edit  Visiting Paramount Those wishing to visit Paramount can take daily studio tours  The tours operate Monday through Friday  Reservations are
