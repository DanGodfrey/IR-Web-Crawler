Mexican American War  also known as the First American Intervention  the Mexican War  or the U S  Mexican War  4  5  was an armed conflict between the United States and Mexico from 1846 to 1848 in the wake of the 1845 U S  annexation of Texas  which Mexico considered part of its territory despite the 1836 Texas Revolution  American forces quickly occupied New Mexico and California  then invaded parts of Northeastern Mexico and Northwest Mexico  meanwhile  the Pacific Squadron conducted a blockade  and took control of several garrisons on the Pacific coast further south in Baja California  After Mexico would still not agree to the cession of its northern territories  another American army captured Mexico City  and the war ended in victory of the U S  The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the major consequence of the war  the forced Mexican Cession of the territories of Alta California and New Mexico to the U S  in exchange for  18 million  In addition  the United States forgave debt owed by the Mexican government to U S  citizens  Mexico accepted the Rio Grande as its national border  and the loss of Texas  American territorial expansion to the Pacific coast had been the goal of President James K  Polk  the leader of the Democratic Party  6  However  the war was highly controversial in the U S   with the Whig Party and anti slavery elements strongly opposed  Heavy American casualties and high monetary cost were also criticized  The political aftermath of the war raised the slavery issue in the U S   leading to intense debates that pointed to civil war  the Compromise of 1850 provided a brief respite  In Mexico  terminology for the war include  primera  intervenci n estadounidense en M xico  United States   First  Intervention in Mexico   invasi n

 Background Mexico was torn apart by political battles that verged on civil war  even as it was united in refusing to recognize the independence of Texas  Mexico threatened war with the U S  if it annexed Texas  Meanwhile President Polk s spirit of Manifest Destiny was focusing U S  interest on westward expansion   edit  Designs on California In 1842  the American minister in Mexico Waddy Thompson  Jr  suggested Mexico might be willing to cede California to settle debts  saying   As to Texas I regard it as of very little value compared with California  the richest  the most beautiful and the healthiest country in the world     with the acquisition of Upper California we should have the same ascendency on the Pacific     France and England both have had their eyes upon it   President John Tyler s administration suggested a tripartite pact that would settle the Oregon boundary dispute and provide for the cession of the port of San Francisco  Lord Aberdeen declined to participate but said Britain had no objection to U S  territorial acquisition there  7  For his part  the British minister in Mexico Richard Pakenham wrote in 1841 to Lord Palmerston urging  to establish an English population in the magnificent Territory of Upper California   saying that  no part of the World offering greater natural advantages for the establishment of an English colony     by all means desirable     that California  once ceasing to belong to Mexico  should not fall into the hands of any power but England     daring and adventurous speculators in the United States have already turned their thoughts in this direction   But by the time the letter reached London  Sir Robert Peel s Tory government with a Little England policy had come to power and rejected the proposal as expensive and a potential source of conflict  8  9   edit  Republic of Texas Main articles  Republic of Texas  Texas Annexation  and Texas Revolution The Republic of Texas  The present day outlines of the U S  states are superimposed on the boundaries of 1836 1845  In 1810  Moses Austin  a banker from Missouri  was granted a large tract of land in Texas  but died before he could bring his plan of recruiting American settlers for the land to fruition  His son  Stephen F  Austin  succeeded and brought over 300 families into Texas  which started the steady trend of American migration into the Texas frontier  Austin s colony was the most successful of several colonies authorized by the Mexican government  The Mexican government intended the anglophone settlers to act as a buffer between the existing Mexican residents and the marauding Comanches  but the anglo colonists tended to settle where there was decent farmland  rather than where they would have been an effective buffer  In 1829  as a result of the large influx of American immigrants  the Americans outnumbered Mexicans in the Texas territory  The Mexican government decided to bring back the property tax  increase tariffs on U S  shipped goods  and prohibit slavery  The settlers rejected the demands  which led to Mexico closing Texas to additional immigration  However  Americans continued to flow into the Texas territory  In 1834  General Antonio L pez de Santa Anna became the dictator of Mexico  abandoning the federal system  He decided to squash the semi independence of Texas  Stephen F  Austin called Texans to arms  they declared independence from Mexico in 1836  and after Santa Anna defeated the Texans at the Alamo  causing his army nearly three weeks  delay   he was defeated by the Texan Army commanded by General Sam Houston and captured at the Battle of San Jacinto and signed a treaty recognizing Texas independence  Texas consolidated its status as an independent republic  winning official recognition from Britain  France  and the U S   which all advised Mexico not to try to reconquer the new nation  Most Texans wanted to join the U S  but annexation of Texas was contentious in the U S  Congress  where Whigs were largely opposed  In 1845 Texas agreed to the offer of annexation by the U S  Congress  Texas became the 28th state on December 29  1845  10   edit  Origins of the war The Mexican government had long warned the United States that annexation of Texas would mean war  Because the Mexican Congress had refused to recognize Texan independence  Mexico saw Texas as a rebellious territory that would be retaken  Britain and France  which recognized the independence of Texas  repeatedly tried to dissuade Mexico from declaring war  When Texas joined the U S  as a state in 1845  the Mexican government broke diplomatic relations with the U S  The border of Texas as an independent state had never been settled  The Republic of Texas claimed land up to the Rio Grande based on the Treaties of Velasco  but Mexico refused to accept these as valid  claiming the border as the Nueces River  Reference to the Rio Grande boundary of Texas was omitted from the U S  Congress  annexation resolution to help secure passage after the annexation treaty failed in the Senate  President Polk claimed the Rio Grande boundary  and this provoked a dispute with Mexico  In June 1845  Polk sent General Zachary Taylor to Texas  and by October 3 500 Americans were on the Nueces River  prepared to defend Texas from a Mexican invasion  Polk wanted to protect the border and also coveted the continent clear to the Pacific Ocean  Polk had instructed the Pacific Squadron to seize the California ports if Mexico declared war while staying on good terms with the inhabitants  At the same time he wrote to Thomas Larkin  the American consul in Alta California  disclaiming American ambitions in California but offering to support independence from Mexico or voluntary accession to the U S   and warning that a British or French takeover would be opposed  11  To end another war scare  Fifty Four Forty or Fight  with Britain over Oregon Country  Polk signed the Oregon Treaty dividing the territory  angering northern Democrats who felt he was prioritizing Southern expansion over Northern expansion  In the winter of 1845 46  the federally commissioned explorer John C  Fr mont and a group of armed men appeared in California  After telling the Mexican governor and Larkin he was merely buying supplies on the way to Oregon  he instead entered the populated area of California and visited Santa Cruz and the Salinas Valley  explaining he had been looking for a seaside home for his mother  12  The Mexican authorities became alarmed and ordered him to leave  Fremont responded by building a fort on Gavilan Peak and raising the American flag  Larkin sent word that his actions were counterproductive  Fremont left California in March but returned to California and assisted the Bear Flag Revolt in Sonoma  where many American immigrants stated that they were playing  the Texas game  and declared California s independence from Mexico  On November 10  1845  13  Polk sent John Slidell  a secret representative  to Mexico City with an offer of  25 million   671 538 462 today  for the Rio Grande border in Texas and Mexico s provinces of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M xico  U S  expansionists wanted California to thwart British ambitions in the area and to gain a port on the Pacific Ocean  Polk authorized Slidell to forgive the  3 million   81 million today  owed to U S  citizens for damages caused by the Mexican War of Independence 14  and pay another  25 to  30 million   672 million to  806 million today  in exchange for the two territories  15  Mexico was not inclined nor able to negotiate  In 1846 alone  the presidency changed hands four times  the war ministry six times  and the finance ministry sixteen times  16  However  Mexican public opinion and all political factions agreed that selling the territories to the United States would tarnish the national honor  17  Mexicans who opposed direct conflict with the United States  including President Jos  Joaqu n de Herrera  were viewed as traitors  18  Military opponents of de Herrera  supported by populist newspapers  considered Slidell s presence in Mexico City an insult  When de Herrera considered receiving Slidell to settle the problem of Texas annexation peacefully  he was accused of treason and deposed  After a more nationalistic government under General Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga came to power  it publicly reaffirmed Mexico s claim to Texas  18  Slidell  convinced that Mexico should be  chastised   returned to the U S  19   edit  Conflict over the Nueces Strip President James K  Polk ordered General Taylor and his forces south to the Rio Grande  entering the territory that Mexicans disputed  Mexico laid claim to the Nueces River about 150 mi  240 km  north of the Rio Grande as its border with Texas  the U S  claimed it was the Rio Grande  citing the 1836 Treaties of Velasco  Mexico  however  under the leadership of General Lorenzo Chlamon  20  rejected the treaties and refused to negotiate  it claimed all of Texas  Taylor ignored Mexican demands to withdraw to the Nueces  He constructed a makeshift fort  later known as Fort Brown Fort Texas  on the banks of the Rio Grande opposite the city of Matamoros  Tamaulipas  Mexican forces under General Mariano Arista prepared for war  On April 25  1846  a 2 000 strong Mexican cavalry detachment attacked a 70 man U S  patrol that had been sent into the contested territory north of the Rio Grande and south of the Nueces River  The Mexican cavalry routed the patrol  killing 16 U S  soldiers in what later became known as the Thornton Affair  after Captain Thornton  who was in command  21   edit  Declaration of war Overview map of the war v t e Texas Campaign Thornton Affair Siege of Fort Texas Battle of Palo Alto Battle of Resaca de la Palma Polk received word of the Thornton Affair  which  added to the Mexican government s rejection of Slidell  Polk believed  constituted a casus belli  case for war   22  His message to Congress on May 11  1846 stated that  Mexico has passed the boundary of the United States  has invaded our territory and shed American blood upon American soil   23  24  Congress approved the declaration of war on May 13  with southern Democrats in strong support  Sixty seven Whigs voted against the war on a key slavery amendment  25  but on the final passage only 14 Whigs voted no  25  including Rep  John Quincy Adams  Congress declared war on Mexico on May 13  1846 after only having a few hours to debate  Although President Paredes s issuance of a manifesto on May 23 is sometimes considered the declaration of war  Mexico officially declared war by Congress on July 7   edit  Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna Once the U S  declared war on Mexico  Antonio L pez de Santa Anna wrote to Mexico City saying he no longer had aspirations to the presidency  but would eagerly use his military experience to fight off the foreign invasion of Mexico as he had before  President Valent n G mez Far as was desperate enough to accept the offer and allowed Santa Anna to return  Meanwhile  Santa Anna had secretly been dealing with representatives of the U S   pledging that if he were allowed back in Mexico through the U S  naval blockades  he would work to sell all contested territory to the United States at a reasonable price  26  Once back in Mexico at the head of an army  Santa Anna reneged on both agreements  Santa Anna declared himself president again and unsuccessfully tried to fight off the U S  invasion   edit  Opposition to the war Events leading to

In the U S   increasingly divided by sectional rivalry  the war was a partisan issue and an essential element in the origins of the American Civil War  Most Whigs in the North and South opposed it  27  most Democrats supported it  28  Southern Democrats  animated by a popular belief in Manifest Destiny  supported it in hope of adding slave owning territory to the South and avoiding being outnumbered by the faster growing North  John O Sullivan  the editor of the  Democratic Review   coined this phrase in its context  stating that it must be  Our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions   29  Northern anti slavery elements feared the rise of a Slave Power  Whigs generally wanted to strengthen the economy with industrialization  not expand it with more land  Democrats wanted more land  northern Democrats were attracted by the possibilities in the far northwest  Joshua Giddings led a group of dissenters in Washington D C  He called the war with Mexico  an aggressive  unholy  and unjust war   and voted against supplying soldiers and weapons  He said  In the murder of Mexicans upon their own soil  or in robbing them of their country  I can take no part either now or here after  The guilt of these crimes must rest on others  I will not participate in them  30  Fellow Whig Abraham Lincoln contested the causes for the war and demanded to know exactly where Thornton had been attacked and American blood shed   Show me the spot   he demanded  Whig leader Robert Toombs of Georgia declared  This war is nondescript      We charge the President with usurping the war making power     with seizing a country     which had been for centuries  and was then in the possession of the Mexicans      Let us put a check upon this lust of dominion  We had territory enough  Heaven knew  31  Northern abolitionists attacked the war as an attempt by slave owners to strengthen the grip of slavery and thus ensure their continued influence in the federal government  Acting on his convictions  Henry David Thoreau was jailed for his refusal to pay taxes to support the war  and penned his famous essay  Civil Disobedience  Former President John Quincy Adams also expressed his belief that the war was primarily an effort to expand slavery in a speech he gave before the House on May 25  1836  32  In response to such concerns  Democratic Congressman David Wilmot introduced the Wilmot Proviso  which aimed to prohibit slavery in new territory acquired from Mexico  Wilmot s proposal did not pass Congress  but it spurred further hostility between the factions   edit  Defense of the war Besides alleging that the actions of Mexican military forces within the disputed boundary lands north of the Rio Grande constituted an attack on American soil  the war s advocates viewed the territories of New Mexico and California as only nominally Mexican possessions with very tenuous ties to Mexico  and as actually unsettled  ungoverned  and unprotected frontier lands  whose non aboriginal population  where there was any at all  comprised a substantial in places even a majority American component  and which were feared to be under imminent threat of acquisition by America s rival on the continent  the British  President Polk reprised these arguments in his Third Annual Message to Congress on December 7  1847  33  in which he scrupulously detailed his administration s position on the origins of the conflict  the measures the U S  had taken to avoid hostilities  and the justification for declaring war  He also elaborated upon the many outstanding financial claims by American citizens against Mexico and argued that  in view of the country s insolvency  the cession of some large portion of its northern territories was the only indemnity realistically available as compensation  This helped to rally Congressional Democrats to his side  ensuring passage of his war measures and bolstering support for the war in the U S   edit  Opening hostilities The Siege of Fort Texas began on May 3  Mexican artillery at Matamoros opened fire on Fort Texas  which replied with its own guns  The bombardment continued for 160 hours 34  and expanded as Mexican forces gradually surrounded the fort  Thirteen U S  soldiers were injured during the bombardment  and two were killed  34  Among the dead was Jacob Brown  after whom the fort was later named  35  On May 8  Zachary Taylor and 2 400 troops arrived to relieve the fort  36  However  Arista rushed north and intercepted him with a force of 3 400 at Palo Alto  The Americans employed  flying artillery   the American term for horse artillery  a type of mobile light artillery that was mounted on horse carriages with the entire crew riding horses into battle  It had a devastating effect on the Mexican army  The Mexicans replied with cavalry skirmishes and their own artillery  The U S  flying artillery somewhat demoralized the Mexican side  and seeking terrain more to their advantage  the Mexicans retreated to the far side of a dry riverbed  resaca  during the night  It provided a natural fortification  but during the retreat  Mexican troops were scattered  making communication difficult  During the Battle of Resaca de la Palma the next day  the two sides engaged in fierce hand to hand combat  The U S  cavalry managed to capture the Mexican artillery  causing the Mexican side to retreat a retreat that turned into a rout  34  Fighting on unfamiliar terrain  his troops fleeing in retreat  Arista found it impossible to rally his forces  Mexican casualties were heavy  and the Mexicans were forced to abandon their artillery and baggage  Fort Brown inflicted additional casualties as the withdrawing troops passed by the fort  Many Mexican soldiers drowned trying to swim across the Rio Grande   edit  Conduct of the war See also  Mexican American War campaigns After the declaration of war  U S  forces invaded Mexican territory on two main fronts  The U S  War Department sent a U S  cavalry force under Stephen W  Kearny to invade western Mexico from Jefferson Barracks and Fort Leavenworth  reinforced by a Pacific fleet under John D  Sloat  This was done primarily because of concerns that Britain might also try to seize the area  Two more forces  one under John E  Wool and the other under Taylor  were ordered to occupy Mexico as far south as the city of Monterrey   edit  California campaign v t e California Campaign Bear Flag Revolt Battle of Olompali Battle of Chino Mexican

replica of the first  Bear Flag  now at El Presidio de Sonoma  or Sonoma Barracks Although the U S  declared war against Mexico on May 13  1846  it took over a month  until the middle of June 1846  for definite word of war to get to California  American consul Thomas O  Larkin  stationed in Monterey  on hearing rumors of war tried to maintain the peace between the States and the small Mexican military garrison commanded by Jos  Castro  U S  Army captain John C  Fr mont  with about 60 well armed men  had entered California in December  1845  and was slowly marching to Oregon when he received word that war between Mexico and the U S  was imminent  So began his chapter of the war  the  Bear Flag Revolt   37  On June 15  1846  some thirty settlers  mostly American citizens  staged a revolt and seized the small Mexican garrison in Sonoma  They raised the  Bear Flag  of the California Republic over Sonoma  The republic was in existence scarcely more than a week before the U S  Army  led by Fr mont  took over on June 23  The California state flag today is based on this original Bear Flag and still contains the words   California Republic   Commodore John Drake Sloat  upon hearing of imminent war and the revolt in Sonoma  ordered his naval and marine forces to occupy Monterey  the capital  on July 7 and raise the flag of the U S   San Francisco  then called Yerba Buena  was occupied on July 9  On July 15  Sloat transferred his command to Commodore Robert F  Stockton  a much more aggressive leader  who put Fr mont s forces under his orders  On July 19  Fr mont s  California Battalion  swelled to about 160 additional men from newly arrived settlers near Sacramento  and he entered Monterey in a joint operation with some of Stockton s sailors and marines  The word had been received  war was official  The U S  forces easily took over the north of California  within days they controlled San Francisco  Sonoma  and the privately owned Sutter s Fort in Sacramento  From Alta California  the present day American state of California   Mexican General Jos  Castro and Governor P o Pico fled southward  When Stockton s forces  sailing southward to San Diego  stopped in San Pedro  he sent 50 U S  Marines ashore  this force entered Los Angeles unresisted on August 13  1846  With the success of this so called  Siege of Los Angeles   the nearly bloodless conquest of California seemed complete  Stockton  however  left too small a force in Los Angeles  and the Californios  acting on their own  and without help from Mexico  led by Jos  Mar a Flores  forced the American garrison to retreat  late in September  The rancho vaqueros who had banded together to defend their land fought as Californio lancers  they were a force the Americans had not anticipated  More than three hundred American reinforcements  sent by Stockton and led by Captain William Mervine  U S N   were repulsed in the Battle of Dominguez Rancho  fought from October 7 through 9  1846  near San Pedro  Fourteen American Marines were killed  Meanwhile  General Stephen W  Kearny  with a squadron of 139 dragoons that he had led on a grueling march across New Mexico  Arizona  and the Sonoran Desert  finally reached California on December 6  1846  and fought in a small battle with Californio lancers at the Battle of San Pasqual near San Diego  California  where 22 of Kearny s troops were killed  Kearny s command was bloodied and in poor condition but pushed on until they had to establish a defensive position on  Mule  Hill near present day Escondido  The Californios besieged the dragoons for four days until Commodore Stockton s relief force arrived  The resupplied  combined American force marched north from San Diego on December 29 and entered the Los Angeles area on January 8  1847  38  linking up with Fr mont s men there  American forces totaling 607 soldiers and marines fought and defeated a Californio force of about 300 men under the command of Captain general Flores in the decisive Battle of Rio San Gabriel  39  The next day  January 9  1847  the Americans fought and won the Battle of La Mesa  On January 12  the last significant body of Californios surrendered to U S  forces  That marked the end of armed resistance in California  and the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed the next day  on January 13  1847   edit  Pacific Coast campaign USS Independence assisted in the blockade of the Mexican Pacific coast  capturing the Mexican ship Correo and a launch on 16 May 1847  She supported the capture of Guaymas  Mexico  on 19 October 1847 and landed bluejackets and Marines to occupy Mazatl n  Mexico on 11 November 1847  After upper California was secure most of the Pacific Squadron proceeded down the California coast capturing all major Baja California cities and capturing or destroying nearly all Mexican vessels in the Gulf of California  Other ports  not on the peninsula  were taken as well  The objective of the Pacific Coast Campaign was to capture Mazatlan  a major supply base for Mexican forces  Numerous Mexican ships were also captured by this squadron with the USS Cyane given credit for 18 captures and numerous destroyed ships  40  Entering the Gulf of California  Independence  Congress and Cyane seized La Paz captured and burned the small Mexican fleet at Guaymas  Within a month  they cleared the Gulf of hostile ships  destroying or capturing 30 vessels  Later on their sailors and marines captured the town of Mazatlan  Mexico  on 11 November 1847  A Mexican campaign under Manuel Pineda to retake the various captured ports resulted in several small clashes  Battle of Mulege  Battle of La Paz  Battle of San Jos  del Cabo  and two sieges  Siege of La Paz  Siege of San Jos  del Cabo  in which the Pacific Squadron ships provided artillery support  U S  garrisons remained in control of the ports and following reinforcement  Lt  Col  Henry S  Burton marched out  rescued captured Americans  captured Pineda and on March 31  defeated and dispersed remaining Mexican forces at the Skirmish of Todos Santos  unaware the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo had been signed in February 1848  When the American garrisons were evacuated following the treaty  many Mexicans that had been supporting the American cause and had thought Lower California would also be annexed like Upper California  were evacuated with them to Monterey   edit  Northeastern Mexico The defeats at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma caused political turmoil in Mexico  turmoil which Antonio L pez de Santa Anna used to revive his political career and return from self imposed exile in Cuba in mid August 1846  41  He promised the U S  that if allowed to pass through the blockade  he would negotiate a peaceful conclusion to the war and sell the New Mexico and Alta California territories to the U S  42  Once Santa Anna arrived in Mexico City  however  he reneged and offered his services to the Mexican government  Then  after being appointed commanding general  he reneged again and seized the presidency  Led by Taylor  2 300 U S  troops crossed the Rio Grande  Rio Bravo  after some initial difficulties in obtaining river transport  His soldiers occupied the city of Matamoros  then Camargo  where the soldiery suffered the first of many problems with disease  and then proceeded south and besieged the city of Monterrey  The hard fought Battle of Monterrey resulted in serious losses on both sides  The American light artillery was ineffective against the stone fortifications of the city  The Mexican forces were under General Pedro de Ampudia and repulsed Taylor s best infantry division at Fort Teneria  American soldiers  including many West Pointers  had never engaged in urban warfare before and they marched straight down the open streets  where they were annihilated by Mexican defenders well hidden in Monterrey s thick adobe homes  43  Two days later  they changed their urban warfare tactics  Texan soldiers had fought in a Mexican city before and advised Taylor s generals that the Americans needed to  mouse hole  through the city s homes  In other words  they needed to punch holes in the side or roofs of the homes and fight hand to hand inside the structures  This method proved successful and Ampudia eventually surrendered  44  Battle of Monterrey Eventually  these actions drove and trapped Ampudia s men into the city s central plaza  where howitzer shelling forced Ampudia to negotiate  Taylor agreed to allow the Mexican Army to evacuate and to an eight week armistice in return for the surrender of the city  Under pressure from Washington  Taylor broke the armistice and occupied the city of Saltillo  southwest of Monterrey  Santa Anna blamed the loss of Monterrey and Saltillo on Ampudia and demoted him to command a small artillery battalion  On February 22  1847  Santa Anna personally marched north to fight Taylor with 20 000 men  Taylor  with 4 600 men  had entrenched at a mountain pass called Buena Vista  Santa Anna suffered desertions on the way north and arrived with 15 000 men in a tired state  He demanded and was refused surrender of the U S  Army  he attacked the next morning  Santa Anna flanked the U S  positions by sending his cavalry and some of his infantry up the steep terrain that made up one side of the pass  while a division of infantry attacked frontally along the road leading to Buena Vista  Furious fighting ensued  during which the U S troops were nearly routed  but managed to cling to their entrenched position  The Mexicans had inflicted considerable losses but Santa Anna had gotten word of upheaval in Mexico City  so he withdrew that night  leaving Taylor in control of part of Northern Mexico  Polk distrusted Taylor  whom he felt had shown incompetence in the Battle of Monterrey by agreeing to the armistice  and may have considered him a political rival for the White House  Taylor later used the Battle of Buena Vista as the centerpiece of his successful 1848 presidential campaign   edit  Northwestern Mexico On March 1  1847  Alexander W  Doniphan occupied Chihuahua City  He found the inhabitants much less willing to accept the American conquest than the New Mexicans  The British consul John Potts did not want to let Doniphan search Governor Trias s mansion  and unsuccessfully asserted it was under British protection  American merchants in Chihuahua wanted the American force to stay in order to protect their business  Gilpin advocated a march on Mexico City and convinced a majority of officers  but Doniphan subverted this plan  then in late April Taylor ordered the First Missouri Mounted Volunteers to leave Chihuahua and join him at Saltillo  The American merchants either followed or returned to Santa Fe  Along the way  the townspeople of Parras enlisted Doniphan s aid against an Indian raiding party that had taken children  horses  mules  and money  45  The civilian population of northern Mexico offered little resistance to the American invasion possibly because the country had already been devastated by Comanche and Apache Indian raids  Josiah Gregg  who was with the American army in northern Mexico  said that  the whole country from New Mexico to the borders of Durango is almost entirely depopulated  The haciendas and ranchos have been mostly abandoned  and the people chiefly confined to the towns and cities   46   edit  U S  press and popular war enthusiasm During the war inventions such as the telegraph created new means of communication that updated people with the latest news from the reporters  who were usually on the scene  With more than a decade s experience reporting urban crime  the  penny press  realized the voracious need of the public to get the astounding war news  This was the first time in the American history when the accounts by journalists  instead of the opinions of politicians  caused great influence in shaping people s minds and attitudes toward a war  News about the war always caused extraordinary popular excitement  By getting constant reports from the battlefield  Americans became emotionally united as a community  In the spring of 1846  news about Zachary Taylor s victory at Palo Alto brought up a large crowd that met in a cotton textile town of Lowell  Massachusetts  At Veracruz and Buena Vista  New York celebrated their twin victories in May 1847  Among fireworks and illuminations  they had a  grand procession  of about 400 000 people  Generals Taylor and Scott became heroes for their people and later became presidential candidates   edit  Desertion Battle of Churubusco by J  Cameron  published by Nathaniel Currier  Hand tinted lithograph  1847  Digitally restored  The desertion rate was a major problem for the Mexican army  depleting forces on the eve of battle  Most of the soldiers were peasants who had a loyalty to their village and family  but not to the generals who conscripted them  Often hungry and ill  never well paid  under equipped and only partially trained  the soldiers were held in contempt by their officers and had little reason to fight the Americans  Looking for their opportunity  many slipped away from camp to find their way back to their home village  47  The desertion rate in the U S  army was 8 3   9 200 out of 111 000   compared to 12 7  during the War of 1812 and usual peacetime rates of about 14 8  per year  48  Many men deserted to join another U S  unit and get a second enlistment bonus  While some deserted because of the miserable conditions in camp  it has been suggested that others used the army to get free transportation to California  where they deserted to join the gold rush  49  This  however  is unlikely as gold was only discovered in California on January 24  1848  less than two weeks before the war concluded  By the time word reached the eastern U S  that gold had been discovered  word also reached it that the war was over  Several hundred deserters went over to the Mexican side  nearly all were recent immigrants from Europe with weak ties to the U S   the most famous group being Saint Patrick s Battalion  about half of whom were Catholics from Ireland  The Mexicans issued broadsides and leaflets enticing U S  soldiers with promises of money  land bounties  and officers  commissions  Mexican guerrillas shadowed the U S  Army and captured men who took unauthorized leave or fell out of the ranks  The guerrillas coerced these men to join the Mexican ranks  The generous promises proved illusory for most deserters  who risked being executed  if captured by U S  forces  About 50 of the San Patricios were tried and hanged following their capture at Churubusco in August 1847  50   edit  Scott s Mexico City campaign v t

Taylor s army for a continued advance  President Polk sent a second army under General Winfield Scott  which was transported to the port of Veracruz by sea  to begin an invasion of the Mexican heartland  On March 9  1847  Scott performed the first major amphibious landing in U S  history in preparation for the Siege of Veracruz  A group of 12 000 volunteer and regular soldiers successfully offloaded supplies  weapons  and horses near the walled city using specially designed landing craft  Included in the invading force were Robert E  Lee  George Meade  Ulysses S  Grant  James Longstreet  and Thomas  Stonewall  Jackson  The city was defended by Mexican General Juan Morales with 3 400 men  Mortars and naval guns under Commodore Matthew C  Perry were used to reduce the city walls and harass defenders  The city replied the best it could with its own artillery  The effect of the extended barrage destroyed the will of the Mexican side to fight against a numerically superior force  and they surrendered the city after 12 days under siege  U S  troops suffered 80 casualties  while the Mexican side had around 180 killed and wounded  about half of whom were civilian  During the siege  the U S  side began to fall victim to yellow fever   edit  Advance on Puebla Scott then marched westward toward Mexico City with 8 500 healthy troops  while Santa Anna set up a defensive position in a canyon around the main road at the halfway mark to Mexico City  near the hamlet of Cerro Gordo  Santa Anna had entrenched with 12 000 troops and artillery that were trained on the road  along which he expected Scott to appear  However  Scott had sent 2 600 mounted dragoons ahead  and the Mexican artillery prematurely fired on them and revealed their positions  Instead of taking the main road  Scott s troops trekked through the rough terrain to the north  setting up his artillery on the high ground and quietly flanking the Mexicans  Although by then aware of the positions of U S  troops  Santa Anna and his troops were unprepared for the onslaught that followed  The Mexican army was routed  The U S  Army suffered 400 casualties  while the Mexicans suffered over 1 000 casualties and 3 000 were taken prisoner  In August 1847  Captain Kirby Smith  of Scott s 3rd Infantry  reflected on the resistance of the Mexican army  What stupid people they are  They can do nothing and their continued defeats should convince them of it  They have lost six great battles  we have captured six hundred and eight cannon  nearly one hundred thousand stands of arms  made twenty thousand prisoners  have the greatest portion of their country and are fast advancing on their Capital which must be ours  yet they refuse to treat  i e   negotiate terms   51   edit  Pause at Puebla In May  Scott pushed on to Puebla  the second largest city in Mexico  Because of the citizens  hostility to Santa Anna  the city capitulated without resistance on May 1  During the following months Scott gathered supplies and reinforcements at Puebla and sent back units whose enlistments had expired  Scott also made strong efforts to keep his troops disciplined and treat the Mexican people under occupation justly  so as to prevent a popular rising against his army   edit  Advance on Mexico City and its capture With guerrillas harassing his line of communications back to Vera Cruz  Scott decided not to weaken his army to defend it but  leaving only a garrison at Puebla to protect the sick and injured recovering there  advanced on Mexico City on August 7  with his remaining force  The capital was laid open in a series of battles around the right flank of the city defenses  culminating in the Battle of Chapultepec  With the subsequent storming of the city gates  the capital was occupied  Winfield Scott became an American national hero after his victories in this campaign of the Mexican American War  and later became military governor of occupied Mexico City   edit  Santa Anna s last campaign In late September 1847  Santa Anna made one last attempt to defeat the Americans  by cutting them off from the coast  General Joaqu n Rea began the Siege of Puebla  soon joined by Santa Anna  but they failed to take it before the approach of a relief column from Vera Cruz under Brig  Gen  Joseph Lane prompted Santa Anna to stop him  Puebla was relieved by Gen  Lane October 12  1847  following his defeat of Santa Anna at the Battle of Huamantla October 9  1847  The battle was Santa Anna s last  Following the defeat  the new Mexican government led by Manuel de la Pe a y Pe a asked Santa Anna to turn over command of the army to General Jos  Joaqu n de Herrera   edit  Anti guerrilla campaign Following his capture and securing of the capital  General Scott sent about a quarter of his strength to secure his line of communications to Vera Cruz from the Light Corps and other Mexican guerilla forces that had been harassing it since May  He strengthened the garrison of Puebla  and by November established 750 man posts at Perote  Puente Nacional  Rio Frio  and San Juan along the National Road and detailed an antiguerrilla brigade under Brig  Gen  Joseph Lane to carry the war to the Light Corps and other guerillas  He also ordered that convoys would travel with at least 1 300 man escorts  Despite some victories over General Joaqu n Rea at Atlixco  18 October 1847  and Izucar de Matamoros  in November  by General Lane  guerrilla raids on the supply route continued into 1848 until the end of the war  52   edit  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo Main article  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo The Mexican Cession  shown in red  and the later Gadsden Purchase  shown in yellow  Outnumbered militarily and with many of its large cities occupied  Mexico could not defend itself and was also faced with internal divisions  It had little choice but to make peace on any terms  53  The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo  signed on February 2  1848  by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican plenipotentiary representatives Luis G  Cuevas  Bernardo Couto  and Miguel Atristain  ended the war and gave the U S  undisputed control of Texas  established the U S  Mexican border of the Rio Grande River  and ceded to the United States the present day states of California  Nevada  Utah  New Mexico  most of Arizona and Colorado  and parts of Texas  Oklahoma  Kansas  and Wyoming  In return  Mexico received US  18 250 000 54    490 223 077 today  less than half the amount the U S  had attempted to offer Mexico for the land before the opening of hostilities 55  and the U S  agreed to assume  3 25 million   87 300 000 today  in debts that the Mexican government owed to U S  citizens  14  The acquisition was a source of controversy then  especially among U S  politicians who had opposed the war from the start  A leading antiwar U S  newspaper  the Whig Intelligencer sardonically concluded that  We take nothing by conquest      Thank God   56  57  Mexican territorial claims relinquished in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in white  Jefferson Davis introduced an amendment giving the U S  most of northeastern Mexico  which failed 44 11  It was supported by both senators from Texas  Sam Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk   Daniel S  Dickinson of New York  Stephen A  Douglas of Illinois  Edward A  Hannegan of Indiana  and one each from Alabama  Florida  Mississippi  Ohio  Missouri  and Tennessee  Most of the leaders of the Democratic party  Thomas Hart Benton  John C  Calhoun  Herschel V  Johnson  Lewis Cass  James Murray Mason of Virginia  and Ambrose Hundley Sevier  were opposed  58  An amendment by Whig Senator George Edmund Badger of North Carolina to exclude New Mexico and California lost 35 15  with three Southern Whigs voting with the Democrats  Daniel Webster was bitter that four New England senators made deciding votes for acquiring the new territories  The acquired lands west of the Rio Grande are traditionally called the Mexican Cession in the U S   as opposed to the Texas Annexation two years earlier  though division of New Mexico down the middle at the Rio Grande never had any basis either in control or Mexican boundaries  Mexico never recognized the independence of Texas 59  prior to the war  and did not cede its claim to territory north of the Rio Grande or Gila River until this treaty  Prior to ratifying the treaty  the U S  Senate made two modifications  changing the wording of Article IX  which guaranteed Mexicans living in the purchased territories the right to become U S  citizens   and striking out Article X  which conceded the legitimacy of land grants made by the Mexican government   On May 26  1848  when the two countries exchanged ratifications of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo  they further agreed to a three article protocol  known as the Protocol of Quer taro  to explain the amendments  The first article claimed that the original Article IX of the treaty  although replaced by Article III of the Treaty of Louisiana  would still confer the rights delineated in Article IX  The second article confirmed the legitimacy of land grants under Mexican law  60  The protocol was signed in the city of Quer taro by A  H  Sevier  Nathan Clifford  and Luis de la Rosa  60  Article XI offered a potential benefit to Mexico in that the US pledged to suppress the Comanche and Apache raids that had ravaged northern Mexico  However  the Indian raids did not cease for several decades after the treaty  although a cholera epidemic reduced the numbers of the Comanche in 1849  61   edit  Results American occupation of Mexico City Mexican territory  prior to the secession of Texas  comprised almost 1 700 000 sq mi  4 400 000 km2   which was reduced to just under 800 000 by 1848  Another 32 000 were sold to the U S  in the Gadsden Purchase of 1853  for a total reduction of more than 55   or 900 000 square miles  62  The annexed territories  comparable in size to Western Europe  were essentially unsettled  containing about 1 000 Mexican families in Alta California and 7 000 in Nuevo M xico  citation needed  as well as large Native American nations such as the Navajo  Hopi  and dozens of others  A few relocated further south in Mexico  the great majority remained in the U S  Descendants of these Mexican families have risen to prominence in American life  such as United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar  and his brother  U S  Rep  John Salazar  both from Colorado  A month before the end of the war  Polk was criticized in a United States House of Representatives amendment to a bill praising Major General Zachary Taylor for  a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States   This criticism  in which Congressman Abraham Lincoln played an important role with his Spot Resolutions  followed congressional scrutiny of the war s beginnings  including factual challenges to claims made by President Polk  63  64  The vote followed party lines  with all Whigs supporting the amendment  Lincoln s attack won luke warm support from fellow Whigs in Illinois but was harshly counter attacked by Democrats  who rallied pro war sentiments in Illinois  Lincoln s Spot resolutions haunted his future campaigns in the heavily Democratic state of Illinois  and was cited by enemies well into his presidency  65  In much of the U S   victory and the acquisition of new land brought a surge of patriotism  Victory seemed to fulfill Democrats  belief in their country s Manifest Destiny  While Whig Ralph Waldo Emerson rejected war  as a means of achieving America s destiny   he accepted that  most of the great results of history are brought about by discreditable means   66  Although the Whigs had opposed the war  they made Zachary Taylor their presidential candidate in the election of 1848  praising his military performance while muting their criticism of the war  Many of the military leaders on both sides of the American Civil War had fought as junior officers in Mexico  including Ulysses S  Grant  George B  McClellan  Ambrose Burnside  Stonewall Jackson  James Longstreet  George Meade  Robert E  Lee  and the future Confederate President Jefferson Davis  In Mexico City s Chapultepec Park  the Monument to the Heroic Cadets commemorates the heroic sacrifice of six teenaged military cadets who fought to their deaths rather than surrender to American troops during the Battle of Chapultepec Castle on September 18  1847  The monument is an important patriotic site in Mexico  On March 5  1947  nearly one hundred years after the battle  U S  President Harry S  Truman placed a wreath at the monument and stood for a moment of silence   edit  Grant s views on the war President Ulysses S  Grant  who as a young army lieutenant had served in Mexico under General Taylor  recalled in his Memoirs  published in 1885  that  Generally  the officers of the army were indifferent whether the annexation was consummated or not  but not so all of them  For myself  I was bitterly opposed to the measure  and to this day regard the war  which resulted  as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation  It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies  in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory  67  Grant also expressed the view that the war against Mexico had brought punishment on the United States in the form of the American Civil War  The Southern rebellion was largely the outgrowth of the Mexican war  Nations  like individuals  are punished for their transgressions  We got our punishment in the most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times  68   edit  Combatants On the American side  the war was fought by regiments of regulars and various regiments  battalions  and companies of volunteers from the different states of the union and the Americans and some of the Mexicans in the territory of California and New Mexico  On the West Coast  the U S  Navy fielded a battalion in an attempt to recapture Los Angeles  69   edit  United States Main article  List of U S  Army  Navy and Volunteer units in the Mexican American War At the beginning of the war  the U S  Army had eight regiments of infantry  three battalions   four artillery regiments and three mounted regiments  two dragoons  one of mounted rifles   These regiments were supplemented by 10 new regiments  nine of infantry and one of cavalry  raised for one year s service  new regiments raised for one year according to act of Congress Feb  11  1847   70  State Volunteers were raised in various sized units and for various periods of time  mostly for one year  Later some were raised for the duration of the war as it became clear it was going to last longer than a year  71  U S  soldiers  memoirs describe cases of looting and murder of Mexican civilians  mostly by State Volunteers  One officer s diary records  We reached Burrita about 5 pm  many of the Louisiana volunteers were there  a lawless drunken rabble  They had driven away the inhabitants  taken possession of their houses  and were emulating each other in making beasts of themselves  72  John L  O Sullivan  a vocal proponent of Manifest Destiny  later recollected  The regulars regarded the volunteers with importance and contempt      The volunteers  robbed Mexicans of their cattle and corn  stole their fences for firewood  got drunk  and killed several inoffensive inhabitants of the town in the streets  Many of the volunteers were unwanted and considered poor soldiers  The expression  Just like Gaines s army  came to refer to something useless  the phrase having originated when a group of untrained and unwilling Louisiana troops were rejected and sent back by Gen  Taylor at the beginning of the war  The last surviving U S  veteran of the conflict  Owen Thomas Edgar  died on September 3  1929  at age 98  1 563 U S  soldiers are buried in the Mexico City National Cemetery  which is maintained by the American Battle Monuments Commission   edit  Mexico At the beginning of the war  Mexican forces were divided between the permanent forces  permanentes  and the active militiamen  activos   The permanent forces consisted of 12 regiments of infantry  of two battalions each   three brigades of artillery  eight regiments of cavalry  one separate squadron and a brigade of dragoons  The militia amounted to nine infantry and six cavalry regiments  In the northern territories of Mexico  presidial companies  presidiales  protected the scattered settlements there  73  One of the contributing factors to loss of the war by Mexico was the inferiority of their weapons  The Mexican army was using British muskets  e g  Brown Bess  from the Napoleonic Wars  In contrast to the aging Mexican standard issue infantry weapon  some U S  troops had the latest U S  manufactured breech loading Hall rifles and Model 1841 percussion rifles  In the later stages of the war  U S  cavalry and officers were issued Colt Walker revolvers  of which the U S  Army had ordered 1 000 in 1846  Throughout the war  the superiority of the U S  artillery often carried the day  Political divisions inside Mexico were another factor in the U S  victory  Inside Mexico  the centralistas and republicans vied for power  and at times these two factions inside Mexico s military fought each other rather than the invading American army  Another faction called the monarchists  whose members wanted to install a monarch  some even advocated rejoining Spain   further complicated matters  This third faction would rise to predominance in the period of the French intervention in Mexico  The ease of the American landing at Vera Cruz was in large part due to civil warfare in Mexico City  which made any real defense of the port city impossible  As Gen  Santa Anna said   However shameful it may be to admit this  we have brought this disgraceful tragedy upon ourselves through our interminable in fighting   Saint Patrick s Battalion  San Patricios  was a group of several hundred immigrant soldiers  the majority Irish  who deserted the U S  Army because of ill treatment or sympathetic leanings to fellow Mexican Catholics  They joined the Mexican army  Most were killed in the Battle of Churubusco  about 100 were captured by the U S  and roughly   were hanged as deserters  The leader  Jon Riley  was merely branded since he had deserted prior to the start of the war   edit  Impact of the war in the U S   An Available Candidate  The One Qualification for a Whig President   Political cartoon about the 1848 presidential election which refers to Zachary Taylor or Winfield Scott  the two leading contenders for the Whig Party nomination in the aftermath of the Mexican American War  Published by Nathaniel Currier in 1848  digitally restored  Despite initial objections from the Whigs and abolitionists  the war would nevertheless unite the U S  in a common cause and was fought almost entirely by volunteers  The army swelled from just over 6 000 to more than 115 000  Of these  approximately 1 5  were killed in the fighting and nearly 10  died of disease  another 12  were wounded or discharged because of disease  or both  For years afterward  veterans continued to suffer from the debilitating diseases contracted during the campaigns  The casualty rate was thus easily over 25  for the 17 months of the war  the total casualties may have reached 35 40  if later injury  and disease related deaths are added  citation needed  In this respect  the war was proportionately the most deadly in American military history  During the war  political quarrels in the U S  arose regarding the disposition of conquered Mexico  A brief  All Mexico  movement urged annexation of the entire territory  Veterans of the war who had seen Mexico at first hand were unenthusiastic  Anti slavery elements opposed that position and fought for the exclusion of slavery from any territory absorbed by the U S  74  In 1847 the House of Representatives passed the Wilmot Proviso  stipulating that none of the territory acquired should be open to slavery  The Senate avoided the issue  and a late attempt to add it to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was defeated  The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was the result of Nicholas Trist s unauthorized negotiations  It was approved by the U S  Senate on March 10  1848  and ratified by the Mexican Congress on May 25  Mexico s cession of Alta California and Nuevo M xico and its recognition of U S  sovereignty over all of Texas north of the Rio Grande formalized the addition of 1 2 million square miles  3 1 million km2  of territory to the United States  In return the U S  agreed to pay  15 million and assumed the claims of its citizens against Mexico  A final territorial adjustment between Mexico and the U S  was made by the Gadsden Purchase in 1853  As late as 1880  the  Republican Campaign Textbook  by the Republican Congressional Committee 75  described the war as  Feculent  reeking Corruption  and  one of the darkest scenes in our history a war forced upon our and the Mexican people by the high handed usurpations of Pres t Polk in pursuit of territorial aggrandizement of the slave oligarchy   The war was one of the most decisive events for the U S  in the first half of the 19th century  While it marked a significant waypoint for the nation as a growing military power  it also served as a milestone especially within the U S  narrative of Manifest Destiny  The resultant territorial gains set in motion many of the defining trends in American 19th century history  particularly for the American West  The war did not resolve the issue of slavery in the U S  but rather in many ways inflamed it  as potential westward expansion of the institution took an increasingly central and heated theme in national debates preceding the American Civil War  Furthermore  in doing much to extend the nation from coast to coast  the Mexican American War was one step in the massive migrations to the West of Americans  which culminated in transcontinental railroads and the Indian wars later in the same century   edit  See also Battles of the Mexican American War Christopher Werner  maker of the  Iron Palmetto  commemorating the loss of South
