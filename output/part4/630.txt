payments while cable  direct broadcast satellite  and IPTV require a monthly payment that varies depending on how many channels a subscriber chooses to pay for  Channels are usually sold in groups  rather than singly   edit  Broadcast television The United States has a decentralized  market oriented television system  The United States has a national public broadcast service known as the Public Broadcasting Service  PBS   Local media markets have their own television stations  which may be affiliated with or owned and operated by a TV network  Stations may sign affiliation agreements with one of the national networks  Except in very small markets with few stations  affiliation agreements are usually exclusive  If a station is an NBC affiliate  the station would not air programs from ABC  CBS or other networks  However  to ensure local presences in television broadcasting  federal law restricts the amount of network programming local stations can run  Until the 1970s and  80s  local stations supplemented network programming with a good deal of their own produced shows  Today  however  many stations produce only local news shows  They fill the rest of their schedule with syndicated shows  or material produced independently and sold to individual stations in each local market    edit  Major broadcast networks See also  Big Three television networks  Fourth television network  and Dayparting The five major U S  networks are NBC  CBS  ABC  Fox  and The CW  The first three began as radio networks  NBC and CBS in the 1920s  and ABC was spun off from NBC in 1943  Fox is a relative newcomer that began in 1986  although it is built upon the remnants of the former DuMont Television Network  which was an earlier  fourth network  that operated from 1948 to 1956  The CW was created in 2006 when UPN merged with The WB  Weekday schedules on ABC  CBS and NBC affiliates tend to be similar  with programming choices sorted by dayparts   Fox does not air network programming outside of prime time   Typically  they begin with an early morning local news show  followed by a network morning show  such as NBC s Today  which mixes news  weather  interviews and music  Network daytime schedules consist of talk shows and soap operas  with one network  CBS  still carrying game shows and a handful of other games airing in syndication  local news may air at midday  Syndicated talk shows appear in the late afternoon  followed by local news again in the early evening  ABC  CBS and NBC offer network news  generally at 6 30 or 7 00 in the Eastern Time zone and 5 30 or 6 00 in other areas  Local newscasts or syndicated programs fill the  prime access  hour or half hour  and lead into the networks  prime time schedules  which are the day s most watched three hours of television  Typically  family oriented comedy programs led in the early part of prime time  although in recent years  reality television like Dancing with the Stars has largely replaced them  Later in the evening  dramas like CSI  Crime Scene Investigation  House  M D   and Grey s Anatomy air  At the end of prime time  another local news program comes on  usually followed by late night interview shows  such as Late Show with David Letterman or The Tonight Show  Rather than sign off for the early hours of the morning  as was standard practice until the early 1970s in larger markets and until the mid 1980 s in smaller ones   TV stations now fill the time with syndicated programming  reruns of prime time television shows or the local late news o clock news  or 30 minute advertisements  known as infomercials  and in the case of CBS and ABC  overnight network news programs  Saturday mornings usually feature network programming aimed at children  including animated cartoons   while Sunday mornings include public affairs programs  Both of these help fulfill stations  legal obligations  to provide educational children s programs and public service programming respectively  Sports and infomercials can be found on weekend afternoons  followed again by the same type of prime time shows aired during the week   edit  Other over the air commercial television This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  From 1955 until 1986  all English language stations not affiliated with the big three networks were independent  airing only locally produced and syndicated programming  Many independent stations still exist in the U S   usually historically broadcasting on the UHF band  Syndicated shows  often reruns of old TV series and old movies  take up much of their schedule  In 1986  however  the Fox Broadcasting Company launched a challenge to the big three networks  Thanks largely to the success of shows like The Simpsons  as well as the network s acquisition of rights to show National Football League games  Fox has established itself as a major player in broadcast television  However  Fox differs from the three older networks in that it does not air daily morning and nightly news programs or have network run daytime or weeknight late night schedules  though late night shows do air on Saturday nights   its nightly prime time schedule is only two hours long  three hours on Sundays   some of its big city affiliates used to broadcast on UHF before the transition to digital  many of its smaller market affiliates outsource news production to Big Three affiliates rather produce their own newscasts  and its flagship stations are WNYW and KTTV  Its only scheduled news program is Fox News Sunday  on Sunday mornings  special news coverage on Fox comes from the staff of cable s Fox News Channel  though not all affiliates carry breaking news bulletins from Fox News outside of primetime presidential addresses  Most Fox affiliates now have local newscasts  in primetime usually airing an hour earlier competing with network dramas  rather than other local newscasts  and in the morning for two additional hours  In the 1990s  three new networks    The WB  1995   UPN  1995  and PAX  1998  became  i  in 2005 and ION in 2007     launched  The fledging WB and UPN merged into The CW in fall 2006  while News Corporation s MyNetworkTV  created to replace UPN programming on Fox s O amp Os  debuted in fall 2006 as well  ION broadcasts 24 hours a day  7 days a week  making the ION network totally responsible for its affiliates  although it mostly airs infomercials outside its prime time  MyNetworkTV broadcasts 10 hours a week  Monday through Saturday  The CW broadcasts 10 hours a week in prime time  10 hours in daytime   edit  Broadcast television in non English languages Univision  a network of Spanish language stations  is the fifth largest TV network behind NBC  CBS  ABC and Fox  Its major competition is Telemundo  a sister network of NBC  Univision owned TeleFutura  aimed at a younger Hispanic demographic  and Azteca Am rica  the American version of Mexico s TV Azteca  are two other popular Spanish language over the air networks  French programming is generally limited in scope  with some locally produced French and creole programming available in the Miami area  serving refugees from Haiti  and Louisiana  along with some places along the heavily populated Eastern Seaboard  French speaking areas near the eastern portion of the Canada United States border generally receive their television broadcasts from French Canadian channels  which are widely available over the air and on cable in those areas  Especially after the transition to digital television  many large cities have Asian language broadcast stations  such as KYAZ in Houston  There have also been a few  local stations in American Sign Language accompanied by closed captioned English  Prior to the development of closed captioning  it was not uncommon to see some public television broadcasts translated into ASL by an on screen interpreter   edit  Non commercial television Public television has a far smaller role than in most other countries  There is no federal state owned broadcasting authority  However  a number of states  including Wisconsin  Maryland  Minnesota  and South Carolina  among others  do have state owned public broadcasting authorities which operate and fund all public television stations in their respective states  The federal government does subsidize non commercial educational television stations through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting  The income received from the government is insufficient to cover expenses and stations rely on corporate sponsorships and viewer contributions  American public television stations air programming that commercial stations do not offer  such as educational  including cultural  and public affairs programming  Most public TV stations are affiliates of the Public Broadcasting Service  sharing programs like Sesame Street and Masterpiece Theatre  Unlike the commercial networks  PBS does not produce its own programming  instead  individual PBS stations create programming and provide these to other affiliates  New York City s municipally owned broadcast service  NYCTV  creates original programming that airs in several markets  Few cities have major municipally owned stations  Many religious broadcasting stations exist  also surviving on viewer contributions  including Trinity Broadcasting Network  Three Angels Broadcasting Network  Hope Channel  Amazing Facts Television  Daystar Television Network  The Word Network  The Worship Network  Total Christian Television  and INSP   edit  Cable and satellite television While pay television systems existed as early as the late 1940s  until the early 1970s cable television only brought distant over the air TV to rural areas without local stations  This role was reflected in the original meaning of the CATV acronym  community antenna TV  In that decade  national networks dedicated exclusively to cable broadcasting appeared along with cable TV systems in major cities with over the air TV  By the mid 1970 s some form of cable TV was available in almost every market that already had over the air TV  Today  most American households receive cable TV  and cable networks collectively have greater viewership than broadcast networks  Unlike broadcast networks  most cable networks air the same programming nationwide  Top cable networks include USA Network  general entertainment   ESPN and Fox Sports  sports   MTV  music   CNN  Fox News  and MSNBC  news   Syfy  science fiction   Disney Channel  family   Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network  Children s   Discovery Channel and Animal Planet  documentaries   TBS  comedy   TNT  drama  and Lifetime  women s   The national cable TV network became possible in the mid 1970s with the launch of domestic communication satellites that could economically broadcast TV programs to cable operators anywhere in the continental US   Some domestic satellites also covered Alaska and Hawaii with dedicated spot beams   Until then  cable networks like HBO had been limited to regional coverage by expensive terrestrial microwave links leased from the telephone companies  primarily AT amp T   Satellites were generally used only for international  i e   transoceanic  communications  their antennas covered an entire hemisphere  producing weak signals that required large  expensive receiving antennas  The first domestic communications satellite  Westar 1  was launched in 1974  By concentrating its signal on the continental United States with a directional antenna  Westar 1 could transmit to TVRO   TV  receive only   dishes only a few meters in diameter  well within the means of local cable TV operators  Satellite TV receiver dishes Cable system operators now receive programming by satellite  terrestrial optical fiber  off the air  and from in house sources and relay it to subscribers  homes  Usually  local governments award a monopoly to provide cable TV service in a given area  By law  cable systems must include local over the air stations in their offerings to customers  Enterprising individuals soon found they could install their own satellite dishes and eavesdrop on the feeds to the cable operators  The signals were transmitted as unscrambled analog FM that did not require advanced or expensive technology  Since these same satellites were also used internally by the TV networks they could also watch programs not intended for public broadcast such as affiliate feeds without commercials and or intended for another time zone  raw footage from remote news teams  advance transmissions of upcoming programs  and live news and talk shows during breaks when those on camera might not realize that anyone outside the network could hear them  Encrypting was introduced to prevent people from receiving pay content for free  and nearly every pay channel was encrypted by the mid to late 1980s   This did not happen without protest  see Captain Midnight  HBO    Satellite TV also began a digital transition  well before over the air broadcasting did the same  to increase satellite capacity and or reduce the size of the receiving antennas  and this also made it more difficult for individuals to intercept these signals  Eventually the industry began to cater to individuals who wanted to continue to receive satellite TV  and were willing to pay for it  in two ways  by authorizing the descrambling of the original satellite feeds to the cable TV operators and with new direct broadcast satellite television services using their own satellites  These latter services  which began in the mid 1990s  offer programming similar to cable TV  Dish Network and DirecTV are the major DBS providers in the country  Although most networks make viewers pay  some networks are broadcasting unencrypted feeds  After broadcast TV switched to all digital  new channels became available on unencrypted satellites to bring more free TV to Americans some of these are available as a digital subchannel to local broadcasters  this reason may be for the expensive costs of the DVB S equipment  NASA TV  Pentagon Channel  ABC News Now  ThisTV  TheCoolTV  and Retro Television Network  through its affiliates  are examples  international news channels like Al Jazeera English are commonly watched this way as a result to the lack of availability on Cable  DBS and IPTV   edit  The business of television Over the air commercial stations and networks generate the vast majority of their revenue from advertisements  According to a 2001 survey  broadcast stations allocated 16 to 21 minutes per hour to commercials  Most cable networks also generate income from advertisements  although most basic cable networks also receive subscription fees  However  premium cable networks  such as the movie network HBO  do not air commercials  Instead  cable TV subscribers must pay extra to receive the premium networks  In the days of broadcast television  networks allocated a portion of commercial time for their shows to the local affiliates  which allowed the local stations to generate revenue  In the same manner  cable TV system operators generate some of their revenue by selling local commercial time for each cable network being broadcast  The other main source of revenue for the cable TV operators is subscription fees   edit  Programming American television has had very successful programming that has inspired television networks across the world to make shows of similar types or broadcast these shows in their own country  Some of these shows are still on the air and some are still alive and well in syndication  The opposite is also true  a number of popular American programs were based on shows from other countries  especially the United Kingdom and Canada  Primetime comedy has included situation comedies such as I Love Lucy  M A S H  All in the Family  The Mary Tyler Moore Show  The Jeffersons  The Cosby Show  Seinfeld  Friends  Boy Meets World  George Lopez  The King of Queens and Everybody Loves Raymond  as well as sketch comedy variety series such as Saturday Night Live and Milton Berle s early shows  The Carol Burnett Show and Rowan and Martin s Laugh In  Dramatic series have taken many forms over the years  Westerns such as Gunsmoke had their greatest popularity in the  50s and  60s  Medical dramas have endured  Marcus Welby  M D   St  Elsewhere  ER   as have family dramas  Eight is Enough  The Waltons  Little House on the Prairie  and crime dramas  Dragnet  Hawaii Five O  Hill Street Blues  Law  amp  Order and CSI  Crime Scene Investigation   the last two of which have spawned multiple spin offs   The major networks all offer a morning news program  NBC s The Today Show and ABC s Good Morning America are the standard bearers   as well as an early evening newscast anchored by the de facto face of the network s news operations  Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather for CBS  NBC s Chet Huntley  David Brinkley and Tom Brokaw  ABC s Peter Jennings   Successful news magazines have included 60 Minutes  20 20  and Dateline in primetime and Meet the Press  the US s oldest series  having debuted in 1947   Face the Nation and This Week on Sunday mornings  Reality television has long existed in the United States  both played for laughs  Candid Camera  Real People  and as drama  COPS  The Real World   A new variant   competition series placing ordinary people in unusual circumstances or in talent contests  generally eliminating one participant per week  exploded in popularity in 2000 with the launch of Survivor  Big Brother  America s Next Top Model and So You Think You Can Dance followed  American Idol  based on the UK s Pop Idol  debuted in 2002 and has dominated the ratings consistently as of 2009  while The Amazing Race has won the Emmy for its program category every year since its 2001 debut  American soap operas have been running for over six decades  Of the six current daytime soaps  four have been on the air for over forty years  General Hospital  Days of our Lives  One Life to Live and All My Children  Previous long running daytime dramas included Search for Tomorrow  Love of Life  The Doctors  Another World  As The World Turns  and Guiding Light   the latter of which ended a 72 year run  combining TV and radio  in September 2009  Primetime soap operas of note have included Peyton Place  Dallas  Dynasty  Beverly Hills  90210 and Desperate Housewives  On Wheel of Fortune  three people compete against each other to win cash and physical prizes such as trips  Daytime has also been home of many popular game shows over the years  particularly during the 1970s   such as The Price is Right  Family Feud  Match Game  The Newlywed Game and Concentration  Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy  have found their greatest success in the early evening slot before primetime  while game shows actually aired within primetime had great popularity in the 1950s and 1960s  What s My Line   I ve Got a Secret  To Tell the Truth  and again  intermittently  in the 2000s  Who Wants to Be a Millionaire  The Weakest Link  Deal or No Deal   The Price Is Right  which has appeared on CBS since 1972  was the only daytime game show remaining on the broadcast networks for fifteen years  prior to CBS s announcement it would be joined by a remake of Let s Make a Deal in October 2009   The most successful talk show has been the late night  after 11 30 PM Eastern Pacific  The Tonight Show  particularly during the 29 year run of third host Johnny Carson   Tonight ushered in a multi decade period of dominance by one network in American late night programming and paved the way for many similar combinations of comedy and celebrity interviews  such as those hosted by Merv Griffin and David Letterman  Daytime talk show hits have included The Oprah Winfrey Show  Phil Donahue  The Ellen DeGeneres Show  and Live with Regis and Kelly  and run the gamut from serious to lighthearted  a subset of so called trash TV talk shows such as The Jerry Springer Show also veered into exploitation and titillation  Children s television programs are also quite popular  though with FCC rules on E I content and regulations on commercial time during children s shows  over the air broadcast stations have found it much harder to profit from these programs compared to in the past  Children s programming has mostly migrated to cable television with such successful shows of recent such as Fanboy  amp  Chum Chum  SpongeBob SquarePants  iCarly  The Suite Life on Deck  Big Time Rush  Victorious  Phineas  amp  Ferb  The Fairly OddParents among others becoming popular on the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon cable channels  Other channels offering kids and family programming include PBS Kids Sprout  Disney XD  Cartoon Network  Boomerang and others  FCC rules on E I content may prevent series airing on these channels from being syndicated on over the air television stations  While the majority of programs broadcast on United States television are produced domestically  some programs carried in syndication  on public television or on cable television are imported from outside the U S   most commonly  these imported programs come from the primarily English speaking countries of Canada and the United Kingdom  PBS in particular  is commonly known for its broadcasts of British comedies such as Are You Being Served   Keeping Up Appearances and As Time Goes By  which typically air on most PBS member stations on weekend evenings  As for Canadian programs  most of the programming imported from Canada includes children s programs from family oriented specialty channels YTV and Family such as Are You Afraid of the Dark   Naturally  Sadie and Life with Derek  Among some of the more well known Canadian television series among American viewers include the Degrassi High franchise  which aired in Canada on CBC Television  with the later incarnation Degrassi  The Next Generation airing on CTV and presently MuchMusic   SCTV Network and The Red Green Show  American Spanish language networks also import much of their programming  for example  Univision imports much of its programming  especially telenovelas that are broadcast on the network  from Mexican broadcaster Televisa and Venezuelan broadcaster Venevision   edit  The life cycle of U S  television shows Television production companies either commission teleplays for TV pilots or buy spec scripts  Some of these scripts are turned into pilots  Those which the production company thinks might be commercially viable are then marketed to television networks or television distributors for first run syndication   KingWorld distributes The Oprah Winfrey Show in first run syndication  for example  because that show is syndicated is not affiliated with a particular network   A few things in consideration for a TV network to pick up a show is if the show itself is compatible with the network s target audience  the cost of production  and if the show is well liked among network executives  Networks sometimes preemptively purchase pilots to prevent other nets from controlling them  and the purchase of a pilot is no guarantee that a show will get an order for more episodes  Those that do get  picked up  get either a full or partial season order  and the show goes into production  usually establishing itself with permanent sets  a full crew and production offices  Writers are hired  directors are selected and work begins  usually during the late spring and summer before the fall season series premieres   Shows can also be midseason replacement  meaning they are ordered specifically to fill holes in a network schedule created by the failure and cancellation of shows which premiered in the fall  Buffy the Vampire Slayer and The Office are examples of successful midseason replacements   The standard broadcast television season in the United States is 22 episodes per season  sitcoms may have 24 or more  animated programs may have more  or fewer  episodes  cable networks with original programming seem to have settled on about 10 or 12 episodes per season  much in line with British television programming  American soap operas air in the afternoon  five days a week  without any significant break in taping and airing schedules throughout the year  This means that these serials air approximately 260 episodes a year  making their casts and crews the busiest in show business  These shows are rarely  if ever  repeated  making it difficult for viewers to  catch up  when they miss programming  However  cable channel SOAPnet provides weekly repeats for some broadcasts  Networks use profits from commercials run during the show to pay the production company  which in turn pays the cast and crew  and keeps a share of the profits for itself   Networks sometimes act as both production companies and distributors   As advertising rates are based on the size of the audience  measuring the number of people watching a network is very important  This measurement is known as a show or network s ratings  Sweeps months  November  February  May  and to a lesser extent July  are important landmarks in the television year   ratings earned during these periods determining advertising rates until the next sweeps period  therefore shows often have their most exciting plot developments happen during sweeps  Shows that are successful with audiences and advertisers receive authorization from the network to continue production  until the plotline ends  only for scripted shows  or if the contract expires  Those that are not successful are often quickly told to discontinue production by the network  known as cancellation  There are instances of initially low rated shows surviving cancellation and later becoming highly popular  but these are rare  For the most part  shows that are not immediately or even moderately successful will be cancelled by the end of November sweeps  Usually if a show is canceled  there is little chance of it ever coming back again especially on the same network it was canceled from  the only show in the US to ever come back from cancellation on the same network is Family Guy  However  canceled shows like Scrubs  Southland  and Medium have been picked up by other networks  which is becoming an increasingly common practice  Once a television series reaches a threshold of approximately 88 to 100 episodes  it becomes a candidate to enter reruns in off network syndication  Reruns are a lucrative business for television producers  who can sell the rights to a  used  series without the expenses of producing it  although royalties may need to be paid to the affected parties  depending on union contracts   Sitcoms are traditionally the most widely syndicated reruns and are usually aired in a five day a week strip  Marginally performing shows tend to last less than five years in broadcast syndication  sometimes moving to cable channels after the end of their syndication runs  while more widely successful series can have a life in syndication that can run for decades  I Love Lucy  the first series designed to be rerun  remains popular in syndication sixty years after its debut   Cable networks and digital broadcast channels have provided outlets for programming that either has outlived its syndication viability  lacks the number of episodes necessary for syndication  or for various reasons was not a candidate for syndication in the first place  Popular dramas  for instance  have permanent homes on several basic cable channels  often running in marathons  multiple episodes airing back to back for several hours   and there are also cable channels devoted to game shows  Game Show Network   soap operas  the soon to be defunct SoapNet   Saturday morning cartoons  e g  Boomerang  and even sports broadcasts  ESPN Classic   Most reality shows perform poorly in reruns and are rarely seen as a result  other than reruns of series still in production  on the same network on which they air  almost always cable outlets   where they air as filler programming   edit  Regulation Broadcast television is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission  The FCC awards licenses to local stations  which stipulate stations  commitments to educational and public interest programming  The FCC also prohibits the airing of  indecent  material over the air between 6 a m  and 10 p m  Although broadcast stations can legally air almost anything they want late at night and cable networks at all hours nudity and graphic profanity are very rare on American television  though they are common on pay television services that are free from FCC regulations and pressure from advertisers to tone down content  and often require a subscription to view  Broadcasters fear that airing such material will turn off advertisers and encourage the federal government to strengthen its regulation of television content  Premium cable networks are exceptions  and often air very racy programming at night  though premium channels often air program content with strong to graphic profanity  violence and nudity in some cases during the daytime hours  Some networks  such as Playboy TV  are devoted exclusively to  adult  content and therefore viewers may find scenes of simulated or graphic sexual intercourse and nudity on such channels  Cable television is largely  but not entirely  unregulated  Cable systems must include local over the air stations in their offerings  see must carry  and give them low channel numbers  The systems cannot show broadcast network affiliates from other parts of the country  however cable systems can air stations out of nearby markets if there are no stations affiliated with one of the major networks  though this is becoming far less common with the existence of over the air stations carrying one network affiliation on the main channel  and affiliating with another network on a digital subchannel  thus allowing these network affiliated digital subchannels to be carried via digital cable   Cable systems can also air satellite relayed over the air stations originating from other areas of the United States  known as superstations  of which there are currently only six around the country  the most prominent being WGN America  which airs some programming carried by WGN TV in Chicago   which for the most part are often aired in rural areas and if carried nationally  may have a separate feed carrying different programming than that of the local area feed that is SyndEx proof  i e   syndicated programming that the superstation has obtained full signal rights to  and may omit network programming from that station s network affiliation  all superstations  except for WSBK TV in Boston  are currently affiliated with a broadcast television network as WGN TV  WPIX in New York City  KWGN in Denver and KTLA in Los Angeles all being affiliated with The CW and WWOR TV in Secaucus  New Jersey affiliated with MyNetworkTV   edit  History of American television Main articles  History of television and List of United States network television schedules Television first became commercialized in the U S  in the early 1950s  initially by RCA  through NBC  which it owned  and CBS  A number of different broadcast systems had been developed through the end of the 1930s  The National Television System Committee  NTSC  standardized on a 525 line broadcast in 1941 that would provide the basis for TV across the country through the end of the century  Television development halted with the onset of World War II  but pioneers returned to the airwaves when that conflict ended  After a flood of television license applications  the FCC froze the application process for new here were only a few dozen stations operating at the end of the decade  concentrated on the East and West coasts  The FCC began handing out broadcasting licenses to communities of all sizes in the early 1950s  spurring an explosion of growth in the medium  A brief debacle over the system to use for color broadcasts occurred at this time  but was soon settled  Half of all U S  households had TV sets by 1955  though color was a premium feature for many years  most households able to purchase TV sets could only afford black and white models  and few programs were broadcast in color until the mid 1960s   Many of the earliest TV programs were modified versions of well established radio shows  Barn dances and opries were regular staples of early television  as were the first variety shows  The  50s saw the first flowering of the genres that would distinguish TV from movies and radio  talk shows like The Jack Paar Show and sitcoms like I Love Lucy  Other popular genera in early television were TV Westerns and soap operas  both of which were adapted from the radio medium  Game shows were also a major part of the early part of television  aided by massive prizes unheard of in the radio era  however  the pressure to keep the programs entertaining led to the quiz show scandals in which it was revealed many of the popular high stakes games were rigged or outright scripted  Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s  concurrent with the development of color television  the evolution of television led to an event colloquially known as the rural purge  genera such as the Western  variety show  barn dance  and rural oriented sitcom all met their demise in favor of newer  more modern series targeted at wealthier suburban and urban viewers  Around the same time  videotape became a more affordable alternative to film for recording programs  which practically ended the practice of destroying and recycling old television episodes and led to more extensive archiving of television programming  Stations across the country also produced their own local programs  Usually carried live  they ranged from simple advertisements to game shows and children s shows that often featured clowns and other offbeat characters  Local shows could often be popular and profitable  but concerns about product promotion led them to almost completely disappear by the mid 1970s  The last remaining locally originated shows on American television as of 2012 are local newscasts and some brokered programming paid for by advertisers  Subscription television  such as cable and satellite  became popular in the early 1980s  and has been growing in significance since then spurring the emergence of multinational conglomerates such as Fox  As the number of outlets for potential new television channels increased  this also introduced the threat of audience fracturing  in that it would become much more difficult to attain a critical mass of viewers in this highly competitive market  As ratings declined  the number of game shows and soap operas followed  with the former genre almost completely disappearing from American daytime television  to be replaced by much cheaper and more lowbrow tabloid talk shows  Infomercials were legalized in 1984  approximately the same time that cable television became widespread  Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s  stations began airing infomercials throughout the night instead of signing off  infomercials also began to overtake other less watched dayparts  such as weekends and during the daytime   which forced series that would otherwise be syndicated onto cable networks or off the air entirely  Cable networks have also begun selling infomercial space  usually in multiple hour blocks in the early morning hours  Infomercials have earned a reputation as a medium for advertising scams and products of dubious quality  The U S  has now moved to digital television  U S  networks began transitioning to recording their programs in high definition television in the late 1990s  a process that is now mostly complete  A law passed in 2006 required over the air stations to cease analog broadcasting in 2009  with the end of analog television arriving on June 12 of that year  The late 1990s also saw the invention of digital video recorders  While the ability to record a television program for home viewing was possible with the earlier VCRs  that medium was a bulky mechanical tape medium that was far less convenient than the all digital technology DVRs used  DVR technology allowed wide scale time shifting of programming  which had a negative impact on programming in time slots outside of prime time by allowing viewers to watch their favorite programs on demand  It also put pressure on advertisers  since DVRs make it relatively easy to skip over commercials  During the 2000s  the major development in U S  television was the growth of reality television  which proved to be an inexpensive and entertaining alternative to scripted prime time programming  The process of nonlinear video editing and digital recording allowed for much easier and less expensive editing of mass amounts of video  making reality television more viable than it had been in previous decades  All four major broadcast networks carry at least one long running reality
