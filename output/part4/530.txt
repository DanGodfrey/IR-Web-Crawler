Rights Movement in the United States was a long  primarily nonviolent struggle to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans  The movement has had a lasting impact on United States society  in its tactics  the increased social and legal acceptance of civil rights  and in its exposure of the prevalence and cost of racism  The American Civil Rights movement has been made up of many movements  The term usually refers to the political struggles and reform movements between 1945 and 1970 to end discrimination against African Americans and other disadvantaged groups and to end legal racial segregation  especially in the U S  South  This article focuses on an earlier phase of the struggle  Two United States Supreme Court decisions Plessy v  Ferguson  163 U S  537  1896   which upheld  separate but equal  racial segregation as constitutional doctrine  and Brown v  Board of Education  347 U S  483  1954  which overturned Plessy   serve as milestones  This was an era of stops and starts  in which some movements  such as Marcus Garvey s Universal Negro Improvement Association  were very successful but left little lasting legacy  while others  such as the NAACP s painstaking legal assault on state sponsored segregation  achieved modest results in its early years but made steady progress on voter rights and gradually built to a key victory in Brown v  Board of Education  1954   After the Civil War  the U  S  expanded the legal rights of African Americans  Congress passed  and enough states ratified  an amendment ending slavery in 1865 the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution  This amendment only outlawed slavery  it provided neither citizenship nor equal rights  In 1868  the 14th Amendment was ratified by the states  granting African Americans citizenship  All persons born in the U  S  were extended equal protection under the laws of the Constitution  The 15th Amendment  ratified in 1870  stated that race could not be used as a condition to deprive men of the ability to vote  During Reconstruction  1865 1877   Northern troops occupied the South  Together with the Freedmen s Bureau  they tried to administer and enforce the new constitutional amendments  Many black leaders were elected to local and state offices  and many others organized community groups  especially to support education  Reconstruction ended following the Compromise of 1877 between Northern and Southern white elites  1  In exchange for deciding the contentious Presidential election in favor of Rutherford B  Hayes  supported by Northern states  over his opponent  Samuel J  Tilden  the compromise called for the withdrawal of Northern troops from the South  This followed violence and fraud in southern elections from 1868 1876  which had reduced black voter turnout and enabled Southern white Democrats to regain power in state legislatures across the South  The compromise and withdrawal of Federal troops meant that white Democrats had more freedom to impose and enforce discriminatory practices  Many African Americans responded to the withdrawal of federal troops by leaving the South in what is known as the Kansas Exodus of 1879  The Radical Republicans  who spearheaded Reconstruction  had attempted to eliminate both governmental and private discrimination by legislation  That effort was largely ended by the Supreme Court s decision in the Civil Rights Cases  109 U S  3  1883   in which the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not give Congress power to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals or businesses  Contents 1 Key events 2 Segregation 2 1 Paul Robeson addresses segregation in Major League Baseball  1943 2 2 Jackie Robinson s Major League Baseball debut  1947 3 Political opposition 3 1

Civil Rights Movement  edit  Segregation The Supreme Court s decision in Plessy v  Ferguson  1896  upheld state mandated discrimination in public transportation under the  separate but equal  doctrine  As Justice Harlan  the only member of the Court to dissent from the decision  predicted  If a state can prescribe  as a rule of civil conduct  that whites and blacks shall not travel as passengers in the same railroad coach  why may it not so regulate the use of the streets of its cities and towns as to compel white citizens to keep on one side of a street  and black citizens to keep on the other  Why may it not  upon like grounds  punish whites and blacks who ride together in street cars or in open vehicles on a public road or street          The Plessy decision did not address an earlier Supreme Court case  Yick Wo v  Hopkins  118 U S  356  1886   2  involving discrimination against Chinese immigrants  that held that a law that is race neutral on its face  but is administered in a prejudicial manner  is an infringement of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U S  Constitution  While in the 20th century  the Supreme Court began to overturn state statutes that disfranchised African Americans  as in Guinn v  United States  1915   with Plessy  it upheld segregation that Southern states enforced in nearly every other sphere of public and private life  The Court soon extended Plessy to uphold segregated schools  In Berea College v  Kentucky  211 U S  45  1908   the Court upheld a Kentucky statute that barred Berea College  a private institution  from teaching both black and white students in an integrated setting  Many states  particularly in the South  took Plessy and Berea as blanket approval for restrictive laws  generally known as Jim Crow laws  that created second class status for African Americans  In many cities and towns  African Americans were not allowed to share a taxi with whites or enter a building through the same entrance  They had to drink from separate water fountains  use separate restrooms  attend separate schools  be buried in separate cemeteries and swear on separate Bibles  They were excluded from restaurants and public libraries  Many parks barred them with signs that read  Negroes and dogs not allowed   One municipal zoo listed separate visiting hours  The etiquette of racial segregation was harsher  particularly in the South  African Americans were expected to step aside to let a white person pass  and black men dared not look any white woman in the eye  Black men and women were addressed as  Tom  or  Jane   but rarely as  Mr   or  Miss  or  Mrs   titles then widely in use for adults  Whites referred to black men of any age as  boy  and a black woman as  girl   both often were called by labels such as  nigger  or  colored   Less formal social segregation in the North began to yield to change  In 1941  however  the United States Naval Academy  based in segregated Maryland  refused to play a lacrosse game against Harvard University because Harvard s team included a black player   edit  Paul Robeson addresses segregation in Major League Baseball  1943 In December 1943  the singer and activist Paul Robeson became the first black man to address baseball team owners on the subject of integration  At the owners  annual winter meeting  Robeson argued that baseball  as a national game  had an obligation to ensure segregation did not become a national pattern  The owners gave Robeson a round of applause  3  Although Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis remarked after the meeting that there was no rule on the books denying blacks entry into the league  he had stood in way of integration for more than 20 years  His death in 1944 removed a significant obstacle to integrating Major League Baseball  4  Still  Robeson is credited with helping to pave the way for Jackie Robinson s entry into major league baseball four years later  5   edit  Jackie Robinson s Major League Baseball debut  1947 Jackie Robinson was a sports pioneer of the Civil Rights Movement  best known for becoming the first African American to play professional sports in the major leagues  Robinson debuted with the Brooklyn Dodgers of Major League Baseball on April 15  1947  His first major league game came one year before the U S  Army was integrated  seven years before Brown v  Board of Education  eight years before Rosa Parks  and before Martin Luther King Jr  was leading the Civil Rights Movement   edit  Political opposition  edit  Lily White Movement Main article  Lily White Movement Following the Civil War black leaders made substantial progress in establishing representation in the Republican Party  Among the most stunning was the rise of Norris Wright Cuney to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party  These gains led to substantial discomfort among many white voters  some of whom left the party to join the Democrats  During the 1888 Texas Republican Convention  Cuney coined the term Lily White Movement to describe efforts by white conservatives to oust blacks from positions of party leadership and incite riots to divide the party  6  Increasingly organized efforts by this movement gradually eliminated black leaders from the party  The writer Michael Fauntroy contends that the effort was coordinated with Democrats as part of a larger movement toward disfranchisement of blacks in the South  7  but by the late 19th century  the Democratic Party had retaken most state legislatures in the South and accomplished disfranchisement of blacks without Republican assistance  Nationally  the Republican Party responded to black demands  For instance  opposition to lynching was part of the Republican platform at the 1920 Republican National Convention  Lynchings  primarily of black men in the South  had increased in the decades around the turn of the 19th to 20th century  Leonidas C  Dyer  a white Republican Representative from St  Louis  Missouri  worked with the NAACP to introduce an anti lynching bill into the House  where he gained strong passage in 1922  His effort was defeated by the Southern Democratic block in the Senate  which filibustered the bill that year  and in 1923 and 1924   edit  Disfranchisement Main article  Disfranchisement after the Civil War Opponents of black civil rights used economic reprisals and sometimes violence in the 1870s and 1880s to discourage blacks from registering to vote  By the turn of the 19th to 20th century  white Democratic dominated Southern legislatures disfranchised nearly all age eligible African American voters through a combination of statute and constitutional provisions  While requirements applied to all citizens  in practice  they were targeted at blacks and poor whites  and Mexican Americans in Texas   and subjectively administered  The feature  Turnout in Presidential and Midterm Elections  at this University of Texas website devoted to politics  shows the drastic drop in voting as these provisions took effect in Southern states compared to the rest of the US  and the longevity of the measures  8  Mississippi was the first state to have such constitutional provisions  such as poll taxes  literacy tests  which depended on the arbitrary decisions of white registrars   and complicated record keeping to establish residency  litigated before the Supreme Court  In 1898  in Williams v  Mississippi  the Court upheld the state  Other Southern states quickly adopted the  Mississippi plan   and from 1890 1908  ten states adopted new constitutions with provisions to disfranchise most blacks and many poor whites  States continued to disfranchise these groups for decades  until mid 1960s federal legislation provided for oversight and enforcement of voting rights  Blacks were most adversely affected  and in many states black voter turnout dropped to zero  Poor whites were also disfranchised  In Alabama  for instance  by 1941  600 000 poor whites had been disfranchised  as well as 520 000 blacks  9  It was not until the 20th century that litigation by African Americans on such provisions began to meet some success before the Supreme Court  In 1915 in Guinn v  United States  the Court declared Oklahoma s  grandfather clause  to be unconstitutional  Although the decision affected all states that used the grandfather clause  state legislatures quickly employed new devices to continue disfranchisement  Each provision or statute had to be litigated separately  The NAACP litigated against many such provisions  One device which the Democratic Party began to use more widely in Southern states in the early 20th century was the white primary  which served for decades to disfranchise the few blacks who managed to get past barriers of voter registration  Barring blacks from voting in the Democratic Party primaries meant they had no chance to vote in the only competitive contests  White primaries were not struck down by the Supreme Court until Smith v  Allwright in 1944   edit  Criminal law and lynching Juvenile African American convicts working in the fields in a chain gang  photo taken c  1903 In 1880  the United States Supreme Court ruled in Strauder v  West Virginia  100 U S  303  1880  that African Americans could not be excluded from juries  But  beginning in 1890 with new state constitutions and electoral laws  the South effectively disfranchised blacks in the South  which routinely disqualified them for jury duty which was limited to voters  This left them at the mercy of a white justice system arrayed against them  In some states  particularly Alabama  the state used the criminal justice system to reestablish a form of peonage  through the convict lease system  The state sentenced black males to years of imprisonment  which they spent working without pay  The state leased prisoners to private employers  such as Tennessee Coal  Iron and Railroad Company  a subsidiary of United States Steel Corporation  which paid the state for their labor  Because the state made money  the system created incentives for the jailing of more men  who were disproportionately black  It also created a system in which treatment of prisoners received little oversight  Extrajudicial punishment was more brutal  During the last decade of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century  white vigilante mobs lynched thousands of black males  sometimes with the overt assistance of state officials  mostly within the South  No whites were charged with crimes in any of those murders  Whites were so confident of their immunity from prosecution for lynching that they not only photographed the victims  but made postcards out of the pictures  The Ku Klux Klan  which had largely disappeared after a brief violent career in the early years of Reconstruction  reappeared in 1915  It grew mostly in industrializing cities of the South and Midwest that underwent the most rapid growth from 1910 to 1930  Social instability contributed to racial tensions from severe competition for jobs and housing  People joined KKK groups who were anxious about their place in American society  as cities were rapidly changed by a combination of industrialization  migration of blacks and whites from the rural South  and waves of increased immigration from mostly rural southern and eastern Europe  10  Initially the KKK presented itself as another fraternal organization devoted to betterment of its members  The KKK s revival was inspired in part by the movie Birth of a Nation  which glorified the earlier Klan and dramatized the racist stereotypes concerning blacks of that era  The Klan focused on political mobilization  which allowed it to gain power in states such as Indiana  on a platform that combined racism with anti immigrant  anti Semitic  anti Catholic and anti union rhetoric  but also supported lynching  It reached its peak of membership and influence about 1925  declining rapidly afterward as opponents mobilized  11  Republicans repeatedly introduced bills in the House to make lynching a federal crime  but they were defeated by the Southern block  In 1920 the Republicans made an anti lynching bill part of their platform and achieved passage in the House by a wide margin  Southern Democrats in the Senate repeatedly filibustered the bill to prevent a vote  and defeated it in the 1922  1923 and 1924 sessions as they held the rest of the legislative program hostage   edit  Segregated economic life and education Besides excluding blacks from equal participation in many areas of public life  white society also kept blacks in a position of economic subservience or marginality  After widespread losses from crops from disease and land from financial failures in the late 19th c   black farmers in the South by the early 20th century worked in virtual economic bondage as sharecroppers or tenant farmers  In Mississippi particularly  many blacks had become landowners before the financial failures of the late 19th century  Employers and labor unions generally restricted African Americans to the worst paid and least desirable jobs  Because of the lack of steady  well paid jobs  relatively undistinguished positions  such as those with the Pullman Porter or as hotel doorman  became prestigious positions in black communities in the North  The expansion of railroads meant that they recruited in the South for laborers  and tens of thousands of blacks moved North to work with the Pennsylvania Railroad  for example  during the period of the Great Migration  The Jim Crow system that excluded African Americans from many areas of economic life led to creation of a vigorous  but stunted economic life within the segregated sphere  Black newspapers sprang up throughout the North  while black owners of insurance and funeral establishments  and other services for blacks  acquired disproportionate influence as both economic and political leaders  This period saw the maturing of independent black churches  whose leaders were usually also strong community leaders  Blacks had left white churches and the Southern Baptist Convention to set up their own churches free of white supervision immediately during and after the American Civil War  With the help of northern associations  they quickly began to set up state conventions and  by 1895  joined several associations into the black National Baptist Convention  the first of that denomination among blacks  In addition  independent black denominations  such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church and AME Zion Church  had made hundreds of thousands of converts in the South  founding AME churches across the region  The churches were centers of community activity  especially organizing for education  Continuing to see education as the primary route of advancement and critical for the race  many talented blacks went into teaching  which had high respect as a profession  Segregated schools for blacks were underfunded in the South and ran on shortened schedules in rural areas  Despite segregation  in Washington  DC by contrast  as Federal employees  black and white teachers were paid on the same scale  Outstanding black teachers in the North received advanced degrees and taught in highly regarded schools  which trained the next generation of leaders in cities such as Chicago  Washington  and New York  whose black populations had increased in the 20th century due to the Great Migration  Education was one of the major achievements of the black community in the 19th century  Blacks in Reconstruction governments had supported the establishment of public education in every Southern state  Despite the difficulties  with the enormous eagerness of freedmen for education  by 1900 the African American community had trained and put to work 30 000 African American teachers in the South  In addition  a majority of the black population had achieved literacy  12  Not all the teachers had a full 4 year college degree in those years  but the shorter terms of normal schools were part of the system of teacher training in both the North and the South to serve the many new communities across the frontier  African American teachers got many children and adults started on education  Northern alliances had helped fund normal schools and colleges to teach African American teachers  as well as create other professional classes  The American Missionary Association  supported largely by the Congregational and Presbyterian churches  had helped fund and staff numerous private schools and colleges in the South  who collaborated with black communities to train generations of teachers and other leaders  Major 20th century industrialists  such as George Eastman of Rochester  New York  acted as philanthropists and made substantial donations to black educational institutions such as Tuskegee Institute  In 1862  the US Congress passed the Morrill Act  which established federal funding of a land grant college in each state  but 17 states refused to admit black students to their land grant colleges  In response  Congress enacted the second Morrill Act of 1890  which required states that excluded blacks from their existing land grant colleges to open separate institutions and to equitably divide the funds between the schools  The colleges founded in response to the second Morill Act became today s public historically black colleges and universities  HBCUs  and  together with the private HBCUs and the unsegregated colleges in the North and West  provided higher educational opportunities to African Americans  Federally funded extension agents from the land grant colleges spread knowledge about scientific agriculture and home economics to rural communities with agents from the HBCUs focusing on black farmers and families  In the 19th century  blacks formed fraternal organizations across the South and the North  including an increasing number of women s clubs  They created and supported institutions that increased education  health and welfare for black communities  After the turn of the 19th to 20th century  black men and women also began to found their own college fraternities and sororities to create additional networks for lifelong service and collaboration  13  These were part of the new organizations that strengthened independent community life under segregation   edit  The Black church As the center of community life  Black churches were integral leaders and organizers in the Civil Rights Movement  Their history as a focal point for the Black community and as a link between the Black and White worlds made them natural for this purpose  Rev  Martin Luther King  Jr  was but one of many notable Black ministers involved in the movement  Ralph David Abernathy  Bernard Lee  Fred Shuttlesworth  and C T  Vivian are among the many notable minister activists  14  They were especially important during the later years of the movement in the 1950s and 1960s   edit  The Niagara Movement and the founding of the NAACP At the turn of the 19th to 20th century  Booker T  Washington was regarded  particularly by the white community  as the foremost spokesman for African Americans in the U  S  Washington  who led the Tuskegee Institute  preached a message of self reliance  He urged blacks to concentrate on improving their economic position rather than demanding social equality until they had proved that they  deserved  it  Publicly  he accepted the continuation of Jim Crow and segregation in the short term  but privately helped to fund national court cases that challenged the laws  W  E  B  Du Bois and others in the black community rejected Washington s apology for segregation  One of his close associates  Monroe Trotter  was arrested after challenging Washington when he came to deliver a speech in Boston in 1905  Later that year Du Bois and Trotter convened a meeting of black activists on the Canadian side of the river at Niagara Falls  They issued a manifesto calling for universal manhood suffrage  elimination of all forms of racial segregation and extension of education not limited to the vocational education that Washington emphasized on a nondiscriminatory basis  Du Bois joined with other black leaders and white activists  such as Mary White Ovington  Oswald Garrison Villard  William English Walling  Henry Moskowitz  Julius Rosenthal  Lillian Wald  Rabbi Emil G  Hirsch  and Stephen Wise to create the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  NAACP  in 1909  W  E  B  Du Bois also became editor of its magazine The Crisis  In its early years  the NAACP concentrated on using the courts to attack Jim Crow laws and disfranchising constitutional provisions  It successfully challenged the Louisville  Kentucky ordinance that required residential segregation in Buchanan v  Warley  245 U S  60  1917   It also gained a Supreme Court ruling striking down Oklahoma s  grandfather clause  that exempted most illiterate white voters from a law that disfranchised African American citizens in Guinn v  United States  1915   The NAACP lobbied against President Woodrow Wilson s introduction of racial segregation into Federal government employment and offices in 1913  They lobbied for commissioning of African Americans as officers in World War I  In 1915 the NAACP organized public education and protests in cities across the nation against D W  Griffith s silent film Birth of a Nation  a film that glamorized the Ku Klux Klan  Some cities refused to allow the film to open   edit  The American Jewish community and the civil rights movement Many from the American Jewish community tacitly or actively supported the civil rights movement  Several of the co founders of the NAACP were Jewish  Many of its white members and leading activists came from within the Jewish community  The great majority of American Jews who were active in promoting civil rights were secular Jews  Reform Jews and Conservative Jews  especially during the later years  citation needed  Jewish philanthropists actively supported the NAACP and various civil rights group  and schools for African Americans  The Jewish philanthropist Julius Rosenwald funded the creation of dozens of primary schools  secondary schools and colleges for segregated black youth  In partnership with Booker T  Washington and Tuskegee University  Rosenwald created a fund which provided seed money for building 5 000 schools for black Americans  mostly in the rural South  Tuskegee architects created model school plans  What is most remarkable is that black communities essentially taxed themselves twice to pay for such schools  which required community matching funds  Often most of the residents in rural areas were blacks  Public funds were committed for the schools  and blacks raised additional funds by community events  and sometimes by members  getting second mortgages on their homes  At one time some forty percent of rural southern blacks were learning at Rosenwald elementary schools  15  Rosenwald also contributed to HBCUs such as Howard  Dillard and Fisk universities  The PBS television show From Swastika to Jim Crow discussed Jewish involvement in the civil rights movement  It recounted that Jewish scholars fleeing from or surviving the Holocaust of World War II came to teach at many Southern schools  where they reached out to black students  Thus  in the 1930s and 1940s when Jewish refugee professors arrived at Southern Black Colleges  there was a history of overt empathy between Blacks and Jews  and the possibility of truly effective collaboration  Professor Ernst Borinski organized dinners at which Blacks and Whites would have to sit next to each other   a simple yet revolutionary act  Black students empathized with the cruelty these scholars had endured in Europe and trusted them more than other Whites  In fact  often Black students   as well as members of the Southern White community   saw these refugees as  some kind of colored folk   16  The American Jewish Committee  American Jewish Congress  and Anti Defamation League became active in promoting civil rights   edit   The New Negro  The experience of fighting as part of World War I  along with exposure to the different racial mores of Europe  influenced the black veterans  they created a widespread demand for the freedoms and equality they had fought for abroad  Those veterans found conditions at home as bad as ever  some were assaulted for having the impertinence of wearing their uniforms  This generation responded with a far more militant spirit than the generation before  urging blacks to fight back when whites attacked them  A  Philip Randolph introduced the term the  New Negro  in 1917  it became the catchphrase to describe the new spirit of militancy and impatience of the post war era  A group known as the African Blood Brotherhood  a socialist group with a large number of Caribbean  migr s in its leadership  organized around 1920 to demand the same sort of self determination for black Americans that the Wilson administration was promising to Eastern European peoples at the Versailles conference in the aftermath of World War I  The leaders of the Brotherhood  many of whom joined the Communist Party in the years to come  were also inspired by the anti imperialist program of the new Soviet Union  In addition  during the Great Migration  hundreds of thousands of African Americans moved to northern industrial cities starting before World War I and through 1940  Another wave of migration during and after World War II led many to West Coast cities  as well as more in the North and Midwest  They were both fleeing violence and segregation and seeking jobs  as manpower shortages in war industries promised steady work  Continued depressed conditions in the farm economy of the South in the 1920s made the north look more appealing  Those expanding northern communities confronted familiar problems racism  poverty  police abuse and official hostility  but these were in a new setting  where the men could vote  and women  too  after 1920   and possibilities for political action were far broader than in the South   edit  Marcus Garvey and the UNIA Marcus Garvey s Universal Negro Improvement Association made great strides in organizing in these new communities in the North  and among the internationalist minded  New Negro  movement in the early 1920s  Garvey s program pointed in the opposite direction from mainstream civil rights organizations such as the NAACP  instead of striving for integration into white dominated society  Garvey s program of Pan Africanism has become known as Garveyism  It encourages economic independence within the system of racial segregation in the United States  an African Orthodox Church with a black Jesus and black Virgin Mother that offered an alternative to the white Jesus of the black church  and a campaign that urged African Americans to  return to Africa   if not physically  at least in spirit  Garvey attracted thousands of supporters  both in the United States and in the African diaspora in the Caribbean  and claimed eleven million members for the UNIA  which was broadly popular in Northern black communities  Garvey s movement was a contradictory mix of defeatism  accommodation and separatism  he married themes of self reliance that Booker T  Washington could have endorsed and the  gospel of success  so popular in white America in the 1920s with a rejection of white colonialism abroad and any hope of reform of white society at home  The movement at first attracted many of the foreign born radicals also associated with the Socialist and Communist parties  but drove many of them away when Garvey began to suspect them of challenging his control  The movement collapsed nearly as quickly as it blossomed  as the federal government convicted Garvey for mail fraud in 1922 in connection with the movement s financially troubled  Black Star Line   The government commuted Garvey s sentence and deported Garvey to his native Jamaica in 1927  While the movement floundered without him  it inspired other self help and separatist movements that followed  including Father Divine and the Nation of Islam   edit  The Labor movement and civil rights The labor movement  with some exceptions  had historically excluded African Americans  While the radical labor organizers who led organizing drives among packinghouse workers in Chicago and Kansas City during World War I and the steel industry in 1919 made determined efforts to appeal to black workers  they were not able to overcome the widespread distrust of the labor movement among black workers in the North  With the ultimate defeat of both of those organizing drives  the black community and the labor movement largely returned to their traditional mutual mistrust  Left wing political activists in the labor movement made some progress in the 1920s and 1930s  however  in bridging that gap  A  Phillip Randolph  a long time member of the Socialist Party of America  took the leadership of the fledgling Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters at its founding in 1925  Randolph and the union faced opposition not only from the Pullman Company  but from the press and churches within the black community  many of whom were the beneficiaries of financial support from the company  The union eventually won over many of its critics in the black community by wedding its organizing program with the larger goal of black empowerment  The union won recognition from the Pullman Company in 1935 after a ten year campaign  and a union contract in 1937  The BSCP became the only black led union within the American Federation of Labor in 1935  Randolph chose to remain within the AFL when the Congress of Industrial Organizations split from it  The CIO was much more committed to organizing African American workers and made strenuous efforts to persuade the BSCP to join it  but Randolph believed more could be done to advance black workers  rights  particularly in the railway industry  by remaining in the AFL  to which the other railway brotherhoods belonged  Randolph remained the voice for black workers within the labor movement  raising demands for elimination of Jim Crow unions within the AFL at every opportunity  BSCP members such as Edgar Nixon played a significant role in the civil rights struggles of the following decades  Many of the CIO unions  in particular the Packinghouse Workers  the United Auto Workers and the Mine  Mill and Smelter Workers made advocacy of civil rights part of their organizing strategy and bargaining priorities  they gained improvements for workers in meatpacking in Chicago and Omaha  and in the steel and related industries throughout the Midwest  The Transport Workers Union of America  which had strong ties with the Communist Party at the time  entered into coalitions with Adam Clayton Powell  Jr   the NAACP and the National Negro Congress to attack employment discrimination in public transit in New York City in the early 1940s  The CIO was particularly vocal in calling for elimination of racial discrimination by defense industries during World War II  they were also forced to combat racism within their own membership  putting down strikes by white workers who refused to work with black co workers  While many of these  hate strikes  were short lived  a wildcat strike launched in Philadelphia in 1944 when the federal government ordered the private transit company to desegregate its workforce lasted two weeks and was ended only when the Roosevelt administration sent troops to guard the system and arrested the strike s ringleaders  Randolph and the BSCP took the battle against employment discrimination even further  threatening a March on Washington in 1942 if the government did not take steps to outlaw racial discrimination by defense contractors  Randolph limited the March on Washington Movement to black organizations to maintain black leadership  he endured harsh criticism from others on the left for his insistence on black workers  rights in the middle of a war  Randolph only dropped the plan to march after winning substantial concessions from the Roosevelt administration   edit  The Left and civil rights See The Communist Party and African Americans   edit  The Scottsboro Boys In 1931  the NAACP and the Communist Party USA also organized support for the  Scottsboro Boys   nine black men arrested after a fight with some white men also riding the rails  then convicted and sentenced to death for allegedly raping two white women dressed in men s clothes later found on the same train  The NAACP and the CP fought over the control of those cases and the strategy to be pursued  the CP and its arm the International Labor Defense largely prevailed  The ILD s legal campaign produced two significant Supreme Court decisions  Powell v  Alabama and Norris v  Alabama  extending the rights of defendants  its political campaign saved all the defendants from the death sentence and ultimately led to freedom for most of them  The Scottsboro defense was only one of the ILD s many cases in the South  for a period in the early and mid 1930s  the ILD was the most active defender of blacks  civil rights  and the Communist Party attracted many members among activist African Americans  Its campaigns for black defendants  rights did much to focus national attention on the extreme conditions which black defendants faced in the criminal justice system throughout the South   edit  The NAACP The NAACP devoted much of its energy between the first and second world wars to fighting the lynching of blacks and investigating the serious race riots in numerous cities throughout the United States in what was called the  Red Summer  of 1919  resulting from postwar economic and social tensions  The organization sent Walter F  White  who later became its general secretary  to Phillips County  Arkansas in October 1919 to investigate the Elaine Race Riot  In that year  it was unusual for being a rural riot  more than 200 black tenant farmers were killed by roving white vigilantes and federal troops after a deputy sheriff s attack on a union meeting of sharecroppers left one white man dead  The NAACP organized the appeals for twelve men sentenced to death a month later  based on their testimony having been obtained by beating and electric shocks  They obtained a groundbreaking Supreme Court decision in Moore v  Dempsey  261 U S  86  1923  that significantly expanded the Federal courts  oversight of the states  criminal justice systems in the years to come  The NAACP also spent more than a decade seeking federal legislation barring lynching  It regularly displayed a black flag stating  A Man Was Lynched Yesterday  from the window of its offices in New York to mark each outrage  Efforts to pass an ant lynching law foundered on Southern Democratic power in Congress  For instance  while Republicans achieved passage in the House of an anti lynching law in 1922  Southern Democratic senators filibustered the bill in the Senate and defeated it in the 1922  1923 and 1924 legislative sessions  The Southern Democratic block controlled important chairmanships in both houses of Congress and defeated all lynching legislative proposals  The NAACP led the successful fight  in alliance with the American Federation of Labor  to prevent the nomination of John Johnston Parker to the Supreme Court  They opposed him because of his opposition to black suffrage and his anti labor rulings  This alliance and lobbying campaign were important for the NAACP  both in demonstrating the NAACP s ability to mobilize widespread opposition to racism and as a first step toward building political alliances with the labor movement  After World War II  returning African American veterans were spurred by their sacrifices and experiences to renew demands for the protection and exercise of their constitutional rights as citizens in US society  One serviceman reportedly said t  I spent four years in the Army to free a bunch of Dutchmen and Frenchmen  and I m hanged if I m going to let the Alabama version of the Germans kick me around when I get home  No sirree bob  I went into the Army a nigger  I m comin  out a man   17  From 1940 to 1946  the NAACP s membership grew from 50 000 to 450 000  17  The NAACP s legal department  headed by Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood Marshall  undertook a campaign spanning several decades to bring about the reversal of the  separate but equal  doctrine announced by the Supreme Court s decision in Plessy v  Ferguson  Instead of appealing to the legislative or executive branches of government  they focused on the judiciary  reasoning that Congress was dominated by Southern segregationists  while the Presidency could not afford to lose the Southern vote  17  The NAACP s first cases did not challenge the principle directly  but sought instead to show that the state s segregated facilities were not equal  Even those more modest goals helped lay the foundation for the ultimate reversal of the doctrine in Plessy v  Ferguson by showing the irrational nature of the distinctions that the states drew to preserve segregation and the humiliating impact it had on the black subjects of  separate but equal  treatment  The Supreme Court s unanimous decision in Brown v  Board of Education  1954   holding that state sponsored segregation of elementary schools was unconstitutional  was a first step in dismantling segregation in the South  It was a historic milestone in reframing the national debate over segregation by putting state sponsored discrimination beyond constitutional defense  Marshall eventually decided to go beyond the initial aims of the NAACP  thinking that the time had come to do away with  separate but equal   The NAACP issued a directive stating that their goal was now  obtaining education on a nonsegregated basis and that no relief other than that will be acceptable   The first case Marshall argued on this basis was Briggs v  Elliott  but cases were also filed in other states  In Topeka  Kansas  the local NAACP branch determined that Oliver Brown would be a good candidate for filing a lawsuit  as an assistant pastor and the father of three girls  he was an ideal candidate  The NAACP instructed him to apply to enroll his daughters at a local white school  after the expected rejection  Brown v  Board of Education was filed  Later  this and several other cases made their way to the Supreme Court  where they were all consolidated under the title of Brown  The decision to name the case was apparently made  so that the whole question would not smack of being a purely southern one   17  Some in the NAACP thought Marshall was being too enthusiastic  fearing that the Southern judge  Chief Justice Fred M  Vinson  who would almost certainly oppose overruling Plessy  could destroy their case  One historian stated   There was a sense that if you do this and you lose  you re going to enshrine Plessy for a generation   A government lawyer involved in the case agreed that it was  a mistake to push for the overruling of segregation per se so long as Vinson was chief justice   it was too early   In December 1952  the Supreme Court heard the case  but could not come to a decision  Unusually  the case was pushed back by a year to allow the lawyers involved to research the intention of the framers who drafted the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment  In September 1953  Vinson died due to a heart attack  leading Justice Felix Frankfurter to proclaim   This is the first indication I have ever had that there is a God   Vinson was replaced by Earl Warren  who was known for his moderate views on civil rights  18  After the case was reheard in December  Warren set about persuading his colleagues to reach a unanimous decision overruling Plessy  Five of the other eight judges were firmly on his side  while another two were persuaded by Warren s promise that the decision would not touch greatly on the question of Plessy s legality  focusing instead on the principle of equality  The remaining holdout  Justice Stanley Reed  was swayed after it was suggested that a Southerner s lone dissent could be more dangerous and incendiary than a unanimous decision  In May 1954  Warren announced the Court s decision  authored by him  which declared that  segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race  deprived  the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities   The decision was strongly resisted by a number of Southerners  the Governor of Virginia  Thomas B  Stanley  insisted he would  use every legal means at my command to continue segregated schools in Virginia   One survey suggested that only 13  of Florida policemen were willing to enforce the decision in Brown  while 19 Senators and 77 members of the House of Representatives  including the entire congressional delegations of the states of Alabama  Arkansas  Georgia  Louisiana  Mississippi  South Carolina and Virginia  signed  The Southern Manifesto   all but two of the signatories were Southern Democrats  Republicans Joel Broyhill and Richard Poff of Virginia also promised to resist the decision by  lawful means   By the fall of 1955  Cheryl Brown started first grade at an integrated school   the first step on the long road to eventual equality for African Americans  19   edit  The Regional Council of Negro Leadership  Laying a Civil Rights Foundation On December 28  1951  T R M  Howard  an entrepreneur  surgeon  fraternal leader and planter in Mississippi  founded the Regional Council of Negro Leadership  RCNL  along with other key blacks in the state  At first the RCNL  which was based in the all black town of Mound Bayou  did not directly challenge  separate but equal   much like the initial stance of the Montgomery Improvement Association   but worked to guarantee the  equal   It often identified inadequate schools as the primary factor responsible for the black exodus to the North  Instead of demanding immediate integration  however  it called for equal school terms for both races  From the beginning  the RCNL also pledged an  all out fight for unrestricted voting rights   20  The Board of RCNL represented some of the key black business  fraternal  agricultural  educational  and governmental leaders in the state  Sixteen relatively autonomous committees  each headed by a respected leader in business  education  the church  or the professions  formed the backbone of the RCNL  The committees  in turn  reported to an executive board and board of directors headed by Howard  20  The RCNL s most famous member was Medgar Evers  Fresh from graduation at Alcorn State University in 1952  he had moved to Mound Bayou to sell insurance for Howard  Evers soon became the RCNL s program director and helped to organize a boycott of service stations that failed to provide restrooms for blacks  As part of this campaign  the RCNL distributed an estimated 20 000 bumper stickers with the slogan  Don t Buy Gas Where You Can t Use the Rest Room   Beginning in 1953  it directly challenged  separate but equal  and demanded integration of schools  20  The RCNL s annual meetings in Mound Bayou between 1952 and 1955 attracted crowds of ten thousand or more  They featured speeches by Rep  William L  Dawson of Chicago  Rep  Charles Diggs of Michigan  Alderman Archibald J  Carey Jr  of Chicago  and NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall  Each of these events  in the words of Myrlie Evers  later Myrlie Evers Williams  the wife of Medgar  constituted  a huge all day camp meeting  a combination of pep rally  old time revival  and Sunday church picnic   The conferences also included panels and workshops on voting rights  business ownership  and other issues  Attendance was a life transforming experience for many future civil black leaders who became prominent in the 1960s  such as Fannie Lou Hamer  Amzie Moore  Aaron Henry and George W  Lee  The RCNL also played a key role in the search for witnesses and evidence in the Emmett Till murder case in late 1955  and Howard spoke at many rallies throughout the country in the aftermath of the trial  On November 27  1955  Rosa Parks attended one of these speeches at Dexter Avenue Church in Montgomery  The host for this event was a then relatively unknown Rev  Martin Luther King Jr  Parks later said that she was thinking of Till when she refused to give up her seat four days later  20   edit  See also African American portal Social movements portal African American Civil Rights Movement  1955 1968  List of 19th century African
