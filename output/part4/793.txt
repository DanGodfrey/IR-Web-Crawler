dressed as a woman in the chorus line of the 1919 revue Every Sailor  He spent several years in vaudeville as a hoofer and comedian  until he got his first major acting part in 1925  He secured several other roles  receiving good notices  before landing the lead in the 1929 play Penny Arcade  After rave reviews  Warner Bros  signed him for an initial  500 a week  three week contract to reprise his role  this was quickly extended to a seven year contract  Cagney s seventh film  The Public Enemy  became one of the most influential gangster movies of the period  Notable for its famous

disagree as to the actual location  either on the corner of Avenue D and 8th Street 1  or in a top floor apartment at 391 East Eighth  8  His Irish American father  James Sr  was by the time of his son s birth a bartender 9  and amateur boxer  though on Cagney s birth certificate  he is listed as a telegraphist  8  His mother  Carolyn Nelson  was half Irish  half Norwegian  her father was a Norwegian ship captain 3  while her mother was Irish American  10  Cagney was the second of seven children  two of whom died within months of birth  he himself was very sick as a young child  so much so that his mother feared he would die before he could be baptized  He later attributed his sickness to the poverty in which they grew up  9  11  The family moved twice while he was still young  first to East 79th Street  and then to East 96th Street  12  The red haired  blue eyed Cagney graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York City in 1918  and attended Columbia College of Columbia University 13  where he intended to major in art  14  He also took German and joined the Student Army Training Corps  15  but dropped out after one semester  returning home upon the death of his father during the 1918 flu pandemic  14  He held a variety of jobs early in his life  giving all his earnings to his family  junior architect  copy boy for the New York Sun  book custodian at the New York Public Library  bellhop  draughtsman  and night doorman  16  Cagney believed in hard work  later stating   It was good for me  I feel sorry for the kid who has too cushy a time of it  Suddenly he has to come face to face with the realities of life without any mama or papa to do his thinking for him   16  He started tap dancing as a boy  a skill that would eventually contribute to his Academy Award  and was nicknamed  Cellar Door Cagney  after his habit of dancing on slanted cellar doors  16  He was a good street fighter  defending his older brother Harry  a medical student  against all comers when necessary  9  17  He engaged in amateur boxing  and was a runner up for the New York State lightweight title  His coaches encouraged him to turn professional  but his mother would not allow it  18  He also played semi professional baseball for a local team  16  and entertained dreams of playing in the Major Leagues  19  His introduction to films was unusual  when visiting an aunt in Brooklyn who lived opposite Vitagraph Studios  Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies  16  He became involved in amateur dramatics  starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House  one of the first settlement houses in the nation  where his brother Harry performed  He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing  One night  however  Harry became ill  and although Cagney was not an understudy  his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake  20  Afterward  he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles  21   edit  Early career  1919 1930  While working at Wanamaker s Department Store in 1919  Cagney learned  from a colleague who had seen him dance  of a role in the upcoming production Every Sailor  A wartime play in which the chorus was made up of servicemen dressed as women  it was originally titled Every Woman  Cagney auditioned for the role of a chorus girl  despite considering it a waste of time  he only knew one dance step  the complicated Peabody  but he knew it perfectly  22  This was enough to convince the producers that he could dance  and he copied the other dancers  moves while waiting to go on  23  He did not find it odd to play a woman  nor was he embarrassed  He later recalled how he was able to shed his own natural shy persona when he stepped onto the stage   For there I am not myself  I am not that fellow  Jim Cagney  at all  I certainly lost all consciousness of him when I put on skirts  wig  paint  powder  feathers and spangles   24  Had Cagney s mother had her way  his stage career would have ended when he quit Every Sailor after two months  proud as she was of his performance  she preferred that he get an education  25  Cagney appreciated the  35 a week he was paid  which he called  a mountain of money for me in those worrisome days   22  23  In deference to his mother s worries  he got employment as a brokerage house runner  23  This did not stop him looking for more stage work  however  and he went on to successfully audition for a chorus part in Pitter Patter  3  24  for which he earned  55 a week he sent  40 to his mother each week  26  So strong was his habit of holding down more than one job at a time  he also worked as a dresser for one of the leads  portered the casts  luggage  and understudied for the lead  24  26  Among the chorus line performers was sixteen year old Frances Willard  Billie  Vernon  whom he would marry in 1922  3  24  The show began Cagney s ten year association with vaudeville and Broadway  Cagney and his wife were among the early resident of Free Acres  a social experiment established by Bolton Hall in Berkeley Heights  New Jersey  27  Pitter Patter was not hugely successful  but it did well enough to run for 32 weeks  enabling Cagney to join the vaudeville circuit  He and Vernon toured separately with a number of different troupes  reuniting as  Vernon and Nye  to do simple comedy routines and musical numbers   Nye  was a rearrangement of the last syllable of Cagney s surname  28  29  One of the troupes that Cagney joined was Parker  Rand and Leach  taking over the spot vacated when Archie Leach who would later change his name to Cary Grant left  30  31  After years of touring and struggling to make money  Cagney and Vernon moved to Hawthorne  California in 1924  partly for Cagney to meet his new mother in law  who had just moved there from Chicago  and partly to investigate breaking into the movies  Their train fares were paid for by a friend  the press officer of Pitter Patter  who was also desperate to act  32  They were not very successful at first  the dance studio Cagney set up had few clients and folded  and he and Vernon toured the studios  but garnered no interest  Eventually  they borrowed some money and headed back to New York via Chicago and Milwaukee  enduring failure along the way when they attempted to make money on the stage  32  Cagney and Gloria Stuart in 1934 s Here Comes the Navy  The movie was filmed on the ill fated USS Arizona  Cagney s long film career would see him in a naval uniform on more than one occasion  Cagney secured his first significant non dancing role in 1925  He played a young tough guy in the three act play Outside Looking In by Maxwell Anderson  earning  200 a week  As with Pitter Patter  Cagney went to the audition with little confidence of getting the part  he had had no experience with drama at this point  33  Cagney felt that he only got the role because his hair was redder than that of Alan Bunce  the only other red headed performer in New York  33  34  Both the play and Cagney received good reviews  Life magazine wrote   Mr  Cagney  in a less spectacular role  than his co star  makes a few minutes silence during his mock trial scene something that many a more established actor might watch with profit   Burns Mantle wrote that it  contained the most honest acting now to be seen in New York   35  Following the show s four month run  Cagney went back to vaudeville for the next couple of years  He achieved varied success  but after appearing in Outside Looking In  clarification needed  the Cagneys were more financially secure  During this period  he met George M  Cohan  whom he would go on to portray in Yankee Doodle Dandy  though they never spoke  36  Cagney secured the lead role in the 1926 27 season West End production of Broadway by George Abbott  The show s management insisted that he copy Broadway lead Lee Tracy s performance  despite Cagney s discomfort in doing so  but the day before the show sailed for England  they decided to replace him  36  37  This was a devastating turn of events for Cagney  apart from the logistical difficulties this presented the couple s luggage was in the hold of the ship and they had given up their apartment he almost quit show business  As Billie recalled   Jimmy said that it was all over  He made up his mind that he would get a job doing something else   38  The Cagneys had run of the play contracts  which lasted as long as the play did  Billie was in the chorus line of the show  and with help from the Actors  Equity Association  Cagney understudied Tracy on the Broadway show  providing them with a desperately needed steady income  Cagney also established a dance school for professionals  then landed a part in the play Women Go On Forever  directed by John Cromwell  which ran for four months  By the end of the run  Cagney was exhausted from acting and running the dance school  He had built a reputation as an innovative teacher  so when he was cast as the lead in Grand Street Follies of 1928  he was also appointed the choreographer  The show received rave reviews 39  and was followed by Grand Street Follies of 1929  These roles led to a part in George Kelly s Maggie the Magnificent  a play generally not liked by the critics  although Cagney s performance was  Cagney saw this role  and Women Go on Forever  as significant because of the talented directors he encountered  he learned  what a director was for and what a director could do  They were directors who could play all the parts in the play better than the actors cast for them   40   edit  Warner Bros   1930 1935  Playing opposite Cagney in Maggie the Magnificent was Joan Blondell  who would star again with him a few months later in Marie Baumer s new play Penny Arcade  41  While the critics panned Penny Arcade  Cagney and Blondell were both highly praised  Al Jolson  sensing film potential  bought the rights for  20 000  He then sold the play to Warner Brothers  with the stipulation that Cagney and Blondell be cast in the film version  Retitled Sinners  Holiday  the film was released in 1930  41  Cagney was given a  500 a week  three week contract  42  In the film  he portrays Harry Delano  a tough guy who becomes a killer  but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing  This role of the sympathetic  bad  guy would be a recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career  43  During filming of Sinners  Holiday  he also demonstrated the stubbornness that would characterize his work attitude  He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line   There was a line in the show where I was supposed to be crying on my mother s breast     The line  was  I m your baby  ain t I   I refused to say it  Adolfi said  I m going to tell Zanuck   I said  I don t give a shit what you tell him  I m not going to say that line    They took the line out  44  Despite this outburst  the studio liked him  and before his three week contract was up while the film was still shooting 45  they gave Cagney a three week extension  which was followed by a full seven year contract at  400 a week  44  The contract  however  allowed Warners to drop him at the end of any 40 week period  effectively only guaranteeing him 40 weeks income at a time  As when he was growing up  Cagney shared his income with his family  44  With the good reviews that Cagney received  he immediately starred in another gangster role in The Doorway to Hell  The film was a financial hit  helping cement Cagney s growing reputation  46  He made four more movies before his breakthrough role  Cagney mashes a grapefruit into Mae Clarke s face in a famous scene from Cagney s breakthrough movie  The Public Enemy  1931  Warner Brothers  succession of gangster movie hits  in particular Little Caesar with Edward G  Robinson  47  culminated with the 1931 film The Public Enemy  Due to the strong reviews in his short film career  Cagney was cast as nice guy Matt Doyle  opposite Edward Woods as Tom Powers  However  after the initial rushes  each was reassigned the other s part  47  48  The film cost only  151 000 to make  but it became one of the first low budget films to gross  1 million  49  Cagney received widespread praise for his role  The New York Herald Tribune described his performance as  the most ruthless  unsentimental appraisal of the meanness of a petty killer the cinema has yet devised   50  He received top billing after the film  51  but while he acknowledged the importance of the role to his career  he always disputed that it changed the way heroes and leading men were portrayed  he cited Clark Gable s slapping of Barbara Stanwyck six months earlier  in Night Nurse  as more important  52 Night Nurse was actually released three months after The Public Enemy and Gable punched Stanwyck in the film  knocking her character unconscious  then carried her across the hall  where she woke up later  According to Robert Osborne  on Turner Classic Movies  the part of  Nick the Chauffeur  was originally intended for Cagney  but his success in The Public Enemy prevented his playing a supporting role  citation needed  The scene in which Cagney pushes a grapefruit into Mae Clarke s face is viewed by many critics as one of the most famous moments in movie history  13  48  53  54  The scene itself was a very late addition  and who originally thought of the idea is a matter of debate  producer Darryl Zanuck claimed he thought of it in a script conference  director William Wellman claimed that the idea came to him when he saw the grapefruit on the table during the shoot  and writers Glasmon and Bright claimed it was based on the real life of gangster Hymie Weiss  who threw an omelet into his girlfriend s face  Cagney himself usually cited the writers  version  but the fruit s victim  Clarke  agreed that it was Wellman s idea  saying   I m sorry I ever agreed to do the grapefruit bit  I never dreamed it would be shown in the movie  Director Bill Wellman thought of the idea suddenly  It wasn t even written into the script    55  However  according to Turner Classic Movies  TCM   the grapefruit scene was a practical joke that Cagney and costar Mae Clark decided to play on the crew while the cameras were rolling  Wellman liked it so much that he left it in  TCM also notes that the scene made Clarke s ex husband  Lew Brice  very happy   He saw the film repeatedly just to see that scene  and was often shushed by angry patrons when his delighted laughter got too loud   56  Filmmakers have mimicked it many times  such as Lee Marvin s character splashing scalding coffee in the face of Gloria Grahame in The Big Heat  57  Cagney himself was offered grapefruit in almost every restaurant he visited for years after  and Clarke claimed it virtually ruined her career due to typecasting  53  Cagney s stubbornness was starting to become well known behind the scenes  not least after his refusal to join in a 100 percent participation free charity drive that was being pushed by Douglas Fairbanks  Jr  Cagney did not object to donating money to charity  but rather to being forced to  Already he had acquired the nickname  The Professional Againster   7  58  Along with George Raft  Edward G  Robinson and Humphrey Bogart  Warner Bros  actors all  Cagney defined what a movie gangster was  In G Men  1934   though  he played a lawyer who joins the FBI  Warners was quick to team its two rising gangster stars   Cagney and Edward G  Robinson   for the 1931 film Smart Money  So keen was the studio to follow up the success of Robinson s Little Caesar that Cagney actually shot Smart Money  for which he received second billing  at the same time as The Public Enemy  59  As in The Public Enemy  Cagney was required to be physically violent to a woman on screen  a signal that Warners was keen to keep Cagney in the public eye  this time he slapped co star Evalyn Knapp  60  With the introduction of the United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930  and particularly its edicts concerning on screen violence  Warners decided to allow Cagney a change of pace  They cast him in the comedy Blonde Crazy  again opposite Blondell  As he completed filming  The Public Enemy was filling cinemas with all night showings  Cagney began to compare his pay with his peers  thinking his contract allowed for salary adjustments based on the success of his films  Warners disagreed  however  and refused to give him a raise  The studio heads also insisted that Cagney continue promoting their films  even the ones he was not in  something he opposed  Cagney moved back to New York  leaving his apartment to his brother Bill to look after  61  While Cagney was in New York  his brother  who had effectively become his agent  angled for a substantial pay rise and more personal freedom for his brother  Warners  hand was forced by the success of The Public Enemy and Blonde Crazy  they eventually offered Cagney a contract paying  1000 a week  62  Cagney s first film upon returning from New York was 1932 s Taxi   The film is notable for not only being the first time that Cagney danced on screen  but it was also the last time he would allow himself to be shot at with live ammunition  a relatively common occurrence at the time  as blank cartridges and squibs were considered too expensive and hard to find to be used in most motion picture filming   He had been shot at in The Public Enemy  but during filming for Taxi   he was almost hit  63  In his opening scene  Cagney spoke fluent Yiddish  a language he had picked up during his boyhood in New York City  63  64  The film was again praised by critics   I never said   MMMmmm  you dirty rat   Cagney  in his acceptance speech for the AFI Life Achievement Award  1974 Taxi  was the source of one of Cagney s most misquoted lines  he never actually said   MMMmmm  you dirty rat    a line commonly used by impressionists  The closest he got to it in the film was   Come out and take it  you dirty  yellow bellied rat  or I ll give it to you through the door   The film was swiftly followed by The Crowd Roars and Winner Take All  Despite his success  Cagney was dissatisfied with his contract  He wanted more money for his successful films  but he also offered to take a smaller salary should his star wane  65  66  Warners refused  and so Cagney once again walked out  He was holding out for  4000 a week  65  the same salary as Edward G  Robinson  Douglas Fairbanks  Jr   and Kay Francis  66  Warners refused to cave in this time  and suspended Cagney  Cagney announced that he would do his next three pictures for free if Warners would cancel the five years remaining on his contract  He also threatened to quit Hollywood and go back to Columbia University to follow his brothers into medicine  After six months of suspension  a deal was brokered by Frank Capra that gave the actor an increased salary of around  3000 a week  a guarantee of no more than four films a year  and top billing  67  Having learned about the block booking studio system that almost guaranteed the studios huge profits  Cagney was determined to spread the wealth  68  69  He would send money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood  though he did not generally make this known  70  His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors even teenagers regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films  This experience would also be an integral reason for his involvement in the formation of the Screen Actors Guild  which came into existence in 1933  Cagney and Joan Blondell in Footlight Parade  1933  Cagney returned to the studio and made Hard to Handle in 1933  This was followed by a steady stream of films  including the highly regarded Footlight Parade  71  which gave Cagney the chance to return to his song and dance roots  The film includes show stopping scenes with Busby Berkeley choreographed routines  72  His next notable film was 1934 s Here Comes the Navy  which paired him with Pat O Brien for the first time  the two would have an enduring friendship  73  In 1935  Cagney was listed as one of the Top Ten Moneymakers in Hollywood for the first time  74  and was cast more frequently in non gangster roles  he played a lawyer who joins the FBI in G Men  and he also took on his first  and only  Shakespearean role  as top billed Nick Bottom in A Midsummer Night s Dream alongside Joe E  Brown as Flute and Mickey Rooney as Puck  Cagney s last movie in 1935 was Ceiling Zero  his third film with Pat O Brien  O Brien received top billing  which was a clear breach of Cagney s contract  This  combined with the fact that Cagney had made five movies in 1934  again against his contract terms  caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warners for breach of contract  75  76  The dispute dragged on for several months  Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn  but neither felt in a position to offer him work while the dispute went on  75  Meanwhile  while being represented by his brother William in court  Cagney went back to New York to search for a country property where he could indulge his passion for farming  75   edit  Independent years  1936 1937  Cagney spent most of the next year on his farm  and only went back to work when Edward L  Alperson from Grand National Films  a newly established  independent studio  approached him to make movies for  100 000 a film and 10  of the profits  77  78  Cagney made two films for Grand National  Great Guy and Something to Sing About  He received good reviews for both  79  80  but overall the production quality was not up to Warners standards  and the films did not do well  A third film  Dynamite  was planned  but Grand National ran out of money  81  Cagney also became involved in political causes  and in 1936  agreed to sponsor the Hollywood Anti Nazi League  82  Unknown to Cagney  the League was in fact a front organization for the Communist International  Comintern   which sought to enlist support for the Soviet Union and its foreign policies  82  83  Humphrey Bogart with Cagney and Jeffrey Lynn in The Roaring Twenties  1939   the last film Bogart and Cagney made together  The courts eventually decided the Warner Brothers lawsuit in Cagney s favor  He had done what many thought unthinkable  taking on the studios and winning  81  Not only did he win  Warners knew that he was still a star and invited him back for a five year   150 000 a film deal  with no more than two pictures a year  Cagney would also have full say over what films he did and did not make  84  Additionally  William Cagney was guaranteed the position of assistant producer for the movies his brother starred in  85  Cagney had demonstrated the power of the walkout in keeping the studios to their word  He later explained his reasons  saying   I walked out because I depended on the studio heads to keep their word on this  that or other promise  and when the promise was not kept  my only recourse was to deprive them of my services   86  Cagney himself acknowledged the importance of the walkout for other actors in breaking the dominance of the studio system  Normally  when a star walked out  the time he or she were absent was added on to the end of an already long contract  as happened with Olivia de Havilland and Bette Davis  69  Cagney  however  walked out and came back to a better contract  Many in Hollywood watched the case closely for hints of how future contracts might be handled  87  Artistically  the Grand National experiment was a success for Cagney  who was able to move away from his traditional Warners tough guy roles to more sympathetic characters  84  88  How far he could have experimented and developed will never be known  but back in the Warners fold  he was once again playing tough guys  88   edit  Return to Warner Bros   1938 1942  Cagney with his pal Pat O Brien inAngels with Dirty Faces  1938   the sixth of nine feature films they would make together  Cagney s two films of 1938  Boy Meets Girl and Angels with Dirty Faces  both costarred Pat O Brien  The former saw Cagney in a comedy role  and received mixed reviews  Warners had allowed Cagney his change of pace  89  but was keen to get him back to playing tough guys  which was more lucrative  Ironically  the script for Angels was one that Cagney had hoped to do while with Grand National  but the studio had been unable to secure funding  89  Cagney starred as Rocky Sullivan  a gangster fresh out of jail and looking for his former associate  played by Humphrey Bogart  who owes him money  While revisiting his old haunts  he runs into his old friend Jerry Connolly  played by O Brien  who is now a priest concerned about the Dead End Kids  futures  particularly as they idolize Rocky  After a messy shootout  Sullivan is eventually captured by the police and sentenced to death in the electric chair  Connolly pleads with Rocky to  turn yellow  on his way to the chair so that the Kids will lose their admiration for him  and hopefully avoid turning to crime  Sullivan refuses  but on his way to his execution  he breaks down and begs for his life  It is unclear whether this cowardice is real or just feigned for the Kids  benefit  Cagney himself refused to say  insisting he liked the ambiguity  90  The film is regarded by many as one of Cagney s finest  91  and garnered him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for 1938  He lost to Spencer Tracy in Boys Town  Cagney had been considered for the role  but lost out on due to his typecasting  92   He also lost the role of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne in Knute Rockne  All American to his friend Pat O Brien for the same reason  92   Cagney did  however  win that year s New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor  His earlier insistence on not filming with live ammunition proved to be a good decision  having been told while filming Angels with Dirty Faces that he would be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets  Cagney refused and insisted the shots be added afterwards  As it turned out  a ricocheting bullet passed through exactly where his head would have been  93  94  During his first year back at Warners  Cagney became the studio s highest earner  making  324 000  95  He completed his first decade of movie making in 1939 with The Roaring Twenties  his first film with Raoul Walsh  and his last with Bogart  It was also his last gangster film for ten years  Cagney again received good reviews  Graham Greene stated that  Mr  Cagney  of the bull calf brow  is as always a superb and witty actor   96 The Roaring Twenties was the last film in which Cagney s character s violence was explained by poor upbringing  or their environment  as was the case in The Public Enemy  From that point on  violence was attached to mania  as in White Heat  96  In 1939  Cagney was second to only Gary Cooper in the national acting wage stakes  earning  368 333  97  Cagney as George M  Cohan  performing  The Yankee Doodle Boy  from Yankee Doodle Dandy  1942  His next notable role was George M  Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy  a film Cagney  took great pride in  98  and considered his best  99  Producer Hal Wallis said that having seen Cohan in I d Rather Be Right  he never considered anyone other than Cagney for the part  100  Cagney  on the other hand  insisted that Fred Astaire had been the first choice  but turned it down  100  101  Filming began the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor  and the cast and crew worked in a  patriotic frenzy  100  as the United States  involvement in World War II gave the cast and crew a feeling that  they might be sending the last message from the free world   according to actress Rosemary DeCamp  102  Cohan was given a private showing of the film shortly before his death  and thanked Cagney  for a wonderful job   103  A paid premi re  with seats ranging from  25 to  25 000  raised  5 750 000 for war bonds for the US treasury  104  105   Smart  alert  hard headed  Cagney is as typically American as Cohan himself    It was a remarkable performance  probably Cagney s best  and it makes Yankee Doodle a dandy  Time magazine 106  Many critics of the time and since have declared it to be Cagney s best film  drawing parallels between Cohan and Cagney  they both began their careers in vaudeville  struggled for years before reaching the peak of their profession  were surrounded with family and married early  and both had a wife who was happy to sit back while he went on to stardom  107  108  The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three  including Cagney s for Best Actor  In his acceptance speech  Cagney said   I ve always maintained that in this business  you re only as good as the other fellow thinks you are  It s nice to know that you people thought I did a good job  And don t forget that it was a good part  too   109   edit  Independent again  1942 1948  Cagney announced in March 1942 that he and brother William were setting up Cagney Productions to release films though United Artists  77  110  Free of Warners again  Cagney spent some time relaxing on his farm in Martha s Vineyard before volunteering to join the USO  He spent several weeks touring the US  entertaining troops with vaudeville routines and scenes from Yankee Doodle Dandy  111  In September 1942  he was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild  Almost a year after the creation of his new production company  Cagney Productions produced its first film  Johnny Come Lately  in 1943  While the major studios were producing patriotic war movies  Cagney was determined to continue dispelling his tough guy image  112  so he produced a movie that was a  complete and exhilarating exposition of the Cagney  alter ego  on film   113  According to Cagney  the film  made money but it was no great winner   and reviews varied from excellent  Time  to poor  New York s PM   114   I m here to dance a few jigs  sing a few songs  say hello to the boys  and that s all   Cagney to British reporters 115  Following the film s completion  Cagney went back to the USO and toured US military bases in the UK  He refused to give interviews to the British press  preferring to concentrate on rehearsals and performances  He gave several performances a day for the Army Signal Corps of The American Cavalcade of Dance  which consisted of a history of American dance  from the earliest days to Fred Astaire  and culminated with dances from Yankee Doodle Dandy  The second movie Cagney s company produced was Blood on the Sun  Insisting on doing his own stunts  Cagney required judo training from expert Ken Kuniyuki and Jack Halloran  a former policeman  116  The Cagneys had hoped that an action film would appeal more to audiences  but it fared worse at the box office than Johnny Come Lately  At this time  Cagney heard of young war hero Audie Murphy  who had appeared on the cover of Life magazine  117  Cagney thought that Murphy had the looks to be a movie star  and suggested that he come to Hollywood  Cagney felt  however  that Murphy could not act  and his contract was loaned out and then sold  118  While negotiating the rights for his third independent film  Cagney starred in 20th Century Fox s 13 Rue Madeleine for  300 000 for two months of work  119  The wartime spy film was a success  and Cagney was keen to begin production of his new project  an adaptation of William Saroyan s Broadway play The Time of Your Life  Saroyan himself loved the film  but it was a commercial disaster  costing the company half a million dollars to make  120  audiences again struggled to accept Cagney in a non tough guy role  120  121  Cagney Productions was in serious trouble  poor returns from the produced films  and a legal dispute with Sam Goldwyn Studio over a rental agreement 120  121  forced Cagney back to Warners  He signed a distribution production deal with the studio for the film White Heat  121  effectively making Cagney Productions a unit of Warner Brothers  85   edit  Back to Warner  1949 1955  Cagney as Cody Jarrett in White Heat  1949  Cagney s portrayal of Cody Jarrett in the 1949 film White Heat is one of his most memorable  122  123  Cinema had changed in the ten years since Walsh last directed Cagney  in The Roaring Twenties   and the actor s portrayal of gangsters had also changed  Unlike Tom Powers in The Public Enemy  Jarrett was portrayed as a raging lunatic with few if any sympathetic qualities  124  In the 18 intervening years  Cagney s hair had begun to gray  and he developed a paunch for the first time  He was no longer a romantic commodity  and this was reflected in his performance  124  Cagney himself had the idea of playing Jarrett as psychotic  he later stated that  it was essentially a cheapie one two three four kind of thing  so I suggested we make him nuts  It was agreed so we put in all those fits and headaches   125  Cagney s final lines in the film    Made it  Ma  Top of the world     was voted the 18th greatest movie line by the American Film Institute  Likewise  Jarrett s explosion of rage in prison on being told of his mother s death is widely hailed as one of Cagney s most memorable performances  123  126  Some of the extras on set actually became terrified of the actor because of his violent portrayal  123  Cagney attributed the performance to his father s alcoholic rages  which he had witnessed as a child  as well as someone that he had seen on a visit to a mental hospital  123    A  homicidal paranoiac with a mother fixation  Warner Bros  publicity description of Cody Jarrett in White Heat 125  The film was a critical success  though some critics wondered about the social impact of a character that they saw as sympathetic  127  Cagney was still struggling against his gangster typecasting  He said to a journalist   It s what the people want me to do  Some day  though  I d like to make another movie that kids could go and see   128  However  Warners  perhaps searching for another Yankee Doodle Dandy 128  assigned Cagney a musical for his next picture  1950 s The West Point Story with Doris Day  an actress he admired  129  His next film  Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye  was another gangster movie  which was the first by Cagney Productions since its acquisition by Warners  While compared unfavorably to White Heat by critics  it was fairly successful at the box office  with  500 000 going straight to Cagney Productions  bankers to pay off their losses  130  Cagney Productions was not a great success  however  and in 1953  after William Cagney produced his last film  A Lion Is in the Streets  the company came to an end  77  Cagney in Love Me or Leave Me  1955  Cagney s next notable role was the 1955 film Love Me or Leave Me  his third with Day  Cagney played Martin  Moe the Gimp  Snyder  a lame Jewish American gangster from Chicago  a part Spencer Tracy had turned down  131  Cagney described the script as  that extremely rare thing  the perfect script   131  132  When the film was released  Snyder reportedly asked how Cagney had so accurately copied his limp  but Cagney himself insisted he had not  having based it on personal observation of other people when they limped   What I did was very simple  I just slapped my foot down as I turned it out while walking  That s all   131  132  His performance earned him another Best Actor Academy Award nomination  17 years after his first  6  Reviews were strong  and the film is considered to be one of the best of his later career  In Day  he found a co star he could build a rapport with  such as he had had with Blondell at the start of his career  133  Day herself was full of praise for Cagney  stating that he was  the most professional actor I ve ever known  He was always  real   I simply forgot we were making a picture  His eyes would actually fill up when we were working on a tender scene  And you never needed drops to make your eyes shine when Jimmy was on the set   133  Cagney s next film was Mister Roberts  directed by John Ford and slated to star Spencer Tracy  It was Tracy s involvement that ensured that Cagney accepted a supporting role  although in the end  Tracy did not take part  134  Cagney had worked with Ford before on What Price Glory   and they had got along fairly well  However  as soon as Ford met Cagney at the airport  the director warned him that they would  tangle asses   which caught Cagney by surprise  He later said   I would have kicked his brains out  He was so goddamned mean to everybody  He was truly a nasty old man   135  The next day  Cagney was slightly late on set  incensing Ford  Cagney cut short his imminent tirade  saying  When I started this picture  you said that we would tangle asses before this was over  I m ready now   are you   Ford walked away  and they had no more problems  even though Cagney never particularly liked Ford  135  Cagney s skill at noticing tiny details in other actors  performances became apparent during the shooting of Mister Roberts  While watching the Kraft Music Hall anthology television show some months before  Cagney had noticed Jack Lemmon performing left handed  The first thing that Cagney asked Lemmon when they met was if he was still using his left hand  Lemmon was shocked  he had done it on a whim  and thought no one else had noticed  He said of his costar   his powers of observation must be absolutely incredible  in addition to the fact that he remembered it  I was very flattered   134  The film was a success  securing three Oscar nominations  including Best Picture  Best Sound Recording and Best Supporting Actor for Lemmon  who won  While Cagney was not nominated  he had thoroughly enjoyed the production  Filming on Midway Island and in a more minor role meant that he had time to relax and engage in his hobby of painting  He also drew caricatures of the cast and crew  136   edit  Later career  1955 1961  Cagney worked with MGM on the Western film Tribute to a Bad Man  a role that had originally been written for Spencer Tracy  He received praise for his performance  and the studio liked his work enough to offer him These Wilder Years with Barbara Stanwyck  The two stars got on well  they had both previously worked in vaudeville  and they entertained the cast and crew off screen by singing and dancing  137  In 1956  Cagney undertook one of his very rare television roles  starring in Robert Montgomery s Soldiers From the War Returning  This was a favor to Montgomery  who needed a strong fall season opener to stop the network from dropping his series  Cagney s appearance ensured that it was a success  The actor made it clear to reporters afterwards that television was not his medium   I do enough work in movies  This is a high tension business  I have tremendous admiration for the people who go through this sort of thing every week  but it s not for me   138  The following year  Cagney appeared in Man of a Thousand Faces  in which he played Lon Chaney  He received excellent reviews  with the New York Journal American rating it one of his best performances  and the film  made for Universal  was a box office hit  Cagney s skill at mimicry  combined with a physical similarity to Chaney  helped him generate empathy for his character  139  140  Later in 1957  Cagney ventured behind the camera for the first and only time to direct Short Cut to Hell  a remake of the 1941 Alan Ladd film This Gun for Hire  which in turn was based on the Graham Greene novel A Gun for Sale  Cagney had long been told by friends that he would make an excellent director  140  so when he was approached by his friend  producer A  C  Lyles  he instinctively said yes  He refused all offers of payment  saying he was an actor  not a director  The film was low budget  and shot quickly  As Cagney recalled   We shot it in twenty days  and that was long enough for me  I find directing a bore  I have no desire to tell other people their business   141  In 1959  Cagney played a labor leader in what proved to be his final musical  Never Steal Anything Small  which featured a comical song and dance duet with Cara Williams  who played his girlfriend  For Cagney s next film  he traveled to Ireland for Shake Hands with the Devil  directed by Michael Anderson  Cagney had hoped to spend some time tracing his Irish ancestry  but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was unable to do so  The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander  and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years  142  Cagney s career began winding down  and he made only one film in 1960  the critically acclaimed The Gallant Hours  in which he played Admiral William F   Bull  Halsey  The film  although set during the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific Theater during World War II  was not a war film  but instead focused on the impact of command  Cagney Productions  which shared the production credit with Robert Montgomery s company  made a brief return  though in name only  The film was a success  and The New York Times  Bosley Crowther singled its star out for praise   It is Mr  Cagney s performance  controlled to the last detail  that gives life and strong  heroic stature to the principal figure in the film  There is no braggadocio in it  no straining for bold or sharp effects  It is one of the quietest  most reflective  subtlest jobs that Mr  Cagney has ever done   143  144   I never had the slightest difficulty with a fellow actor  Not until One  Two  Three  In that picture  Horst Buchholz tried all sorts of scene stealing didoes  I came close to knocking him on his ass   James Cagney on the filming of One  Two  Three 143  Cagney s penultimate film was a comedy  He was hand picked by Billy Wilder to play a hard driving Coca Cola executive in the film One  Two  Three  145  Cagney had concerns with the script  remembering back 23 years to Boy Meets Girl  in which scenes were re shot to try to make them funnier by speeding up the pacing  with the opposite effect  Cagney received assurances from Wilder that the script was balanced  Filming did not go well  though  with one scene requiring 50 takes  something Cagney was unaccustomed to  146  In fact  it was one of the worst experiences of his long career  For the first time  Cagney considered walking out of a film  He felt he had worked too many years inside studios  and combined with a visit to Dachau concentration camp during filming  he decided that he had had enough  and retired afterward  147  One of the few positive aspects was his friendship with Pamela Tiffin  to whom he gave acting guidance  including the secret that he had learned over his career   You walk in  plant yourself squarely on both feet  look the other fella in the eye  and tell the truth   148   edit  Retirement and death  1961 1986  Cagney remained in retirement for twenty years  conjuring up images of Jack Warner every time he was tempted to return  which soon dispelled the notion  After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady  149  150  he found it easier to rebuff others  including a part in The Godfather Part II  150  He made few public appearances  preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles  and summers either at his Martha s Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms in New York  When in New York  he and Billie held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant  where they got to know Marge Zimmermann  the proprietress  151  Cagney was diagnosed with glaucoma and began taking eye drops  but he continued to have problems with his vision  On Zimmerman s recommendation  he visited a different doctor  who determined that glaucoma had been a misdiagnosis  and that Cagney was actually diabetic  Zimmerman then took it upon herself to look after Cagney  preparing his meals to reduce his blood triglyceride level  which had reached alarming proportions  Such was her success that  by the time Cagney made a rare public appearance at his AFI Lifetime Achievement award ceremony in 1974  he had lost 20 pounds  9 1 kg  and his vision had drastically improved  152  Opened by Charlton Heston and introduced by Frank Sinatra  the ceremony was attended by so many Hollywood stars said to be more than for any event in history that one columnist wrote at the time that a bomb in the dining room would have brought about the end of the movie industry  During his acceptance speech  Cagney lightly chastised impressionist Frank Gorshin  saying   Oh  Frankie  just in passing  I never said  MMMMmmmm  you dirty rat   What I actually did say was  Judy  Judy  Judy     a joking reference to a famous misquotation attributed to Cary Grant  153   I think he s some kind of genius  His instinct  it s just unbelievable  I could just stay at home  One of the qualities of a brilliant actor is that things look better on the screen than the set  Jimmy has that quality  Director Milo  Forman  154  While at Coldwater Canyon in 1977  Cagney had a minor stroke  After two weeks in hospital  Zimmerman became his full time caregiver  traveling with him and Billie wherever they went  155  After the stroke  Cagney was no longer able to undertake many of his favorite pastimes  including horse riding and dancing  and as he became more depressed  he even gave up his beloved painting  Encouraged by his wife and Zimmerman  Cagney accepted an offer from Milo  Forman to star in a small but pivotal role in the 1981 film Ragtime  The film was shot mainly at Shepperton Studios in London  and on his arrival at Southampton aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2  Cagney was mobbed by hundreds of fans  Cunard officials  who were responsible for the security at the dock  said they had never seen anything like it  although they had experienced past visits by Marlon Brando and Robert Redford  Despite it being his first film in twenty years  Cagney was immediately at ease  Flubbed lines and miscues were all committed by his co stars  many of whom were in awe of Cagney  Howard Rollins  who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance  said   I was frightened to meet Mr  Cagney  I asked him how to die in front of camera  He said  Just die   It worked  Who would know more about dying than him   Cagney also repeated the advice he had given to Pamela Tiffin  Joan Leslie and Lemmon  As filming progressed  Cagney s sciatica worsened  but he finished the nine week shoot  and reportedly stayed on the set after completing his scenes to help other actors with their dialogue  He and co star Pat O Brien appeared on the Parkinson talk show  and Cagney made a surprise appearance at the Queen Mother s command birthday performance at the London Palladium  His appearance on stage prompted the Queen Mother to rise to her feet  the only time she did so during the whole show  and she later broke protocol to go backstage to speak with Cagney directly  154  Cagney made a rare TV appearance in the lead role of the movie Terrible Joe Moran in 1984  his last work  He was in fragile health and confined to a wheelchair from strokes  but the producers worked his real life disabilities into it by casting him as an 80 year old ex boxer who needs a wheelchair to get around  The film used fight clips from Cagney s 1932 boxing movie Winner Take All although Cagney plays a different character in the TV movie  Cagney died at his Dutchess County farm in Stanfordville  New York  on Easter Sunday 1986  of a heart attack  He is interred in the Cemetery of the Gate of Heaven in Hawthorne  New York  His pallbearers included boxer Floyd Patterson  Mikhail Baryshnikov  who had hoped to play Cagney on Broadway   actor Ralph Bellamy  and Milo  Forman  His close friend  President Ronald Reagan  gave the eulogy at the funeral  64   edit  Personal life The crypt of James Cagney in Gate of Heaven Cemetery On September 28  1922  Cagney married dancer Frances Willard  Billie  Vernon  with whom he remained for the rest of his life  They had met on the chorus line of Pitter Patter  They adopted a son  James Cagney  Jr   in 1941  and then a daughter  Cathleen  Casey  Cagney  156  Cagney was a very private man  and while he was more than willing to give the press opportunities for photographs when necessary  he generally spent his private time out of the public eye  157  Cagney s son married Jill Lisbeth Inness in 1962  158  The couple had two children  James III and Cindy  159  Cagney Jr  died from a heart attack on January 27  1984 in Washington D C   two years before his adoptive father s death  160  161  He had become estranged from his father and had not seen or talked to him since 1982  159  160  Cagney s daughter Cathleen married Jack W  Thomas in 1962  162  She too was estranged from her father during the final years of his life  She died August 11  2004  163  As a young man  Cagney became interested in farming   sparked by a soil conservation lecture he had attended 14    and during his first walkout from Warners  he found a 100 acre  0 40 km2  farm in Martha s Vineyard  owning a farm had long been a dream of his  164  165  Cagney loved that there were no concrete roads surrounding the property  only dirt tracks  The house was rather run down and ramshackle  and Billie was initially reluctant to move in  but soon came to love the place as well  After being inundated by movie fans  Cagney sent out a rumor that he had hired a gunman for security  The ruse proved so successful that when Spencer Tracy came to visit  his taxi driver refused to drive up to the house  saying   I hear they shoot    which forced Tracy to walk the rest of the way  78  In 1955  having shot three films  Cagney bought a 120 acre  0 49 km2  farm in Dutchess County  Stanfordville  New York  for  100 000  Cagney named it Verney Farm  taking the first syllable from Billie s maiden name and the second from his own surname  Cagney did not just live there  he turned it into a working farm by selling some of the dairy cattle and replacing them with beef cattle  166  167  He expanded it over the years to 750 acres  3 0 km2   Such was Cagney s enthusiasm for farming that when he was awarded an honorary degree from Rollins College  He surprised the staff by writing a paper on soil conservation  rather than just  turning up with Ava Gardner on my arm   as he put it  166  Cagney loved horses from childhood  when he would sit on the horses of local delivery riders and ride in horse drawn streetcars with his mother  He raised horses on his farms  specializing in Morgans  a breed of which he was particularly fond  168  Cagney was a keen sailor and owned boats on both coasts of the United States  169  although he occasionally experienced seasickness sometimes not being stricken in a heavy sea  but becoming ill on a calm day  170  He also enjoyed painting  171  and claimed in his autobiography that he might have been happier as a painter than a movie star  if somewhat poorer  172  One of his teachers in later life was Sergei Bongart  who went on to own two of Cagney s paintings  Cagney refused to sell his paintings  considering himself an amateur  He signed and sold only one painting  which Johnny Carson bought to benefit a charity  171   edit  Political views In his autobiography  Cagney stated that as a young man he had no political views  since he was simply more concerned with where the next meal was coming from  173  Fanzines in the 1930s  however  described his politics as  radical   174  This somewhat exaggerated view was enhanced by his public contractual wranglings with Warners at the time  his joining of the Screen Actors Guild in 1933  and his involvement in the revolt against the so called Merriam tax  During the 1934 Californian gubernatorial campaign  this tax was levied by the studio heads  automatically taking a day s pay from their biggest earning stars and helping raise half a million dollars for Frank Merriam  Cagney  and Jean Harlow  refused to pay  175  176  He supported political activist and labor leader Thomas Mooney s defense fund  but was repelled by the behavior of some of Mooney s supporters at a rally  173  Around the same time  he gave money for a Spanish Republican Army ambulance during the Spanish Civil War  which he put down to being  a soft touch   an act which enhanced his liberal reputation  He also became involved in a  liberal group   with a leftist slant   along with Ronald Reagan  However  when he and Reagan saw the direction in which the group was heading  they resigned the same night  177  Cagney was accused of being a Communist sympathizer in 1934 and again in 1940  The 1934 accusation stemmed from a letter from a local Communist official found by police which alleged that Cagney would be bringing other Hollywood stars to meetings  Cagney denied this  and Lincoln Steffens  husband of the letter s writer  backed up this denial  asserting that the accusation stemmed solely from Cagney s donation to striking cotton workers in San Joaquin Valley  William Cagney claimed this donation was the root of the 1940 charges  178  Cagney was cleared by U S  Representative Martin Dies  Jr  on the House Un American Activities Committee  Cagney became president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1942 for a two year term  He took an active role in the Guild s fight against the Mafia  which had taken an active interest in the movie industry  Billie once received a phone call telling her that Cagney was dead  179  Cagney alleged that  having failed to scare him and the Guild off  they sent a hitman to kill him by dropping a heavy light onto his head  On hearing about the rumor of the hit  George Raft made a call  and the hit was supposedly canceled  179  180  During World War II  to raise money for war bonds  Cagney took part in racing exhibitions at the Roosevelt Raceway and sold seats for the premiere of Yankee Doodle Dandy  104  106  He also allowed the Army to practice maneuvers at his Martha s Vineyard farm  181  After the war  Cagney s politics started to change  He had worked on Democrat Franklin D  Roosevelt s presidential campaigns  including the 1940 presidential election against Wendell Willkie  However  by the time of the 1948 election  he had become disillusioned with Harry S  Truman  and voted for Thomas E  Dewey  his  first non Democratic vote   182  By 1980  Cagney was contributing financially to the Republican Party  supporting his friend Ronald Reagan s bid for the presidency in the 1980 election  183  As he got older  he became more and more conservative  referring to himself in his autobiography as  arch conservative   He regarded his move away from liberal politics as  a totally natural reaction once I began to see undisciplined elements in our country stimulating a breakdown of our system    Those functionless creatures  the hippies     just didn t appear out of a vacuum   184   edit  Honors and legacy In 1974  Cagney received the American Film Institute s Life Achievement Award  Charlton Heston  in announcing that Cagney was to be honored  called him  one of the most significant figures of a generation when American film was dominant  Cagney  that most American of actors  somehow communicated eloquently to audiences all over the world  and to actors as well   185  He received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1980  In 1984  Ronald Reagan awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom  Cagney was among Stanley Kubrick s favorite actors  186  and was considered by Orson Welles to be  maybe the greatest actor to ever appear in front of a camera   187  Warner Bros  would arrange private screenings of Cagney films for Winston Churchill
