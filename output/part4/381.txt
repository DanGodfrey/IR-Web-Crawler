have been historically established in most corners of the Mediterranean  but Greeks have always been centered around the Aegean Sea  where the Greek language has been spoken since antiquity  38  Until the early 20th century  Greeks were uniformly distributed between the Greek peninsula  the western coast of Asia Minor  Pontus  Egypt  Cyprus and Constantinople  many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of the ancient Greek colonization  39  In the aftermath of the Greco Turkish War  1919 1922   a large scale population exchange between Greece and Turkey transferred and confined Christians from Turkey  except Constantinople  effectively ethnic Greeks  into the borders of the modern Greek state and Cyprus  Other ethnic Greek populations can be found from southern Italy to the Caucasus and in diaspora communities in a number of other countries  Today  most Greeks are officially registered as members of the Greek Orthodox Church  40  Contents 1 History 1 1 Origins 1 2 Mycenaean 1 3 Classical 1 4 Hellenistic 1 5 Byzantine 1 6 Ottoman 1 7 Modern 2 Identity 2 1 Names

Georgiev  The Greeks speak the Greek language  which forms its own unique branch within the Indo European family of languages  the Hellenic language  38  They are part of a group of pre modern ethnicities  described by Anthony D  Smith as an  archetypal diaspora people   41  42  The modern Greek state was created in 1832  when the Greeks liberated a part of their historic homelands from the Ottoman Empire  43  The large Greek diaspora and merchant class were instrumental in transmitting the ideas of western romantic nationalism and philhellenism  44  which together with the conception of Hellenism  formulated during the last centuries of the Byzantine Empire  formed the basis of the Diafotismos and the current conception of Hellenism  45  46  47   edit  Origins Further information  Proto Greek language and List of Ancient Greek tribes The Proto Greeks probably arrived at the area now called Greece  in the southern tip of the Balkan peninsula  at the end of the 3rd millennium BC  48  49  a   though a later migration by sea from eastern Anatolia  modern Armenia  has also been suggested  50  The sequence of migrations into the Greek mainland during the 2nd millennium BC has to be reconstructed on the basis of the ancient Greek dialects  as they presented themselves centuries later and is subject to some uncertainties  There were at least two migrations  the first of the Ionians and Aeolians which resulted in Mycenaean Greece by the 16th century BC  38  51  and the second  the Dorian invasion  around the 11th century BC  displacing the Arcadocypriot dialects which descended from the Mycenaean period  Both migrations occur at incisive periods  the Mycenaean at the transition to the Late Bronze Age and the Doric at the Bronze Age collapse  There were some suggestions of three waves of migration indicating a Proto Ionian one  either contemporary or even earlier than the Mycenaean  This possibility appears to have been first suggested by Ernst Curtius in the 1880s  In current scholarship  the standard assumption is to group the Ionic together with the Arcadocypriot group as the successors of a single Middle Bronze Age migration in dual opposition to the  western  group of Doric   edit  Mycenaean Main article  Mycenaean Greece A Kouros  from the Archaic period  Archaeological Museum of Thebes  Greece  The Mycenaeans were ultimately the first Greek speaking people attested through historical sources  written records in the Linear B script  52  and through their literary echoes in the works of Homer  a few centuries later  The Mycenaeans quickly penetrated the Aegean Sea and by the 15th century BC had reached Rhodes  Crete  Cyprus  where Teucer is said to have founded the first colony  and the shores of Asia Minor  38  53  Around 1200 BC the Dorians  another Greek speaking people  followed from Epirus  54  Traditionally  historians have believed that the Dorian invasion caused the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization  but it is likely the main attack was made by seafaring raiders  sea peoples  who sailed into the eastern Mediterranean around 1180 BC  55  The Dorian invasion was followed by a poorly attested period of migrations  appropriately called the Greek Dark Ages  but by 800 BC the landscape of Archaic and Classical Greece was discernible  38  In the Homeric epics  the Greeks of prehistory are viewed as the ancestors of the early classical civilization of Homer s own time  56  while the Mycenaean pantheon included many of the divinities  e g  Zeus  Poseidon and Hades  attested in later Greek religion  57  58   edit  Classical Main article  Classical Greece Hoplites fighting  Detail from an Attic black figure hydria  ca  560 BC 550 BC  Louvre  Paris  The classical period of Greek civilization covers a time spanning from the early 5th century BC to the death of Alexander the Great  in 323 BC  some authors prefer to split this period into  Classical   from the end of the Persian wars to the end of the Peloponnesian War  and  Fourth Century   up to the death of Alexander   It is so named because it set the standards by which Greek civilization would be judged in later eras  59  The ethnogenesis of the Greek nation is marked  according to some scholars  by the first Olympic Games in 776 BC  when the idea of a common Hellenism among the Greek speaking tribes was first translated into a shared cultural experience and Hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture  37  While the Greeks of the classical era understood themselves to belong to a common Greek genos their first loyalty was to their city and they saw nothing incongruous about warring  often brutally  with other Greek city states  The Peloponnesian War  the large scale Greek civil war between Athens and Sparta and their allies  is a case in point  60  Most of the feuding Greek city states were  in some scholars  opinions  united under the banner of Philip s and Alexander the Great s pan Hellenic ideals  though others might generally opt  rather  for an explanation of  Macedonian conquest for the sake of conquest  or at least conquest for the sake of riches  glory and power and view the  ideal  as useful propaganda directed towards the city states  61  In any case  Alexander s toppling of the Achaemenid Empire  after his victories at the battles of the Granicus  Issus and Gaugamela  and advance as far as modern day Pakistan and Tajikistan  62  provided an important outlet for Greek culture  via the creation of colonies and trade routes along the way  63  While the Alexandrian empire did not survive its creator s death intact  the cultural implications of the spread of Hellenism across much of the Middle East and Asia were to prove long lived as Greek became the lingua franca  a position it retained even in Roman times  64  Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria  Antioch  Seleucia and many other new Hellenistic cities founded in Alexander s wake  65  Two thousand years later  there are still communities in Pakistan and Afghanistan  like the Kalash  who claim to be descended from Greek settlers  66   edit  Hellenistic Main article  Hellenistic Greece The major Hellenistic realms  the

which are usually placed at Alexander s death  67  This Hellenistic age  so called because it saw the partial Hellenization of many non Greek cultures  68  lasted until the conquest of Egypt by Rome in 30 BC  67  This age saw the Greeks move towards larger cities and a reduction in the importance of the city state  These larger cities were parts of the still larger Kingdoms of the Diadochi  69  70  Greeks  however  remained aware of their past  chiefly through the study of the works of Homer and the classical authors  71  An important factor in maintaining Greek identity was contact with barbarian  non Greek  peoples which was deepened in the new cosmopolitan environment of the multi ethnic Hellenistic kingdoms  This led to a strong desire among Greeks to organize the transmission of the Hellenic paideia to the next generation  71  In the religious sphere  this was a period of profound change  The spiritual revolution that took place saw a waning of the old Greek religion  whose decline beginning in the 3rd century BC continued with the introduction of new religious movements from the East  37  The cults of deities like Isis and Mithra were introduced into the Greek world  70  72  In the Indo Greek and Greco Bactrian kingdoms  Greco Buddhism was spreading and Greek missionaries would play an important role in propagating it to China  73  Further east  the Greeks of Alexandria Eschate became known to the Chinese people as the Dayuan  74   edit  Byzantine Main article  Byzantine Greeks Statues of Saints Cyril and Methodius  missionaries of Christianity among the Slavic peoples  on the Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc  Czech Republic  Of the new eastern religions introduced into the Greek world the most successful was Christianity  While ethnic distinctions still existed in the Roman Empire  they became secondary to religious considerations and the renewed empire used Christianity as a tool to support its cohesion and promoted a robust Roman national identity  75  Concurrently the secular  urban civilization of late antiquity survived in the Eastern Mediterranean along with Greco Roman educational system  although it was from Christianity that the culture s essential values were drawn  76   Much of what we know of antiquity   especially of Hellenic and Roman literature and of Roman law   would have been lost for ever but for the scholars and scribes and copyists of Constantinople   J J  Norwich 77  The Eastern Roman Empire   today conventionally named the Byzantine Empire  a name not in use during its own time 78    became increasingly influenced by Greek culture after the 7th century  when Emperor Heraclius  AD 575   641  decided to make Greek the empire s official language  79  80  Certainly from then on  but likely earlier  the Roman and Greek cultures were virtually fused into a single Greco Roman world  Although the Latin West recognized the Eastern Empire s claim to the Roman legacy for several centuries  after Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne  king of the Franks  as the  Roman Emperor  on December 25  800  an act which eventually led to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire  the Latin West started to favour the Franks and began to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire largely as the Empire of the Greeks  Imperium Graecorum   81  Greek speakers at the time  however  referred to themselves as Romaioi   Romans    78  These Byzantine Greeks were largely responsible for the preservation of the literature of the classical era  76  77  82 Byzantine grammarians were those principally responsible for carrying  in person and in writing  ancient Greek grammatical and literary studies to the West during the 15th century  giving the Italian Renaissance a major boost  83  84  The Aristotelian philosophical tradition was nearly unbroken in the Greek world for almost two thousand years  until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453  85  To the Slavic world  Roman era Greeks contributed by the dissemination of literacy and Christianity  The most notable example of the later was the work of the two Greek brothers Saints Cyril and Methodius from Thessaloniki  who are credited today with formalizing the first Slavic alphabet  86  A distinct Greek political identity re emerged in the 11th century in educated circles and became more forceful after the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade in 1204  so that when the empire was revived in 1261  it became in many ways a Greek national state  45  That new notion of nationhood engendered a deep interest in the classical past culminating in the ideas of the Neoplatonist philosopher Gemistus Pletho  who abandoned Christianity  45  However  it was the combination of Orthodox Christianity with a specifically Greek identity that shaped the Greeks  notion of themselves in the empire s twilight years  45   edit  Ottoman Main article  Ottoman Greeks Engraving of a Greek merchant by Cesare Vecellio  16th century   Following the Fall of Constantinople on May 29  1453  many Greeks sought better employment and education opportunities by leaving for the West  particularly Italy  Central Europe  Germany and Russia  83  For those that remained under the Ottoman Empire s millet system  religion was the defining characteristic of national groups  milletler   so the exonym  Greeks   Rumlar from the name Rhomaioi  was applied by the Ottomans to all members of the Orthodox Church  regardless of their language or ethnic origin  46  The Greek speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves Romioi  87   as opposed to being so named by others  and  at least those educated  considered their ethnicity  genos  to be Hellenic  88  The roots of Greek success in the Ottoman Empire can be traced to the Greek tradition of education and commerce  89  It was the wealth of the extensive merchant class that provided the material basis for the intellectual revival that was the prominent feature of Greek life in the half century and more leading to the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821  44  Not coincidentally  on the eve of 1821  the three most important centres of Greek learning were situated in Chios  Smyrna and Aivali  all three major centres of Greek commerce  44   edit  Modern Main article  Greece The cover of Hermes o Logios  a Greek literary publication of the late 18th and early 19th century  The relationship between ethnic Greek identity and Greek Orthodox religion continued after the creation of the Modern Greek state in 1830  According to the second article of the first Greek constitution of 1822  a Greek was defined as any Christian resident of the Kingdom of Greece  a clause removed by 1840  90  A century later  when the Treaty of Lausanne was signed between Greece and Turkey in 1923  the two countries agreed to use religion as the determinant for ethnic identity for the purposes of population exchange  although most of the Greeks displaced  over a million of the total 1 5 million  had already been driven out by the time the agreement was signed  N 1  91  92  93  94  The Greek genocide  contemporaneous with the failed Greek Asia Minor Campaign  was part of this process of turkification of the Ottoman Empire and the placement of its economy and trade  then largely in Greek hands under ethnic Turkish control  95  While most Greeks today are descended from Greek speaking Romioi  Roman  there are sizeable groups of ethnic Greeks who trace their descent to Aromanian speaking Vlachs and Albanian speaking Arvanites as well as Slavophones and Turkish

identified with membership to a Greek state  99  By Western standards  the term Greeks has traditionally referred to any native speakers of the Greek language  whether Mycenaean  Byzantine or modern Greek  46  100 Byzantine Greeks called themselves Romioi and considered themselves the political heirs of Rome  but at least by the 12th century a growing number of those educated  deemed themselves the heirs of ancient Greece as well  although for most of the Greek speakers   Hellene  still meant pagan  101  On the eve of the Fall of Constantinople the Last Emperor urged his soldiers to remember that they were the descendants of Greeks and Romans  102  Before the establishment of the Modern Greek state  the link between ancient and modern Greeks was emphasized by the scholars of Greek Enlightenment especially by Rigas Feraios  In his  Political Constitution   he addresses to the nation as  the people descendant of the Greeks   103  The Greeks today are a nation in the meaning of an ethnos  defined by possessing Greek culture and having a Greek mother tongue  not by citizenship  race  and religion or by being subjects of any particular state  104  In ancient and medieval times and to a lesser extent today the Greek term was genos  which also indicates a common ancestry  105  106   edit  Names Main article  Names of the Greeks Map showing ancient regions of central Greece in relation to geographical features  Throughout the centuries  Greeks and Greek speakers have been known by a number of names  including  Hellenes   Homer refers to the  Hellenes  as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia  with its warriors under the command of Achilleus  107  The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks            108  In Greek mythology  Hellen  the patriarch of Hellenes  was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion  who ruled around Phthia  the only survivors after the great deluge  109  It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin  Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an area in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river  the location of the great deluge of Deucalion  a land occupied by the Selloi and the  Greeks  who later came to be known as  Hellenes   110  Selloi were the priests of Dodonian Zeus 111  and the word probably means  sacrificers   compare Gothic saljan   present  sacrifice    There is currently no satisfactory etymology of the name Hellenes  Some scholars assert that the name Selloi changed to Sellanes and then to Hellanes Hellenes  112  113  However this etymology connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain  The name Hellenes seems to be older and it was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League  This was an ancient association of Greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of Apollo in Delphi  Phocis  and of Demeter near Thermopylae  Locris   114  According to the legend it was founded after the Trojan War by the eponymous Amphictyon  brother of Hellen  Greeks             In the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women  Graecus is presented as the son of Zeus and Pandora II  sister of Hellen the patriarch of Hellenes  115  Hellen was the son of Deucalion who ruled around Phthia in central Greece The Parian Chronicle mentions that when Deucalion became king of Phthia the previously called Graikoi were named Hellenes  Aristotle notes that the Hellenes were related with Grai Greeks  Meteorologica I xiv  a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus which was used by the Illyrians He also claims that the great deluge must have occurred in the region around Dodona where the Selloi dwelt However according to the Greek tradition it is more possible that the homeland of the Greeks was originally in central Greece  A modern theory derives the name Greek  Lt  Graeci  from Graecos inhabitant of Graia  or Graea          a town on the coast of Boeotia  Greek colonists from Graia helped to found Cumae  900 BC  in Italy where they were called Graeces When the Romans encountered them they used this name for the colonists and then for all Greeks  Graeci  116  In Greek  graia         means  old woman  and is derived from the PIE root  gere   to grow old  117  118  in Proto Greek guraj   old age  and later  gift of honour   Mycenean  kera  geras    and grau j   old lady   119  The Germanic languages borrowed the word Greeks with an initial  k  sound which probably was their initial sound closest to the Latin  g  at the time  Goth  Kreks   The area out of ancient Attica including Boeotia was called Graiki and is connected with the older deluge of Ogyges 120  the mythological ruler of Boeotia  The region was originally occupied by the Minyans who were autochthonous or Proto Greek speaking people  121  In ancient Greek the name Ogygios came to mean  from earliest days   122  Achaeans            Homer uses the terms Achaeans and Danaans as a generic term for Greeks in Iliad  123  and they were probably a part of the Mycenean civilization  The names Achaioi and Danaoi seem to be pre Dorian belonging to the people who were overthrown  They were forced to the region that later bore the name Achaea after the Dorian invasion  124  In the 5th century BC they were redefined as contemporary speakers of Aeolic Greek which was spoken mainly in Thessaly  Boetia and Lesbos  There are many controversial theories on the origin of the Achaeans  According to one view  the Achaeans were one of the fair headed tribes of upper Europe  who pressed down over the Alps during the early Iron age  1300 BC  to southern Europe  125  Another theory suggests that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans  126  These theories are rejected by other scholars who  based on linguistic criteria  suggest that the Achaeans were mainland pre Dorian Greeks  127  There is also the theory that there was an Achaean ethnos that migrated from Asia minor to lower Thessaly prior to 2000 BC  128  Some Hittite texts mention a nation lying to the west called Ahhiyava or Ahhiya  129  Egyptian documents are referring to Ekwesh  one of the groups of sea peoples who attached Egypt during the reign of Merneptah  1213 1203 BCE   who may have been Achaeans  130  Danaans or Danaoi          and Argives            In Homer s Iliad  the names Danaans and Argives are used to designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans  The myth of Danaus  whose origin is Egypt  is a foundation legend of Argos  His daughters Danaides  were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom  This myth is connected with a task that can never be never be fullfilled  Sisyphos  and the name can be derived from the PIE root  danu   river   131  132  There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin  Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen  one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III  1187 1156 BCE   133  The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans  The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia  Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization  These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash  or Weshesh  who may be Achaeans  134  They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters  135 Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root da     flow  river   da  nu   any moving liquid  drops   da  navo  people living by the river  Skyth

Archaeological Museum  Athens  The most obvious link between modern and ancient Greeks is their language  which has a documented tradition from at least the 14th century BC to the present day  albeit with a break during the Greek Dark Ages  138  Scholars compare its continuity of tradition to Chinese alone  138  139  Since its inception  Hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture 37  and the national continuity of the Greek world is a lot more certain than its demographic  140  Yet  Hellenism also embodied an ancestral dimension through aspects of Athenian literature that developed and influenced ideas of descent based on autochthony  141  During the later years of the Eastern Roman Empire  areas such as Ionia and Constantinople experienced a Hellenic revival in language  philosophy  and literature and on classical models of thought and scholarship  140  This revival provided a powerful impetus to the sense of cultural affinity with ancient Greece and its classical heritage  140  The cultural changes undergone by the Greeks are  despite a surviving common sense of ethnicity  undeniable  140  At the same time  the Greeks have retained their language and alphabet  certain values  customs  a sense of religious and cultural difference and exclusion   the word barbarian was used by 12th century historian Anna Komnene to describe non Greek speakers   142  a sense

population  144  and the Republic of Cyprus where they make up 78  of the island s population  excluding Turkish settlers in the occupied part of the country   145  Greek populations have not traditionally exhibited high rates of growth  nonetheless  the population of Greece has shown regular increase since the country s first census in 1828  146  A large percentage of the population growth since the state s foundation has resulted from annexation of new territories and the influx of 1 5 million Greek refugees after the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey  146  About 80  of the population of Greece is urban  with 28  concentrated in the city of Athens 147  Greeks from Cyprus have a similar history of emigration  usually to the English speaking world because of the island s colonization by the British Empire  Waves of emigration followed the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974  while the population decreased between mid 1974 and 1977 as a result of emigration  war losses  and a temporary decline in fertility  148  After the ethnic cleansing of a third of the Greek population of the island in 1974  149  150  151  152  153  there was also an increase in the number of Greek Cypriots leaving  especially for the Middle East  which contributed to a decrease in population that tapered off in the 1990s  148  Today more than two thirds of the Greek population in Cyprus is urban  148  There is a sizeable Greek minority of about 105 000 people  in Albania  154  The Greek minority of Turkey  which numbered upwards of 200 000 people after the 1923 exchange  has now dwindled to a few thousand  after the 1955 Constantinople Pogrom and other state sponsored violence and discrimination  155  This effectively ended  though not entirely  the

George Prevelakis of Sorbonne University  the number is closer to just below 5 million  160  Integration  intermarriage  and loss of the Greek language influence the self identification of the Omogeneia  Important centres of the New Greek Diaspora today are London  New York  Melbourne and Toronto  158  Recently  the Hellenic Parliament passed a law that enables Diaspora Greeks to vote in the elections of the Greek state  161   edit  Ancient Greek colonization in antiquity  In ancient times  the trading and colonizing activities of the Greek tribes and city states spread the Greek culture  religion and language around the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins  especially in Sicily and southern Italy  also known as Magna Grecia  Spain  the south of France and the Black sea coasts  162  Under Alexander the Great s empire and successor states  Greek and Hellenizing ruling classes were established in the Middle East  India and in Egypt  162  The Hellenistic period is characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization that established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa  163  Under the Roman Empire  easier movement of people spread Greeks across the Empire and in the eastern territories  Greek became the lingua franca rather than Latin  79  The modern day Griko community of southern Italy  numbering about 60 000  16  17  may represent a living remnant of the ancient Greek populations of Italy   edit  Modern During and after the Greek War of Independence  Greeks of the diaspora were important in establishing the fledgling state  raising funds and awareness abroad  164  Greek merchant families already had contacts in other countries and during the disturbances many set up home around the Mediterranean  notably Marseilles in France  Livorno in Italy  Alexandria in Egypt   Russia  Odessa and Saint Petersburg   and Britain  London and Liverpool  from where they traded  typically in textiles and grain  165  Businesses frequently comprised the extended family  and with them they brought schools teaching Greek and the Greek Orthodox Church  165  Greek Diaspora  20th century   As markets changed and they became more established  some families grew their operations to become shippers  financed through the local Greek community  notably with the aid of the Ralli or Vagliano Brothers  166  With economic success  the Diaspora expanded further across the Levant  North Africa  India and the USA  166  167  In the 20th century  many Greeks left their traditional homelands for economic reasons resulting in large migrations from Greece and Cyprus to the United States  Great Britain  Australia  Canada  Germany  and South Africa  especially after the Second World War  1939 45   the Greek Civil War  1946 49   and the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus in 1974  168   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of Greece Greek culture has evolved over thousands of years  with its beginning in the Mycenaean civilization  continuing through the Classical period  the Roman and Eastern Roman periods and was profoundly affected by Christianity  which it in turn influenced and shaped  169  170 Ottoman Greeks had to endure through several centuries of adversity that culminated in genocide in the 20th century but nevertheless included cultural exchanges and enriched both cultures  171  172  173  174  175  The Diafotismos is credited with revitalizing Greek culture and giving birth to the synthesis of ancient and medieval elements that characterize it today  45  46   edit  Language Main article  Greek language Ancient Greek Ostracon bearing the name of Cimon  Museum of the Ancient Agora  Athens  Most Greeks speak the Greek language  an Indo European language that forms a branch itself  with its closest relations being Armenian  see Graeco Armenian  and the Indo Iranian languages  see Graeco Aryan   138  It has one of the longest documented histories of any language and Greek literature has a continuous history of over 2 500 years  176  Several notable literary works  including the Homeric epics  Euclid s Elements and the New Testament  were originally written in Greek  Greek demonstrates several linguistic features that are shared with other Balkan languages  such as Albanian  Bulgarian and Eastern Romance languages  see Balkan sprachbund   and has absorbed many foreign words  primarily of Western European and Turkish origin  177  Because of the movements of Philhellenism and the Diafotismos in the 19th century  which emphasized the modern Greeks  ancient heritage  these foreign influences were excluded from official use via the creation of Katharevousa  a somewhat artificial form of Greek purged of all foreign influence and words  as the official language of the Greek state  In 1976  however  the Hellenic Parliament voted to make the spoken Dimotiki the official language  making Katharevousa obsolete  178  Modern Greek has  in addition to Standard Modern Greek or Dimotiki  a wide variety of dialects of varying levels of mutual intelligibility  including Cypriot  Pontic  Cappadocian  Griko and Tsakonian  the only surviving representative of ancient Doric Greek   179 Yevanic is the language of the Romaniotes  and survives in small communities in Greece  New York and Israel  In addition to Greek  many Greeks in Greece and the Diaspora are bilingual in other languages or dialects such as English  Arvanitika  Aromanian  Macedonian Slavic  Russian and Turkish  138  180   edit  Religion Main articles  Religion in ancient Greece and Orthodox Church Papyrus 46 is one of the oldest extant New Testament manuscripts in Greek  written on papyrus  with its  most probable date  between 175 225  Most Greeks are Christians  belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church  During the first centuries after Jesus Christ  the New Testament was originally written in Koine Greek  which remains the liturgical language of the Greek Orthodox Church  and most of the early Christians and Church Fathers were Greek speaking  169  170  While the Orthodox Church was always intensely hostile to the ancient Greek religion  it did help Greeks keep their sense of identity during the Ottoman rule through its use of Greek in the liturgy and its modest educational efforts  181  There are small groups of ethnic Greeks adhering to other Christian denominations like Greek Catholics  Greek Evangelicals  Pentecostals  and groups adhering to other religions including Romaniot and Sephardic Jews and Greek Muslims  In particular  there are Greek Muslim communities in Tripoli  Lebanon   7 000 strong  and Al Hamidiyah in Syria  while there is a large community of indeterminate size in the Pontus region  who were spared of the population exchange because of their faith  182  About 2 000 Greeks are members of Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism congregations  183  184  185   edit  Art See also  Greek art  Ancient Greek theatre  Music of Greece  and Cinema of Greece El Greco s Assumption of the Virgin  1577 1579   Greek art has a long and varied history  Greeks have contributed to the visual  literary and performing arts  186  In the West  ancient Greek art was influential in shaping the Roman and later the modern western artistic heritage  Following the Renaissance in Europe  the humanist aesthetic and the high technical standards of Greek art inspired generations of European artists  186  Well into the 19th century  the classical tradition derived from Greece played an important role in the art of the western world  187  In the East  Alexander the Great s conquests initiated several centuries of exchange between Greek  Central Asian and Indian cultures  resulting in Greco Buddhist art  whose influence reached as far as Japan  188  Byzantine Greek art  which grew from classical art and adapted the pagan motifs in the service of Christianity  provided a stimulus to the art of many nations  189  Its influences can be traced from Venice in the West to Kazakhstan in the East  189  190  In turn  Greek art was influenced by eastern civilizations in classical antiquity and the new religion of Orthodox Christianity during Roman times  while modern Greek art is heavily influenced by western art  191  Notable modern Greek artists include Renaissance painter Dominikos Theotokopoulos  El Greco   Panagiotis Doxaras  Nikolaos Gyzis  Yannis Tsarouchis  Nikos Engonopoulos  Constantine Andreou  Jannis Kounellis  conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos  soprano Maria Callas  composers such as Mikis Theodorakis  Nikos Skalkottas  Iannis Xenakis  Manos Hatzidakis

Michael Cacoyannis and Theo Angelopoulos are among the most important directors   edit  Science See also  Greek mathematics  Greek philosophy  Ancient Greek medicine  Byzantine science  and Greek scholars in the Renaissance The Greeks of the Classical era made several notable contributions to science and helped lay the foundations of several western scientific traditions  like philosophy  historiography and mathematics  The scholarly tradition of the Greek academies was maintained during Roman times with several academic institutions in Constantinople  Antioch  Alexandria and other centres of Greek learning while Eastern Roman science was essentially a continuation of classical science  192  Greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in paideia  education   71 Paideia was one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world while the first European institution described as a university was founded in 5th century Constantinople and operated in various incarnations until the city s fall to the Ottomans in 1453  193  The University of Constantinople was Christian Europe s first secular institution of higher learning since no theological subjects were taught  194  and considering the original meaning of the world university as a corporation of students  the world s first university as well  193  As of 2007  Greece had the eighth highest percentage of tertiary enrollment in the world  with the percentages for female students being higher than for male  while Greeks of the Diaspora are equally active in the field of education  147  Hundreds of thousands of Greek students attend western universities every year while the faculty lists of leading Western universities contain a striking number of Greek names  195  Notable modern Greek scientists of modern times include Dimitrios Galanos  Georgios Papanikolaou  inventor of the Pap test   Nicholas Negroponte  Constantin Carath odory  Manolis Andronikos  Michael Dertouzos  John Argyris  Panagiotis Kondylis and Dimitri Nanopoulos   edit  Symbols See also  Flag of Greece The flag of the Greek Orthodox Church is based on the coat of arms of the Palaiologoi  the last dynasty of the Byzantine Empire  Traditional Greek flag  The most widely used symbol is the flag of Greece  which features nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white representing the nine syllables of the Greek national motto Eleftheria i thanatos  freedom or death   which was the motto of the Greek War of Independence  196  The blue square in the upper hoist side corner bears a white cross  which represents Greek Orthodoxy  The Greek flag is widely used by the Greek Cypriots  although Cyprus has officially adopted a neutral flag to ease ethnic tensions with the Turkish Cypriot minority   see flag of Cyprus   197  The pre 1978  and first  flag of Greece  which features a Greek cross  crux immissa quadrata  on a blue background  is widely used as an alternative to the official flag  and they are often flown together  The national emblem of Greece features a blue escutcheon with a white cross surrounded by two laurel branches  A common design involves the current flag of Greece and the pre 1978 flag of Greece with crossed flagpoles and the national emblem placed in front  198  Another highly recognizable and popular Greek symbol is the double headed eagle  the imperial emblem of the last dynasty of the Roman Empire and a common symbol in Asia Minor and  later  Eastern Europe  199  It is not part of the modern Greek flag or coat of arms  although it is officially the insignia of the Greek Army and the flag of the Church of Greece  It had been incorporated in the Greek coat of arms between 1925 and 1926  200   edit  Surnames See also  Greek name The Greeks were one of the first people in Europe to use surnames and these were widely in use by the 9th century supplanting the ancient tradition of using the father s name  however Greek surnames are most commonly patronymics  201  Commonly  Greek male surnames end in  s  which is the common ending for Greek masculine proper nouns in the nominative case  Exceptionally  some end in  ou  indicating the genitive case of this proper noun for patronymic reasons  202  Although surnames in mainland Greece are static today  dynamic and changing patronymic usage survives in middle names where the genitive of father s first name is commonly the middle name  this usage having been passed onto the Russians   In Cyprus  by contrast  surnames follow the ancient tradition of being given according to the father s name  203  204  205  Finally  in addition to Greek derived surnames many have Latin  Turkish and Italian origin  206  With respect to personal names  the two main influences are early Christianity and antiquity  The ancient names were never forgotten but have become more widely bestowed from the 18th century onwards  207   edit  Sea Main article  Greek shipping The traditional Greek homelands have been the Greek peninsula and the Aegean Sea  the Southern Italy  Magna Graecia   the Black Sea  the Ionian coasts of Asia Minor and the islands of Cyprus and Sicily  In Plato s Phaidon  Socrates remarks   we  Greeks  live like ants or frogs around a pond   208  This image is attested by the map of the Old Greek Diaspora  which corresponded to the Greek world until the creation of the Greek state in 1832  The sea and trade were natural outlets for Greeks since the Greek peninsula is rocky and does not offer good prospects for agriculture  37  Notable Greek seafarers include people such as Pytheas of Marseilles  Scylax of Caryanda who sailed to Iberia and beyond  Nearchus  the 6th century merchant and later monk Cosmas Indicopleustes  Cosmas who sailed to India  and the explorer of the Northwestern passage Juan de Fuca  209  210  211  212  In later times  the Romioi plied the sea lanes of the Mediterranean and controlled trade until an embargo imposed by the Roman Emperor on trade with the Caliphate opened the door for the later Italian pre eminence in trade  213  214  The Greek shipping tradition recovered during Ottoman rule when a substantial merchant middle class developed  which played an important part in the Greek War of Independence  45  Today  Greek shipping continues to prosper to the extent that Greece has the largest merchant fleet in the world  while many more ships under Greek ownership fly flags of convenience  147  The most notable shipping magnate of the 20th century was Aristotle Onassis  others being Yiannis Latsis  George Livanos  and Stavros Niarchos  215  216  A famous Greek poet of the 20th century was also a Chinese born seaman Nikos Kavvadias  217   edit  Timeline The history of the Greek people is closely associated with the history of Greece  Cyprus  Constantinople  Asia Minor and the Black Sea  During the Ottoman rule of Greece  a number of Greek enclaves around the Mediterranean were cut off from the core  notably in Southern Italy  the Caucasus  Syria and Egypt  By the early 20th century  over half of the overall Greek speaking population was settled in Asia Minor  now Turkey   while later that century a huge wave of migration to the United States  Australia  Canada and elsewhere created the modern Greek diaspora  Some key historical events have also been included for context  but this

there were two waves of immigrants and Robert Drews places the event as late as 1600 BC  219  220  A variety of more theories has also been supported  221  but there is a general consensus that the coming of the Greek tribes occurred around 2100 BC    While Greek authorities signed the agreement legalizing the population exchange this was done on the insistence of Mustafa Kemal Atat rk and after
