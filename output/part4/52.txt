issue American comic book limited series  identified as a  12 part maxi series   and crossover event  produced by DC Comics in 1985 to simplify its then 50 year old continuity  1  The series was written by Marv Wolfman and illustrated by George P rez  pencils layouts   2  along with Mike DeCarlo  Dick Giordano  and Jerry Ordway  who shared inking embellishing chores   The series removed the concept of the Multiverse in the fictional DC Universe  and depicted the deaths of such long standing superheroes as Supergirl and the Barry Allen incarnation of the Flash  As such  it is one of the most important events in the DC Universe  and continuity in the DCU is typically divided into pre Crisis and post Crisis periods  The title of the series was inspired by earlier crossover stories involving the multiple parallel Earths of the Multiverse  such as  Crisis on Earth Two  and  Crisis on Earth Three   but instead of lasting two to five issues and involving members from many superhero teams from many parallel worlds  it involved virtually every significant character from every parallel universe in DC s history  It in turn inspired the titles of four subsequent DC crossover series  Zero Hour  Crisis in Time  1994   Identity Crisis  2004   Infinite Crisis  2005 2006   and Final Crisis  2008   Contents 1 Overview 1 1 Continuity issues 1 2 Multiverse fixes 1 3 Crisis resolution 2

notorious for continuity problems  3  No character s back story within the comic books was entirely self consistent and reliable  For example  DC s oldest superhero character  Superman  the lone survivor of the destroyed planet Krypton  originally could not fly  he could instead leap over an eighth of a mile   and his powers came from having evolved on a planet with stronger gravity than Earth s  Soon  he was depicted as able to fly and his powers were explained as coming from our solar system s yellow sun  A more complex origin story was invented  In time  his career was altered to include early exploits as Superboy  More survivors of Krypton were introduced  including Supergirl  a dog named Krypto  the inhabitants of the bottled city of Kandor  and others  This further watered down the original concept  that the character was the sole survivor of his planet s destruction  Issues also arose regarding the ages of characters  Batman  an Earth born human without superpowers  retained his youth and vitality well into the 1980s despite having been an active hero during World War II  His sidekick  Robin  took over thirty years in real time to graduate from high school  Characters such as the Flash  the Atom  and Green Lantern often featured conflicting story lines  Origins and even powers differed between tales  depending on the writers   edit  Multiverse fixes Little attempt was made at first to offer in universe explanations of the conflicts  Problems of this sort began to be addressed in the 1961 story  Flash of Two Worlds   which featured a meeting between Barry Allen  the then currently published version of the Flash  and Jay Garrick  the version originally published by the company  The meeting was made possible by the introduction of the idea of two parallel worlds  Earth One  the contemporary DC Universe which had been depicted since the advent of the Silver Age  and Earth Two  the parallel world where the Golden Age events took place  and where the heroes who were active during that period had aged more or less realistically since that time  This idea was eventually expanded into the concept of a multiverse  including such worlds as Earth Three  which was an  opposite  world where heroes were villains and historical events happened in reverse of how they occurred in real life  e g   President John Wilkes Booth being assassinated by an actor named Abraham Lincoln   and Earth Prime  which was ostensibly the  real world  and used to explain how real life DC staffers  such as Julius Schwartz  could occasionally appear in comics stories  and so forth  If something happened outside current continuity  such as the so called  Imaginary Stories  that were a staple of DC s Silver Age publications   it was explained away as happening on a parallel world  a premise not dissimilar to the company s current Elseworlds imprint  citation needed  As the volume of published work within the DC Universe became larger and as the original stories of characters receded in time  the task of reconciling plot points grew  The burden of keeping track of differing versions of a variety of characters proved taxing for DC s writers  citation needed   edit  Crisis resolution Crisis was originally conceived to be a celebration of DC s 50th anniversary  however  Marv Wolfman and Len Wein saw it as a chance to clean up DC s rather convoluted continuity  which was thought to have put many new readers off buying DC titles  that had built up over time  The term  Crisis  was a word used frequently in DC Comics of the time  as it denoted an inter dimensional crossover  such as the yearly Justice League Justice Society crossovers that began with  Crisis on Earth One   citation needed  Wolfman came up with an idea that would reach across the entirety of the DC Universe and its half century of history  The groundwork for Crisis was laid over the year preceding its publication as one of the chief characters of the series  the Monitor  was introduced into various comics  In these original appearances  the Monitor was portrayed as a shadowy figure and a potential villain  His face was never shown  perhaps to imply that he might be an established DC villain  and his most common appearance was as a source of technology or information for various villains in the DC Universe  citation needed  The series was highly successful from a marketing standpoint  generating renewed interest in the company s books  enticing readers with the tagline that  the DC Universe will never be the same   Along with Alan Moore s Watchmen and Frank Miller s Batman  The Dark Knight Returns  it contributed to the commercial and creative revitalization of DC Comics after years of being dominated in the market by rival publisher Marvel Comics  citation needed  Crisis also helped popularize the formula of the line wide  crossover  comic book series  a concept deployed previously in Marvel s Contest of Champions  1983  and Secret Wars  1984   Since 1985  superhero publishers such as DC and Marvel have had frequent  summer crossover  series designed to tie many of their comic book titles together under a single storyline  citation needed   edit  Plot summary The Anti Monitor fights heroes from eight Earths  Cover to Crisis on Infinite Earths  12  Art by George P rez  The story introduces readers to two near omnipotent beings  the good Monitor and the evil Anti Monitor  who had been created as a result of the same experiment that created the Multiverse  The Monitor made cameo appearances in various DC comic book series for two years preceding the publication of the series  At first  he appears to be a new supervillain  but with the onset of the Crisis  he is revealed to be working on a desperate plan to save the entire Multiverse from destruction at the hands of the Anti Monitor  The Crisis series depicts the efforts of DC Comics  superheroes to stop the Anti Monitor s plan  Under the initial guidance of the Monitor  a select group of heroes is assigned to protect massive  tuning forks  designed to merge the surviving Earths into one that could be protected from the antimatter that has already annihilated untold numbers of alternate Earths  Eventually  the conflict grows and nearly every DC hero becomes involved in the battle  The Monitor is murdered by his own assistant  Harbinger  while one of her duplicates is temporarily possessed by one of the Anti Monitor s  shadow demons   However  he expects the attack and allows it to happen so that his death will release enough energy to protect the last five parallel Earths  the homes of the known DC Universe  long enough for the heroes to lead an assault on the Anti Monitor under the guidance of the Monitor s assistants  Harbinger  Alexander Luthor  Jr   and Pariah  The villain is forced to retreat  but at the cost of Supergirl s life  This lull in the war provides some breathing room for the heroes  but the various supervillains join forces under Brainiac  who murders Alexi Luthor of Earth Two for trying to take leadership  and Lex Luthor to conquer the Earths  while the Anti Monitor causes chaos on the Earths by forcing the Psycho Pirate to manipulate the emotions of their inhabitants  The Flash  Barry Allen  dies stopping the Anti Monitor s backup scheme of destruction to use an antimatter cannon to penetrate the protective aura  The Spectre halts the hero villain conflict  warning that the Anti Monitor is traveling to the beginning of time to prevent the Multiverse s creation  Heroes and villains join forces in response  with the heroes traveling to stop the Anti Monitor  and the villains traveling to the planet Oa in antiquity to prevent the renegade scientist Krona from performing a historic experiment that would allow the Anti Monitor to succeed in his efforts  The villains fail  and Krona proceeds with his experiment  while the heroes support the Spectre  whose battle with the Anti Monitor creates an energy overload that shatters space and time  A single universe is created and all the superheroes return to a present day reality where the various elements of the five Earths were fused into one  with no one except the people present at the battle at the dawn of time remembering the original reality  The Anti Monitor attacks one last time  transporting Earth to the Anti Matter universe  and summons a massive horde of shadow demons  However  he falls to a carefully planned counter attack  culminating in a battle with Kal L  the Earth Two Superman   Alexander Luthor of Earth Three  and Superboy of Earth Prime  with some unexpected last second help from the New Gods  adversary  Darkseid  As the Anti Monitor crashes into a star and dies  Alex sends himself  Earth Two Superman  Earth Two Lois Lane  and Earth Prime Superboy into a paradise reality  The aftermath of the Crisis plays out a few pages later  including Wally West becoming the new Flash  The final page shows the Psycho Pirate  who was now imprisoned in Arkham Asylum  talking to himself in a monologue    I m the only one left who remembers the Infinite Earths  You see  I know the truth  I remember all that happened  and I m not going to forget  Worlds lived  worlds died  Nothing will ever be the same  But those were great days for me    I had a good friend in the good old days  really  He was the Anti Monitor  He was going to give me a world to rule  Now he s gone  too  But that s okay with me  You see  I like to remember the past because those were better times than now  I mean  I d rather live in the past than today  wouldn t you  I mean  nothing s ever certain anymore  Nothing s ever predictable like it used to be  These days    y you just never know who s going to die    and who s going to live     Psycho Pirate  Crisis on Infinite Earths  12  p  42   edit  Possible alternative ending According to George P rez in a Wizard magazine interview in 1994  Chris Claremont suggested that Superman of Earth One dies in the final battle with the Anti Monitor in issue  12  After the Anti Monitor was destroyed for good  Kal L from Earth Two realizes that he is now alone  without his Earth  without his Lois  and now the new single Earth is without a Superman  Then he remarks   Don t need this anymore   and brushes the white dye off his hair and other make up that he apparently used to make himself look aged  The other heroes are surprised by this and Kal L simply explains that he had stopped aging when he reached the peak of his powers  He returns with the other heroes to the new post Crisis Earth  taking the place of the Earth One Superman  If this idea had been used  then The Man of Steel would have marked the return of the  Original Super Hero   as Kal L  now switched to Kal El  begins his life on the post Crisis Earth  which is similar to his old life  but with distinct differences  Despite this  culture shock   Kal L endures and is given a new lease on life by being deposited back to the early days of the modern heroic age of the post Crisis Earth  4  However  this was discarded when the John Byrne version of The Man of Steel was planned   edit  Animal Man  of Grant Morrison  Roger Hayden  Psycho Pirate  shows up again in Grant Morrison s run on Animal Man  imprisoned in Arkham Asylum  He ends up releasing characters destroyed during the Crisis back into the world  Many of these characters come to realize that they are just characters in a comic book  After an intervention by Animal Man  Hayden  seemingly happy  fades away into nothingness due to the strain from releasing all the forgotten characters  removing him from reality and heading into Limbo  where DC characters go when not being written about  James Highwater  a Native American physicist  is left to wear the Medusa Mask and keep the forgotten worlds contained  The other staff members come to accept Highwater as a patient  not realizing anything is wrong  citation needed  Subsequent comics however  particularly major event crossovers  consistently ignored this  deploying the Psycho Pirate as if he were still Hayden even using him in a similar role to his original one in Infinite Crisis  citation needed   edit  Tie in issues All Star Squadron  50 56 Amethyst  vol  2   13 Batman  389 391 Blue Devil  17 19 DC Comics Presents  78   86 88   94 95

talk page   October 2010  Because of the extensive and substantial changes that Crisis on Infinite Earths implemented on many titles published by DC Comics  the series became a defining and critical moment in DC Comics  long standing continuity  Characters and other elements established before the series  especially those eliminated by it  were referred to as pre Crisis  while revised ones were considered post Crisis  As a result  the series and its events eventually became known simply as  The Crisis   an informal title that would persist among fans  readers  and even the DC editorial staff  for almost 20 years  However  with the advent of the 2005 2006 mini series Infinite Crisis  another continuity altering storyline  pre  or post Crisis alone is no longer a definitive identifier  it is now necessary to make clear which Crisis one is referring to  Recent terms have been adopted by both fans and DC Comics when referring to anything after Infinite Crisis  such as  post Infinite Crisis    One Year Later   or simply  New Earth   The terms  post CIE   referring to Crisis on Infinite Earths  and  post IC   referring to Infinite Crisis  have also been used to avoid confusion between the two storylines  Crisis was used by DC as an opportunity to wipe much of its slate clean and make major changes to many of their major revenue generating comic book series  Frank Miller s revamp of Batman with Batman  Year One  George P rez s relaunching of Wonder Woman in Gods and Mortals  and John Byrne s reboot of Superman in The Man of Steel all took place shortly following Crisis on Infinite Earths  and changed substantial elements of the characters  backstories  The Green Lantern title was also changed to Green Lantern Corps  chronicling the adventures of a group of Green Lanterns led by Hal Jordan and stationed on Earth  Several other titles which were not significantly retconned were taken in very different directions following Crisis  However  to give readers breathing room  these revamps were delayed for a year so that they could be tied into DC s next  big event  storyline   Legends   The Flash was relaunched starring a younger main character  the previous Flash s sidekick  Kid Flash  Wally West   The Justice League of America title was cancelled  to be replaced by a new series entitled simply Justice League  featuring a new cast drawn from what had been different universes in DC s pre Crisis multiverse  A new Suicide Squad title was launched  and Captain Marvel was given his own new mini series to establish his new post Crisis origin   edit  Acknowledgment of the Crisis Since Crisis on Infinite Earths created a new  singular universe with a new back history  the Crisis event itself  as told in the limited series  is obviously not part of it  Regardless  various  revised  DC Universe characters have often referenced a past event called  Crisis   In this history  many heroes opposed the Anti Monitor  who sought to destroy the  single  positive matter universe in favor of his anti matter universe  Supergirl did not die as she did not yet exist  but Barry Allen sacrificed his life to save the universe  5  The majority of DC Universe characters are unaware that the original  multiverse wide Crisis occurred  Although the characters who were present at the epic battle at the dawn of time  Crisis on Infinite Earths  10   Death at the Dawn of Time     Psycho Pirate  Lady Quark  Harbinger  and Pariah   were initially treated as exceptions  this idea did not stick  There have been occasional references to the event  A 2002 storyline in the Supergirl comic book saw the original pre Crisis Supergirl landing on post Crisis Earth  for example  and established that the Spectre  being able to see across dimensions and timelines  is aware that the Crisis occurred  In addition  Grant Morrison s run on Animal Man  heralded for its deconstruction of the concept of the comic book  initiated a  Second Crisis  in which characters such as the original Crime Syndicate of America from Earth Three came back to life thanks to the Medusa Mask owned by the Psycho Pirate  who remembered the original Crisis  Per Degaton is aware of the pre Crisis timeline  as he told the JSAs of the present and of 1951 that he would retcon them out of existence the same way the Huntress of Earth Two was  With the Fourth World existing outside the Multiverse proper  Darkseid has also acknowledged the events of the Crisis  Members of the Green Lantern Corps were also aware of the Crisis  even though none participated in the battle at the beginning of time  Corps member Ch p  the only Earth One character to have his timeline completely erased by the Crisis  was nonetheless recognized by his fellow Green Lanterns  6 John Constantine is also aware of the Crisis  as seen in Swamp Thing  vol  2   70  In the Planetary special Planetary Batman  Night on Earth  it was implied that Elijah Snow had somehow temporarily left the Wildstorm universe to witness the Crisis  Finally  during the Joker  Last Laugh crossover  the Joker refers to the lack of  anti matter auroras  and  blood red skies  during his rampage  declaring that  Every other crisis gets funky mood lighting    edit  Deaths during Crisis The death of Supergirl  Art by George P rez  The following DC characters were explicitly shown to have died during Crisis on Infinite Earths  Alexander Luthor  Sr  of Earth Three and wife Lois Lane Luthor Alexei Luthor of Earth Two Angle Man Anti Monitor Aquagirl  Tula  Bug Eyed Bandit Clayface  Matt Hagen  Crime Syndicate

continuity Lori Lemaris  death  She was reintroduced as not being wheelchair bound  but with a more rational  leg changing  ability  according to situations  The Crime Syndicate was brought back three times  First as Qwardians the Justice League fought years ago  7  then post Zero Hour as people from the Earth of the Antimatter Universe  8  and finally as the Crime Society of America in 52 and Countdown 9  10  11  12  13  James Robinson s Starman comics revealed that Prince Gavyn s spirit actually survived and bonded with the superhero Will Payton  Wonder Woman of Earth One was revealed to have not died  but instead sent backwards through time  de aging in the process until she reverted to the clay she was originally sculpted from  and spread over Paradise Island  this laid the groundwork for George Perez s reintroduction of Wonder Woman in the post Crisis continuity   Psimon was resurrected  Mark Merlin  human host of Prince Ra Man  did not die along with him  being instead  freed  from his possession  After the events of Infinite Crisis and 52  Earth Two  albeit a different version  was resurrected with many of the characters that had died in Crisis alive and well on the new Earth Two  Twenty three years after his landmark death in the original Crisis  Barry Allen returned to the DC Universe on the last page of Grant Morrison s Final Crisis  2   edit  New characters and changes Several new characters were introduced in Crisis  The Monitor s assistant  Harbinger  and scientist Pariah played major roles in the story  Lady Quark was introduced as a survivor of one of the destroyed worlds  A new Doctor Light  this time heroic and female  was introduced  The former Charlton Comics characters   notably Blue Beetle II   were introduced to the DC Universe  After the Crisis  former Kid Flash Wally West took over the mantle of his predecessor  the Flash  Jonah Hex was transported to a post apocalyptic future  but this did not prove popular and subsequent stories brought him back to the Wild West  The JSA member Wildcat was briefly replaced by his god daughter  Yolanda Montez  The Guardians of the Universe departed for an unknown dimension  and the Green Lantern Corps was reorganized  with Hal Jordan leading a team of Green Lanterns based on Earth   edit  Continuing continuity issues This section may contain original research  Please

made in the wake of Crisis were not implemented consistently  The series was published over the course of a year  with ongoing series continuing simultaneously  In addition  several stories set in the previous continuity were published following the series  final issue  Initially  characters who were present at the final battle at the dawn of time remembered their original histories until their post Crisis histories were fully established  a process that sometimes required years to completely play out  Furthermore  revamped or relaunched versions of titles debuted at different times  with DC continuing to feature old versions of characters until new versions were launched  sometimes a year or more later  As a consequence  a series intended to streamline DC continuity introduced additional complexities  citation needed  Several characters such as Hawkman  Donna Troy  and Power Girl saw their origins complicated by the changes implemented by the Crisis and the various reboots of characters  The Superman line saw particular continuity issues regarding its supporting cast  In an effort to return Superman to his special status as the  last son of Krypton  DC had used the Crisis and the Man of Steel limited series to eliminate most of the Kryptonian supporting characters  For Supergirl this was not a major problem initially since the character had died in the Crisis  However  later writers would bring the character back using various explanations ranging from her being a shapeshifting alien to her being an angel  Power Girl  originally introduced as a cousin of Superman still existed however  With the mandate to reduce the number of Kryptonians in the DCU  her origin was changed to being a descendant of ancient Atlanteans who mistakenly believed herself to be Superman s cousin  Donna Troy s origin was similarly complicated by Crisis  Originally she had been an orphan who Wonder Woman raised on Paradise Island  However  Crisis had eliminated Wonder Woman from history  the character would not debut in the new DC Universe until the next year  Her origin was therefore rewritten to involve the Greek Titans  Other inconsistencies include  Action Comics  590  The narrator recounts exactly how Chemo is destroyed on Earth 4 by the Negative Woman in Crisis on Infinite Earths  9  stating   Weeks ago on a parallel earth that no longer exists   and goes on to specify how he survived when all the Earths merged into one single Earth at the end of the Crisis  Superman  8  Superman was referred to mistakenly as Superboy  the young Clark Kent from the Time Trapper s pocket universe  by the Legion of Super Heroes  He recalls meeting a Superboy  Earth Prime  during the Crisis and that he was not around long enough to make any enemies  The problem is that the Earth Prime Superboy should not be remembered  Legion of Super Heroes  38  During the mourning of Superboy  a statue of Supergirl is seen  The statue  like the others in the background  is made in dedication to fallen Legionnaires  The Supergirl statue would be removed by issue  51 when DC enforced her nonexistent status  The Crisis had also been intended to eliminate the multi verse  All stories were now supposed to be set on a unified new Earth  However  as time went on many creators found the idea of alternate universes and timelines to be too interesting to abandon   edit  Relationship to other crises At the 2008 New York Comic Con  Dan DiDio described how Crisis on Infinite Earths was the first of a trilogy of  Crisis  limited series that showed different stages in the development of the DC Multiverse  14 Crisis on Infinite Earths represented the  death of the multiverse   Infinite Crisis  the  rebuilding of the multiverse   and Final Crisis  the  final saga of the multiverse    edit  Spin offs There have been a number of spin offs and tie ins   edit  Legends of the DC Universe  Crisis on Infinite Earths An untold story from Crisis on Infinite Earths was published in February 1999 as a special in Legends of the DC Universe  Crisis on Infinite Earths  1  written by Crisis writer Marv Wolfman  with art by Paul Ryan and Bob McLeod  It took place during and after Crisis on Infinite Earths  4  It featured the first and only appearance of Earth D  The Flash of Earth D  Tanaka Rei  was a Japanese man who idolized Barry Allen  whose stories only existed in comic books  Rei was inspired by Allen to become the Flash  much like Allen was inspired to become the Flash by his idol  Jay Garrick  Allen and Rei met during the Crisis on Infinite Earths when Barry was coming back from the 30th century and arrived in the wrong universe  As that earth was under attack by the shadow demons  Barry called on the Justice League and Rei called on the Justice Alliance  his world s version of the Justice League  They built a cosmic treadmill and made an evacuation  The Justice League left  but 39 seconds later  Earth D perished   edit  Action figures To commemorate the 20th anniversary of Crisis on Infinite Earths  DC Direct issued a series of Crisis action figures  However  due to quality control problems  DC Direct recalled the toys and asked retailers to cut off the heads and ship them back to DC Direct  They were re released on June 28  2006  The first wave included action figure representations of Earth 2 Robin  Supergirl  the Monitor  Harbinger  and Psycho Pirate  The second wave included action figure representations of the Flash  Barry Allen   Earth 2 Superman  the Anti Monitor  Lex Luthor  and Brainiac  The third and final wave

Earths are repeated in JLA Avengers  written by Kurt Busiek and pencilled  as was Crisis  by George P rez  In the Justice League episode  A Better World  Part 1   an alternate Martian Manhunter lures the Justice League into a trap by deploying a similar story  The part that can be heard is      and the dimensions appear to be collapsing on each other     and      perhaps by combining our forces
