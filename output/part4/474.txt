a soft  fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll  or protective capsule  around the seeds of cotton plants of the genus Gossypium  The fiber is almost pure cellulose  The botanical purpose of cotton fiber is to aid in seed dispersal  The plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world  including the Americas  Africa  and India  The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico  followed by Australia and Africa  1  Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds  The English name derives from the Arabic  al  qutn        which began to be used circa 1400 AD  2  The fiber most often is spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft  breathable textile  The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times  fragments of cotton fabric dated from 5000 BC have been excavated in Mexico and Pakistan  Although cultivated since antiquity  it was the invention of the cotton gin that so lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use  and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today  Current estimates for world production are about 25 million tonnes annually  accounting for 2 5  of the world s arable land  China is the world s largest producer of cotton  but most of this is used domestically  The United States has been the largest exporter for many years  3  Contents 1 Types of

two New World cotton species account for the vast majority of modern cotton production  but the two Old World species were widely used before the 1900s  While cotton fibers occur naturally in colors of white  brown  and green  fears of contaminating the genetics of white cotton have led many cotton growing locations to ban growing of colored cotton varieties which remain a specialty product   edit  History Main article  History of cotton Cotton plants as imagined and drawn by John Mandeville in the 14th century Cotton was first cultivated in the Old World 7 000 years ago  5th millennium BC   by the inhabitants of western Pakistan  for example as the site of Mehrgarh where early cotton thread has been preserved in copper beads  4  Cotton cultivation became more widespread during the Indus Valley Civilization  which covered a huge swath of the northwestern part of the South Asia  comprising today parts of eastern Pakistan and northwestern India  5  The Indus cotton industry was well developed and some methods used in cotton spinning and fabrication continued to be used until the modern industrialization of India  6  Between 2000 and 1000 BC cotton became widespread in much of India  7  For example  it has been found at the site of Hallus in Karnataka around 1000 BC  Well before the Common Era  the use of cotton textiles had spread from India to the Mediterranean and beyond  8  Cotton fabrics discovered in a cave near Tehuac n  Mexico have been dated to around 5800 BC  although it is difficult to know for certain due to fiber decay  9  Other sources date the domestication of cotton in Mexico to approximately 5000 to 3000 BC  10  The Greeks and the Arabs were not familiar with cotton until the Wars of Alexander the Great  as his contemporary Megasthenes told Seleucus I Nicator of  there being trees on which wool grows  in  Indica   According to the Columbia Encyclopedia  8  Cotton has been spun  woven  and dyed since prehistoric times  It clothed the people of ancient India  Egypt  and China  Hundreds of years before the Christian era  cotton textiles were woven in India with matchless skill  and their use spread to the Mediterranean countries  In Iran  Persia   the history of cotton dates back to the Achaemenid era  5th century BC   however  there are few sources about the planting of cotton in pre Islamic Iran  The planting of cotton was common in Merv  Ray and Pars of Iran  In the poems of Persian poets  especially Ferdowsi s Shahname  there are references to cotton   panbe  in Persian   Marco Polo  13th century  refers to the major products of Persia  including cotton  John Chardin  a French traveler of 17th century  who had visited the Safavid Persia  has approved the vast cotton farms of Persia  11  During the Han dynasty  cotton was grown by non Chinese peoples in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan  12  In Peru  cultivation of the indigenous cotton species Gossypium barbadense was the backbone of the development of coastal cultures  such as the Norte Chico  Moche and Nazca  Cotton was grown upriver  made into nets and traded with fishing villages along the coast for large supplies of fish  The Spanish who came to Mexico and Peru in the early 16th century found the people growing cotton and wearing clothing made of it  During the late medieval period  cotton became known as an imported fiber in northern Europe  without any knowledge of how it was derived  other than that it was a plant  noting its similarities to wool  people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant borne sheep  John Mandeville  writing in 1350  stated as fact the now preposterous belief   There grew there  India  a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs on the endes of its branches  These branches were so pliable that they bent down to allow the lambs to feed when they are hungrie  sic     See Vegetable Lamb of Tartary   This aspect is retained in the name for cotton in many European languages  such as German Baumwolle  which translates as  tree wool   Baum means  tree   Wolle means  wool    By the end of the 16th century  cotton was cultivated throughout the warmer regions in Asia and the Americas  The Vegetable Lamb of Tartary India s cotton processing sector gradually declined during British expansion in India and the establishment of colonial rule during the late 18th and early 19th centuries  This was largely due to aggressive colonialist mercantile policies of the British East India Company  which made cotton processing and manufacturing workshops in India uncompetitive  Indian markets were increasingly forced to supply only raw cotton and were forced  by British imposed law  to purchase manufactured textiles from Britain   edit  Industrial Revolution in Britain The advent of the Industrial Revolution in Britain provided a great boost to cotton manufacture  as textiles emerged as Britain s leading export  In 1738  Lewis Paul and John Wyatt  of Birmingham  England  patented the roller spinning machine  and the flyer and bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds  Later  the invention of the spinning jenny in 1764 and Richard Arkwright s spinning frame  based on the roller spinning machine  in 1769 enabled British weavers to produce cotton yarn and cloth at much higher rates  From the late 18th century onwards  the British city of Manchester acquired the nickname  Cottonopolis  due to the cotton industry s omnipresence within the city  and Manchester s role as the heart of the global cotton trade  Production capacity in Britain and the United States was improved by the invention of the cotton gin by the American Eli Whitney in 1793  Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were  at first  purchased from colonial plantations  processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire  and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa  India  and China  via Shanghai and Hong Kong   By the 1840s  India was no longer capable of supplying the vast quantities of cotton fibers needed by mechanized British factories  while shipping bulky  low price cotton from India to Britain was time consuming and expensive  This  coupled with the emergence of American cotton as a superior type  due to the longer  stronger fibers of the two domesticated native American species  Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense   encouraged British traders to purchase cotton from plantations in the United States and the Caribbean  By the mid 19th century   King Cotton  had become the backbone of the southern American economy  In the United States  cultivating and harvesting cotton became the leading occupation of slaves  During the American Civil War  American cotton exports slumped due to a Union blockade on Southern ports  also because of a strategic decision by the Confederate government to cut exports  hoping to force Britain to recognize the Confederacy or enter the war  prompting the main purchasers of cotton  Britain and France to turn to Egyptian cotton  British and French traders invested heavily in cotton plantations and the Egyptian government of Viceroy Isma il took out substantial loans from European bankers and stock exchanges  After the American Civil War ended in 1865  British and French traders abandoned Egyptian cotton and returned to cheap American exports  sending Egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country declaring bankruptcy in 1876  a key factor behind Egypt s occupation by the British Empire in 1882  Prisoners farming cotton under the trusty system in Parchman Farm  Mississippi  1911 Picking cotton in Georgia  United States  in 1943 During this time  cotton cultivation in the British Empire  especially India  greatly increased to replace the lost production of the American South  Through tariffs and other restrictions  the British government discouraged the production of cotton cloth in India  rather  the raw fiber was sent to England for processing  The Indian Mahatma Gandhi described the process  English people buy Indian cotton in the field  picked by Indian labor at seven cents a day  through an optional monopoly  This cotton is shipped on British ships  a three week journey across the Indian Ocean  down the Red Sea  across the Mediterranean  through Gibraltar  across the Bay of Biscay and the Atlantic Ocean to London  One hundred per cent profit on this freight is regarded as small  The cotton is turned into cloth in Lancashire  You pay shilling wages instead of Indian pennies to your workers  The English worker not only has the advantage of better wages  but the steel companies of England get the profit of building the factories and machines  Wages  profits  all these are spent in England  The finished product is sent back to India at European shipping rates  once again on British ships  The captains  officers  sailors of these ships  whose wages must be paid  are English  The only Indians who profit are a few lascars who do the dirty work on the boats for a few cents a day  The cloth is finally sold back to the kings and landlords of India who got the money to buy this expensive cloth out of the poor peasants of India who worked at seven cents a day   Fisher 1932 pp 154 156  In the United States  Southern cotton provided capital for the continuing development of the North  The cotton produced by enslaved African Americans not only helped the South  but also enriched Northern merchants  Much of the Southern cotton was transshipped through the northern ports  Cotton remained a key crop in the Southern economy after emancipation and the end of the Civil War in 1865  Across the South  sharecropping evolved  in which free black farmers and landless white farmers worked on white owned cotton plantations of the wealthy in return for a share of the profits  Cotton plantations required vast labor forces to hand pick cotton  and it was not until the 1950s that reliable harvesting machinery was introduced into the South  prior to this  cotton harvesting machinery had been too clumsy to pick cotton without shredding the fibers   During the early 20th century  employment in the cotton industry fell  as machines began to replace laborers  and the South s rural labor force dwindled during the First and Second World Wars  Today  cotton remains a major export of the southern United States  and a majority of the world s annual cotton crop is of the long staple American variety  13   edit  Tang is cotton Main article  Ferm n Tang is Ferm n Tang is poses with an example of the  Tang is cotton  In 1901  Peru s cotton industry suffered because of a fungus plague caused by a plant disease known as  cotton wilt   more correctly   fusarium wilt   caused by the fungus Fusarium vasinfectum  14  The plant disease  which spread throughout Peru  entered plant s roots and worked its way up the stem until the plant was completely dried up  Ferm n Tang is  a Puerto Rican agriculturist who lived in Peru  studied some species of the plant that were affected by the disease to a lesser extent and experimented in germination with the seeds of various cotton plants  In 1911  after 10 years of experimenting and failures  Tang is was able to develop a seed which produced a superior cotton plant resistant to the disease  The seeds produced a plant that had a 40  longer  between 29 mm and 33 mm  and thicker fiber that did not break easily and required little water  15  The Tang is cotton  as it became known  is the variety which is preferred by the Peruvian national textile industry  It constituted 75  of all the Peruvian cotton production  both for domestic use and apparel exports  The Tang is cotton crop was estimated at 225 000 bales that year  16   edit  Cultivation Cotton plowing in Togo  1928 Picking cotton in Armenia in the 1930 s  No cotton is grown there today  Cotton ready for shipment  Houston  Texas  postcard  circa 1911  Harvested cotton in Tennessee  2006  Cotton modules in Australia  2007  Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost free period  plenty of sunshine  and a moderate rainfall  usually from 600 to 1200 mm  24 to 48 inches   Soils usually need to be fairly heavy  although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional  In general  these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres  but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation  Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn  Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June  The area of the United States known as the South Plains is the largest contiguous cotton growing region in the world  While dryland  non irrigated  cotton is successfully grown in this region  consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on irrigation water drawn from the Ogallala Aquifer  Since cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant  this makes it an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions  As water resources get tighter around the world  economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict  as well as potential environmental problems  17  18  19  20  21  For example  improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of Uzbekistan  where cotton is a major export  In the days of the Soviet Union  the Aral Sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation  largely of cotton  and now salination is widespread  20  21  Cotton can also be cultivated to have colors other than the yellowish off white typical of modern commercial cotton fibers  Naturally colored cotton can come in red  green  and several shades of brown  22   edit  Genetic modification Genetically modified  GM  cotton was developed to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides  The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis  Bt  naturally produces a chemical harmful only to a small fraction of insects  most notably the larvae of moths and butterflies  beetles  and flies  and harmless to other forms of life  The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton  causing cotton to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues  In many regions  the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae  which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat  This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests  some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance   This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management  Bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests  however  such as plant bugs  stink bugs  and aphids  depending on circumstances it may still be desirable to use insecticides against these  A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers  the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased  necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds  23  However a more recent 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences  Stanford University and Rutgers University refutes this  24  They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm  The secondary pests were mostly miridae  plant bugs  whose increase was related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase in half the villages studied  Moreover  the increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption  The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri biotech Applications  ISAAA  said that  worldwide  GM cotton was planted on an area of 16 million hectares in 2009  25  This was 49  of the worldwide total area planted in cotton  The U S  cotton crop was 93  GM in 2010 26  and the Chinese cotton crop was 68  GM in 2009  27  The initial introduction of GM cotton proved to be a success in Australia   the yields were equivalent to the no transgenic varieties and the crop used much less pesticide to produce  85  reduction   28  The subsequent introduction of a second variety of GM cotton led to increases in GM cotton production until 95  of the Australian cotton crop was GM in 2009  25  Cotton has mainly been genetically modified for resistance to glyphosate  marketed as Roundup in North America  a broad spectrum herbicide sold by Monsanto  the same company that sells some of the Bt cotton seeds to farmers  29  There are now a number of different cotton seed companies selling GE cotton around the world  Farmers buy new seed every year under a licensing agreement between the farmer and the company that has created the GE cotton  citation needed  GM cotton acreage in India continues to grow at a rapid rate  increasing from 50 000 hectares in 2002 to 8 4 million hectares in 2009  The total cotton area in India was 9 6 million hectares  the largest in the world or  about 35  of world cotton area   so GM cotton was grown on 87  of the cotton area in 2009  27  This makes India the country with the largest area of GM cotton in the world  surpassing China  3 7 million hectares in 2009   Cotton has gossypol  a toxin that makes it inedible  However  scientists have silenced the gene that produces the toxin  making it a potential food crop  30   edit  Organic production Organic cotton is generally understood as cotton  from plants not genetically modified  that is certified to be grown without the use of any synthetic agricultural chemicals  such as fertilizers or pesticides  31  Its production also promotes and enhances biodiversity and biological cycles  32  United States cotton plantations are required to enforce the National Organic Program  NOP   This institution determines the allowed practices for pest control  growing  fertilizing  and handling of organic crops  33  34  As of 2007  265 517 bales of organic cotton were produced in 24 countries  and worldwide production was growing at a rate of more than 50  per year  35   edit  Pests and weeds Main article  List of cotton diseases Hoeing a cotton field to remove weeds  Greene County  Georgia  USA  1941 Female and nymph Cotton Harlequin Bug The cotton industry relies heavily on chemicals  such as herbicides  fertilizers and insecticides  although a very small number of farmers are moving toward an organic model of production  and organic cotton products are now available for purchase at limited locations  These are popular for baby clothes and diapers  Under most definitions  organic products do not use genetic engineering  Historically  in North America  one of the most economically destructive pests in cotton production has been the boll weevil  Due to the US Department of Agriculture s highly successful Boll Weevil Eradication Program  BWEP   this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States  This program  along with the introduction of genetically engineered Bt cotton  which contains a bacterial gene that codes for a plant produced protein that is toxic to a number of pests such as cotton bollworm and pink bollworm   has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides  Other significant global pests of cotton include the pink bollworm  Pectinophora gossypiella  the chili thrips  Scirtothrips dorsalis  the cotton seed bug  Oxycarenus hyalinipennis  the tarnish plant bug  Lygus lineolaris  and the fall armyworm  Spodoptera frugiperda   edit  Harvesting Offloading freshly harvested cotton into a module builder in Texas  previously built modules can be seen in the background Cotton being picked by hand in India  2005  Most cotton in the United States  Europe  and Australia is harvested mechanically  either by a cotton picker  a machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant  or by a cotton stripper  which strips the entire boll off the plant  Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton  and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze  Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics  and without defoliation or freezing  the plant will continue to grow  Cotton continues to be picked by hand in developing countries  36   edit  Competition from synthetic fibers The era of manufactured fibers began with the development of rayon in France in the 1890s  Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic  but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process  and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials  A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades  Acetate in fiber form was developed in 1924  Nylon  the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals  was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936  followed by DuPont s acrylic in 1944  Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers  such as women s hosiery from nylon  but it was not until the introduction of polyester into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat  37  The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton exporting economies  especially in Central American countries  such as Nicaragua  where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides  Cotton production recovered in the 1970s  but crashed to pre 1960 levels in the early 1990s  38  Beginning as a self help program in the mid 1960s  the Cotton Research and Promotion Program  CRPP  was organized by U S  cotton producers in response to cotton s steady decline in market share  At that time  producers voted to set up a per bale assessment system to fund the program  with built in safeguards to protect their investments  With the passage of the Cotton Research and Promotion Act of 1966  the program joined forces and began battling synthetic competitors and re establishing markets for cotton  Today  the success of this program has made cotton the best selling fiber in the U S  and one of the best selling fibers in the world  Administered by the Cotton Board and conducted by Cotton Incorporated  the CRPP works to greatly increase the demand for and profitability of cotton through various research and promotion activities  It is funded by U S  cotton producers and importers   edit  Uses A display from a British cotton manufacturer of items used in a cotton mill during the Industrial Revolution  Cotton is used to make a number of textile products  These include terrycloth for highly absorbent bath towels and robes  denim for blue jeans  chambray  popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts  from which we get the term  blue collar    and corduroy  seersucker  and cotton twill  Socks  underwear  and most T shirts are made from cotton  Bed sheets often are made from cotton  Cotton also is used to make yarn used in crochet and knitting  Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning  weaving  or cutting process  While many fabrics are made completely of cotton  some materials blend cotton with other fibers  including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester  It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics  as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics  and apparel such as stretch jeans  In addition to the textile industry  cotton is used in fishing nets  coffee filters  tents  explosives manufacture  see nitrocellulose   cotton paper  and in bookbinding  The first Chinese paper was made of cotton fiber  Fire hoses were once made of cotton  The cottonseed which remains after the cotton is ginned is used to produce cottonseed oil  which  after refining  can be consumed by humans like any other vegetable oil  The cottonseed meal that is left generally is fed to ruminant livestock  the gossypol remaining in the meal is toxic to monogastric animals  Cottonseed hulls can be added to dairy cattle rations for roughage  During the American slavery period  cotton root bark was used in folk remedies as an abortifacient  that is  to induce a miscarriage  39  Cotton linters are fine  silky fibers which adhere to the seeds of the cotton plant after ginning  These curly fibers typically are less than 1 8 in  3 mm  long  The term also may apply to the longer textile fiber staple lint as well as the shorter fuzzy fibers from some upland species  Linters are traditionally used in the manufacture of paper and as a raw material in the manufacture of cellulose  In the UK  linters are referred to as  cotton wool   This can also be a refined product  absorbent cotton in U S  usage  which has medical  cosmetic and many other practical uses  The first medical use of cotton wool was by Dr  Joseph Sampson Gamgee at the Queen s Hospital  later the General Hospital  in Birmingham  England  Shiny cotton is a processed version of the fiber that can be made into cloth resembling satin for shirts and suits  However  it is hydrophobic  does not absorb water easily   which makes it unfit for use in bath and dish towels  although examples of these made from shiny cotton are seen   The name Egyptian cotton is broadly associated with quality products  however only a small percentage of Egyptian cotton production is actually of superior quality  Most products bearing the name are not made with the finest cottons from Egypt  40   edit  International trade Worldwide cotton production Cottonseed output in 2005 The largest producers of cotton  currently  2009   are China and India  with annual production of about 34 million bales and 24 million bales  respectively  most of this production is consumed by their respective textile industries  The largest exporters of raw cotton are the United States  with sales of  4 9 billion  and Africa  with sales of  2 1 billion  The total international trade is estimated to be  12 billion  Africa s share of the cotton trade has doubled since 1980  Neither area has a significant domestic textile industry  textile manufacturing having moved to developing nations in Eastern and South Asia such as India and China  In Africa  cotton is grown by numerous small holders  Dunavant Enterprises  based in Memphis  Tennessee  is the leading cotton broker in Africa  with hundreds of purchasing agents  It operates cotton gins in Uganda  Mozambique  and Zambia  In Zambia  it often offers loans for seed and expenses to the 180 000 small farmers who grow cotton for it  as well as advice on farming methods  Cargill also purchases cotton in Africa for export  The 25 000 cotton growers in the United States of America are heavily subsidized at the rate of  2 billion per year  The future of these subsidies is uncertain and has led to anticipatory expansion of cotton brokers  operations in Africa  Dunavant expanded in Africa by buying out local operations  This is only possible in former British colonies and Mozambique  former French colonies continue to maintain tight monopolies  inherited from their former colonialist masters  on cotton purchases at low fixed prices  41   edit  Leading producer countries Top ten cotton producers 2011 480 pound bales   People

Andhra Pradesh  13 75   and also Madhya Pradesh are the leading cotton producing states  43  these states have a predominantly tropical wet and dry climate  In Pakistan  cotton is grown predominantly in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh  The leading city in cotton production is the Punjabi city of Faisalabad which is also leading in textiles within Pakistan  Punjab has a tropical wet and dry climate throughout the year therefore enhancing the growth of cotton  In the United States  the state of Texas led in total production as of 2004  44  while the state of California had the highest yield per acre  45   edit  Fair trade Cotton is an enormously important commodity throughout the world  However  many farmers in developing countries receive a low price for their produce  or find it difficult to compete with developed countries  This has led to an international dispute  see United States   Brazil cotton dispute   On 27 September 2002  Brazil requested consultations with the US regarding prohibited and actionable subsidies provided to US producers  users and or exporters of upland cotton  as well as legislation  regulations  statutory instruments and amendments thereto providing such subsidies  including export credits   grants  and any other assistance to the US producers  users and exporters of upland cotton  46  On 8 September 2004  the Panel Report recommended that the United States  withdraw  export credit guarantees and payments to domestic users and exporters  and  take appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or withdraw  the mandatory price contingent subsidy measures  47  In addition to concerns over subsidies  the cotton industries of some countries are criticized for employing child labor and damaging workers  health by exposure to pesticides used in production  The Environmental Justice Foundation has campaigned against the prevalent use of forced child and adult labor in cotton production in Uzbekistan  the world s third largest cotton exporter  48  The international production and trade situation has led to  fair trade  cotton clothing and footwear  joining a rapidly growing market for organic clothing  fair fashion

without removing the technical details  The talk page may contain suggestions   January 2011  A public genome sequencing effort of cotton was initiated 53  in 2007 by a consortium of public researchers  They agreed on a strategy to sequence the genome of cultivated  tetraploid cotton   Tetraploid  means that cultivated cotton actually has two separate genomes within its nucleus  referred to as the A and D genomes  The sequencing consortium first agreed to sequence the D genome relative of cultivated cotton  G  raimondii  a wild Central American cotton species  because of its small size and limited number of repetitive elements  It is nearly one third the number of bases of tetraploid cotton  AD   and each chromosome is only present once  clarification needed  The A genome of G  arboreum would be sequenced next  Its genome is roughly twice the size of G  raimondii s  Part of the difference in size between the two genomes is the amplification of retrotransposons  GORGE   Once both diploid genomes are assembled  then research could begin sequencing the actual genomes of cultivated cotton varieties  This strategy is out of necessity  if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes  the euchromatic DNA sequences of the AD genomes would co assemble and the repetitive elements of AD genomes would assembly independently into A and D sequences respectively  Then there would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts  The public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high quality  draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources  The public sector effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs  fosmids  and plasmids as well as 454 reads  These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome  In 2010  two companies  Monsanto and Illumina   completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of G  raimondii about 50x  clarification needed  They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public  This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome  Once the D genome is assembled from all of this raw material  it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton  but a lot of hard work remains   edit  See also BBCH
