is a country in East Africa that lies on the equator  With the Indian Ocean to its south east  it is bordered by Tanzania to the south  Uganda to the west  South Sudan to the north west  Ethiopia to the north and Somalia to the north east  Kenya has a land area of 580 000 km2 and a population of nearly 41 million  6  representing 42 different peoples and cultures  7  The country is named after Mount Kenya  a significant landmark and second among Africa s highest mountain peaks  Following a referendum and adoption of a new constitution in August 2010  Kenya is now divided into 47 counties that are semi autonomous units of governance  These units are expected to be fully implemented by August 2012   in time for the first general election under the new constitution  The counties will be governed by elected governors and will operate independent of the central government in Nairobi  The country s geography is as diverse as its multi ethnic population  It has a warm and humid climate along its coastline on the Indian Ocean which changes to wildlife rich savannah grasslands moving inland towards the capital Nairobi  Nairobi has a cool climate that gets colder approaching Mount Kenya  which has three permanently snow capped peaks  The warm and humid tropical climate reappears further inland towards lake Victoria  before giving way to temperate forested and hilly areas in the western region  The North Eastern regions along the border with Somalia and Ethiopia are arid and semi arid areas with near desert landscapes  The country also has significant geothermal activity that puts a lot of electricity in the national grid  Kenya s capital city  Nairobi  is situated next to a national park  The country is famous for its safaris and diverse world famous wildlife reserves such as Tsavo National Park  the Maasai Mara  Nakuru National Park  and Aberdares National Park that attract tourists from all over the world  Lake Victoria  the world s second largest fresh water lake  after Lake Superior in the US and Canada  and the world s largest tropical lake  is situated to the southwest and is shared with Uganda and Tanzania  As part of East Africa  Kenya has seen human habitation since the Lower Paleolithic period  The Bantu expansion reached the area by the first millennium AD  and the borders of the modern state comprise the crossroads of the Niger Congo  Nilo Saharan  and Afro Asiatic linguistic areas of Africa  making Kenya a truly multi cultural state  European and Arab presence in Mombasa dates to the Early Modern period  but European exploration of the interior began only in the 19th century  The British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895  known from 1920 as the Kenya Colony  The independent Republic of Kenya was founded in December 1963  The capital  Nairobi  is a regional commercial hub  The economy of Kenya is the largest by GDP in East and Central Africa  8  9  Agriculture is a major employer and the country traditionally exports tea and coffee  and more recently fresh flowers to Europe  The service industry is a major economic driver  mostly the telecommunications sector  and contributes 62 percent of GDP  Kenya is a member of the East African Community and produces world class athletes such as world champions Paul Tergat  David Rudisha  and Vivian Cheruiyot  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Geography and

Kenya The word Kenya     k nj    originates from the Kikuyu  Embu and Kamba names for Mount Kenya   Kirinyaga    Kirinyaa  and  Kiinyaa   citation needed  Prehistoric volcanic eruptions of Mount Kenya  now extinct  may have resulted in its association with divinity and creation among the indigenous Kikuyu related ethnic groups who are the native inhabitants of the agricultural land surrounding Mount  Kenya  original research   The Wakamba first pointed out the second mountain to Dr  Krapf called  K  Nyaa  or  K  ma  K  yaa  which is similar to K r ma K r nyaga in Kikuyu    probably because the pattern of black rock and white snow on its peaks reminded them of the feathers of the cock ostrich  10  The word  Nyaga  is a Kikuyu   Embu word to mean spot  It is a diminutive for  Manyaganyaga   Spots  The spots of the black rock and the white snow could be the origin of the words  K r  nyaga  which in this case means  spotted   Therefore  Mwene  Nyaga  Agikuyu God  means  The owner guardian of the spotted Mountain   In the 19th century  the German explorer Ludwig Krapf recorded the name as both Kenia and Kegnia believed by some to be a corruption of the Kamba version  11  12  13  Others say that this was on the contrary a very precise notation of a correct African pronunciation   k nj    14  A map drawn by Joseph Thompsons  1882 a Scottish geologist and Naturalist indicated

199 m  17 057 ft   15  Kenya is named after the mountain  16  At 580 367 km2  224 081 sq mi   2  Kenya is the world s forty seventh largest country  after Madagascar   It lies between latitudes 5 N and 5 S  and longitudes 34  and 42 E  From the coast on the Indian Ocean  the low plains rise to central highlands  The highlands are bisected by the Great Rift Valley  a fertile plateau lies in the east  The Kenyan Highlands comprise one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa  The highlands are the site of the highest point in Kenya  and the second highest in Africa   Mount Kenya  which reaches 5 199 m  17 057 ft  and is the site of glaciers  Mount Kilimanjaro  5 895 m 19 341 ft  can be seen from Kenya to the South of the Tanzanian border  15  Kenya s climate varies from tropical along the coast to temperate inland to arid in the north and northeast parts of the country  Kenya receives a great deal of sunshine all the year round  and summer clothes are worn throughout the year  It is usually cool at night and early in the morning inland at higher elevations  The  long rains  season occurs from March April to May June  The  short rains  season occurs from October to November December  The rainfall is sometimes heavy and often falls in the afternoons and evenings  The temperature remains high throughout these months of tropical rain  The hottest period is February and March  leading into the season of the long rains  and the coldest is in July and August  A giraffe at Nairobi National Park  with Nairobi s skyline in background Average annual

found in Kenya and in the Masai Mara in particular  the lion  leopard  buffalo  rhinoceros and elephant  A significant population of other wild animals  reptiles and birds can be found in the national parks and game reserves in the country  The annual animal migration   especially migration of the wildebeest   occurs between June and September with millions of animals taking part  Kenya is the setting for one of the Natural Wonders of the World   the great wildebeest migration  11 5 million of these ungulates migrate a distance of 1 800 miles from the Serengeti in neighbouring Tanzania to the Masai Mara in Kenya  in a constant clockwise fashion  searching for food and water supplies  History Main article  History of Kenya Prehistory The African theropod Spinosaurus was the largest known carnivorous dinosaur  Giant crocodile fossils have been discovered in Kenya  dating from the Mesozoic Era  over 200 million years ago  The fossils were found in an excavation conducted by a team from the University of Utah and the National Museums of Kenya in July August 2004 at Lokitaung Gorge  near Lake Turkana  17  Fossils found in East Africa suggest that primates roamed the area more than 20 million years ago  Recent finds near Kenya s Lake Turkana indicate that hominids such as Homo habilis  1 8 and 2 5 million years ago  and Homo erectus  1 8 million to 350 000 years ago  are possible direct ancestors of modern Homo sapiens and lived in Kenya during the Pleistocene epoch  In 1984 one particular discovery made at Lake Turkana by famous palaeoanthropologist Richard Leakey and Kamoya Kimeu was the skeleton of a Turkana boy belonging to Homo erectus from 1 6 million years ago  Previous research on early hominids is particularly identified with Mary Leakey and Louis Leakey  who were responsible for the preliminary archaeological research at Olorgesailie and Hyrax Hill  Later work at the former was undertaken by Glynn Isaac  citation needed  Kenya has been inhabited by people for as long as human history has existed  Pre colonial history The first inhabitants of present day Kenya were hunter gatherer groups  akin to the modern Khoisan speakers  18  These people were later replaced by agropastoralist Cushitic speakers from the Horn of Africa  19  During the early Holocene the regional climate shifted from dry to wetter climatic conditions  this provided an opportunity for the development of cultural traditions  such as agriculture and herding  in a more favorable environment  18  Around 500 BC Nilotic speaking pastoralists  ancestral to Kenya s Nilotic speakers  started migrating from present day Southern Sudan into Kenya  20  21  22  Nilotic groups in Kenya include the Samburu  Luo  Turkana  Maasai  23  By the first millennium AD  Bantu speaking farmers moved into the region  24  The Bantus originated in West Africa along the Benue River in what is now eastern Nigeria and western Cameroon  25  The Bantu migration brought new developments in agriculture and iron working to the region  25  Bantu groups in Kenya include the Kikuyu  Luhya  Kamba  Kisii  Meru  Aembu  Ambeere and Mijikenda among others  Arab traders began frequenting the Kenya coast around the 1st century AD  Kenya s proximity to the Arabian Peninsula invited colonization  and Arab and Persian settlements sprouted along the coast by the 8th century  The Kenyan coast had served host to communities of ironworkers and communities of subsistence farmers  hunters and fishers who supported the economy with agriculture  fishing  metal production and trade with foreign countries  26  The Great Mosque of Kilwa Kisiwani  one of the many mosques built by the Persian founders of the Kilwa Sultanate  27  The Kilwa Sultanate was a medieval sultanate  centered at Kilwa in modern day Tanzania  At its height  its authority stretched over the entire length of the Swahili Coast  including Kenya  It was founded in the 10th century by Ali ibn al Hassan Shirazi  28  a Persian Prince of Shiraz  29  The Persian rulers would go on to build elaborate coral mosques and introduced copper coinage  27  During this period  Arabs from southern Arabia settled on the coast  They established many new autonomous city states  including Mombasa  Malindi and Zanzibar  The Arab migrants also introduced Islam and the Omani dialect of Arabic to the area  This blending of cultures left a notable Arabian influence on the local Bantu Swahili culture and language of the coast  30  The Arabs built Mombasa into a major port city and established trade links with other nearby city states  as well as commercial centers in Persia  Arabia  and even India  31  By the 15th century  Portuguese voyager Duarte Barbosa claimed that  Mombasa is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships  both of which are bound from Sofala and others which come from Cambay and Melinde and others which sail to the island of Zanzibar   32  In the centuries preceding colonization  the Swahili coast of Kenya was part of the east African region which traded with the Arab world and India especially for ivory and slaves  the Ameru tribe is said to have originated from slaves escaping from Arab lands sometime around the year 1700   Initially these traders came mainly from Arab states  but later many came from Zanzibar  such as Tippu Tip   33  Close to 90  of the population on the Kenya coast was enslaved  34  Swahili  a Bantu language with Arabic  Persian  and other Middle Eastern and South Asian loanwords  later developed as a lingua franca for trade between the different peoples  26  Throughout the centuries the Kenyan Coast has played host to many merchants and explorers  Among the cities that line the Kenyan coast is the City of Malindi  It has remained an important Swahili settlement since the 14th century and once rivaled Mombasa for dominance in this part of East Africa  Malindi has traditionally been a friendly port city for foreign powers  In 1414  the Arab Sultan of Malindi initiated diplomatic relations with Ming Dynasty China during the voyages of the explorer Zheng He  35  Malindi authorities welcomed Portuguese explorer  Vasco da Gama  in 1498  Colonial history Main article  History of Kenya Colonial history Britain s possessions in British East Africa during the colonial period  The colonial history of Kenya dates from the establishment of a German protectorate over the Sultan of Zanzibar s coastal possessions in 1885  followed by the arrival of the Imperial British East Africa Company in 1888  Incipient imperial rivalry was forestalled when Germany handed its coastal holdings to Britain in 1890  This was followed by the building of the Kenya Uganda railway passing through the country  This was resisted by some tribes   notably the Nandi led by Orkoiyot Koitalel Arap Samoei for ten years from 1895 to 1905   still the British eventually built the railway  The Nandi were the first tribe to be put in a native reserve to stop them from disrupting the building of the railway  During the railway construction era  there was a significant inflow of Indian peoples  who provided the bulk of the skilled manpower required for construction  36  While building the railroad through Tsavo  a number of the Indian railway workers and local African labourers were attacked by two lions known as the Tsavo maneaters  They and most of their descendants later remained in Kenya and formed the core of several distinct Indian communities such as the Ismaili Muslim and Sikh communities  37  38  Statue of Dedan Kimathi  a Kenyan rebel leader with the Mau Mau who fought against British colonization in the 1950s  At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914  the governors of British East Africa  as the Protectorate was generally known  and German East Africa agreed a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities  Lt Col Paul von Lettow Vorbeck took command of the German military forces  determined to tie down as many British resources as possible  Completely cut off from Germany  von Lettow conducted an effective guerilla warfare campaign  living off the land  capturing British supplies  and remaining undefeated  He eventually surrendered in Zambia eleven days after the Armistice was signed in 1918  To chase von Lettow the British deployed the British Indian Army troops from India and then needed large numbers of porters to overcome the formidable logistics of transporting supplies far into the interior on foot  The Carrier Corps was formed and ultimately mobilised over 400 000 Africans  contributing to their long term politicisation  36  During the early part of the 20th century  the interior central highlands were settled by British and other European farmers  who became wealthy farming coffee and tea  39   One depiction of this period of change from one colonist s perspective is found in the memoir  Out of Africa  by Danish author Baroness Karen von Blixen Finecke  published in 1937   By the 1930s  approximately 30 000 white settlers lived in the area and gained a political voice because of their contribution to the market economy  The area was already home to over a million members of the Kikuyu people  most of whom had no land claims in European terms  and lived as itinerant farmers  To protect their interests  the settlers banned the growing of coffee  introduced a hut tax  and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour  A massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to provide a living from the land dwindled  36  By the 1950s  the white population numbered 80 000  40  Kenya Uganda railway near Mombasa  about 1899 From October 1952 to December 1959  Kenya was under a state of emergency arising from the Mau Mau rebellion against British rule  The governor requested and obtained British and African troops  including the King s African Rifles  The British began counter insurgency operations  in May 1953 General Sir George Erskine took charge as commander in chief of the colony s armed forces  with the personal backing of Winston Churchill  41  The capture of War hi  Itote  aka General China  on 15 January 1954  and the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure  Operation Anvil opened on 24 April 1954  after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the War Council  The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege  and the occupants were screened and the Mau Mau supporters moved to detention camps  The Home Guard formed the core of the government s strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans  not foreign forces like the British Army and King s African Rifles  By the end of the emergency  the Home Guard had killed 4686 Mau Mau  amounting to 42  of the total insurgents  The capture of Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956  in Nyeri signified the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the military offensive  41  During this period  substantial governmental changes to land tenure occurred  the most important of which was the Swynnerton Plan  which was used to both reward loyalists and punish Mau Mau  Post colonial history The first direct elections for Africans to the Legislative Council took place in 1957  Despite British hopes of handing power to  moderate  African rivals  it was the Kenya African National Union  KANU  of Jomo Kenyatta that formed a government shortly before Kenya became independent on 12 December 1963  on the same day forming the first Constitution of Kenya  42  During the same year  the Kenyan army fought the Shifta War against ethnic Somalis who wanted Kenya s Northern Frontier District joined with the Republic of Somalia  The Shifta War officially ended with the signature of the Arusha Memorandum in October  1967  but relative insecurity prevailed through 1969  43  44  To discourage further invasions  Kenya signed a defence pact with Ethiopia in 1969  which is still in effect  45  The former Kenyan President and founder of Kenya  Jomo Kenyatta  On 12 December 1964 the Republic of Kenya was proclaimed  and Jomo Kenyatta became Kenya s first president  46  At Kenyatta s death in 1978  Daniel arap Moi became President  Daniel arap Moi retained the Presidency  being unopposed in elections held in 1979  1983  snap elections  and 1988  all of which were held under the single party constitution  The 1983 elections were held a year early  and were a direct result of an abortive military coup attempt on 2 August 1982  The abortive coup was masterminded by a low ranked Air Force serviceman  Senior Private Hezekiah Ochuka and was staged mainly by enlisted men in the Air Force  The attempt was quickly suppressed by Loyalist forces led by the Army  the General Service Unit  GSU    a paramilitary wing of the police   and later the regular police  but not without civilian casualties  This event led to the disbanding of the entire Air Force and a large number of its former members were either dismissed or court martialled  The election held in 1988 saw the advent of the mlolongo  queuing  system  where voters were supposed to line up behind their favoured candidates instead of a secret ballot  47  This was seen as the climax of a very undemocratic regime and it led to widespread agitation for constitutional reform  Several contentious clauses  including one that allowed for only one political party were changed in the following years  48  In democratic  multiparty elections in 1992 and 1997  Daniel arap Moi won re election  In 2002  Moi was constitutionally barred from running  and Mwai K bak   running for the opposition coalition  National Rainbow Coalition    NARC  was elected President  Anderson  2003  reports the elections were judged free and fair by local and international observers  and seemed to mark a turning point in Kenya s democratic evolution  49  Politics Main article  Politics of Kenya Current president Mwai Kibaki Kenya is a presidential representative democratic republic  whereby the President is both the head of state and head of government  and of a multi party system  Executive power is exercised by the government  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly  The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature  There was growing concern especially during former president Daniel arap Moi s tenure that the executive was increasingly meddling with the affairs of the judiciary  citation needed  Kenya has maintained remarkable stability despite changes in its political system and crises in neighbouring countries  A cross party parliamentary reform initiative in the autumn of 1997 revised some oppressive laws inherited from the colonial era that had been used to limit freedom of speech and assembly  This improved public freedoms and contributed to generally credible national elections in December 1997  citation needed  In December 2002  Kenyans held democratic and open elections  most of which were judged free and fair by international observers  The 2002 elections marked an important turning point in Kenya s democratic evolution in that power was transferred peacefully from the Kenya African Union  KANU   which had ruled the country since independence to the National Rainbow Coalition  Narc   a coalition of political parties  Under the presidency of Mwai Kibaki  the new ruling coalition promised to focus its efforts on generating economic growth  combating corruption  improving education  and rewriting its constitution  A few of these promises have been met  There is free primary education  In 2007 the government issued a statement declaring that from 2008  secondary education would be heavily subsidised  with the government footing all tuition fees  citation needed  2007 elections Main article  Kenyan presidential election  2007 Post election violence in Nairobi The latest general elections were held on 27 December 2007  In them  President Kibaki under the Party of National Unity ran for re election against the main opposition party  the Orange Democratic Movement  ODM   The elections were seen to have been flawed with international observers saying that they were below international standards  After a split which would take a crucial 8  of the votes away from the ODM to the newly formed Orange Democratic Movement Kenya  ODM K  s candidate  Kalonzo Musyoka  the race tightened between ODM candidate Raila Odinga and Kibaki  As the count came in to the Electoral Commission of Kenya  ECK  headquarters  Odinga was shown to have a slight  and then substantial lead as the results from his strongholds came in early  As the ECK continued to count the votes  Kibaki closed the gap and then overtook his opponent by a substantial margin after votes from his stronghold arrived later  This led to protests and open discrediting of the ECK for complicity and to Odinga declaring himself the  people s president  and calling for a recount  50  The protests escalated into ethnic violence and destruction of property  almost 1 000 people were killed and nearly 600 000 displaced  51  52  53  The dispute caused underlying tensions over land and its distribution to re erupt  as it had in the 1992 and 1997 elections  53  Hundreds of thousands were forced off their land to relatives elsewhere in the country and some claim weapons are being bought in the region  perhaps in anticipation of the 2012 elections  53  A group of eminent persons of Africa  led by former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan  brokered a peaceful solution to the political stalemate  2008 Current prime minister Raila Odinga On 28 February 2008  Kibaki and Odinga signed an agreement on the formation of a coalition government in which Odinga would become Kenya s second prime Minister  Under the deal  the president would appoint cabinet ministers from both PNU and ODM camps depending on each party s strength in Parliament  The agreement stipulated that the cabinet would include a vice president and two deputy Prime Ministers  After being debated and passed by Parliament  the coalition would hold until the end of the current Parliament or if either of the parties withdraws from the deal before then  citation needed  The new office of the PM will have power and authority to co ordinate and supervise the functions of the Government and will be occupied by an elected MP who will be the leader of the party or coalition with majority members in Parliament  The world watched Annan and his UN backed panel and African Union chairman Jakaya Kikwete as they brought together the erstwhile rivals to the signing ceremony  beamed live on national TV from the steps of Nairobi s Harambee House  On 29 February 2008  representatives of PNU and ODM began working on the finer details of the power sharing agreement  54  Kenyan lawmakers unanimously approved a power sharing deal 18 March 2008  aimed at salvaging a country usually seen as one of the most stable and prosperous in Africa  The deal brought Kibaki s PNU and Odinga s ODM together and heralded the formation of the grand coalition  in which the two political parties would share power equally  55  Grand coalition On 13 April 2008  President Kibaki named a grand coalition cabinet of 41 Ministers  including the prime minister and his two deputies  The cabinet  which included 50 Assistant Ministers  was sworn in at the State House in Nairobi on Thursday  17 April 2008 in the presence of Dr  Kofi Annan and other invited dignitaries  A constitutional change was considered that would eliminate the position of Prime Minister 56  and simultaneously reduce the powers of the President  A referendum to vote on the proposed constitution was held on 4 August 2010  and the new constitution passed by a wide margin  57  Among other things  the new constitution delegates more power to local governments and gives Kenyans a bill of rights  58  It was promulgated on 27 August 2010 at a euphoric ceremony in Nairobi s Uhuru Park  accompanied by a 21 gun salute  The event was graced by a number of African leaders and praised by the international community  As of that day  the new constitution heralding the Second Republic came into force  Administrative regions Main articles  Provinces of Kenya  Districts of Kenya  and Divisions of Kenya Provinces of Kenya Kenya is divided into 47 semi autonomous counties that will be headed by governors who will be elected in the first general election under the new constitution in August 2012  There is still controversy over whether the elections should be held in August or December 2012   Under the old constitution  Kenya comprised eight provinces each headed by a Provincial Commissioner  centrally appointed by the president   The provinces  mkoa singular mikoa plural in Swahili  were subdivided into districts  wilaya   There were 69 districts as of 1999 census  Districts are then subdivided into 497 divisions  taarafa   The divisions are then subdivided into 2 427

provinces  The provinces are  Central Coast Eastern Nairobi North Eastern Nyanza Rift Valley Western Under the current Kenya constitution  local government authorities are not recognized  However  under the old constitution  local governance in Kenya was practised through local authorities  Many urban centres host city  municipal or town councils  Local authorities in rural areas are known as county councils  Local councillors are elected by civic elections  which are held alongside general elections  Constituencies are an electoral subdivision  An Interim Boundaries commission was formed in year 2010 to review the constituencies and in its report  it recommended creation of additional 80 constituencies  Currently  there are 210 Constituencies in Kenya  60  Economy 20 shilling note from 1994  depicting then President Daniel arap Moi Main article  Economy of Kenya Despite western donors  early disillusionment with the government  the economy has seen much expansion  seen by strong performance in tourism  higher education and telecommunications  and acceptable post drought results in agriculture  especially the vital tea sector  61  Kenya s economy grew by more than 7  in 2007  and its foreign debt was greatly reduced  61  But this changed immediately after the disputed presidential election of December 2007  following the chaos which engulfed the country  East and Central Africa s biggest economy has posted tremendous growth in the service sector  boosted by rapid expansion in telecommunication and financial activity over the last decade  and now contributes 62 percent of GDP  Unfortunately  a massive 22 percent of GDP still comes from the unreliable agricultural sector which employs 75 percent of the labor force  a consistent characteristic of under developed economies that have not attained food security   an important catalyst of economic growth  and a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid  Industry and manufacturing is the smallest sector that accounts for 16 percent of the GDP  Kenya has traditionally been a liberal market with minimal government involvement  price control  seen in the oil industry  However  recent legislation allows the government to determine and gazette price controls on essential commodities like maize flour  kerosine and cooking oil  Privatisation of state corporations like the defunct Kenya Post and Telecommunications Company  which resulted in East Africa s most profitable company   Safaricom  has led to their revival due to massive private investment  As of May 2010  economic prospects are positive with 4 5  GDP growth expected  largely because of expansions in tourism  telecommunications  transport  construction and a recovery in agriculture  The World Bank predicts growth of 4  in 2010 and a potential of 4 9  growth in 2011  62  In March 1996  the Presidents of Kenya  Tanzania  and Uganda re established the East African Community  EAC   The

exchange bureaus  61  Tourism Main article  Tourism in Kenya Tourists on a safari in Kenya Kenya s services sector  which contributes about 63 percent of GDP  is dominated by tourism  The tourism sector has exhibited steady growth in most years since independence and by the late 1980s had become the country s principal source of foreign exchange  Tourists  the largest number from Germany and the United Kingdom  are attracted mainly to the coastal beaches and the game reserves  notably  the expansive Tsavo National Park  20 808 square kilometers  in the southeast  Tourism has seen a substantial revival over the past several years and is the major contributor to the pick up in the country s economic growth  Tourism is now Kenya s largest foreign exchange earning sector  followed by flowers  tea  and coffee  In 2006 tourism generated US 803 million  up from US 699 million the previous year  Agriculture Main article  Agriculture in Kenya Cultivation on the slopes of Mount Kenya Agriculture is the second largest contributor to Kenya s gross domestic product  GDP   after the service sector  In 2005 agriculture  including forestry and fishing  accounted for about 24 percent of GDP  as well as for 18 percent of wage employment and 50 percent of revenue from exports  The principal cash crops are tea  horticultural produce  and coffee  horticultural produce and tea are the main growth sectors and the two most valuable of all of Kenya s exports  The production of major food staples such as corn is subject to sharp weather related fluctuations  Production downturns periodically necessitate food aid for example  in 2004 aid for 1 8 million people because of one of Kenya s intermittent droughts  citation needed  Tea  coffee  sisal  pyrethrum  corn  and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands  one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa  Livestock predominates in the semi arid savanna to the north and east  Coconuts  pineapples  cashew nuts  cotton  sugarcane  sisal  and corn are grown in the lower lying areas  Unfortunately  the country has not attained the level of investment and efficiency in agriculture that can guarantee food security and coupled with resulting poverty  53 percent of the population lives below the poverty line   a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid  Poor roads  an inadequate railway network  under utilised water transport and expensive air transport have isolated mostly arid and semi arid areas and farmers in other regions often leave food to rot in the fields because they cannot access markets  This was last seen in August and September 2011 prompting the Kenyans for Kenya initiative by the Red Cross  64  Industry and manufacturing Although Kenya is the most industrially developed country in East Africa  manufacturing still accounts for only 14 percent of gross domestic product  GDP   Industrial activity  concentrated around the three largest urban centers  Nairobi  Mombasa  and Kisumu  is dominated by food processing industries such as grain milling  beer production  and sugarcane crushing  and the fabrication of consumer goods  e g   vehicles from kits  There is a vibrant and fast growing cement production industry  citation needed  Kenya has an oil refinery that processes imported crude petroleum into petroleum products  mainly for the domestic market  In addition  a substantial and expanding informal sector commonly referred to as Jua Kali engages in small scale manufacturing of household goods  motor vehicle parts  and farm implements  citation needed  Kenya s inclusion among the beneficiaries of the U S  Government s African Growth and Opportunity Act  AGOA  has given a boost to manufacturing in recent years  Since AGOA took effect in 2000  Kenya s clothing sales to the United States increased from US 44 million to US 270 million  2006   citation needed  Other initiatives to strengthen manufacturing have been the new government s favorable tax measures  including the removal of duty on capital equipment and other raw materials  citation needed  Energy Logo of KenGen  the largest electricity producer in Kenya  The largest share of Kenya s electricity supply comes from hydroelectric stations at dams along the upper Tana River  as well as the Turkwel Gorge Dam in the west  A petroleum fired plant on the coast  geothermal facilities at Olkaria  near Nairobi   and electricity imported from Uganda make up the rest of the supply  Kenya s installed capacity stood at 1 142 megawatts between 2001 and 2003  The state owned Kenya Electricity Generating Company  KenGen   established in 1997 under the name of Kenya Power Company  handles the generation of electricity  while the Kenya Power and Lighting Company  KPLC   which is slated for privatization  handles transmission and distribution  Shortfalls of electricity occur periodically  when drought reduces water flow  To become energy sufficient  Kenya aims to build a nuclear power plant by 2017  65  Workers at Olkaria Geothermal Power Plant Hydrocarbon reserves have yet to be discovered on Kenya s territory  despite several decades of intermittent exploration  Kenya currently imports all crude petroleum requirements  Kenya  east Africa s largest economy  has no strategic reserves and relies solely on oil marketers  21 day oil reserves required under industry regulations  Petroleum accounts for 20 to 25 percent of the national import bill  66  Although Kenya is yet to give a formal indication of where its exploration program  which now involves half a dozen companies  is headed  in recent weeks  well placed sources in Uganda s oil industry have suggested that the country is on the verge on making an announcement that could cement East Africa s position as major oil region on the continent  Optimism surrounding the Kenyan program is informed by recent oil discoveries in Uganda that  combined with the fact that the rocks that form the East African Rift System are about the same age  suggests a high potential for oil in Kenya  Gas discoveries in Tanzania and significant proven oil reserves along the border between Uganda and DR Congo have also encouraged interest in the once largely overlooked region  Reacting to the current speculation about prospects for an early oil find  senior geologists at Uganda s Energy Ministry who were at the forefront of the country s search for oil two decades ago  said they had no reason to doubt that there was oil in Kenya  with the area around Lake Turkana and the coastal belt being singled out as the most promising prospects  67  Before its exit mid this year  China National Offshore Oil Corporation  CNOOC  had worked with Africa Oil and Lion Energy Corp to drill an exploratory well in block 9 in northern Kenya  It also had a license for block L2  an inland area in the Lamu basin  67  Vision 2030 In 2007  the Kenyan government

to China s rapidly expanding economy  The deal allowed for China s state controlled offshore oil and gas company  CNOOC  to prospect for oil in Kenya  which is just beginning to drill its first exploratory wells on the borders of Sudan and Somalia and in coastal waters  No oil has been discovered yet  and there has been no formal estimate of the possible reserves  69  Demographics Main

in the health sector  Kenya still faces many challenges  Recent life expectancy estimates are approximately 55 years in 2009   five years below 1990 levels  79  Too many women and children still die at birth or within the first year of life  More die before their 5th birthday  Preventable diseases such as malaria  HIV AIDS  pneumonia  diarrhea and malnutrition are the major child killers and responsible for much morbidity  Weak policies  inadequate health workers  weak management and poor leadership in most public health facilities are largely to blame  According to 2009 estimates  HIV prevalence is about 6 3  of the adult population  80  However  the 2011 UNAIDS Report suggests that the HIV epidemic may be improving in Kenya  as HIV prevalence is declining among young people  ages 15 24  and pregnant women  81  The total fertility rate in Kenya is estimated to be 4 49 children per woman in 2012  82 Maternal mortality is high  partly because of female genital mutilation  61  This practice is however on the decline as the country becomes more modernised and the practice was also banned in the country in 2011  83  Education Main article  Education in Kenya School children in a classroom  Kenya s education system consists of early childhood education  primary  secondary and college The country s literacy level stands at 85  of the whole population  Early childhood education takes at least three years  primary eight years  secondary four and university four or six years depending on the course  Preschool  which targets children from age three to five  is an integral component of the education system and is a key requirement for admission to Standard One  First Grade   At the end of primary education  pupils sit the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education  KCPE   which determines those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training  Primary school age is 6 7 13 14 years  For those who proceed to secondary level  there is a national examination at the end of Form Four   the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education  KCSE   which determines those proceeding to the universities  other professional training or employment  The Joint Admission Board  JAB  is responsible for selecting students joining the public universities  Other than the public schools  there are many private schools in the country  mainly in urban areas  Similarly  there are a number of international schools catering for various overseas educational systems  Historical background Independent Kenya s first system of education was introduced by British colonists  84  After Kenya s independence on 12 December 1963  an authority named the Ominde Commission was formed to introduce changes that would reflect the nation s sovereignty  The commission focused on identity and unity  which were critical issues at the time  Changes in the subject content of history and geography were made to reflect national cohesion  Between 1964 and 1985  the 7 4 2 3 system was adopted   seven years of primary  four years of lower secondary  two years of upper secondary  and three years of university  All schools had a common curriculum  84  In 1981  the Presidential Working Party on the Second University was commissioned to look at both the possibilities of setting up a second university in Kenya as well as the reforming of the entire education system  84  The committee recommended that the 7 4 2 3 system be changed to an 8 4 4 system  eight years in primary  four years in secondary  and four years in university education   The table under Present day education in Kenya below shows the structure of the 8 4 4 system  Although the 7 4 2 3 system theoretically ended with the introduction of the new 8 4 4 system in 1985  the last batch of students from the former system graduated from Kenyan Universities in 1992  84  Present day education in Kenya An MSc student at Kenyatta University in Nairobi The current 8 4 4 system was launched in January 1985  85  86  It put more emphasis on vocational subjects on the assumption that the new structure would enable school dropouts at all levels either to be self employed or to secure employment in the informal sector  In January 2003  the Government of Kenya announced the introduction of free primary education  As a result  primary school enrollment increased by about 70   Secondary and tertiary education enrollment has not increased proportionally because payment is still required for attendance  In class eight of primary school the Kenya Certificate of Primary Examination  K C P E   is taken  The result of this examination is needed for placement at secondary school  In form four of secondary schools the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Examination  K C S E   is taken  Students sit examinations in eight subjects of their choosing  However  English  KiSwahili  Languages  and Mathematics are compulsory subjects  Private schooling also exists in Kenya  In 2007 the government issued a statement declaring that from 2008  secondary education would be heavily subsidized  with the government footing all tuition fees  Culture Main article  Culture of Kenya Dressed up Maasai warriors Kenya is a diverse country  Notable peoples include the Swahili on the coast  pastoralist communities in the north  and several different communities in the central and western regions  The Maasai culture is

Music of Kenya Popular Kenyan musician Jua Cali  Kenya has a diverse assortment of popular music forms  in addition to multiple types of folk music based on the variety over 40 regional languages  87  The guitar is the most dominant instrument in Kenyan popular music  Guitar rhythms are very complex and include both native beats and imported ones  especially the Congolese cavacha rhythm  music usually involves the interplay of multiple parts and  more recently  showy guitar solos  Lyrics are most often in Swahili or English  There s also some emerging aspect of Lingala borrowed from Congo musicians  Lyrics are also written in the indigenous languages  though urban radio will generally not play music in one of the  tribal  languages  This however has been seen through the emergence of vernacular radio stations that broadcast in native languages  Benga music has been popular since the late 1960s  especially around Lake Victoria  The word benga is occasionally used to refer to any kind of pop music  bass  guitar and percussion are the usual instruments  Zanzibaran taarab music has also become popular  as has hip hop  reggae  soul  soukous  zouk  rock and roll  funk and Europop  Sports Main article  Sport in Kenya Kenya is active in several sports  among them cricket  rallying  football  soccer   rugby union and boxing  But the country is known chiefly for its dominance in

000 m  10 000 m and the marathon  Kenyan athletes  particularly Kalenjin  continue to dominate the world of distance running  although competition from Morocco and Ethiopia has reduced this supremacy  Kenya s best known athletes included the four time women s Boston Marathon winner and two time world champion Catherine Ndereba  former Marathon world record holder Paul Tergat  and John Ngugi  Top Kenyan long distance runner  David Rudisha  Kenya won several medals during the Beijing Olympics  five gold  five silver and four bronze  making it Africa s most successful nation in the 2008 Olympics  New athletes gained attention  such as Pamela Jelimo  the women s 800m gold medalist who went ahead to win the IAAF Golden League jackpot  and Samuel Wanjiru who won the men s marathon  Retired Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion Kipchoge Keino helped usher in Kenya s ongoing distance dynasty in the 1970s and was followed by Commonwealth Champion Henry Rono s spectacular string of world record performances  Lately  there has been controversy in Kenyan athletics circles  with the defection of a number of Kenyan athletes to represent other countries  chiefly Bahrain and Qatar  88  The Kenyan Ministry of Sports has tried to stop the defections  but they have continued anyway  with Bernard Lagat the latest  choosing to represent the United States  88  Most of these defections occur because of economic or financial factors  Some elite Kenyan runners who cannot qualify for their country s strong national team find it easier to qualify by running for other countries  citation needed  Kenya has been a dominant force in women s volleyball within Africa  with both the clubs and the national team winning various continental championships in the past decade  citation needed

popular in Kenya especially with the annual Safari Sevens tournament  Kenya sevens team ranked 9th in IRB Sevens World Series for the 2006 season  Kenya was a regional power in soccer but its dominance has been eroded by wrangles within the Kenya Football Federation  90  This has led to a suspension by FIFA which was lifted in March  2007  In the motor rallying arena  Kenya is home to the world famous Safari Rally  commonly acknowledged as one of the toughest rallies in the world  91  and a part of the World Rally Championship for many years until its exclusion after the 2002 event owing to financial difficulties  Some of the best rally drivers in the world have taken part in and won the rally  such as Bj rn Waldeg rd  Hannu Mikkola  Tommi M kinen  Shekhar Mehta  Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae  Though the rally still runs annually as part of the Africa rally championship  the organisers are hoping to be allowed to rejoin the World Rally championship in the next couple of years  See also Geography portal Africa portal Kenya portal Outline of Kenya Index of Kenya related articles Commonwealth of Nations Foreign relations of Kenya Kiu Languages of Kenya List of
