article  History of El Salvador Temazcal in Joya de Ceren Pre Columbian El Salvador s origins of human civilization date back to the Pipil people of Cuzcatl n  which means The Place of Precious Diamonds and Jewels  The people of El Salvador are variably referred to as Salvadoran or Salvadorian  while the term Cuzcatleco is commonly used to identify someone of Salvadoran heritage  In pre Columbian times the territory was inhabited by various Native American peoples  including the Pipil  a Nahuatl speaking population that occupied the central and western regions of the territory  and the Lenca  who settled in the east of the country  The larger domain until the Spanish conquest of the kingdom was Cuzcatl n  The Mayan civilization which inhabited El Salvador has left ruins such as those at Tazumal  Joya De Ceren  San Andres  Casa Blanca  Cihuatan  and Chalchuapa  Discovery In 1520 the indigenous population of the territory had been reduced by 80  due to the smallpox epidemic that affected the Mesoamerican area  The Spanish Admiral Andr s Ni o led an expedition to Central America and disembarked on Meanguera island  which he named Petronila  in the Gulf of Fonseca  on May 31  1522  Thereafter he discovered Jiquilisco Bay on the mouth of Lempa River  This was the first known visit by Spaniards to what is now Salvadoran territory  Conquest of Cuzcatl n The ruins of Tazumal of the Maya civilizationin El Salvador  The Mayan ruins of San Andr s The Spanish Conquistadors led by Pedro de Alvarado and his brother Gonzalo arrived between 1524 and 1525 from the area comprising the present Republic of Guatemala  after participating in the conquest of Mexico and crossing the Rio Paz  Peace River  into what is now the Republic of El Salvador  The Pipil had no treasure but held land with rich and fertile soil  good for farming  The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in El Salvador as they had in other places like Guatemala or Mexico  but recognized the richness of the verdant land s volcanic soil  Pedro de Alvarado led the first incursion by Spanish forces to extend their dominion to the nation of Cuzcatl n  El Salvador   in June 1524  On June 8  1524  the conquerors arrived in the neighborhood of Acajutla at a village called Acaxual  There  according to records  a battle ensued between the opposing armies  with the Pipils wearing cotton armor  of three fingers  thickness  according to Alvarado  and carrying long lances  This circumstance would be crucial in the progression of the battle  Alvarado approached the Pipil lines with his archers  showers of crossbow arrows  but the natives did not retreat  The conquistador noticed the proximity of a nearby hill and knew that it could be a convenient hiding place for his opponents  Alvarado pretended that his army had given up the battle and retreated  The Pipils suddenly rushed the invaders  giving Alvarado an opportunity to inflict massive losses  The Pipils that fell to the ground could not get back on their feet  hindered by the weight of their cotton armor  which enabled the Spanish to slaughter them  In the words of Alvarado      the destruction was so great that in just a short time there were none which were left alive      However  Alvarado s army were not completely unscathed  In the battle Alvarado himself was struck by a sling shot to his thigh which fractured his femur bone  According to local tradition the stone that hit the conquistador was hurled by a Pipil  Tatoni   a prince  called Atonal  The resultant infection lasted about eight months and left Alvarado partially crippled  In spite of this wound  he continued the conquest campaign with relish  The Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people  including the Pipil and their Mayan speaking neighbors  Despite Alvarado s initial success in the Battle of Acajutla  the people of Cuzcatl n  who according to tradition were led by a warlord called Atlacatl  defeated the Spaniards and what was left of the Mexican Tlaxcala Indian allies the Spanish had brought  forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala  There  Pedro de Alvarado was again wounded  this time on his left thigh  which left him handicapped for the rest of his life  He abandoned the war and appointed his brother  Gonzalo de Alvarado  to continue the task  It took two subsequent expeditions  the first in 1525  followed by a smaller group in 1528  to bring the Pipil under Spanish control  In 1525  the conquest of Cuzcatl n was completed and the city of San Salvador was established  The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipils and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador  the area of the Lencas  Finally  with reinforcements  the Spanish established the garrison town of San Miguel  headed by Luis de Moscoso  explorer and conquistador  in 1526  A Maya Lenca woman  crown Princess Antu Silan Ulap I  daughter of Asisilcan Nachan I and Lady Omomatku  Monarch of the Lencas  organized resistance to the domination of the gold  and profit hungry Conquistadors  The Lenca kingdom was alarmed by de Moscoso s invasion  and Antu Silan dealt with it by going from village to village  uniting all the Lenca towns in present day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards  Through surprise attacks and their overwhelming numbers  they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison  For ten years  the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement  Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers  including about 2 000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala  They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of Intibuc   Antu Silan Ulap continued leading the united forces until  late in pregnancy  she slipped out of the conflicted area to a safe haven  Tihuilotal  where she gave birth to twins  a girl and a boy  Their father was Prince Salaiki Kanul from Sesori  The daughter became Atonim Silan I   she and her twin and another brother lived in the mountains near the lake Olomega and Maquigue   in this way they escaped the Spanish and their allies who were hunting them  Tihuilotal is a little southwest of the present city of La Uni n  near the source of the sacred Managuara River  Antu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to Lempira  also called Empira   Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle  Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in El Salvador and Honduras until he was killed in battle  The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills  The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537  Spanish rule  colonization  and independence Dios  Union  Libertad  God  Unity  Liberty  El Salvador 1912 Flag Painting of the First Independence Movement celebration in San Salvador  At the center  Jos  Mat as Delgado  The Spanish built Santa Ana Cathedral In the early sixteenth century  the Spanish conquistadors ventured into the natural harbors to extend their dominion to the area  They called the land  Provincia De Nuestro Se or Jesus Cristo  El Salvador Del Mundo    Province of our Lord Jesus Christ  the Savior of the World    which was subsequently abbreviated to  El Salvador  The Savior    During the colonial period  El Salvador was part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala  also known as the Kingdom of Guatemala  Spanish  Reino de Guatemala   created in 1609 as an administrative division of New Spain  The Salvadoran territory was administered by the Mayor of Sonsonate  with San Salvador being established as an intendancia in 1786  Towards the end of 1811  a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown  The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country s affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities  and the Creoles  long standing aspiration for independence  The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the French and American revolutions in the eighteenth century  and the weakening of the Spanish Crown s military power as a result of the Napoleonic Wars  with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively  On 5 November 1811  Salvadoran priest Jos  Mat as Delgado rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador  calling for insurrection and launching the 1811 Independence Movement  This insurrection was suppressed and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail  Another insurrection was launched in 1814  and again it was suppressed  Finally  on September 15  1821  in light of unrest in Guatemala  Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the Acta de Independencia  Deed of Independence  which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala  comprising current territories of Guatemala  El Salvador  Honduras  Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of Chiapas  from Spanish rule and declared its independence  In 1821  El Salvador joined Costa Rica  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the Federal Republic of Central America  In early 1822  the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces  meeting in Guatemala City  voted to join the newly constituted First Mexican Empire under Agust n de Iturbide  El Salvador resisted  insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries  A Mexican military detachment marched to San Salvador and suppressed dissent  but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823  the army decamped back to Mexico  Shortly thereafter  the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote for joining Mexico  deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces   Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture   When the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841  El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the Greater Republic of Central America  which later dissolved in 1898  After the mid 19th century  the economy was based on coffee growing and  as the world market for indigo withered away  prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated  The enormous profits that coffee yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land in the hands of an oligarchy of just a few families  6  citation needed  Throughout the last half of the nineteenth century  a succession of presidents from the ranks of the Salvadoran oligarchy  nominally both conservative and liberal  generally agreed on the promotion of coffee as the predominant cash crop  the development of infrastructure  railroads and port facilities  primarily in support of the coffee trade  the elimination of communal landholdings to facilitate further coffee production  the passage of anti vagrancy laws to ensure that displaced campesinos and other rural residents provided sufficient labor for the coffee fincas  plantations   and the suppression of rural discontent  In 1912  the national guard was created as a rural police force  20th century General Tom s Regalado was President of El Salvador from 14 November 1898 until 1 March 1903  He was a military ruler  After he left office  he remained active in the Army of El Salvador  and was killed July 11  1906 at El Jicaro during a war against Guatemala  In 1898  General Tomas Regalado gained power by force  deposing Rafael Antonio Guti rrez and ruling as president until 1903  He revived the practice of designating presidential successors  Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable  but there were undercurrents of popular discontent as well  When President Dr  Manuel Enrique Araujo was killed in 1913  there were many hypotheses advanced for the political motive of his murder  Araujo s administration was followed by the Melendez Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927  Pio Romero Bosque  ex Minister of the Government  and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty  succeeded president Jorge Melendez and in 1930 announced free elections in which Arturo Araujo came to power on March 1  1931  His government lasted only nine months  as his Labor Party lacked political and governmental experience and many party members used their government offices inefficiently  President Araujo faced general popular discontent  as the people expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land  There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration  His vice president and Minister of War was General Maximiliano Hern ndez Mart nez and his National Police Director was Rochac  the president s brother in law  In 1931 a coup d  tat was organized by young junior officers and led by General Mart nez  the first strike started in the First Regiment of Infantry across from the National Palace in downtown San Salvador  Only the First Regiment of Calvary and the National Police defended the President  the National Police had been on its payroll   but later that night on December 1931  after hours of fighting and badly outnumbered  they surrendered to the military revolution  The Directorate  composed of officers  hid behind a shadowy figure  as told by Thomas Anderson in his book Matanza   a rich anti communist banker called Rodolfo Duke  and later installed the ardent fascist General Mart nez as president of El Salvador  The causes of the revolt were probably due to the army s discontent at being unpaid by President Araujo for some months  Araujo left the National Palace and later unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt  The U S  Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Mart nez  who agreed to hold presidential elections later  Mart nez resigned in 1934  six months before the presidential elections  to run for the presidency  and then won as the only candidate  He ruled from 1935 to 1939  then from 1939 to 1943  He began a fourth term in 1944  but resigned in May after the general strike  Mart nez had said he was going to respect the Constitution  which stipulated he could not be reelected  but he refused to keep his promise  From December 1931  the year of the coup in which Mart nez came to power  there was brutal suppression of the rural resistance  The most notable event was the February 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising  led by Farabundo Mart  and Abel Cuenca  and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata  Only Cuenca survived  the other freedom fighters were killed by the government  It was later referred to as La Matanza  The Massacre   because tens of thousands of peasants were slaughtered on the orders of President Martinez  In the unstable political climate of the past few years  the social activist and revolutionary leader Farabundo Mart  helped found the Communist Party of Central America  and led a communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid  serving as one of its representatives  Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of Marxist Leninist ideology  strongly rejecting Stalinism   In December 1930  at the height of the country s economic and social depression  Mart  was once again exiled due to his popularity among the nation s poor and rumors of his upcoming nomination for President the following year  Once the new president  Arturo Araujo  was elected in 1931  Mart  returned to El Salvador  and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata  began the movement that was later truncated by the military  They helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers  The government responded by killing over 30 000 indigenous people at what was to be a  peaceful meeting  in 1932  this became known as La Matanza  The Slaughter   The peasant uprising against the dictator Mart nez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun  The Communist led rebellion  fomented by collapsing coffee prices  enjoyed some initial success  but was soon drowned in a bloodbath  President Mart nez  who had himself toppled an elected government only weeks earlier  ordered the defeated Mart  shot after a perfunctory hearing  Historically  the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighboring Honduras  as land poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land  This phenomenon was a major cause of the 1969 Football War between El Salvador and Honduras  7  As many as 130 000 Salvadorans had been forcibly expelled or had fled from Honduras  8  The PDC and the PCN parties FENADESAL train in Apopa  In 1960  two political parties were born and are still active in El Salvadoran politics  the Christian Democratic Party  PDC  and the National Conciliation Party  PCN   Both share common ideals  but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the Salvadoran military  Opposition leader Jos  Napole n Duarte from the PDC was the mayor of San Salvador from 1964 to 1970  winning three elections during the regime of President Jose Adalberto Rivera  who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly   Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the National Opposition Union  UNO  but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections  He lost to the ex Minister of Interior  Colonel Arturo Armando Molina  in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent  Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes  Duarte  at some Army officers  request  supported a revolt to protest the election fraud  but was captured  tortured and later exiled  Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer  The October 1979 coup d  tat In October 1979  a coup d  tat brought the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador to power  It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land  The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte s stolen election  Nevertheless  the oligarchy opposed agrarian reform  and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the Army such as General Majano and General Gutierrez citation needed   as well as with progressives such as Ungo and Alvarez  Owing to pressure from the staunch oligarchy  this Junta was soon dissolved because of its inability to control the Army in its repression of the people fighting for unionization rights  agrarian reform  better wages  accessible health care  and freedom of expression  In the meantime  the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society  Middle and high school students were organized in MERS  Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria  Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students   college students were involved with AGEUS  Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos  Association of Salvadoran College Students   and workers were organized in BPR  Bloque Popular Revolucionario  Popular Revolutionary Block   The U S  supported and financed the creation of a second Junta to change the political environment and stop the spread of a leftist insurrection  Napoleon Duarte was recalled from his exile in Venezuela to head this new Junta  However  a revolution was already underway and his new role as head of the Junta was seen by the general population as opportunistic  He was unable to influence the outcome of the insurrection movement  and this resulted in the Salvadoran Civil War  1980 1992   Mural in Perquin  former  guerrilla capital  and now a tourist destination  On January 16  1992 the government of El Salvador  represented by president Alfredo Cristiani  and the Frente Farabundo Mart  para la Liberaci n Nacional  FMLN   represented by the commanders of the five guerrilla groups   Shafick Handal  Joaquin Villalobos  Salvador S nchez Ceren  Francisco Jovel and Eduardo Sancho  all signed the peace agreements brokered by the United Nations which ended the 12 year civil war  This event  held at the Chapultepec Castle in Mexico  was attended by U N  dignitaries and other representatives of the international community  After signing the armistice  the president stood up and shook hands with all the now ex guerrilla commanders  an action which was widely admired  The so called Mexico Peace Agreements mandated reductions in the size of the Army  and the dissolution of the National Police  the Treasury Police  the National Guard  and the Civilian Defense  a paramilitary group  A new Civil Police was to be organized  Judicial immunity for crimes committed by the armed forces ended  the government agreed to submit to the recommendations of a Commission on the Truth for El Salvador  Comisi n de la Verdad Para El Salvador   which would  investigate serious acts of violence occurring since 1980  and the nature and effects of the violence  and   recommend methods of promoting national reconciliation   End of the 20th century From 1989 until 2004  Salvadorans favored the Nationalist Republican Alliance  ARENA  party  voting in ARENA presidents in every election  Alfredo Cristiani  Armando Calder n Sol  Francisco Flores P rez  Antonio Saca  until 2009  when Mauricio Funes was elected president from the Farabundo Mart  National Liberation Front  FMLN  party  Economic reforms since the early 1990s have brought major benefits in terms of improved social conditions  diversification of its export sector  and access to international financial markets at investment grade level  However  crime remains a major problem for the investment climate  This all ended in 2001  and support for ARENA weakened  There is internal turmoil in the ARENA party  while the FMLN party is growing and united  9  21st century The unsuccessful attempts of the left wing party to win presidential elections led to its selection of a journalist rather than a former guerrilla leader as a candidate  On March 15  2009  Mauricio Funes  a television figure  became the first president from the FMLN party  He was inaugurated on June 1  2009  One focus of the Funes government has been revealing the alleged corruption from the past government  10  Geography Main article  Geography of El Salvador Meanguera Island view from the Gulf of Fonseca Izalco Volcano El Salvador is located in Central America  It has a total area of 8 123 square miles  21 040 km2   about the size of Massachusetts or Wales   It is the smallest country in continental America  and is affectionately called  Pulgarcito de America  the  Tom Thumb of the Americas    It has 123 6 square miles  320 km2  of water within its borders  It lies between latitudes 13  and 15 N  and longitudes 87  and 91 W  Several small rivers flow through El Salvador into the Pacific Ocean  including the Goascor n  Jiboa  Torola  Paz and the R o Grande de San Miguel  Only the largest river  the Lempa River  flowing from Guatemala and Honduras across El Salvador to the ocean  is navigatable for commercial traffic  Volcanic craters enclose lakes  the most important of which are Lake Ilopango  70 km  27 sq mi  and Lake Coatepeque  26 km  10 sq mi   Lake G ija is El Salvador s largest natural lake  44 km  17 sq mi   Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa  the largest of which is Embalse Cerr n Grande  135 km    El Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras  It is the only Central American country that does not have a Caribbean coastline  The highest point in the country is Cerro El Pital at 8 957 feet  2 730 m   which shares a border with Honduras  Climate Main article  Climate of El Salvador El Zonte beach Coatepeque Caldera Lake in Santa Ana  El Salvador El Salvador has a tropical climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons  Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change  The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot  the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate  The rainy season extends from May to October  this time of year is referred to as invierno or winter  Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period  yearly totals  particularly on southern facing mountain slopes  can be as high as 2 170 millimetres  85 4 in   The best time to visit El Salvador would be at the beginning or end of the dry season  Protected areas and the central plateau receive less  although still significant  amounts  Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms  Hurricanes occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of Hurricane Mitch  which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America  From November through April  the northeast trade winds control weather patterns  this time of year is referred to as verano  or summer  During these months  air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in Honduras  By the time this air reaches El Salvador  it is dry  hot  and hazy  However  in the extreme northeastern part of the country near Cerro El Pital  snow is known to fall during summer as well as during the winter due to a very high elevation  it is often referred to as the coldest place in the country   During El Salvador s summer  temperatures are warm to hot but dry  excluding the northern higher mountain ranges  where temperatures are chilly   Tropical climate at the Jiquilisco Bay and at Playa de La Libertad in the La Libertad Department  While cold  snowy temperate climate in Cerro El Pital in the Chalatenango Department  Biodiversity and endangered species The Ocelot is a native of El Salvador  The Torogoz is El Salvador s national bird  There are eight species of sea turtles in the world  six of them nest on the coasts of Central America  and four make their home on the Salvadoran coast  the leatherback turtle  Dermochelys coriacea   the hawksbill  Eretmochelys imbricata   the Green Sea turtle  Chelonia agasizzii  and the olive ridley  Lepidochelys olivacea   Of these four species  the most common is the Olive Ridley turtle  followed by the brown  black  turtle  The other two species  Hawksbill and Leatherback  are much more difficult to find as they are critically endangered  while the Olive Ridley and brown  black  turtle are in danger of extinction  Recent conservation efforts provide hope for the future of the country s biological diversity  In 1997  the government established the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources  A general environmental framework law was approved by the National Assembly in 1999  Specific legislation to protect wildlife is still pending  In addition  a number of non governmental organizations are doing important work to safeguard some of the country s most important forested areas  Foremost among these is SalvaNatura  which manages El Impossible  the country s largest national park under an agreement with El Salvador s environmental authorities  Despite these efforts  much remains to be done  It is estimated that there are 500 species of birds  1 000 species of butterflies  400 species of orchids  800 species of trees  and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador  Natural disasters El Salvador lies along the Pacific Ring of Fire  and is thus subject to significant tectonic activity  including frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity  Recent examples include the earthquake on January 13  2001 that measured 7 7 on the Richter scale and caused a landslide that killed more than 800 people  11  and another earthquake only a month later  on February 13  2001  that killed 255 people and damaged about 20  of the nation s housing  Luckily  many families were able to find safety from the landslides caused by the earthquake  The San Salvador area has been hit by earthquakes in 1576  1659  1798  1839  1854  1873  1880  1917  1919  1965  1986  2001 and 2005  12  The 5 7 Mw earthquake of 1986 resulted in 1 500 deaths  10 000 injuries  and 100 000 people left homeless  13  14  El Salvador s most recent destructive volcanic eruption took place on October 1  2005  when the Santa Ana Volcano spewed a cloud of ash  hot mud and rocks that fell on nearby villages and caused two deaths  11  15  The most severe volcanic eruption in this area occurred in the 5th century AD when the Ilopango volcano erupted with a VEI strength of 6  producing widespread pyroclastic flows and devastating Mayan cities  16  El Salvador s position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions  including heavy rainstorms and severe droughts  both of which may be made more extreme by the El Ni o and La Ni a effects  In the summer of 2001  a severe drought destroyed 80  of the country s crops  causing famine in the countryside  17  18  On October 4  2005  severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and landslides  which caused a minimum of fifty deaths  11  El Salvador s location in Central America also makes it vulnerable to hurricanes coming off the Caribbean  however  this risk is much less than for other Central American countries  The Santa Ana Volcano in El Salvador is currently dormant  the last eruptions were in 1904 and 2005  Lago de Coatepeque  one of El Salvador s lakes  was created by water filling the caldera that formed after a massive eruption  The British Imperial College s El Salvador Project aims to build earthquake proof buildings in remote areas of the country  Government and politics Main article  Politics of El Salvador Main article  Foreign relations of El Salvador The 1983 Constitution is the highest legal authority in the country  El Salvador has a democratic and representative government  whose three bodies are  The Executive Branch  headed by the President of the Republic  who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five

some security forces who were in command of the army  such as the National Guard  Treasury Police and special battalions that were formed to fight against the insurgency of the 1980s  The political

completion  According to the IMF and CIA World Factbook  El Salvador has the third largest economy in the region  behind Costa Rica and Panama  when comparing nominal Gross Domestic Product and purchasing power GDP  20  El Salvador s GDP per capita stands at US  4 365  21  El Salvador s economy has been hampered at times by natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes  but it is currently growing steadily  Antiguo Cuscatl n has the highest per capita income of all the cities in the country  and is a center of international investment  GDP in purchasing power parity  PPP  in 2008 was estimated at   25 895 billion USD  The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 64 1   followed by the industrial sector at 24 7   2008 est    Agriculture represents only 11 2  of GDP  2010 est    San Salvador  one of the fastest growing capitals in the world The GDP has been growing since 1996 at an annual rate that averages 3 2  real growth  The government has recently committed to free market initiatives  and the 2007 GDP s real growth rate was 4 7   22  In December 1999  net international reserves equaled US  1 8 billion or roughly five months of imports  Having this hard currency buffer to work with  the Salvadoran government undertook a monetary integration plan beginning January 1  2001 by which the U S  dollar became legal tender alongside the Salvadoran col n  and all formal accounting was done in U S  dollars  Thus  the government has formally limited the implementing of open market monetary policies to influence short term variables in the economy  As of September 2007  net international reserves stood at  2 42 billion  23  24  It has long been a challenge in El Salvador to develop new growth sectors for a more diversified economy  In the past  the country produced gold and silver  25  As with other former colonies  El Salvador was considered a mono export economy  an economy that depended heavily on one type of export  for many years  During colonial times  the Spanish decided that El Salvador would produce and export indigo  but after the invention of synthetic dyes in the 19th century  the newly created modern state turned to coffee as the main export  San Miguel is an important economic center of El Salvador and home to  Carnival of San Miguel   the biggest festival of entertainment and gastronomy in Central America  There are a total of 15 free trade zones in El Salvador  El Salvador signed the Central American Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA    negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the Dominican Republic   with the United States in 2004  CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster free trade  El Salvador has signed free trade agreements with Mexico  Chile  the Dominican Republic  and Panama and increased its trade with those countries  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras  and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada  In October 2007  these four countries and Costa Rica began free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union  Negotiations started in 2006 for a free trade agreement with Colombia  The government has has sought to improve the collection of its current revenues  with a focus on indirect taxes  A 10  value added tax  IVA in Spanish   implemented in September 1992  was raised to 13  in July 1995  Inflation has been steady and among the lowest in the region  Since 1997 inflation has averaged 3   with recent years increasing to nearly 5   As a result of the free trade agreements  from 2000 to 2006  total exports have grown 19  from  2 94 billion to  3 51 billion  and total imports have risen 54  from  4 95 billion to  7 63 billion  This has resulted in a 102  increase in the trade deficit  from  2 01 billion to  4 12 billion  26  El Chorreron  El Salvador  tourism is the fastest growing sector of the Salvadoran economy  Remittances from Salvadorans living and working in the United States  sent to family members in El Salvador  are a major source of foreign income and offset the substantial trade deficit of  4 12 billion  Remittances have increased steadily in the last decade  and reached an all time high of  3 32 billion in 2006  an increase of 17  over the previous year   27  approximately 16 2  of gross domestic product GDP   Remittances have had positive and negative effects on El Salvador  In 2005  the number of people living in extreme poverty in El Salvador was 20   28  according to a United Nations Development Program report  Without remittances  the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37   While Salvadoran education levels have gone up  wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity  For example  some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad  This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage  Also  the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased  Money from remittances has also increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate  With much higher wages  many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans  and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay  29  Despite being the smallest country in Central America  El Salvador has the third largest economy  with a per capita income that is roughly two thirds that of Costa Rica and Panama  but more than double that of Nicaragua  Growth has been modest in recent years  and the economy contracted nearly 3  in 2009  Because of the recent growing and dollarized economy  El Salvador is seeing an increase of Central American  South American  and Caribbean immigrants from Guatemalans  Hondurans  Nicaraguans  Dominicans  Colombians  Venezuelan  Peruvians and Cubans searching for better living opportunities  El Salvador leads the region in remittances per capita  with inflows equivalent to nearly all export income  about a third of all households receive these financial inflows  In 2006  El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement  CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods  sugar  and ethanol  and supported investment in the apparel sector  which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the Multi Fiber Agreement in 2005  In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector s competitiveness  the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub  and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives  El Salvador has promoted an open trade and investment environment  and has embarked on a wave of privatizations extending to telecom  electricity distribution  banking  and pension funds  In late 2006  the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five year   461 million compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country s northern region  the primary conflict zone during the civil war  through investments in education  public services  enterprise development  and transportation infrastructure  With the adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001  El Salvador lost control over monetary policy  Any counter cyclical policy response to the downturn must be through fiscal policy  which is constrained by legislative requirements for a two thirds majority to approve any international financing  Demographics Main article  Demographics of El Salvador Salvadoran people Main article  List of Salvadorans Salvadoran model Irma Dimas was crowned Miss El Salvador in 2005  Lately she has been making headlines for her incursion inside El Salvador s politics  Christy Turlington is an American model of Salvadoran ancestry  best known for representing Calvin Klein from 1987 to 2007  Consuelo de Saint Exup ry was a Salvadoran writer and artist  The population of El Salvador increased from 1 9 million inhabitants in 1950 to 4 7 million in 1984  30  El Salvador has lacked authoritative demographic data for many years because no national census was taken between 1992 and 2007  Before the 2007 census  patterns in population growth led many officials  including within the Salvadoran government  to estimate the country s population at between 7 1 and 7 2 million people  31  However  on May 12  2008  El Salvador s Ministry of Economy released statistics gathered in the census of the previous May  These data present a figure for the total population that corroborates the earlier estimates  7 185 218  citation needed  Challenges to the 2007 census on a number of grounds are forthcoming  32  33  34  The country s population is composed of mestizos  those of mixed indigenous Native American and European ancestry   whites  and indigenous peoples  Eighty six percent of Salvadorans are of mixed ancestry  In the mestizo population  Salvadorans of predominantly Mediterranean descent  Afro Salvadoran  and Native Indigenous who are not connected to indigenous customs or language  all identify themselves as Mestizo culturally  Twelve percent of Salvadorans are mostly of Spanish descent  Small communities of French  German  Swiss  English  Irish  Italian  Danish  Swedish  Norwegian  Dutch and Central European ethnicity also exist within the country  The majority of Central European immigrants arrived during World War II as refugees from Czechoslovakia  Germany  Hungary  Poland  and Switzerland  and their descendants are scattered in different communities across El Salvador  Russians arrived during the Salvadoran civil war  concurrent with the U S  Soviet Union cold war  to help the communist guerrillas in their struggle to seize the government  Americans  Australians  and Canadians assisted the military junta in their fight against the communists  Only one percent of the Salvadoran population is purely indigenous  mostly Mayan  Pipil  Lenca and Kakawira  Cacaopera   The current low numbers of indigenous people may be partly explained by mass murders during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising  or La Matanza   Up to 30 000 peasants were killed in what by modern standards would be considered genocide because of the Salvadoran army s efforts to exterminate a certain racial group  Other ethnic groups include Arabs  Jews  other Central Americans  South Americans  Caribbean and a small group of Asians  citation needed  Afro Salvadoran  El Salvador is the only Central American country that has no visible African population today  which is the result of racial intermixing during colonial times  Africans that were brought to El Salvador completely mixed into the Mestizo population  creating Afro Mestizo Salvadorans  Africans are also not visible because of El Salvador s isolation from the Atlantic Central American coastline  where the slave trade occurred for centuries  This scarcity of African population is also due to laws imposed by the Spanish and Criollos around the 17th century after a slave revolt in San Salvador  which were sustained by authorities even after independence was won from Spain in 1821 and slavery was abolished  Ethnic groups in El Salvador 35  Ethnic Group Percent Mestizo    86  White Caucasian    12  Native American    1  Until the end of the 20th century  people of African descent weren t allowed to enter the country unless the oligarchy determined it was absolutely necessary  In addition  General Maximiliano Hern ndez Mart nez instituted race laws in 1930 that prohibited four ethnic groups   blacks  Gypsies  Asians  from entering the country  It was not until the 1980s that this law was rescinded  Regardless of these racial laws  Afro Salvadorans are present in some areas due to immigrants arriving from neighboring countries like Belize  Honduras  and Nicaragua  who eventually mixed in with the local populations  Arabs  mostly Palestinian Christians  are today one of the most notable immigrant groups in El Salvador  despite their relatively small numbers  36  37  Denying this  the book  Seeing Indians  A Study of Race  Nation  and Power in El Salvador   by Virginia Q  Tilley  states on page 210      no twentieth century law or regulation ever prohibited the entry  settlement  or patriation of blacks  under the Martinez dictatorship or any other regime   There have been several publications presenting information about Africans in what is now El Salvador during the colonial period  Among the immigrant groups in El Salvador  Palestinian Christians stand out  38  Though few in number  their descendants have attained great economic and political power in the country  as evidenced by the election of ex president Antonio Saca   whose opponent in the 2004 election  Schafik Handal  was likewise of Palestinian descent   and the flourishing commercial  industrial  and construction firms owned by this ethnic group  The capital city of San Salvador has about 2 1 million people  an estimated 42  of El Salvador s population live in rural areas  Urbanization has expanded at a phenomenal rate in El Salvador since the 1960s  driving millions to the cities and creating growth problems for cities around the country  In the first half of 2007  government statistics provided by La Polic a Nacional Civil of El Salvador showed lower numbers in homicide and extortions as well as robbery and theft of vehicles  In 2007  homicides in El Salvador were reduced by 22   extortions were reduced by 7   and robbery and theft of vehicles had gone down 18   in comparison with the same period in 2006  39  However  in 2009  there has been an increase in homicides and extortions of about 30  more than in 2008  according to some statistics  40  As of 2004  there were approximately 3 2 million Salvadorans living outside El Salvador  with the United States traditionally being the destination of choice for Salvadorans looking for greater economic opportunity  By 2009  there were about 1 6 million Salvadoran immigrants and Americans of Salvadoran descent in the U S   41  making them the sixth largest immigrant group in the country  42  Salvadorans also live in nearby Belize  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua  43  The majority of expatriates emigrated during the civil war of the 1980s for political reasons and later because of adverse economic and social conditions  Other countries with notable Salvadoran communities include Canada  Mexico  the United Kingdom  including the Cayman Islands   Sweden  Brazil  Italy  Colombia  and Australia  There is also a large community of Nicaraguans  100 000 according to some figures  in

been a small Japanese community in El Salvador since World War II  citation needed   as well as a considerable Taiwanese community  The local Spanish vernacular is called Caliche  Salvadoreans use voseo  which is also used in Uruguay and Argentina  This refers to the use of  vos  as the second person pronoun  instead of  t    However  caliche  is considered informal and a small number of people choose not to use it  Nahuatl is an indigenous language that has survived  though it is only used by small communities of some elderly Salvadorans in western El Salvador  Religion Main article

gang related crimes and juvenile delinquency  52  Some say that this was a result of the deportation of thousands of Salvadorans from the U S  the majority of whom were members of MS 13  Mara Salvatrucha  or La Mara   53  in the mid 90s  The gangs in which Salvadorans had been involved in the United States began to show up in El Salvador  54  Today El Salvador experiences some of the highest murder rates in the Latin America  it is also considered an epicenter of the gang crisis  along with Guatemala and Honduras  55  In response to this  the government has set up countless programs to try to guide the youth away from gang membership  so far its efforts have not produced any quick results  One of the government programs was a gang reform called  Super Mano Dura   Super Firm Hand   Super Mano Dura had little success and was highly criticized by the UN  It saw temporary success in 2004 but then saw a rise in crime after 2005  In 2004  the rate of intentional homicides per 100 000 citizens was 41  with 60  of the homicides committed being gang related  55  The Salvadoran government reported that the Super Mano Dura gang legislation led to a 14  drop in murders in 2004  However  El Salvador currently has 65 homocides per 100 000 inhabitants  more than triple the current rate of Mexico  56  57  There are an estimated 25 000 gang members at large in El Salvador

The only airport serving international flights in the country is Comalapa International Airport  This airport is located about 40 km  25 mi  southeast of San Salvador  60  The airport is commonly known as Comalapa International or El Salvador International  El Salvador s tourism industry has grown dynamically over recent years as the Salvadoran government focuses on developing this sector  In 2006  tourism accounted for 4 6  of GDP  in 1996  it accounted for 0 4   In this same year  tourism grew 4 5  worldwide  Comparatively  El Salvador saw an increase of 8 97   from 1 15 million to 1 27 million tourists  This has led to revenue from tourism growing 35 9   from  634 million to  862 million  In 1996  tourism revenue was only  44 2 million  Also  there has been an even greater increase in the number of excursions  visits that do not include an overnight stay   More than 222 000 excursionists visited El Salvador in 2006  a 24  increase over the previous year  61  Most North American and European tourists seek out El Salvador s beaches and nightlife  Besides these two attractions  El Salvador s tourism landscape is slightly different from those of other Central American countries  Because of its geographic size and urbanization  there are not many nature themed tourist destinations such as ecotours  or archaeological sites  open to the public  Surfing  however  is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular  Surfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of the country  finding surfing spots that are not yet overcrowded  Also  the use of the United States dollar as Salvadoran currency  and direct flights of 4 6 hours from most cities in the United States  are factors for American tourists  Urbanization and Americanization of Salvadoran culture has also led to the abundance of American style malls  stores  and restaurants in the three main urban areas  especially greater San Salvador  Currently  tourists to El Salvador can be classified into four groups  Central Americans  North Americans  Salvadorans living abroad  primarily in the United States  and Europeans and South Americans  The first three represent the vast majority of tourists  Recently  El Salvador has attempted to broaden its tourist base by increasing the number of visitors from Europe and South America  Early indicators show that the government s efforts are working  When comparing January March 2007 to the same period in 2006  tourism has grown overall 10   and specifically from North America 38   Europe 31   and South America 36   62  In the fall  Livingston Airlines will initiate the only direct flight between Europe  departing from Milan  and El Salvador  The Decameron Salinitas  a recently inaugurated resort  has contributed to the growth of tourism by South American visitors because of the resort chain s name recognition  and it is looking to do the same with Europeans  A whole new segment of tourism has grown up around El Salvador s recent turbulent past  63  Artillery fragments  battle photographs  combat plans  and mountain hideouts have become tourist attractions in themselves  Since 1992  residents in some economically depressed areas have set up local enterprises to profit from these  The mountain town of Perquin was considered the  guerrilla capital   and today it is home to the  Museum of the Revolution   featuring cannons  uniforms  pieces of Soviet weaponry  and other weapons of war once used by the FMLN s  Farabundo Marti

the pupusa  Pupusas are hand made corn tortillas  made of masa de ma z or masa de arroz  a maize or rice flour dough used in Latin American cuisine  stuffed with one or more of the following  cheese  usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as quesillo  similar to mozzarella   chicharr n  or refried beans  Sometimes the filling is queso con loroco  cheese combined with loroco  a vine flower bud native to Central America   Pupusas revueltas are pupusas filled with beans  cheese and pork  There are also vegetarian options  Some adventurous restaurants even offer pupusas stuffed with shrimp or spinach  The name pupusa comes from the Pipil Nahuatl word  pupushahua  The precise origins of the pupusa are debated  although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards  65  Two other typical Salvadoran dishes are yuca frita and panes con pollo  Yuca frita is deep fried cassava root served with curtido  a pickled cabbage  onion and carrot topping  and pork rinds with pescaditas  fried baby sardines   The Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried  Panes con pollo  literally breads with chicken  are warm turkey filled submarine sandwiches  The turkey is marinated and then roasted with Pipil spices and handpulled  This sandwich is traditionally served with chicken  tomato  and watercress along with cucumber  onion  lettuce  mayonnaise  and mustard  One of El Salvador s typical breakfasts is fried plantain  usually served with cream  It is common in Salvadorian restaurants and homes  including those of immigrants to the United States   Maria Luisa  is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador  It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar  A popular drink that Salvadorians enjoy is Horchata  a drink native to the Valencian Community in Spain  Horchata is most commonly made of the morro seed ground into a powder and added to milk or water  and sugar  Horchata is drunk year round  and can be drunk anytime of day  It mostly is accompanied by a plate of pupusas or fried yuca  Horchata from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican horchata  which is

Education The public education system in El Salvador is severely lacking in resources  Class sizes in public schools can reach 50 children  so Salvadorans who can afford the cost often choose to send their children to private schools  which are reasonably higher in every level  Most private schools follow American  European or other advanced systems  Lower income families are forced to rely on public education  Education in El Salvador is free through high school  After nine years of basic education  elementary middle school   students have the option of a two year high school or a three year high school  A two year high school prepares the student for transfer to a university  A three year high school allows the student to graduate and enter the workforce in a vocational career  or to transfer to a university to further their education in their chosen field  Post secondary education varies widely in price  There is one public university  Universidad de El Salvador  UES The University of El Salvador has one main campus in San Salvador and three more campuses in Santa Ana  San Miguel and San Vicente  El Salvador has several private universities  Universidad Dr  Jos  Mat
