Indian rupee  6  7  During the 2010 Union Budget  Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee mentioned that the proposed sign would reflect and capture the Indian ethos and culture  8  Five signs created by Nondita Correa Mehrotra  Hitesh Padmashali  Shibin KK  Shahrukh J Irani  and D Udaya Kumar 9  10  had been short listed 10  from around 3331 responses received and one of them was to be finalized at the Union Council of Ministers of India meeting held on 24 June 2010  11  The decision was deferred by a request of the finance minister  8  and it was decided when they met again on 15 July 2010 12  and selected the symbol created by D  Udaya Kumar  son of N  Dharmalingam  a former DMK MLA  13  The selection process was challenged under the Right to Information Act in the Delhi High Court  The petitioner  Rakesh Kumar  who was a participant in the competition  described the process as  full of discrepancies  and  flawed   and named the Finance Ministry and the chairman of Indian Rupee Symbol Selection Committee as respondents  14  On 26 November 2010  the Delhi High single bench Court dismissed the writ petition  stating there was no justifiable ground for the stated allegations  15  But on 31 March 2011  Chief Justice and Justice Sanjiv Khanna of Delhi High Court in their judgment court allowed RTI activist Rakesh Kumar Singh to file PIL against  Indian Rupee symbol selection process   According to Guideline No  5 of the contest process  submitted symbols were required to be  in the Indian National Language Script or a visual representation   It has been argued that this violates the Constitution of India  because that does not specify any particular Indian Language Script as the Indian National Language Script  16   edit  Symbol The new sign is a combination of the Devanagari letter      ra  and the Latin capital letter  R  without its vertical bar  similar to the R rotunda   The parallel lines at the top  with white space between them  are said to make an allusion to the tricolor Indian flag  17  and also depict an equality sign which symbolizes the nation s desire to reduce economic disparity  Coins of denomination of Rupees 1 2 5 and 10 with the new Rupee Symbol have been put into circulation  18  19  As of January 2012  the new Indian rupee sign has been incorporated in the currency notes in the denomination of s 10  100  500 and 1000  20  21

is believed to have been introduced by Sher Shah Suri  1486 1545   based on a ratio of 40 copper pieces  paisa  per rupee  25  Among the earliest issues of paper rupees were those by the Bank of Hindustan  1770 1832   the Generalarren Hastings  and the Bengal Bank  1784 91   amongst others  Until 1815  the Madras Presidency also issued a currency based on the panam  with 12 panams equal to the rupee  Historically  the rupee  derived from the Sanskrit word raupya  meaning silver   was a silver coin  This had severe consequences in the nineteenth century  when the strongest economies in the world were on the gold standard  The discovery of vast quantities of silver in the U S  and various European colonies resulted in a decline in the relative value of silver to gold  Suddenly the standard currency of India could not buy as much from the outside world  This event was known as  the fall of the rupee   India was not affected by the imperial order in council of 1825 that attempted to introduce the British sterling coinage to the British colonies  British India at that time was controlled by the British East India Company  The silver rupee continued as the currency of India throughout the entire period of the British Raj and beyond  In 1835  British India set itself firmly upon a mono metallic silver standard based on the rupee  His decision was influenced by a letter  written in the year 1805  by Lord Liverpool that extolled the virtues of mono metallism  Following the Indian Mutiny in 1857  the British government took direct control of British India  Since 1851  gold sovereigns were being produced in large numbers at the Royal Mint branch in Sydney  New South Wales  In the year 1864 in an attempt to make the British gold sovereign become the  imperial coin   the treasuries in Bombay and Calcutta were instructed to receive gold sovereigns  These gold sovereigns however never left the vaults  As was realized in the previous decade in Canada and the next year in Hong Kong  existing habits are hard to replace  Just as the British government had finally given up any hopes of replacing the rupee in India with the pound sterling  it simultaneously realized  and for the same reasons  that they could not easily replace the silver dollar in the Straits Settlements with the Indian rupee  as had been the desire of the British East India Company  Since the great silver crisis of 1873  a growing number of nations had been adopting the gold standard  however the Indian currency system maintained its silver standard tradition  which remained until it was replaced by a basket of commodities and currencies in the late twentieth century  citation needed  The Indian rupee replaced the Danish Indian rupee in 1845  the French Indian rupee in 1954 and the Portuguese Indian escudo in 1961  Following independence in 1947  the Indian rupee replaced all the currencies of the previously autonomous states  Some of these states had issued rupees equal to those issued by the British  such as the Travancore rupee   Other currencies included the Hyderabad rupee and the Kutch kori  Nominal value during British rule  and the first decade of independence  1 damidi pie    0 520833 paise  1 12 Anna  1 kani pice    1 5625 paise  1 4 Anna  1 paraka   3 125 paise  1 2 Anna  1 anna   6 25 paise  1 Anna  1 beda   12 5 paise  2 Anna  1 pavala

initial  naye  was dropped  Many still refer to 25  50 and 75 paise as 4  8 and 12 annas respectively  not unlike the usage of  bit  in American English for   dollar  The One Rupee Banknote  One rupee  Obverse  edit  East African coast and South Arabia In East Africa  Arabia  and Mesopotamia the Rupee and its subsidiary coinage was current at various times  The usage of the Rupee in East Africa extended from Somalia in the north  to as far south as Natal  In Mozambique the British India rupees were overstamped  and in Kenya the British East Africa Company minted the rupee and its fractions as well as pice  The rise in the price of silver immediately after the First World War caused the rupee to rise in value to two shillings sterling  In 1920 in British East Africa  the opportunity was then taken to introduce a new florin coin  hence bringing the currency into line with sterling  Shortly after that  the Florin was split into two East African shillings  This assimilation to sterling did not however happen in British India itself  In Somalia the Italian colonial authority minted  rupia  to exactly the same standard  and called the pice  besa    edit  Straits Settlements The Straits Settlements were originally an outlier of the British East India Company  The Spanish dollar had already taken hold in the Straits Settlements by the time the British arrived in the nineteenth century  however  the East India Company tried to introduce the rupee in its place  These attempts were resisted by the locals  and by 1867 when the British government took over direct control of the Straits Settlements from the East India Company  attempts to introduce the rupee were finally abandoned   edit  International use With Partition  the Pakistani rupee came into existence  initially using Indian coins and Indian currency notes simply overstamped with  Pakistan   In previous times  the Indian rupee was an official currency of other countries  including Aden  Oman  Kuwait  Bahrain  Qatar  the Trucial States  Kenya  Tanganyika  Uganda  the Seychelles  and Mauritius  See also  Pakistani rupee The Indian government introduced the Gulf rupee  also known as the Persian Gulf rupee  XPGR   as a replacement for the Indian rupee for circulation exclusively outside the country with the Reserve Bank of India  Amendment  Act  1 May 1959  This creation of a separate currency was an attempt to reduce the strain put on India s foreign reserves by gold smuggling  After India devalued the rupee on 6 June 1966  those countries still using it   Oman  Qatar  and the Trucial States  which became the United Arab Emirates in 1971    replaced the Gulf rupee with their own currencies  Kuwait and Bahrain had already done so in 1961 and 1965 respectively  The Bhutanese ngultrum is pegged at par with the Indian rupee  and both currencies are accepted in Bhutan  The Nepalese rupee is pegged at 0 625 Rs  and the Indian rupee is accepted in Nepal  though 500 and 1000 rupee banknotes are banned 26   Sri Lanka s rupee is not related to India s currency  rather  it is pegged to the US Dollar 27    edit  Coins Main article  Modern Indian coins  edit  East India Company

nickel 1 anna was introduced  In 1918 and 1919  cupro nickel 2  4 and 8 annas were introduced  although the 4 and 8 annas coins were only issued until 1921 and did not replace their silver equivalents  Also in 1918  the Bombay mint struck gold sovereigns and 15 rupee coins identical in size to the sovereigns as an emergency measure due to the First World War  In the early 1940s  several changes were implemented  The 1 12 anna and   pice ceased production  the   anna was changed to a bronze  holed coin  cupro nickel and nickel brass   anna coins were introduced  nickel brass was used to produce some 1 and 2 annas coins  and the composition of the silver coins was reduced from 91 7  to 50   The last of the regal issues were cupro nickel      and 1 rupee pieces minted in 1946 and 1947

Indian rupee has a market determined exchange rate  However  the RBI trades actively in the USD INR currency market to impact effective exchange rates  Thus  the currency regime in place for the Indian rupee with respect to the US dollar is a de facto controlled exchange rate  This is sometimes called a  managed float   Other rates such as the EUR INR and INR JPY have volatilities that are typical of floating exchange rates  33  It should be noted  however  that unlike China  successive administrations  through RBI  the central bank  have not followed a policy of pegging the INR to a specific foreign currency at a particular exchange rate  RBI intervention in currency markets is solely to deliver low volatility in the exchange rates  and not to take a view on the rate or direction of the Indian rupee in relation to other currencies  34  Also affecting convertibility is a series of customs regulations restricting the import and export of rupees  Legally  foreign nationals are forbidden from importing or exporting rupees  while Indian nationals can import and export only up to 7500 rupees at a time  and the possession of 500 and 1000 rupee notes in Nepal is prohibited  RBI also exercises a system of capital controls in addition to the intervention  through active trading  in the currency markets  On the current account  there are no currency conversion restrictions hindering buying or selling foreign exchange  though trade barriers do exist   On the capital account  foreign institutional investors have convertibility to bring money in and out of the country and buy securities  subject to certain quantitative restrictions   Local firms are able to take capital out of the country in order to expand globally  But local households are restricted in their ability to do global diversification  However  owing to an enormous expansion of the current account and the capital account  India is increasingly moving towards de facto full convertibility  There is some confusion regarding the interchange of the currency with gold  but the system that India follows is that money cannot be exchanged for gold  in any circumstances or any situation  Money cannot be changed into gold by the RBI  This is because it will become difficult to handle it  India follows the same principle as Great Britain and America   edit  Chronology 1991   India began to lift restrictions on its currency  A series of reforms remove restrictions on current account transactions including trade  interest payments  amp  remittances and on some capital assets based transactions  Liberalized Exchange Rate Management System  LERMS   a dual exchange rate system  introduced a partial convertibility of the Rupee in March 1992  35  1997   A panel set up to explore capital account convertibility recommended India move towards full convertibility by 2000  but timetable abandoned in the wake of the 1997 98 East Asian financial crisis  2006   The Prime Minister  Dr Manmohan Singh  asks the Finance Minister and the Reserve Bank of India to prepare a road map for moving towards capital account convertibility   The  Fuller Capital Account Convertibility Report    2006 07 31  http
