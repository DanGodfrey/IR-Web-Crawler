electronic game that involves human interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device  The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device  1  but following popularization of the term  video game   it now implies any type of display device  The electronic systems used to play video games are known as platforms  examples of these are personal computers and video game consoles  These platforms range from large mainframe computers to small handheld devices  Specialized video games such as arcade games  while previously common  have gradually declined in use  Video games have gone on to become an art form and industry  The input device used to manipulate video games is called a game controller  and varies across platforms  For example  a controller might consist of only a button and a joystick  while another may feature a dozen buttons and one or more joysticks  Early personal computer games often needed a keyboard for gameplay  or more commonly  required the user to buy a separate joystick with at least one button  2  Many modern computer games allow or require the player to use a keyboard and a mouse simultaneously  A few of the most common game controllers are gamepads  mice  keyboards  and joysticks  Video games typically use additional means of providing interactivity and information to the player  Audio is almost universal  using sound reproduction devices  such as speakers and headphones  Other feedback may come via haptic peripherals  such as vibration or force feedback  with vibration sometimes used to simulate force feedback  In the early days of cartridge consoles  they were sometimes called TV games  a term now often used for handheld TV games  Contents 1 History 2 Overview 2 1 Platforms 2 2

oscilloscope for a display Early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats  The earliest example is from 1947 a  Cathode ray tube Amusement Device  was filed for a patent on January 25  1947  by Thomas T  Goldsmith Jr  and Estle Ray Mann  and issued on December 14  1948  as U S  Patent 2455992  3  Inspired by radar display tech  it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control a vector drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets  which were drawings fixed to the screen  4  Other early examples include  The NIMROD computer at the 1951 Festival of Britain OXO a tic tac toe Computer game by Alexander S  Douglas for the EDSAC in 1952 Tennis for Two  an interactive game engineered by William Higinbotham in 1958 Spacewar   written by MIT students Martin Graetz  Steve Russell  and Wayne Wiitanen s on a DEC PDP 1 computer in 1961  Each game used different means of display  NIMROD used a panel of lights to play the game of Nim  5  OXO used a graphical display to play tic tac toe  6 Tennis for Two used an oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court  4  and Spacewar  used the DEC PDP 1 s vector display to have two spaceships battle each other  7  In 1971  Computer Space  created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney  was the first commercially sold  coin operated video game  It used a black and white television for its display  and the computer system was made of 74 series TTL chips  8  The game was featured in the 1973 science fiction film Soylent Green  Computer Space was followed in 1972 by the Magnavox Odyssey  the first home console  Modeled after a late 1960s prototype console developed by Ralph H  Baer called the  Brown Box   it also used a standard television  4  9  These were followed by two versions of Atari s Pong  an arcade version in 1972 and a home version in 1975 that dramatically increased video game popularity  10  The commercial success of Pong led numerous other companies to develop Pong clones and their own systems  spawning the video game industry  11  A flood of Pong clones eventually led to the video game crash of 1977  which came to an end with the mainstream success of Taito s 1978 shooter game Space Invaders  12  marking the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games and inspiring dozens of manufacturers to enter the market  12  13  The game inspired arcade machines to become prevalent in mainstream locations such as shopping malls  traditional storefronts  restaurants  and convenience stores  14  The game also became the subject of numerous articles and stories on television and in newspapers and magazines  establishing video gaming as a rapidly growing mainstream hobby  15  16 Space Invaders was soon licensed for the Atari VCS  later known as Atari 2600   becoming the first  killer app  and quadrupling the console s sales  17  This helped Atari recover from their earlier losses  18  and in turn the Atari VCS revived the home video game market during the second generation of consoles  up until the North American video game crash of 1983  19  The home video game industry was revitalized shortly afterwards by the widespread success of the Nintendo Entertainment System  20  which marked a shift in the dominance of the video game industry from the United States to Japan during the third generation of consoles  21  Overview Platforms See also  History of video games The term  platform  refers to the specific combination of electronic components or computer hardware which  in conjunction with software  allows a video game to operate  22  The term  system  is also commonly used  In common use a  PC game  refers to a form of media that involves a player interacting with a IBM PC compatible personal computer connected to a video monitor  A  console game  is played on a specialized electronic device that connects to a common television set or composite video monitor  A  handheld  gaming device is a self contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in a user s hands   Arcade game  generally refers to a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special cabinet  These distinctions are not always clear and there may be games that bridge one or more platforms  In addition to personal computers  there are multiple other devices which have the ability to play games but are not dedicated video game machines  such as mobile phones  PDAs and graphing calculators  With the advent of social networking and other online applications hubs  the term  platform  started being used to refer to the online service within which the game is played  regardless of the actual hardware on which it is executed  A game s platform could simply be  Facebook   whether it is played on a Windows PC  Mac  Smart TV  or smartphone  Genres Main article  Video game genres A video game  like most other forms of media  may be categorized into genres based on many factors such as method of game play  types of goals  art style and more  Because genres are dependent on content for definition  genres have changed and evolved as newer styles of video games have come into existence  Ever advancing technology and production values related to video game development have fostered more life like and complex games which have in turn introduced or enhanced genre possibilities  e g   virtual pets   pushed the boundaries of existing video gaming or in some cases add new possibilities in play  such as that seen with titles specifically designed for devices like Sony s EyeToy   Some genres represent combinations of others  such as massively multiplayer online role playing games  or  more commonly  MMORPGs  It is also common to see higher level genre terms that are collective in nature across all other genres such as with action  music rhythm or horror themed video games  Classifications Casual games Main article  Casual game Casual games derive their name from their ease of accessibility  simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp rule sets  Additionally  casual games frequently support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand  Casual games as a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as Solitaire or Minesweeper which can commonly be found pre installed with many versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system  Examples of genres within this category are hidden object  match three  time management  tetris or many of the tower defense style games  Casual games are generally sold through online retailers such as PopCap  Zylom  Vans Video Games and GameHouse or provided for free play through web portals such as Newgrounds or AddictingGames  While casual games are most commonly played on personal computers  cellphones or PDAs  they can also be found on many of the on line console system download services  e g   Xbox Live  PlayStation Network  or WiiWare   Serious games Main article  Serious game Serious games are games that are designed primarily to convey information or a learning experience of some sort to the player  Some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game in the traditional sense of the term  Educational software does not typically fall under this category  e g   touch typing tutors  language learning  etc   and the primary distinction would appear to be based on the title s primary goal as well as target age demographics  As with the other categories  this description is more of a guideline than a rule  Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre  although some such as exergames  educational games  or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter  These games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job or for skill set improvement  They can also be created to convey social political awareness on a specific subject  One of the longest running serious games franchises would be Microsoft Flight Simulator first published in 1982 under that name  The United States military uses virtual reality based simulations  such as VBS1 for training exercises  23  as do a growing number of first responder roles  e g   police  fire fighter  EMT   24  One example of a non game environment utilized as a platform for serious game development would be the virtual world of Second Life  which is currently used by several United States governmental departments  e g   NOAA  NASA  JPL   Universities  e g   Ohio University  MIT  for educational and remote learning programs 25  and businesses  e g   IBM  Cisco Systems  for meetings and training  26  Tactical media in video games plays a crucial role in making a statement or conveying a message on important relevant issues  This form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people  An example of tactical media in video games would be newsgames  These are short games related to contemporary events designed to illustrate a point  27  For example  Take Action Games is a game studio collective that was co founded by Susana Ruiz and has made successful serious games  Some of these games include Darfur is Dying  Finding Zoe  and In The Balance  All of these games bring awareness to important issues and events in an intelligent and well thought out manner  28  Educational games See also  Educational software On September 23  2009  U S  President Barack Obama launched a campaign called  Educate to Innovate  aimed at improving the technological  mathematical  scientific and engineering abilities of American students  This campaign states that it plans to harness the power of interactive games to help achieve the goal of students excelling in these departments  29  30  This campaign has stemmed into many new and exciting opportunities for the video game realm and has contributed to many new competitions  Some of these competitions include the Stem National Video Game Competition and the Imagine Cup  31  32  Both of these examples are events that bring a focus to relevant and important current issues that are able to be addressed in the sense of video games to educate and spread knowledge in a new form of media  www NobelPrize org uses games to entice the user to learn about information pertaining to the Nobel prize achievements while engaging in a fun to play video game  33  There are many different types and styles of educational games all the way from counting to spelling to games for kids and games for adults  Some other games do not have any particular targeted audience in mind and intended to simply educate or inform whoever views or plays the game  Development Main article  Game development See also  Video game industry practices Developers use various tools to create video games  here an editor to fine tune the virtual camera system  Video game development and authorship  much like any other form of entertainment  is frequently a cross disciplinary field  Video game developers  as employees within this industry are commonly referred  primarily include programmers and graphic designers  Over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program  including sound designers  musicians  and other technicians  as well as skills that are specific to video games  such as the game designer  All of these are managed by producers  In the early days of the industry  it was more common for a single person to manage all of the roles needed to create a video game  As platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material they can present  larger teams have been needed to generate all of the art  programming  cinematography  and more  This is not to say that the age of the  one man shop  is gone  as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets  34  where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited RAM or lack of dedicated 3D graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform  e g   some cellphones and PDAs   citation needed  With the growth of the size of development teams in the industry  the problem of cost has increased  Development studios need to be able to pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent  while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment  Typically  a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people  with some teams exceeding 100  In May 2009  one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450  35  The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines and unfinished products  citation needed  Downloadable content Main article  Downloadable content A newer phenomenon of withholding content from the game and then releasing it at a later date for additional funds not factored into the retail price began with digital video game distribution known as Downloadable Content  also known colloquially as  DLC    Studios may choose to utilize this to issue original content after the game is released  such as Rockstar Games with Grand Theft Auto IV  or Bethesda with Fallout 3  yet often opt instead to create content before the game is released to be intentionally withheld  such as Activision and Treyarch with Call of Duty  Despite knowing well public affection for a  Zombies  game mode  it was shipped with only one map for this game mode  and periodically releases new ones with  10 DLC   36  37  38  Modifications Main article  Mod  computer gaming  Many games produced for the PC are designed such that technically oriented consumers can modify the game  These mods can add an extra dimension of replayability and interest  Developers such as id Software  Valve Software  Crytek  Bethesda  Epic Games and Blizzard Entertainment ship their games with some of the development tools used to make the game  along with documentation to assist mod developers  The Internet provides an inexpensive medium to promote and distribute mods  and they may be a factor in the commercial success of some games  39  This allows for the kind of success seen by popular mods such as the Half Life mod Counter Strike  Cheating Main article  Cheating  video games  Cheating in computer games may involve cheat codes and hidden spots implemented by the game developers  40  41  modification of game code by third parties  42  43  or players exploiting a software glitch  Modifications are facilitated by either cheat cartridge hardware or a software trainer  42  Cheats usually make the game easier by providing an unlimited amount of some resource  for example weapons  health  or ammunition  or perhaps the ability to walk through walls  41  42  Other cheats might give access to otherwise unplayable levels or provide unusual or amusing features  like altered game colors or other graphical appearances  Glitches Example of a color glitch from the video game Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Main article  Glitch Software errors not detected by software testers during development can find their way into released versions of computer and video games  This may happen because the glitch only occurs under unusual circumstances in the game  was deemed too minor to correct  or because the game development was hurried to meet a publication deadline  Glitches can range from minor graphical errors to serious bugs that can delete saved data or cause the game to malfunction  In some cases publishers will release updates  referred to as patches  to repair glitches  Sometimes a glitch may be beneficial to the player  these are often referred to as exploits  Easter eggs Easter eggs are hidden messages or jokes left in games by developers that are not part of the main game  Theory Main article  Game studies Although departments of computer science have been studying the technical aspects of video games for years  theories that examine games as an artistic medium are a relatively recent development in the humanities  The two most visible schools in this emerging field are ludology and narratology  Narrativists approach video games in the context of what Janet Murray calls  Cyberdrama   That is to say  their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium  one that arises out of interactive fiction  Murray puts video games in the context of the Holodeck  a fictional piece of technology from Star Trek  arguing for the video game as a medium in which we get to become another person  and to act out in another world  44  This image of video games received early widespread popular support  and forms the basis of films such as Tron  eXistenZ and The Last Starfighter  Ludologists break sharply and radically from this idea  They argue that a video game is first and foremost a game  which must be understood in terms of its rules  interface  and the concept of play that it deploys  Espen J  Aarseth argues that  although games certainly have plots  characters  and aspects of traditional narratives  these aspects are incidental to gameplay  For example  Aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game Tomb Raider  saying that  the dimensions of Lara Croft s body  already analyzed to death by film theorists  are irrelevant to me as a player  because a different looking body would not make me play differently    When I play  I don t even see her body  but see through it and past it   45  Simply put  ludologists reject traditional theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the underlying set of rules  demands  and expectations imposed on the player  While many games rely on emergent principles  video games commonly present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within the context of the game  The term  emergent narrative  has been used to describe how  in a simulated environment  storyline can be created simply by  what happens to the player   46  However  emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games  In general  any place where event driven instructions occur for AI in a game  emergent behavior will exist  For instance  take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing  and they encounter an obstacle in the track  the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow and or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle  The programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam  yet one now exists in the game  Social aspects Demographics The November 2005 Nielsen Active Gamer Study  taking a survey of 2 000 regular gamers  found that the U S  games market is diversifying  The age group among male players has expanded significantly in the 25 40 age group  For casual online puzzle style and simple mobile cell phone games  the gender divide is more or less equal between males and females  Females have also been found to show an attraction to online multi player games where there is a communal experience  citation needed  More recently there has been a growing segment of female players engaged with the aggressive style of games historically considered to fall within traditionally male genres  e g   first person shooters   According to the ESRB almost 41  of PC gamers are women 47   see Girl gamer   When comparing today s industry climate with that of 20 years ago  women and many adults are more inclined to be using products in the industry  While the market for teen and young adult men is still a strong market  it is the other demographics which are posting significant growth  The Entertainment Software Association  ESA  provides the following summary for 2011 based on a study of almost 1 200 American households carried out by Ipsos MediaCT  48  The average gamer is 37 years old and has been playing for 12 years  Eighty two percent of gamers are 18 years of age or older  Forty two percent of all players are women and women over 18 years of age are one of the industry s fastest growing demographics  Today  adult women represent a greater portion of the game playing population  37 percent  than boys age 17 or younger  13 percent   Twenty nine percent of game players are over the age of 50  an increase from nine percent in 1999  Sixty five percent of gamers play games with other gamers in person  Fifty five percent of gamers play games on their phones or handheld device  A 2006 academic study  based on a survey answered by 10 000 gamers  identified the gaymers  gamers that identify as LGBT  as a significant demographic group   49  50  51  A followup survey in 2009 studied the purchase habits and content preferences of people in the group  52  53  54  Based on the study by NPD group in 2011  about 91 percent of kids aged 2 17 play games  55  Multiplayer Main article  Multiplayer video game Video gaming has traditionally been a social experience  Multiplayer video games are those that can be played either competitively  sometimes in Electronic Sports  or cooperatively by using either multiple input devices  or by hotseating  Tennis for Two  arguably the first video game  was a two player game  as was its successor Pong  The first commercially available game console  the Magnavox Odyssey  had two controller inputs  Since then  most consoles have been shipped with two or four controller inputs  Some have had the ability to expand to four  eight or as many as 12 inputs with additional adapters  such as the Multitap  Multiplayer arcade games typically feature play for two to four players  sometimes tilting the monitor on its back for a top down viewing experience allowing players to sit opposite one another  Many early computer games for non PC descendant based platforms featured multiplayer support  Personal computer systems from Atari and Commodore both regularly featured at least two game ports  PC based computer games started with a lower availability of multiplayer options because of technical limitations  PCs typically had either one or no game ports at all  Network games for these early personal computers were generally limited to only text based adventures or MUDs that were played remotely on a dedicated server  This was due both to the slow speed of modems  300 1200 bit s   and the prohibitive cost involved with putting a computer online in such a way where multiple visitors could make use of it  However  with the advent of widespread local area networking technologies and Internet based online capabilities  the number of players in modern games can be 32 or higher  sometimes featuring integrated text and or voice chat  MMOs can offer extremely high numbers of simultaneous players  Eve Online set a record with 54 446 players on a single server in 2010  56  Benefits This article s references may not meet Wikipedia s guidelines for reliable sources  Please help by checking whether the references meet the criteria for reliable sources   February 2012  Main article  Video game behavioral effects It has been shown that action video game players have better hand eye coordination and visuo motor skills  such as their resistance to distraction  their sensitivity to information in the peripheral vision and their ability to count briefly presented objects  than nonplayers  57  Researchers found that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with action games  involving challenges that switch attention between different locations  but not with games requiring concentration on single objects  It has been suggested by a few studies that online offline video gaming can be used as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of different mental health concerns  which   In Steven Johnson s book  Everything Bad Is Good for You  he argues that video games in fact demand far more from a player than traditional games like Monopoly  To experience the game  the player must first determine the objectives  as well as how to complete them  They must then learn the game controls and how the human machine interface works  including menus and HUDs  Beyond such skills  which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers  video games are based upon the player navigating  and eventually mastering  a highly complex system with many variables  This requires a strong analytical ability  as well as flexibility and adaptability  He argues that the process of learning the boundaries  goals  and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function  Indeed  most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player  and  contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification  games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books  58  Some research suggests video games may even increase players  attention capacities  59  Learning principles found in video games have been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the U S  education system  60  It has been noticed that gamers adopt an attitude while playing that is of such high concentration  they do not realize they are learning  and that if the same attitude could be adopted at school  education would enjoy significant benefits  61  Students are found to be  learning by doing  while playing video games while fostering creative thinking  62  The U S  Army has deployed machines such as the PackBot and UAV vehicles  which make use of a game style hand controller to make it more familiar for young people  63  According to research discussed at the 2008 Convention of the American Psychological Association  certain types of video games can improve the gamers  dexterity as well as their ability to problem solve  A study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were 27 percent faster at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors compared to those who did not play video games  A second study of 303 laparoscopic surgeons  82 percent men  18 percent women  also showed that surgeons who played video games requiring spatial skills and hand dexterity and then performed a drill testing these skills were significantly faster at their first attempt and across all 10 trials than the surgeons who did not play the video games first  64  Whilst many studies have detected superior mental aptitudes which   amongst habitual gamers  research by Walter Boot at the University of Illinois found that non gamers showed no improvement in memory or multitasking abilities after 20 hours of playing three different games  The researchers suggested that  individuals with superior abilities are more likely to choose video gaming as an activity in the first place   65 Unreliable   Discuss Controversy Main article  Video game controversy Like related forms of media  computer and video games have been the subject of frequent controversy and censorship  due to the depiction of graphic violence  sexual themes  advergaming  a form of advertising in games   consumption of drugs  consumption of alcohol or tobacco  propaganda  or profanity in some games  Among others  critics of video games often include parents  groups  politicians  organized religious groups  and other advocacy groups  Various games have been accused of causing addiction and even violent behavior  though how much ground this holds is debatable   Video game censorship  is defined as the use of state or group power to control the playing  distribution  purchase  or sale of video games or computer games  Video game controversy comes in many forms  and censorship is a controversial subject  Proponents and opponents of censorship are often very passionate about their individual views  Various national content rating organizations  such as the Entertainment Software Ratings Board or ESRB in North America  rate software for certain age groups and with certain content warnings  Some of these organizations are optional industry self regulation  such as the ESRB   while others are part of national government censorship organizations  Most video games display their rating on the front side of their packaging  However  parents are not always aware of the existence of these ratings  Not all ratings are considered accurate  Organizations such as What They Play and Common Sense Media aim to provide guidance and advice for parents  66  Ratings and censorship ESRB The Entertainment Software Rating Board  ESRB  gives videogames maturity ratings based on their content  For example  a game might be rated T for Teen if the game contained obscene words or violence  If a game contains explicit violence or sexual themes  it is likely to receive an M for Mature rating  which means that no one under 17 should play it  There is a rated  A O  games for  Adults Only  these games have massive violence or nudity  There are no laws that prohibit children from purchasing  M  rated games in the United States  Laws attempting to prohibit minors from purchasing  M  rated games were established in California  Illinois  Michigan  Minnesota  and Louisiana  but all were overturned on the grounds that the establishment of such laws were in violation of a child s First Amendment rights citation needed   However  many stores have opted to not sell such games to children anyway  Of course  video game laws vary from country to country  One of the most controversial games of all time  Manhunt 2 by Rockstar Studios  was denied a rating by the ESRB until Rockstar could make the content more suitable for a mature audience  Video game manufacturers usually exercise tight control over the games that are made available on their systems  so unusual or special interest games are more likely to appear as PC games  Free  casual  and browser based games are usually played on available computers  mobile phones  or PDAs  PEGI Pan European Game Information  PEGI  is a system that was developed to standardize the game ratings in all of Europe  not just European Union  although the majority are EU members   the current members are  all EU members  except Germany and the 10 accession states  Norway  Switzerland  Iceland is expected to join soon  as are the 10 EU accession states  For all PEGI members  they use it as their sole system  with the exception of the UK  where if a game contains certain material  67  it must be rated by BBFC  The PEGI ratings are legally binding in Vienna and it is a criminal offence to sell a game to someone if it is rated above their age  68  Germany  BPjM and USK Stricter game rating laws mean that Germany does not operate within the PEGI  Instead  they adopt their own system of certification which is required by law  The Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle  USK or Voluntary Certification of Entertainment Software  checks every game before release and assigns an age rating to it   either none  white   6 years of age  yellow   12 years of age  green   16 years of age  blue  or 18 years of age  red   It is forbidden for anyone  retailers  friends or parents alike  to allow a child access to a game for which he or she is underage  If a game is particularly violent  it may be referred to the BPjM  Bundespr fstelle f r jugendgef hrdende Medien   Federal Verification Office for Child Endangering Media  who may opt to place it on the Index upon which the game may not be sold openly or advertised in the open media  Unofficially  the titles are not  banned    adult gamers are still technically free to obtain the titles by other means  although it is still considered a felony to supply these titles to a child  Commercial aspects Game sales See also  Video game industry  List of best selling video games  and Golden age of video arcade games A typical retail display  in Geneva  Switzerland  with a large selection of games for several major consoles The three largest producers of and markets for computer and video games  in order  are North America  US and Canada   Japan and the United Kingdom  Other significant markets include Australia  Spain  Germany  South Korea  Mexico  France and Italy  69  Both India and China are considered emerging markets in the video game industry and sales are expected to rise significantly in the coming years  Irish are the largest per capita consumers of video games  70  Sales of different types of games vary widely between these markets due to local preferences  Japanese consumers tend to purchase much more console games than computer games  with a strong preference for games catering to local tastes  Another key difference is that  despite the decline of arcades in the Western world  see Golden age of video arcade games   arcade games remain the largest sector of the Japanese gaming industry  As of 2009  the Japanese gaming industry is worth  20 billion  including  6 billion from arcades   3 5 billion from console game sales  and  2 billion from mobile game sales  71  In South Korea  computer games are generally preferred over console games  especially MMORPG games and real time strategy games  There are over 20 000 Internet caf s in South Korea where computer games can be played for an hourly charge  Computer games are also preferred in China  which has a PC gaming industry worth  6 billion  the largest in the world  72  The NPD Group tracks computer and video game sales in the United States  It reported in 2004 that  Console and portable software sales   6 2 billion  up 8  from 2003 73  Console and portable hardware and accessory sales   3 7 billion  down 35  from 2003 73  PC game sales   1 1 billion  down 15  from 2006 74  PC games that are digitally distributed either directly or by networks such as Steam are not tracked by the NPD  and Valve does not list sales numbers for games downloaded through their service  Unauthorized distribution is also rampant on the PC  75  These figures are sales in dollars  not units  Unit shipments for each category were higher than the dollar sales numbers indicate  because more software and hardware was discounted than in 2003  But with the release of the next generation consoles in 2006  these numbers increased dramatically  The game and film industries are also becoming increasingly intertwined  with companies like Sony having significant stakes in both  A large number of summer blockbuster films spawn a companion game  often launching at the same time to share the marketing costs  The global market for console games has seen an average of 6 9 percent compound annual growth rate and is expected to become a  34 7 billion market in 2012 Online game sales are expected to grow at a larger rate of 16 9 percent  escalating from  6 6 billion in 2008 to  14 4 billion by 2012  The largest channel for growth  however  is in mobile gaming with a growth rate of 19 percent  estimated to grow from  5 6 billion in 2008 to  13 5 billion in four years  76  Criticism Video games have the problem of regional lockout  In Australia  while most DVD players are sold region free to accommodate local consumer rights legislation  77  video game consoles are still sold fully region protected  Some effort has been made to increase awareness of the issue  specifically to Nintendo of Australia  78  in the form of a formal report outlining the issues  published by Aaron Rex Davies  79  The report has gone on to gain a lot of attention in the public media  80  Museums There are many video game museums around the world  for example Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines in Moscow 81  or Computer Game Museum in Berlin  82  See also Video games portal Book  Video game Wikipedia books are collections
