11 References 12 External links 13 Related information Etymology The word Peru is derived from Bir   the name of a local ruler who lived near the Bay of San Miguel  Panama  in the early 16th century  6  When his possessions were visited by Spanish explorers in 1522  they were the southernmost part of the New World yet known to Europeans  7  Thus  when Francisco Pizarro explored the regions farther south  they came to be designated Bir  or Peru  8  The Spanish Crown gave the name legal status with the 1529 Capitulaci n de Toledo  which designated the newly encountered Inca Empire as the province of Peru  9  Under Spanish rule  the country adopted the denomination Viceroyalty of Peru  which became Republic of Peru after the Peruvian War of Independence  History Main article  History of Peru The earliest evidences of human presence in Peruvian territory have been dated to approximately 9 000 years BCE  10  The oldest known complex society in Peru  the Norte Chico civilization  flourished along the coast of the Pacific Ocean between 3 000 and 1 800 BCE  11  These early developments were followed by archaeological cultures such as Cupisnique  Chavin  Paracas  Mochica  Nazca  Wari  and Chim   In the 15th century  the Incas emerged as a powerful state which  in the span of a century  formed the largest empire in pre Columbian America  12  Andean societies were based on agriculture  using techniques such as irrigation and terracing  camelid husbandry and fishing were also important  Organization relied on reciprocity and redistribution because these societies had no notion of market or money  13  In 1532  a group of conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro defeated and captured Inca Emperor Atahualpa  Ten years later  the Spanish Crown established the Viceroyalty of Peru  which included most of its South American colonies  14  Viceroy Francisco de Toledo reorganized the country in the 1570s with silver mining as its main economic activity and Amerindian forced labor as its primary workforce  15  Peruvian bullion provided revenue for the Spanish Crown and fueled a complex trade network that extended as far as Europe and the Philippines  16  However  by the 18th century  declining silver production and economic diversification greatly diminished royal income  17  In response  the Crown enacted the Bourbon Reforms  a series of edicts that increased taxes and partitioned the Viceroyalty of Peru  18  The new laws provoked T pac Amaru II s rebellion and other revolts  all of which were defeated  19  In the early 19th century  while most of South America was swept by wars of independence  Peru remained a royalist stronghold  As the elite hesitated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish Monarchy  independence was achieved only after the occupation by military campaigns of Jos  de San Mart n and Sim n Bol var  20  During the early years of the Republic  endemic struggles for power between military leaders caused political instability  21  National identity was forged during this period  as Bolivarian projects for a Latin American Confederation floundered and a union with Bolivia proved ephemeral  22  Between the 1840s and 1860s  Peru enjoyed a period of stability under the presidency of Ram n Castilla through increased state revenues from guano exports  23  However  by the 1870s  these resources had been squandered  the country was heavily indebted  and political in fighting was again on the rise  24  Independence was proclaimed by Jos  de San Mart n in 1821  Peru was defeated by Chile in the 1879 1883 War of the Pacific  losing the provinces of Arica and Tarapac  in the treaties of Anc n and Lima  Internal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the Civilista Party  which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of Augusto B  Legu a  25  The Great Depression caused the downfall of Legu a  renewed political turmoil  and the emergence of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance  APRA   26  The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the military defined Peruvian politics for the following three decades  27  In 1968  the Armed Forces  led by General Juan Velasco Alvarado  staged a coup against president Fernando Belaunde  The new regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development but failed to gain widespread support  28  In 1975  General Francisco Morales Berm dez forcefully replaced Velasco  paralyzed reforms  and oversaw the reestablishment of democracy  29  During the 1980s  Peru faced a considerable external debt  ever growing inflation  a surge in drug trafficking  and massive political violence  30  Under the presidency of Alberto Fujimori  1990 2000   the country started to recover  however  accusations of authoritarianism  corruption  and human rights violations forced his resignation after the controversial 2000 elections  31  Since the end of the Fujimori regime  Peru has tried to fight corruption while sustaining economic growth  32  Government Main articles  Government of Peru and Politics of Peru Congress sits in the Palacio Legislativo in Lima  Peru is a presidential representative

Brazil to the east  Bolivia to the southeast  Chile to the south  and the Pacific Ocean to the west  The Andes Mountains run parallel to the Pacific Ocean  they define the three regions traditionally used to describe the country geographically  The costa  coast   to the west  is a narrow plain  largely arid except for valleys created by seasonal rivers  The sierra  highlands  is the region of the Andes  it includes the Altiplano plateau as well as the highest peak of the country  the 6 768 m  22 205 ft  Huascar n  49  The third region is the selva  jungle   a wide expanse of flat terrain covered by the Amazon rainforest that extends east  Almost 60  of the country s area is located within this region  50  Left  Alpamayo  a mountain peak in the Huascar n National Park Right  Man  National Park  a biosphere reserve  depicts the Peruvian rainforest  Most Peruvian rivers originate in the peaks of the Andes and drain into one of three basins  Those that drain toward the Pacific Ocean are steep and short  flowing only intermittently  Tributaries of the Amazon River are longer  have a much larger flow  and are less steep once they exit the sierra  Rivers that drain into Lake Titicaca are generally short and have a large flow  51  Peru s longest rivers are the Ucayali  the Mara  n  the Putumayo  the Yavar   the Huallaga  the Urubamba  the Mantaro  and the Amazon  52  Peru  unlike other equatorial countries  does not have an exclusively tropical climate  the influence of the Andes and the Humboldt Current cause great climatic diversity within the country  The costa has moderate temperatures  low precipitations  and high humidity  except for its warmer  wetter northern reaches  53  In the sierra  rain is frequent during summer  and temperature and humidity diminish with altitude up to the frozen peaks of the Andes  54  The selva is characterized by heavy rainfall and high temperatures  except for its southernmost part  which has cold winters and seasonal rainfall  55  Because of its varied geography and climate  Peru has a high biodiversity with 21 462 species of plants and animals reported as of 2003  5 855 of them endemic  56  Economy Main article

based on 2010 data  57  Historically  the country s economic performance has been tied to exports  which provide hard currency to finance imports and external debt payments  58  Although they have provided substantial revenue  self sustained growth and a more egalitarian distribution of income have proven elusive  59  According to 2010 data  31 3  of its total population is poor  including 9 8  that is extremely poor  60  Left  The seaport of Callao is the main outlet for Peruvian exports Right  Buildings in the financial district of San Isidro  Lima  Peruvian economic policy has varied widely over the past decades  The 1968 1975 government of Juan Velasco Alvarado introduced radical reforms  which included agrarian reform  the expropriation of foreign companies  the introduction of an economic planning system  and the creation of a large state owned sector  These measures failed to achieve their objectives of income redistribution and the end of economic dependence on developed nations  61  Despite these results  most reforms were not reversed until the 1990s  when the liberalizing government of Alberto Fujimori ended price controls  protectionism  restrictions on foreign direct investment  and most state ownership of companies  62  Reforms have permitted sustained economic growth since 1993  except for a slump after the 1997 Asian financial crisis  63  Services account for 53  of Peruvian gross domestic product  followed by manufacturing  22 3    extractive industries  15    and taxes  9 7    64  Recent economic growth has been fueled by macroeconomic
