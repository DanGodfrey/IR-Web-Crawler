their governing bodies and committees must abide by California s Brown Act  which governs the meetings of deliberative assemblies  The first notable concern of the neighborhood councils collectively was the opposition by some of them in March 2004 to an 18  increase in water rates by the city s Department of Water and Power  This led the City Council to approve only a limited increase pending independent review  More recently  some of the councils petitioned the City Council in summer 2006 to allow them to introduce ideas for legislative action  but the City Council put off a decision  The neighborhood councils have been allocated  45 000 each per year for administration  outreach and approved neighborhood projects  Crime See also  Crime in Los Angeles The LAPD during May Day 2006 in
