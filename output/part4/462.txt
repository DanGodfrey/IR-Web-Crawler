with US   Bermuda from space Bermuda    b r mju d    officially  the Bermudas or Somers Islands 1   is a British overseas territory in the North Atlantic Ocean  Located off the east coast of the United States  its nearest landmass is Cape Hatteras  North Carolina  about 1 030 kilometres  640 mi  to the west northwest  It is about 1 373 kilometres  853 mi  south of Halifax  Nova Scotia  Canada  and 1 770 kilometres  1 100 mi  northeast of Miami  Florida  Its capital city is Hamilton  Bermuda was discovered in 1505 by Spanish sea captain Juan de Berm dez after whom the islands are named  who claimed it for the Spanish Empire  Although he paid two visits to the archipelago  Berm dez never set foot on the uninhabited islands  Subsequent Spanish or other visitors are believed to have released the feral pigs that were abundant on the island when settlement began  The archipelago was settled by England in 1609  by the Virginia Company  which had established Jamestown on the Continent two years earlier  Administered as an extension of Virginia by the Virginia Company until 1614  and by its successor  the Somers Isles Company  from 1615 until 1684  Bermuda became a British colony following the 1707 unification of the Kingdom of England with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain  Since Virginia s independence  Bermuda is the oldest  and since the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997  the most populous  remaining British overseas territory  Its first capital  St George s  was established in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the Americas  4  Bermuda has an affluent economy  with off shore finance as its largest sector  followed by tourism  4  5  In 2005 Bermuda claimed to have the world s highest GDP per capita  but these statistics are difficult to verify as Bermuda is classified as a territory of the UK rather than an independent country  It has a subtropical climate  6  Bermuda makes up the easternmost point of the so called  Bermuda Triangle   a region of sea in which a number of aircraft and surface vessels have allegedly disappeared under mysterious circumstances  The island is prone to severe weather and powerful hurricanes  with widespread power outages  Contents 1 Geography 2 Climate 3 Flora and fauna 4 History 4 1 Pre settlement 4 2 Settlement by the British 4 3 Company colony

Sea  roughly 580 nautical miles  1070 km  670 mi  east southeast of Cape Hatteras on the Outer Banks of North Carolina and roughly 590 nautical miles  1100 km  690 mi  southeast of Martha s Vineyard  The island lies due east of Fripp Island  South Carolina  It has 103 km  64 mi  of coastline  There are two incorporated municipalities in Bermuda  the City of Hamilton and the Town of St George  Bermuda is divided into various  parishes   in which there are some localities called  villages   such as Flatts Village and Somerset Village  It is antipodal to Rottnest Island in Western Australia  Although usually referred to in the singular  the territory consists of 181 islands  with a total area of 53 3 square kilometres  20 6 sq mi   The largest island  Main Island  sometimes itself called Bermuda  Compiling a list of the islands is often complicated  as many have more than one name  as does the entire archipelago  which has also been known historically as La Garza  Virgineola  and the Isle of Devils   Somers Isles  is often rendered  Somers Islands   or mistaken for  Summer Isles    Despite its small land mass  there has been a tendency for place names to be repeated  there are  for example  two islands named Long Island  and St George s Town is located on St George s Island within St George s Parish  each known as St George s    edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Bermuda Bermuda has a humid subtropical climate 6  7  on the border of tropical climate  It s warmed by the nearby Gulf Stream  due to the westerlies  which carry warm  humid air eastwards over Bermuda  helping to keep winter temperatures above freezing  The climate is humid and  as a result  the summertime heat index can be high  even though mid August temperatures rarely exceed 30  C  86  F   Winters are mild and windy  with average daytime temperatures in January and February around 20  C  68  F   although cold fronts bring Arctic air masses that can result in rapid temperature drops  Atlantic winter storms  often associated with these cold fronts  can produce powerful  gusting winds and heavy rain  Factoring in the wind chill  the felt air temperature in winter can fall below freezing  0  C  32  F   even though the actual temperature rarely drops below 10  C  50  F   The lowest temperature recorded between 1949 and 1999 was 6 7  C  44  F   in February 1950  8  Bermuda is very susceptible to hurricanes  Its position along the Gulf Stream means that it is often directly in the path of hurricanes recurving in the westerlies  although they have usually begun to weaken as they approach the island  It is often affected by these hurricanes  although the island s small size means that direct landfalls are rare  The last hurricane to cause significant damage to Bermuda was category 3 Hurricane Fabian on 5 September 2003  The only source of fresh water in Bermuda is rainfall  which is collected on roofs and catchments  or drawn from underground lenses  and stored in tanks  Each dwelling usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation  Residents typically add bleach to make the water safe to drink  Average annual temperature of the sea is 23  C  73  F   from 20  C  68  F  in January to 28  C  82  F  in August  9  Climate data for Hamilton   capital of Bermuda Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Average high  C   F

mostly dominated by forests of Bermuda cedar  with mangrove swamps along its shores  Only 165 of the island s current 1000 vascular plant species are considered native  and of those 15  including the cedar  are endemic  The only indigenous mammals of Bermuda are five species of bats  all of which also occur in the eastern United States   Lasionycteris noctivagans  Lasiurus borealis  Lasiurus cinereus  Lasiurus seminolus and Perimyotis subflavus  12  Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda includes its national bird  the Bermuda Petrel  and the Bermuda Rock Skink  The skink was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda  discounting the marine turtles that lay their eggs on its beaches  It has recently been discovered  however  that a species of terrapin  which had been assumed to have been introduced  predated the arrival of humans on the archipelago  As this species spends most of its time in brackish ponds  there is some question as to whether it negates the skink s claim to be the only indigenous land vertebrate   edit  History Main article  History of Bermuda  edit  Pre settlement Bermuda was discovered in 1505 by Spanish explorer Juan de Bermudez  13  It is mentioned in Legatio Babylonica  published in 1511 by historian Pedro M rtir de Angler a  and was also included on Spanish charts of that year  Both Spanish and Portuguese ships used the islands as a replenishment spot for fresh meat and water  Legends of spirits and devils  now thought to have stemmed from the callings of raucous birds  most likely the Bermuda Petrel  or Cahow  and the loud noise heard at night from wild hogs  combined with perpetual storm wracked conditions and a surrounding ring of treacherous reefs  led to the archipelago being called the Isle of Devils  and may have contributed to the lack of any attempt at permanent settlement   edit  Settlement by the British John Smith wrote one of the first Histories of Bermuda  in concert with Virginia and New England  For the next century  the island is believed to have been visited frequently but not settled  After the failure of the first two English colonies in Virginia  a more determined effort was initiated by King James I of England  James VI of Scotland   who granted a Royal Charter to the Virginia Company  In 1609  a flotilla of ships left England under the Company s Admiral  Sir George Somers  and the new Governor of Jamestown  Sir Thomas Gates  to relieve the colony of Jamestown  settled two years before  Somers had previous experience sailing with both Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh  The flotilla was broken up by a storm  and the flagship  the Sea Venture  was wrecked off Bermuda  as depicted on the territory s coat of arms   leaving the survivors in possession of a new territory   William Shakespeare s play The Tempest is thought to have been inspired by William Strachey s account of this shipwreck    14  The island was claimed for the English Crown  and the charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include it  Most of the survivors of the Sea Venture carried on to Jamestown in 1610 aboard two Bermuda built ships  Among them was John Rolfe  who left a wife  Sarah Hacker  and child buried in Bermuda before marrying Pocahontas  a daughter of Powhatan  in Jamestown  Intentional settlement of Bermuda began with the arrival of the Plough  in 1612  St George s was settled in 1612 and made Bermuda s first capital  It is the oldest continually inhabited English town in the New World  4  In 1615  the colony was passed to a new company  the Somers Isles Company  The Somers Isles remains an official name for the colony  named after Admiral Somers  just as Gate s Bay and Fort Gates are named after Sir Thomas Gates   formed by the same shareholders  The close ties with Virginia were commemorated even after Bermuda s separation by reference to the archipelago in many Virginian place names  such as Bermuda City  and Bermuda Hundred  The first British coins in America were struck here   edit  Company colony Because of its limited land area  Bermuda has had difficulty with over population  In the first two centuries of settlement it relied on steady human emigration to keep the population manageable  It is often claimed that  before the American Revolution more than ten thousand Bermudians  over half of the population  emigrated  primarily to the American South  where Great Britain was displacing Spain as the dominant European imperial power  A steady trickle of outward migration continued  With seafaring being the only real industry  by the end of the 18th century at least a third of the island s manpower was at sea at any one time  The archipelago s limited land area and resources led to the creation of what may be the earliest conservation laws of the New World  In 1616 and 1620 acts were passed banning the hunting of certain birds and young tortoises  15  In 1649  the English Civil War raged and King Charles I was beheaded in Whitehall  London  The execution resulted in the outbreak of a Bermudian civil war  it was ended by militias  This created a strong sense of devotion to the crown for the majority of colonists and it forced those who did not swear allegiance  such as Puritans and independents  into exile in the Bahamas  16  Bermuda Gazette of 12 November 1796  calling for privateering against Spain and its allies  and with advertisements for crew for two privateer vessels  In the 17th century the Somers Isles Company suppressed shipbuilding  as it needed Bermudians to farm in order to generate income from the land  Agricultural production met with only limited success  however  The Bermuda cedar boxes used to ship tobacco to England were reportedly worth more than their contents  citation needed  The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of tobacco produced  Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century  but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture  This interference led to the islanders demanding  and receiving  the revocation of the Company s charter in 1684  the Company itself being dissolved   edit  Maritime economy After the dissolution of the Somers Isle Company  Bermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding  replanting farmland with the native juniper  Juniperus bermudiana  called Bermuda cedar  trees that grew thickly over the whole island  Establishing effective control over the Turks Islands  Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade that became the world s largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda s economy for the next century  Bermudian sailors relied on more than salt  however  They vigorously pursued whaling  privateering  and the merchant trade  Vessels sailed the normal shipping routes  but were required to engage an enemy vessel no matter the size or strength  and as a result many ships were destroyed  The Bermuda sloop became highly regarded for speed and maneuverability  The Bermuda sloop HMS Pickle  one of the fastest vessels in the Royal Navy  brought the news of the victory at Trafalgar and the death of Admiral Nelson back to England   edit  Fortress Bermuda An illustration of Devonshire Redoubt  Bermuda  1614 After the American Revolution  the Royal Navy began improving the harbours and in 1811 started building the large dockyard on Ireland Island  in the west of the chain  to serve as its principal naval base guarding the western Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes  During the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States  the British attacks on Washington  D C  and the Chesapeake  which prompted the writing of The Star Spangled Banner  were planned and launched from Bermuda  where the headquarters of the Royal Navy s  North American Station  had recently been moved from Halifax  Nova Scotia  The First Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps Contingent  raised in 1914  By the war s end  the two BVRC contingents had lost over 75  of their combined strength  In 1816  James Arnold  the son of Benedict Arnold  fortified Bermuda s Royal Naval Dockyard against possible U S  attacks  17  Today  the  Maritime Museum  occupies the Keep of the Royal Naval Dockyard  including the Commissioner s House  and exhibits artefacts of the base s military history  As a result of Bermuda s proximity to the southeastern U S  coast  it was regularly used by Confederate States blockade runners during the American Civil War to evade Union naval vessels and bring desperately needed war goods to the South from England  The old Globe Hotel in St George s  which was a centre of intrigue for Confederate agents  is preserved as a museum open to the public   edit  Economic and political development In the early 20th century  as modern transport and communication systems developed  Bermuda became a popular destination for wealthy American  Canadian and British tourists arriving by frequent steamship service  In addition  the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act enacted by the United States against its trading partners in 1930  cut off Bermuda s once thriving agricultural export trade  primarily lilies and fresh vegetables to the U S    spurring the overseas territory to develop its tourist industry  Bermuda mid 1920s After several failed attempts  in 1930 the first aeroplane reached Bermuda  A Stinson Detroiter seaplane flying from New York  it had to land in the ocean once because of darkness and then again to refuel  Navigation and weather forecasting improved in 1933 when the Royal Air Force established a station at Bermuda and operated float planes from the harbour in coordination with the British fleet  In 1936 Luft Hansa began to experiment with seaplane flights from Berlin via the Azores with continuation to New York City  18  In the late 1930s  Imperial Airways and Pan American World Airways began operating scheduled flying boat airline services from New York and Baltimore to Darrell s Island  Bermuda  In 1948  regularly scheduled commercial airline service by land based aeroplanes began to Kindley Field  now L F  Wade International Airport   helping tourism to reach its peak in the 1960s 1970s  By the end of the 20th century  international business had supplanted tourism as the dominant sector of Bermuda s economy  see Economy of Bermuda   The S S  Queen of Bermuda in Hamilton Harbour  December 1952 or January 1953 The S S  Queen of Bermuda departing the island in December 1952 or January 1953 The Royal Naval Dockyard  and the attendant military garrison continued to be an important component of Bermuda s economy until the mid 20th century  In addition to considerable building work  the armed forces needed to source food and other materials from local vendors  Beginning in World War II  U S  military installations also were located in Bermuda  see  Military  section  below  and Military of Bermuda   Universal adult suffrage and the development of a two party political system occurred in the 1960s  Before universal suffrage  adopted as part of Bermuda s Constitution in 1967  voting was based on property ownership  see  Politics  section  below  and Politics of Bermuda   On 10 March 1973  then Governor of Bermuda Richard Sharples was assassinated by local Black Power militants during a period

Executive authority in Bermuda is vested in the monarch and is exercised on her behalf by the Governor  The governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the British Government  The current governor is Sir Richard Hugh Turton Gozney KCMG CVO  he was sworn in on 12 December 2007  19  There is also a Deputy Governor  currently David ArkleyJP   20  Defence and foreign affairs remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom  which also retains responsibility to ensure good government  It must approve any changes to the Constitution of Bermuda  Bermuda now exists as an overseas territory of Britain  but it is the oldest British colony  In 1620  a Royal Assent granted Bermuda limited self governance  thus making the Parliament of Bermuda the fifth oldest in the world  behind only the Parliament of the United Kingdom  the Tynwald of the Isle of Man  the Althing of Iceland and Sejm of Poland  21  Of these  it is the only one to have met continuously as a legislature since its inception through to today  The State House  the home of Bermuda s parliament 1620 1815 Sessions House  current home of the House of Assembly and the Supreme Court The Constitution of Bermuda came into force on 1 June 1967 and was amended in 1989 and 2003  The head of government is the premier  A cabinet is nominated by the premier and appointed officially by the governor  The legislative branch consists of a bicameral parliament modelled on the Westminster system  The Senate is the upper house consisting of 11 members appointed by the governor on the advice of the premier and the leader of the opposition  The House of Assembly  or lower house  has 36 members elected by the eligible voting populace in secret ballot to represent geographically defined constituencies  Elections must be called at no more than five year intervals  The Progressive Labour Party won the most recent general election held on 18 December 2007  winning 22 of 36 seats in the House of Assembly  22  Following her victory at the Progressive Labour Party delegates  conference in October 2010  the current premier is Paula Cox  The One Bermuda Alliance serves in opposition  The Progressive Labour Party leadership favours independence from the United Kingdom  although polls have indicated that this is not supported by the population  While a referendum in 1995 on independence was defeated by a substantial margin  the Bermuda Industrial Union and the Progressive Labour Party  then in the Opposition  had called for a boycott of the referendum  having an unquantified impact on the result  There are few accredited diplomats in Bermuda  The United States maintains the largest diplomatic mission in Bermuda  comprising both the United States Consulate and the U S  Customs and Border Protection Services at the L F  Wade International Airport  The current U S  Consul General is Grace Shelton  who replaced Gregory W  Slayton as the U S  Chief of Mission in Bermuda in August 2009  Given that the United States is by far Bermuda s largest trading partner  providing over 71  of total imports  85  of tourist visitors  and an estimated  163 billion of U S  capital in the Bermuda insurance re insurance industry alone  and the fact that an estimated 5  of Bermuda residents are U S  citizens  which represents 14  of all foreign born persons   American diplomatic presence is seen as an important element in the Bermuda political landscape  A General Election must be held in Bermuda every five years  Following the PLP s re election in 2007  the next election must be held no later than 2012   edit  Role in international relations As a British Overseas Territory  Bermuda has no seat in the United Nations and is represented by Britain in matters of foreign affairs  To promote its economic interests abroad Bermuda maintains representative offices in key influential cities such as London 23  and Washington D C   24  Bermuda s proximity to the United States has made it the site of past summit conferences between British Prime Ministers and U S  Presidents  The first summit was held in December 1953  at the insistence of Prime Minister Winston Churchill  to discuss relations with the Soviet Union during the Cold War  Participants at the conference included Churchill  U S  President Dwight D  Eisenhower and French Premier Joseph Laniel  In 1957  a second summit conference was held  this time British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan arrived earlier than President Eisenhower  to make it clear that they were meeting on British territory  as tensions were still high regarding the previous year s conflict over the Suez Canal  It was said the two discussed the general situation of the world  Macmillan returned in 1961 for the third summit with President John F  Kennedy  who was familiar with Bermuda  having made numerous personal visits  The meeting was called to discuss Cold War tensions arising from construction of the Berlin Wall  The most recent summit conference in Bermuda between the two powers occurred in 1990  when British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met U S  President George Bush  25  Direct meetings between the President of the United States and the Premier of Bermuda have been rare  The most recent meeting was on 23 June 2008  between Premier Ewart Brown and President George W  Bush  Prior to this  the leaders of Bermuda and the United States had not met at the White House since a 1996 meeting between Premier David Saul and President Bill Clinton  26   edit  Asylum offered to four former Guant namo detainees Main article  Uyghur detainees at Guantanamo Bay  Bermuda On 11 June 2009  four Uyghurs who had been held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guant namo Bay detention camp  in Cuba were deported to Bermuda  27  28  29  30  The four men were among 22 Uyghurs who claimed to be refugees  who were captured in 2001 in Pakistan after fleeing the American aerial bombardment of Afghanistan  They were suspected of training to assist Taliban s military  They were cleared as safe for release from Guant namo in 2005 or 2006  But U S  domestic law prohibited deporting them back to China  their country of citizenship  because the U S  government determined that China was likely to abuse their human rights  In September 2008 the men were cleared of all suspicion  and Judge Ricardo Urbina in Washington ordered their release  However domestic opposition to their admittance to the United States was very strong  citation needed  and  until Bermuda and Palau agreed to accept them in June 2009  the U S  had failed to find a home for them  The secret bilateral discussions that led to prisoner transfers between the U S  and the devolved Bermuda government sparked diplomatic ire from the United Kingdom  which was not consulted on the move despite Bermuda being a British territory  The British Foreign Office issued the following statement   We ve underlined to the Bermuda Government that they should have consulted with the United Kingdom as to whether this falls within their competence or is a security issue  for which the Bermuda Government do not have delegated responsibility  We have made clear to the Bermuda Government the need for a security assessment  which we are now helping them to carry out  and we will decide on further steps as appropriate    edit  Caribbean Community Despite its location well north of the Caribbean  Bermuda became an associate member of the Caribbean Community  CARICOM  in 2003   31  32  This is a socio economic bloc of nations in the Caribbean  or near the Caribbean such as the Co operative Republic of Guyana  the Republic of Suriname  and Belize in Central America as full members  Bermuda 33  and the Turks and Caicos Islands which are in the Atlantic Ocean as Associate members of CARICOM  and the same goes for the Commonwealth of The Bahamas which is a full member of the Caribbean Community and also in the Atlantic  Among scholars who     the Caribbean  can be a socio historical category  commonly referring to a cultural zone characterised by the legacy of slavery and the plantation system  It embraces the islands and parts of the adjoining mainland and may be extended to include the Caribbean Diaspora overseas  34   edit  Armed forces Main article  Military of Bermuda Remembrance Day Parade  Hamilton  Bermuda Once known as the Gibraltar of the West  the defence of Bermuda remains the responsibility of the British government  For the first two centuries of settlement  the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet  which turned to Privateering at every opportunity  After the American Revolutionary War  Bermuda became the Royal Navy s Western Atlantic headquarters  before which the Bermuda government had maintained militia for the defence of the colony  Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers  however  these militias became superfluous and were disbanded following the War of 1812  At the end of the 19th century  the colony did raise volunteer units to form a reserve for the military garrison  Due to its strategic location in the North Atlantic Ocean  Bermuda was vital to the Allies  war effort during both world wars of the 20th century  serving as a marshalling point for trans Atlantic convoys  as well as a naval air base  By the Second World War  both the Royal Navy s Fleet Air Arm and the Royal Air Force were operating Seaplane bases on Bermuda  In May 1940  the U S  requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom  but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return  35  In September 1940  as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement  the United Kingdom granted the U S  base rights in Bermuda  Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement  but both were added to it  with no war material received in exchange  However  one of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the U S  Army built would be used jointly by the U S  and the UK  which it was for the duration of the war  with RAF Transport Command relocating there from Darrell s Island in 1943   Construction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of 5 8 km   2  sq mi  1 400 acres  of land  largely reclaimed from the sea  For many years  Bermuda s bases were used by U S  Air Force transport and refuelling aircraft and by U S  Navy aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines  first German and  later  Soviet  The principal installation  Kindley Air Force Base on the eastern coast  was transferred to the U S  Navy in 1970 and redesignated Naval Air Station Bermuda  As a naval air station  the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft  as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and Canadian Forces aircraft  The original NAS Bermuda on the west side of the island  a seaplane base until the mid 1960s  became the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex and provided optional anchorage and or dockage facilities for transiting U S  Navy  U S  Coast Guard and NATO vessels  depending on size   An additional U S  Navy compound known as Naval Facility Bermuda  NAVFAC Bermuda   a SOSUS station  was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility  Although leased for 99 years  U S  forces withdrew in 1995  as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the Cold War  Canada  which had operated a war time naval base  HMCS Somers Isles  on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay  St George s  also established a radio listening post at Daniel s Head  in the West End of the islands during this time  In the 1950s  after the end of World War II  the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed  A small Royal Navy supply base  HMS Malabar  continued to operate within the dockyard area  supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it  too  was closed in 1995  along with the American and Canadian bases  HMS Ambuscade at the Royal Naval Dockyard In both World War I and World War II  Bermudians served in the British armed forces  Amongst the latter was Major General Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert  Bermuda s highest ranking soldier  After the war  he was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment  A number of other Bermudians and children of Bermudians had preceded him into senior ranks  including Bahamian born Admiral Lord Gambier  and Bermudian born Royal Marines Brigadier Harvey  who  when promoted to that rank at age 39  following his wounding at the Anzio landings  became the youngest ever Royal Marine Brigadier  The Cenotaph in front of the Cabinet Building  in Hamilton  was erected in tribute to Bermuda s Great War dead  the tribute was later extended to Bermuda s Second World War dead  and is the site of the annual Remembrance Day commemoration  Today  the only military unit remaining in Bermuda is the Bermuda Regiment  an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century  Although the Regiment s predecessors were voluntary units  the modern body is formed primarily by conscription in which balloted males are required to serve for three years  two months part time  once they turn 18   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Bermuda Bermudian  50 Banknote Since switching from the Bermudian pound in 1970  Bermuda s currency has been the Bermudian dollar  which is pegged to the US dollar  US notes and coins are used interchangeably with Bermudian notes and coins within the islands for most practical purposes  however  banks levy a small exchange rate for the purchase of US dollars with Bermudian dollars  36  Bermudian notes carry the image of HM Queen Elizabeth II  The Bermuda Monetary Authority is the issuing authority for all banknotes and coins  as well as being responsible for the regulation of financial institutions  There is a permanent exhibition of Bermuda notes and coins at the Royal Naval Dockyard Museum  According to the Bermuda Government s Economic Statistics Division  Bermuda s GDP was  5 85 billion in 2007  or  91 477 per capita  giving Bermuda the highest GDP per capita in the world  3  The affordability of housing has become a prominent issue over the past few years  The CIA World Factbook lists the average cost of a house in June 2003 as  976 000  2  while real estate agencies have claimed that this figure had risen to  1 6  37  and to  1 845 million by early 2007  38  though such high figures have been disputed  39  Bermuda is an offshore financial centre  which results from its low direct taxation on personal or corporate income  The local tax system is based upon import duties  payroll taxes and consumption taxes  The legal system is derived from that of the United Kingdom  with recourse to English courts of final appeal  However  foreign private individuals cannot easily open bank accounts or subscribe to mobile phone or internet service  40  As the offshore domicile of many foreign companies  Bermuda has a highly developed international business economy  it is a financial exporter of financial services  primarily insurance  reinsurance  investment funds and special purpose vehicles  SPV   Finance and international business now constitute the largest sector of Bermuda s economy  4  However  in September 2009  it was reported that a growing number of companies were moving from Bermuda to Ireland as part of a search for  a more stable environment   41  Hamilton Large numbers of leading international insurance companies are based in Bermuda  making the territory one of the world s largest reinsurance centres  42  Those internationally owned and operated businesses that are physically based in Bermuda of which there are around four hundred are represented by the Association of Bermuda International Companies  ABIC   In total  over 15 000 exempted or international companies are currently registered with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda  Thanks to its favourable tax regime and a highly reactive regulatory framework Bermuda is the domicile of choice for the implementation of insurance related innovative solutions also known as Alternative Risk Transfer  ART   ART includes captive insurances  Finite Risk insurance and insurance securitisation such as Cat bonds  The Bermuda Stock Exchange  BSX   established in 1971  is now the world s largest fully electronic offshore securities market  with a current market capitalisation  excluding mutual funds  in excess of US 330 billion citation needed   There are four hundred securities listed on the stock exchange  of which almost three hundred are offshore funds and alternative investment structures attracted by Bermuda s regulatory environment  The Exchange specialises in listing and trading of capital market instruments such as equities  debt issues  funds  including hedge fund structures  and depository receipt programmes  The BSX is a full member of the World Federation of Exchanges and is located in an OECD member nation  It also has Approved Stock Exchange status under Australia s Foreign Investment Fund  FIF  taxation rules and Designated Investment Exchange status by the UK s Financial Services

of visitors are from Canada and the United Kingdom  Tourists arrive either by cruise ship or by air at L F  Wade International Airport  the only airport on the island  43   edit  Education The Bermuda Education Act 1996 requires that only three categories of schools can operate in the Bermuda Education system  aided school  has all or a part of its property vested in a body of trustees or board of governors and is partially maintained by public funding or  since 1965 and the desegregation of schools  has received a grant in aid out of public funds  maintained school  has the whole of its property belonging to the Government and is fully maintained by public funds  private school  not maintained by public funds and has not  since 1965 and the desegregation of schools  received any capital grant in aid out of public funds  The private school sector consists of 6 traditional private schools  two of which are religious schools  and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single gender school and another a Montessori school  Also  within the private sector there are a number of home schools which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation  The only boys  school opened its doors to girls in the 1990s and in 1996  one of the maintained public schools became a private school  Prior to 1965  the Bermuda school system was racially segregated and when the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965  two of the formally maintained  white  schools and both single sex schools opted to become private schools  The rest became part of the public school system and were either aided or maintained  At present there are 26 schools in the Bermuda Public School System  18 of which are primary schools  five are middle schools  two senior schools and one special school  There is also an Alternative Programme provided for students with behavioural challenges who cannot function in the public mainstream  There are two aided primary schools  two aided middle schools and one aided senior school  For higher education  the Bermuda College offers various associate degrees and other certificate programmes  44  Bermuda

membership is slated to allow Bermudian students to enter the University at an agreed upon subsidised rate possibly as early as the 2009 2010 school year  UWI also agrees that their Open Campus  online degree courses  would become open to Bermudian students in the future  with Bermuda becoming the 13th country to have access to the Open Campus  45  46   edit  Main sights One of Bermuda s pink sand beaches  at Astwood Park Bermuda s pink sand beaches and clear  cerulean blue ocean waters are popular with tourists and many of Bermuda s hotels are located along the south shore of the island  In addition to its beaches  there are a number of sightseeing attractions  Historic St George s is a designated World Heritage Site  Scuba divers can explore numerous wrecks and coral reefs in

Exploration Institute  the Botanical Gardens  lighthouses  and the Crystal Caves with its impressive stalactites and underground saltwater pools  It is not possible to rent a car on the island  however  visitors can hire scooters for use as private transport  or use public transport   edit  Arts and culture Main article  Culture of Bermuda Bermuda s culture is a mixture of the various sources of its population  Native American  Spanish Caribbean  Irish  and Scots cultures were evident in the 17th century  though ultimately eclipsed by the dominant Anglo Saxon culture  Today  the only language other than English that is spoken by any substantial part of the population is Portuguese  following one hundred and sixty years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands  primarily the Azores  though also from Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands   There are strong British influences  together with Afro Caribbean ones  A second wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th century  although  unlike the Blacks who immigrated from there as indentured servants  or who were imported as slaves in the 17th century  the more recent arrivals have mostly come from English speaking countries  albeit  most of the West Indian islands whose populations now speak English were then part of the Spanish Empire   This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change  and diversified Bermuda s culture  West Indian musicians introduced Calypso music when Bermuda s tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post Second World War aviation  While Calypso music appealed more to the visitors than to the locals  Reggae has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 1970s with the influx of Jamaican immigrants  Gombey dancers in Bermuda Bermuda s early literary history was largely limited to non Bermudian writers commenting on the island  These included John Smith s The Generall Historie of Virginia  New England  and the Summer Isles  1624   and Edmund Waller s poem  Battle of the Summer Islands  1645   48  49  In the 20th century  a large number of books were written and published locally  though few were aimed at a wider market than Bermuda  most of these being scholarly reference books  rather than creative writing   One Bermudian novelist  Brian Burland  has achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally  although the first notable  and historically important  book credited to a Bermudian was the History of Mary Prince  a slave narrative by a Bermudian woman  Mary Prince  which helped to end slavery in the British Empire  Bermuda s proximity to the United States  as well as its origin as part of Virginia  means that many aspects of US culture are reflected in  or incorporated into  Bermudian culture  Many non Bermudian writers have also made Bermuda their home  or have had homes here  including A J  Cronin and F  Van Wyck Mason  who wrote on Bermudian subjects  Bermuda has produced  or been home to  actors such as Oona O Neill  Earl Cameron  Diana Dill  Lena Headey  Will Kempe  and most famously  Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones  Other film and television personalities who were born  or have lived  in Bermuda include producer Arthur Rankin  Jr   and cartoonist and Muppet man Michael Frith  Music and dance are important in Bermuda  Noted musicians have included local icons The Talbot Brothers  who performed for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States  and appeared on Ed Sullivan s televised variety show  jazz pianist Lance Hayward  singer songwriter Heather Nova  tenor Gary Burgess  classical musician and conductor Kenneth Amis  and more recently  dancehall artist Collie Buddz  The dances of the colourful Gombey Dancers  seen at many events  are heavily influenced by African  Caribbean  Native American and British cultural traditions  In 1979  Gina Swainson was crowned  Miss World   Every year  Bermuda hosts an international film festival which shows many independent films  One of the festival s founders is film producer and director Arthur Rankin  Jr   co founder of the Rankin Bass production company  50  Bermuda watercolours painted by local artists are sold at various galleries  and elaborately hand carved cedar sculptures are another specialty  One such 7 ft  2 1 m  sculpture created by Bermudian artisan Chesley Trott is on display at the airport s baggage claim area  Local artwork may also be viewed at several galleries around the island  Alfred Birdsey was one of the more famous and talented water colourists  his impressionistic landscapes of Hamilton  St George s and the surrounding sailboats  homes  and bays of Bermuda are world renowned  Every Good Friday  Bermudians of all ages build kites  usually of a traditional Bermudian type  which are flown to symbolise Christ s ascent  A Bermudian kite is made to geometric designs  quite colourful  and is an art form as much as a recreational tool  Despite this  Bermudian kites are very airworthy  holding world records for altitude and duration of flight  citation needed   edit  Sports Main article  Sports and recreation in Bermuda Bermuda s national cricket team participated in the Cricket World Cup 2007 in the West Indies  Their most famous player is a 130 kilograms  290 lb  police officer named Dwayne Leverock  But

1990s  and Renegades  women s   Games are currently played at Warwick Academy  Bermuda u 19 team won the 2010 Caribbean Championships   edit  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Bermuda Demographics in Bermuda  at least in terms of race  is a thorny subject  complicated by unscientifically collected census data  the legacy of racism  general ignorance of ancestry  and the pressure to conform to racial identities  The current increasingly divisive racial politics further complicate the matter  and these facts must be born in mind when considering data based on census reports  A July 2005 estimate put Bermuda s population at 65 365  The ethnic makeup of Bermuda is 64 8  Black  34  28 8  White  and 6 4  multiracial  A significant segment of the White population is also of Portuguese ancestry  10    the result of immigration from Portuguese islands  especially the Azores  during the past 160 years  52  Some islanders  especially in St David s  trace their ancestry to Native Americans  Hundreds were shipped to Bermuda  possibly from as far as Mexico  The best known examples were the Algonquian peoples who were exiled from the New England colonies and sold into slavery in the 17th century  notably in the aftermaths of the Pequot War  and King Philip s War  Several thousand expatriate workers  principally from the UK  Canada  the West Indies  South Africa and
