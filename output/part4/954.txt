Alcoholism From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Alcoholism Classification and external resources  King Alcohol and his Prime Minister  c  1820 ICD 10 F10 2 ICD 9 303 MedlinePlus alcoholism MeSH D000437 Alcoholism is a broad term for problems with alcohol  and is generally used to mean compulsive and uncontrolled consumption of alcoholic beverages  usually to the detriment of the drinker s health  personal relationships  and social standing  It is medically considered a disease  specifically a neurological disorder  and in medicine several other terms are used  specifically  alcohol abuse  and  alcohol dependence   which have more specific definitions  1  In 1979 an expert World Health Organization committee discouraged the use of  alcoholism  in medicine  preferring the category of  alcohol dependence syndrome   2  In the 19th and early 20th centuries  alcohol dependence in general was called dipsomania  but that term now has a much more specific meaning  3  People suffering from alcoholism are often called  alcoholics   Many other terms  some of them insulting or informal  have been used throughout history  The World Health Organization estimates that there are 140 million people with alcoholism worldwide  4  5  Alcoholism is called a  dual disease  since it includes both mental and physical components  6  The biological mechanisms that cause alcoholism are not well understood  Social environment  stress  7 mental health  family history  age  ethnic group  and gender all influence the risk for the condition  8  9  Long term alcohol abuse produces changes in the brain s structure and chemistry such as tolerance and physical dependence  These changes maintain the person with alcoholism s compulsive inability to stop drinking and result in alcohol withdrawal syndrome if the person stops  10  Alcohol damages almost every organ in the body  including the brain  The cumulative toxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse can cause both medical and psychiatric problems  11  Identifying alcoholism is difficult because of the social stigma associated with the disease that causes people with alcoholism to avoid diagnosis and treatment for fear of shame or social consequences  The evaluation responses to a group of standardized questioning is a common method for diagnosing alcoholism  These can be used to identify harmful drinking patterns  including alcoholism  12  In general  problem drinking is considered alcoholism when the person continues to drink despite wanting to stop because of social or health problems caused by drinking  13  Treatment of alcoholism takes several steps  Because of the medical problems that can be caused by withdrawal  alcohol detoxification is carefully controlled and may involve medications such as benzodiazepines such as diazepam  Valium   14  People with alcoholism also sometimes have other addictions  including addictions to benzodiazepines  which may complicate this step  15  After detoxification  other support such as group therapy or self help groups are used to help the person remain sober  16  17  Thombs  1999  states according to behavioural sciences alcoholism is described as a  maladaptive behaviour   He explains this must not be confused with  misbehaviour   Behavioural scientists explain that addicts have a behaviour pattern that may lead to destructive consequences for themselves  their families and society  This does not label addicts as bad or irresponsible  18  Compared with men  women are more sensitive to alcohol s harmful physical  cerebral  and mental effects  19  Contents 1 Signs and symptoms 1 1 Long term misuse 1 1 1 Physical 1 1 2 Psychiatric 1 1 3 Social effects 1 2 Alcohol withdrawal 2 Causes 2 1 Genetic variation 3

links Signs and symptoms Long term misuse Main article  Long term effects of alcohol Some of the possible long term effects of ethanol an individual may develop  Additionally  in pregnant women  alcohol can cause fetal alcohol syndrome  Alcoholism is characterised by an increased tolerance of and physical dependence on alcohol  affecting an individual s ability to control alcohol consumption safely  These characteristics are believed to play a role in impeding an alcoholic s ability to stop drinking  10  Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health  causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide  The onset of depression is a common symptom  20  21  Physical Long term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms  including cirrhosis of the liver  pancreatitis  epilepsy  polyneuropathy  alcoholic dementia  heart disease  nutritional deficiencies  peptic ulcers 22  and sexual dysfunction  and can eventually be fatal  Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease  malabsorption  alcoholic liver disease  and cancer  Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption  23  24  Women develop long term complications of alcohol dependence more rapidly than do men  Additionally  women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men  25  Examples of long term complications include brain  heart  and liver damage 26  and an increased risk of breast cancer  Additionally  heavy drinking over time has been found to have a negative effect on reproductive functioning in women  This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation  decreased ovarian mass  problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle  and early menopause  25  Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking  27  28  Even though alcoholism can increase the risk of liver cancer  studies have shown that a moderate consumption of alcohol  1 serving day for women and 2 servings day for men  does not affect diabetes Type II greatly  Psychiatric Long term misuse of alcohol can cause a wide range of mental health problems  Severe cognitive problems are common  approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption  making it the second leading cause of dementia  29  Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function  and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time  30  Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics  with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances  The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders  Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal  but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence  31 Psychosis  confusion  and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse  which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia  32 Panic disorder can develop or worsen as a direct result of long term alcohol misuse  33  34  The co occurrence of major depressive disorder and alcoholism is well documented  35  36  37  Among those with comorbid occurrences  a distinction is commonly made between depressive episodes that remit with alcohol abstinence   substance induced    and depressive episodes that are primary and do not remit with abstinence   independent  episodes   38  39  40  Additional use of other drugs may increase the risk of depression  41  Psychiatric disorders differ depending on gender  Women who have alcohol use disorders often have a co occurring psychiatric diagnosis such as major depression  anxiety  panic disorder  bulimia  post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   or borderline personality disorder  Men with alcohol use disorders more often have a co occurring diagnosis of narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder  bipolar disorder  schizophrenia  impulse disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  42  Women with alcoholism are more likely to have a history of physical or sexual assault  abuse and domestic violence than those in the general population  42  which can lead to higher instances of psychiatric disorders and greater dependence on alcohol  Social effects See also  Drug related crime The social problems arising from alcoholism are serious  caused by the pathological changes in the brain and the intoxicating effects of alcohol  29  43  Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences  including child abuse  domestic violence  rape  burglary and assault  44  Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment  45  which can lead to financial problems  Drinking at inappropriate times  and behavior caused by reduced judgment  can lead to legal consequences  such as criminal charges for drunk driving 46  or public disorder  or civil penalties for tortious behavior  and may lead to a criminal sentence  An alcoholic s behavior and mental impairment  while drunk  can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends  This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce  or contribute to domestic violence  Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect  with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic s children  47  For this reason  children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems  For example  they can become afraid of their parents  because of their unstable mood behaviors  In addition  they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism  As a result of this failure  they develop wretched self images  which can lead to depression  48  Alcohol withdrawal Main article  Alcohol withdrawal syndrome As with similar substances with a sedative hypnotic mechanism  such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines  withdrawal from alcohol dependence can be fatal if it is not properly managed  43  49  Alcohol s primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor  promoting central nervous system depression  With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol  these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number  resulting in tolerance and physical dependence  When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly  the person s nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing  This can result in symptoms that include anxiety  life threatening seizures  delirium tremens  hallucinations  shakes and possible heart failure  50  51  Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved  especially dopamine  NMDA and glutamate  10  52  Acute withdrawal symptoms tend to subside after one to three weeks  Less severe symptoms  e g  insomnia and anxiety  anhedonia  may continue as part of a post withdrawal syndrome gradually improving with abstinence for a year or more  53  54  55  Withdrawal symptoms begin to subside as the body and central nervous system restore alcohol tolerance and GABA functioning towards normal  56  57  Causes A complex mixture of genetic and environmental factors influences the risk of the development of alcoholism  58  Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism  and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism  59  One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence  60  Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism are also more likely to begin drinking at an earlier age than average  61  Also  a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism  61  and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence  It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal  and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view  62  A high testosterone concentration during pregnancy may be a risk factor for later development of alcohol dependence  63  Severe childhood trauma is also associated with a general increase in the risk of drug dependency  58  Lack of peer and family support is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism developing  58  Genetics and adolescence are associated with an increased sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse  Cortical degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour  which may contribute to the development  persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders  There is evidence that with abstinence  there is a reversal of at least some of the alcohol induced central nervous system damage  64  Genetic variation See also  Human genetic variation Genetic differences exist between different racial groups which affect the risk of developing alcohol dependence  For example  there are differences between African  East Asian and Indo racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol  These genetic factors are believed to  in part  explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups  65  66  The alcohol dehydrogenase allele ADH1 B 3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol  The allele ADH1 B 3 is only found in those of African descent and certain Native American tribes  African Americans and Native Americans with this allele have a reduced risk of developing alcoholism  67 Native Americans however  have a significantly higher rate of alcoholism than average  it is unclear why this is the case  68  Other risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e g  trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates of alcoholism among Native Americans compared to alcoholism levels in caucasians  69  70  Pathophysiology Alcohol s primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor  promoting central nervous system depression  With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol  these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number  resulting in tolerance and physical dependence  50  The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes  Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations  BACs   42  This can be attributed to many reasons  the main being that women have less body water than men do  A given amount of alcohol  therefore becomes more highly concentrated in a woman s body  A given amount of alcohol causes greater intoxication for women due to different hormone release compared to men  26  Diagnosis See also  Addiction medicine Terminology Misuse  problem use  abuse  and heavy use refer to improper use of alcohol which may cause physical  social  or moral harm to the drinker  71  Moderate use is defined by The Dietary Guidelines for Americans as no more than two alcoholic beverages a day for men and no more than one alcoholic beverage a day for women  72  Some drinkers may drink more than 600 ml of alcohol per day during a heavy drinking period  73  The term  alcoholism  is commonly used  but poorly defined  The WHO calls alcoholism  a term of long standing use and variable meaning   and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO Expert Committee  The Big Book  from Alcoholics Anonymous  states that once a person is an alcoholic  they are always an alcoholic  but does not define what is meant by the term  alcoholic  in this context  In 1960  Bill W   co founder of Alcoholics Anonymous  AA   said  We have never called alcoholism a disease because  technically speaking  it is not a disease entity  For example  there is no such thing as heart disease  Instead there are many separate heart ailments  or combinations of them  It is something like that with alcoholism  Therefore we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity  Therefore we always called it an illness  or a malady a far safer term for us to use  74  In professional and research contexts  the term  alcoholism  sometimes encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence  75  and sometimes is considered equivalent to alcohol dependence  Talbot  1989  observes that alcoholism in the classical disease model follows a progressive course  if a person continues to drink  their condition will worsen  This will lead to harmful consequences in their life  physically  mentally  emotionally and socially  76  Johnson  1980  explores the emotional progression of the addict s response to alcohol  He looks at this in four phases  The first two are considered  normal  drinking and the last two are viewed as  typical  alcoholic drinking  77  78  Johnson s four phases consist of  Learning the mood swing  A person is introduced to alcohol  in some cultures this can happen at a relatively young age   and the person enjoys the happy feeling it produces  At this stage there is no emotional cost  Seeking the mood swing  A person will drink to regain that feeling of euphoria experienced in phase 1  the drinking will increase as more intoxication is required to achieve the same effect  Again at this stage  there are no significant consequences  At the third stage there are physical and social consequences  i e   hangovers  family problems  work problems  etc  A person will continue to drink excessively  disregarding the problems  The fourth stage can be detrimental  as Johnson cites it as a risk for premature death  As a person now drinks to feel normal  they block out the feelings of overwhelming guilt  remorse  anxiety  and shame they experience when sober  79  Other theorists such as Milam  amp  Ketcham  1983  focus on the physical deterioration of alcohol  They describe the process in three stages  Adaptive stage   The person will not experience any negative symptoms  and believe they have capacity for alcohol  Physiological changes are happening with the increase in tolerance  but this will not be noticeable to the drinker or others  Dependent stage   At this stage  symptoms build gradually  Hangover symptoms may be confused with withdrawal symptoms  Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness  drinking small amounts frequently  They will try and hide their problem from others  and will avoid gross intoxication  Deterioration stage   Various organs are damaged due to long term drinking  Medical treatment will be required  otherwise the pathological changes will cause death  In psychology and psychiatry  the DSM is the most common global standard  while in medicine  the standard is ICD  The terms they recommend are similar but not identical  Organization Preferred term s  Definition APA s DSM IV  alcohol abuse  and  alcohol dependence  alcohol abuse   repeated use despite recurrent adverse consequences  80  alcohol dependence   alcohol abuse combined with tolerance  withdrawal  and an uncontrollable drive to drink  80  The term  alcoholism  was split into  alcohol abuse  and  alcohol dependence  in 1980 s DSM III  and in 1987 s DSM III R behavioral symptoms were moved from  abuse  to  dependence   1  It has been suggested that DSM V merge alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence into a single new entry  81  named  alcohol use disorder   82  WHO s ICD 10  alcohol harmful use  and  alcohol dependence syndrome  Definitions are similar to that of the DSM IV  The World Health Organisation uses the term  alcohol dependence syndrome  rather than alcoholism  2  The concept of  harmful use   as opposed to  abuse   was introduced in 1992 s ICD 10 to minimize underreporting of damage in the absence of dependence  1  The term  alcoholism  was removed from ICD between ICD 8 ICDA 8 and ICD 9  83  Despite the imprecision inherent in the term  there have been attempts to define how the word  alcoholism  should be interpreted when encountered  In 1992  it was defined by the NCADD and ASAM as  a primary  chronic disease characterized by impaired control over drinking  preoccupation with the drug alcohol  use of alcohol despite adverse consequences  and distortions in thinking   84 MeSH has had an entry for  alcoholism  since 1999  and references the 1992 definition  85  AA describes alcoholism as an illness that involves a physical allergy 86  28  where  allergy  has a different meaning than that used in modern medicine  87   and a mental obsession  86  23 88  The doctor and addiction specialist Dr  William D  Silkworth M D  writes on behalf of AA that  Alcoholics suffer from a   physical  craving beyond mental control   86  XXVI A 1960 study by E  Morton Jellinek is considered the foundation of the modern disease theory of alcoholism  89  Jellinek s definition restricted the use of the word  alcoholism  to those showing a particular natural history  The modern medical definition of alcoholism has been revised numerous times since then  The American Medical Association currently uses the word alcoholism to refer to a particular chronic primary disease  90  Social barriers Attitudes and social stereotypes can create barriers to the detection and treatment of alcohol abuse  This is more of a barrier for women than men  Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition  to hide their drinking  and to drink alone  This pattern  in turn  leads family  physicians  and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic  25  In contrast  reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition  to display their drinking publicly  and to drink in groups  This pattern  in turn  leads family  physicians  and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic  42  Screening Several tools may be used to detect a loss of control of alcohol use  These tools are mostly self reports in questionnaire form  Another common theme is a score or tally that sums up the general severity of alcohol use  12  The CAGE questionnaire  named for its four questions  is one such example that may be used to screen patients quickly in a doctor s office  Two  yes  responses indicate that the respondent should be investigated further  The questionnaire asks the following questions  Have you ever felt you needed to Cut down on your drinking  Have people Annoyed you by criticizing your drinking  Have you ever felt Guilty about drinking  Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning  Eye opener  to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover  91  92  The CAGE questionnaire has demonstrated a high effectiveness in detecting alcohol related problems  however  it has limitations in people with less severe alcohol related problems  white women and college students  93  Other tests are sometimes used for the detection of alcohol dependence  such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire  which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire  It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use  94  The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test  MAST  is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol related offenses  95 driving under the influence being the most common  The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test  AUDIT   a screening questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization  is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally  Like the CAGE questionnaire  it uses a simple set of questions   a high score earning a deeper investigation  96  The Paddington Alcohol Test  PAT  was designed to screen for alcohol related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments  It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time  97  Genetic predisposition testing Psychiatric geneticists John I  Nurnberger  Jr   and Laura Jean Bierut suggest that alcoholism does not have a single cause including genetic but that genes do play an important role  by affecting processes in the body and brain that interact with one another and with an individual s life experiences to produce protection or susceptibility   They also report that fewer than a dozen alcoholism related genes have been identified  but that more likely await discovery  98  At least one genetic test exists for an allele that is correlated to alcoholism and opiate addiction  99  Human dopamine receptor genes have a detectable variation referred to as the DRD2 TaqI polymorphism  Those who possess the A1 allele  variation  of this polymorphism have a small but significant tendency towards addiction to opiates and endorphin releasing drugs like alcohol  100  Although this allele is slightly more common in alcoholics and opiate addicts  it is not by itself an adequate predictor of alcoholism  and some researchers argue that evidence for DRD2 is contradictory  98  DSM diagnosis The DSM IV diagnosis of alcohol dependence represents one approach to the definition of alcoholism  In part this is to assist in the development of research protocols in which findings can be compared to one another  According to the DSM IV  an alcohol dependence diagnosis is  13      maladaptive alcohol use with clinically significant impairment as manifested by at least three of the following within any one year period  tolerance  withdrawal  taken in greater amounts or over longer time course than intended  desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use  great deal of time spent obtaining  using  or recovering from use  social  occupational  or recreational activities given up or reduced  continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological sequelae  Urine and blood tests There are reliable tests for the actual use of alcohol  one common test being that of blood alcohol content  BAC   101  These tests do not differentiate alcoholics from non alcoholics  however  long term heavy drinking does have a few recognizable effects on the body  including  102  Macrocytosis  enlarged MCV  Elevated GGT Moderate elevation of AST and ALT and an AST  ALT ratio of 2 1 High carbohydrate deficient transferrin  CDT  However  none of these blood tests for biological markers is as sensitive as screening questionnaires  Prevention The World Health Organization  the European Union and other regional bodies  national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies in order to reduce the harm of alcoholism  103  104  Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse  Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased  the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse  Credible  evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended  Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents  and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested  105  Management Treatments are varied because there are multiple perspectives of alcoholism  Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments than  for instance  those who approach the condition as one of social choice  Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake  followed up with life training and or social support in order to help them resist a return to alcohol use  Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking  they must all be addressed in order to successfully prevent a relapse  An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy  attendance at self help groups  and ongoing development of coping mechanisms  The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence based zero tolerance approach  however  some prefer a harm reduction approach  106  Detoxification Main article  Alcohol detoxification Alcohol detoxification or  detox  for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs  such as benzodiazepines  that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal  Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients  Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients  Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism  and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse in order to reduce the risk of relapse  14  Psychological A regional service center for Alcoholics Anonymous  Various forms of group therapy or psychotherapy can be used to deal with underlying psychological issues that are related to alcohol addiction  as well as provide relapse prevention skills  The mutual help group counseling approach is one of the most common ways of helping alcoholics maintain sobriety  16  17 Alcoholics Anonymous was one of the first organizations formed to provide mutual  nonprofessional counseling  and it is still the largest  Others include LifeRing Secular Recovery  SMART Recovery  Women For Sobriety  and Secular Organizations for Sobriety  Rationing and moderation programs such as Moderation Management and DrinkWise do not mandate complete abstinence  While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking in this way  some return to moderate drinking  A 2002 U S  study by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism  NIAAA  showed that 17 7 percent of individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent more than one year prior returned to low risk drinking  This group  however  showed fewer initial symptoms of dependency  107  A follow up study  using the same subjects that were judged to be in remission in 2001 2002  examined the rates of return to problem drinking in 2004 2005  The study found abstinence from alcohol was the most stable form of remission for recovering alcoholics  108  A long term  60 year  follow up of two groups of alcoholic men concluded that  return to controlled drinking rarely persisted for much more than a decade without relapse or evolution into abstinence   109  Medications A variety of medications may be prescribed as part of treatment for alcoholism  Vitamin supplements  most importantly thiamine  Disulfiram  Antabuse  prevents the elimination of acetaldehyde  a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol  Acetaldehyde itself is the cause of many hangover symptoms from alcohol use  The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested  an extremely fast acting and long lasting uncomfortable hangover  This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine  A recent nine year study found that incorporation of supervised disulfiram and the related compound carbimide into a comprehensive treatment program resulted in an abstinence rate of over 50 percent  110  Calcium carbimide  Temposil  works in the same way as disulfiram  it has an advantage in that the occasional adverse effects of disulfiram  hepatotoxicity and drowsiness  do not occur with calcium carbimide  110  111  Naltrexone is a competitive antagonist for opioid receptors  effectively blocking the effects of endorphins and opiates  Naltrexone is used to decrease cravings for alcohol and encourage abstinence  Alcohol causes the body to release endorphins  which in turn release dopamine and activate the reward pathways  hence when naltrexone is in the body there is a reduction in the pleasurable effects from consuming alcohol  112  Naltrexone is also used in an alcoholism treatment method called the Sinclair Method  which treats patients through a combination of Naltrexone and continued drinking  113  Odansetron  a 5HT3 antagonist  is effective in the treatment of alcoholism  the combination of odansetron and naltrexone is superior than either treatment alone  114  Acamprosate  Campral  stabilises the brain chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising the actions of glutamate  a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the post withdrawal phase  115  By reducing excessive NMDA activity which occurs at the onset of alcohol withdrawal  acamprosate can reduce or prevent alcohol withdrawal related neurotoxicity  116  A 2010 review of medical studies found that acamprosate reduces the incidence of relapse amongst alcohol dependent persons  117  Benzodiazepines  while useful in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal  if used long term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism  Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines  This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management  118  Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting more than a quarter of people relapsed after being prescribed sedative hypnotics  Those who are long term users of benzodiazepines should not be withdrawn rapidly  as severe anxiety and panic may develop  which are known risk factors for relapse into alcohol abuse  Taper regimes of 6 12 months have been found to be the most successful  with reduced intensity of withdrawal  119  120  Dual addictions Alcoholics may also require treatment for other psychotropic drug addictions  The most common dual addiction in alcohol dependence is benzodiazepine dependence  with studies showing 10 20 percent of alcohol dependent individuals had problems of dependence and or misuse problems of benzodiazepines  Benzodiazepines increase cravings for alcohol and the volume of alcohol consumed by problem drinkers  121  Benzodiazepine dependency requires careful reduction in dosage to avoid benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome and other health consequences  Dependence on other sedative hypnotics such as zolpidem and zopiclone as well as opiates and illegal drugs is common in alcoholics  Alcohol itself is a sedative hypnotic and is cross tolerant with other sedative hypnotics such as barbiturates  benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines  Dependence upon and withdrawal from sedative hypnotics can be medically severe and  as with alcohol withdrawal  there is a risk of psychosis or seizures if not managed properly  15  Epidemiology Disability adjusted life year for alcohol use disorders per 100 000 inhabitants in 2004    no data    lt 50   50 170   170 290   290 410   410 530

public health problem facing many countries   The most common substance of abuse dependence in patients presenting for treatment is alcohol   106  In the United Kingdom  the number of  dependent drinkers  was calculated as over 2 8 million in 2001  123  About 12  of American adults have had an alcohol dependence problem at some time in their life  124  The World Health Organization estimates that about 140 million people throughout the world suffer from alcohol dependence  4  5  In the United States and Western Europe  10 to 20 percent of men and 5 to 10 percent of women at some point in their lives will meet criteria for alcoholism  125  Within the medical and scientific communities  there is broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a disease state  For example  the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that  drug addiction is a chronic  relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences  It results from a complex interplay of biological vulnerability  environmental exposure  and developmental factors  e g   stage of brain maturity    90  Alcoholism has a higher prevalence among men  though in recent decades  the proportion of female alcoholics has increased  26  Current evidence indicates that in both men and women  alcoholism is 50 60 percent genetically determined  leaving 40 50 percent for environmental influences  126  Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood  58  Prognosis A 2002 study by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism surveyed a group of 4 422 adults meeting the criteria for alcohol dependence and found that after one year  some met the authors  criteria for low risk drinking  even though only 25 5 percent of the group received any treatment  with the breakdown as follows  25 percent were found to be still dependent  27 3 percent were in partial remission  some symptoms persist   11 8 percent asymptomatic drinkers  consumption increases chances of relapse  and 35 9 percent were fully recovered   made up of 17 7 percent low risk drinkers plus 18 2 percent abstainers  127  In contrast  however  the results of a long term  60 year  follow up of two groups of alcoholic men by George Vaillant at Harvard Medical School indicated that  return to controlled drinking rarely persisted for much more than a decade without relapse or evolution into abstinence   128  Vaillant also noted that  return to controlled drinking  as reported in short term studies  is often a mirage   The most common cause of death in alcoholics is from cardiovascular complications  129  There is a high rate of suicide in chronic alcoholics  which increases the longer a person drinks  This is believed to be due to alcohol causing physiological distortion of brain chemistry  as well as social isolation  Suicide is also very common in adolescent alcohol abusers  with 25 percent of suicides in adolescents being related to alcohol abuse  130  Approximately 18 percent of alcoholics commit suicide  21  and research has found that over 50 percent of all suicides are associated with alcohol or drug dependence  The figure is higher for adolescents  with alcohol or drug misuse playing a role in up to 70 percent of suicides  131  History 1904 advertisement describing alcoholism as a disease  Historically the name dipsomania was coined by German physician Dr  C  W  Hufeland in 1819 before it was superseded by alcoholism  132  133  The term  alcoholism  was first used in 1849 by the Swedish physician Magnus Huss to describe the systematic adverse effects of alcohol  134  Alcohol has a long history of use and misuse throughout recorded history  Biblical  Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol  In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others its abuse was condemned  Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognised as causing social problems even thousands of years ago  However  the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century  In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures  paralysis and internal bleeding  In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America  In 2005 the cost of alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the USA economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year  more than cancer and obesity  135  Society and culture William Hogarth s Gin Lane  1751 The various health problems associated with long term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society  for example  money due to lost labor hours  medical costs  and secondary treatment costs  Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries  motor vehicle accidents  violence  and assaults  Beyond money  there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends  43  For instance  alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome  136  an incurable and damaging condition  137  Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse  collected by the World Health Organization  vary from one to six percent of a country s GDP  138  One Australian estimate pegged alcohol s social costs at 24  of all drug abuse costs  a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol s share was 41   139  One study quantified the cost to the UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as  18 5 20 billion  123  140  All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at  223 5 billion  141  Stereotypes of alcoholics are often found in fiction and popular culture  The  town drunk  is a stock character in Western popular culture  Stereotypes of drunkenness may be based on racism or xenophobia  as in the depiction of the Irish as heavy drinkers  142  Studies by social psychologists Stivers and Greeley attempt to document the perceived prevalence of high alcohol consumption amongst the Irish in America  143  Alcohol consumption is relatively similar between many European cultures  the United States  and Australia  In Asian countries that have a high gross domestic product  there is heightened drinking compared to other Asian countries  but it is nowhere near as high as it is in other countries like the United States  It is also inversely seen  with countries that have very low gross domestic product showing high alcohol consumption  144  In a study done on Korean immigrants in Canada  they reported alcohol was even an integral part of their meal  and is the only time solo drinking should occur  They also believe alcohol is necessary at any social event as it helps conversations start  145  Caucasians have a much lower abstinence rate  11 8   and much higher tolerance to symptoms  3 4 2 45 drinks  of alcohol than Chinese  33 4  and 2 2 1 78 drinks respectively   Also  the more acculturation there is between cultures  the more influenced the culture is to adopt Caucasians drinking practices  146  Peyote  a psychoactive agent  has even shown promise in treating alcoholism  This is interesting because alcohol replaced peyote as Native American s psychoactive agent of choice in rituals when peyote was outlawed  147  Research Topiramate  a derivative of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D fructose  has been found effective in helping alcoholics quit or cut back on the amount they drink  Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors  inhibits dopamine release  and enhances inhibitory gamma aminobutyric acid function  A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising  however as of 2008  data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first line agent for alcohol dependence  148  A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options  Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality of life ratings  149  See also Addictive personality Alcoholism in family systems Alcohol related traffic crashes Disease theory of alcoholism Drug addiction High
