destruction by The Infinata with the Library Of Gorth  the collective knowledge of the entire planet condensed into a small palm sized orb module  This library contains as yet undeveloped secrets to destroy the Infinata  As the scientist escapes  the Infinata gives chase knowing that if an advanced civilization could decipher the Library  it could mean his destruction  The Infinata sends his minions to disable the scientist s ship before he could escape  Having no choice  the scientist changes his course to the nearest galaxy  enters our solar system and heads to the one planet with

about a foot long  which falls straight to him  After catching the ship in his hand  Spider Man opens the small door  and the alien scientist  who is only an inch tall on Earth  emerges from it  The scientist communicates with Spider Man using mental telepathy that Spider Man deciphers with his spider sense  After giving Spider Man the Library Of Gorth  the alien then dies  Spider Man  after being made aware of the danger his galaxy could be in  decides to take the Library to the government authorities to be analyzed  However  The Infinata  who witnessed the arachnoid take charge of the Library  sends his demons to capture Spider Man and bring him to the realm of Dimentia Five  The Infinata s home  Upon arriving  Spider Man is interrogated by The Infinata as to the whereabouts of the Library Of Gorth  Spider Man then flees  but he is quickly re captured after the Infinata s demons zap him and bring him to the Infanta inside his citadel  Spider Man makes one last attempt to fight back but is defeated again by the horrors of the dimension and finds himself sinking in some form of quicksand  Knowing he has only moments to live  Spider Man racks his brain to find a way to defeat this powerful enemy and closes his eyes to think  Upon closing his eyes  he finds himself back in New York for a split second  which he tries again  yielding the same results  With that he discovers the Infinata s secret  Only fear makes the Infinata powerful  Dementia Five is all illusion  and that if one closes his eyes and his mind to that fear  he would be free  Spider Man relaxes  closes his eyes  and leaves the 5th Dimension  Defeated and fearful of retaliation  the Infinata flees the galaxy  searching for other galaxies and universes to terrorize and destroy  Meanwhile  Spider Man  having safely arrived back in his own world  delivers the Library Of Gorth  which he had hidden  the whole time  in one of his web shooters  to the proper authorities  50 Specialists and Slaves The
