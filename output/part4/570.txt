services of the United States  The U S  Navy is the largest in the world  its battle fleet tonnage is greater than that of the next 13 largest navies combined  4  The U S  Navy also has the world s largest carrier fleet  with 11 in service  one under construction  two planned   and one in reserve  The service had 328 516 personnel on active duty and 101 689 in the Navy Reserve in January 2011  It operates 286 ships in active service and more than 3 700 aircraft  2  The Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy  which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was essentially disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter  The United States Constitution provided the legal basis for a military force by giving Congress the power  to provide and maintain a navy   5  Depredations against U S  shipping by Barbary Coast pirates in the Mediterranean Sea spurred Congress to employ this power by passing the Naval Act of 1794 ordering the construction and manning of six frigates  6  These ships were used to end most pirate activity off the Barbary Coast  In the 20th century  American blue water navy capability was demonstrated by the 1907 1909 world tour of the Great White Fleet  The 21st century United States Navy maintains a sizable global presence  deploying in such areas as East Asia  the Mediterranean  and the Middle East  It is a blue water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world  engage in forward areas during peacetime  and rapidly respond to regional crises  making it an active player in U S  foreign and defense policy  The Navy is administratively managed by the Department of the Navy  which is headed by the civilian Secretary of the Navy  The Department of the Navy is itself a division of the Department of Defense  which is headed by the Secretary of Defense  Traditionally  the highest ranking naval officer is the Chief of Naval Operations  a position currently held by Admiral Jonathan Greenert  however one naval officer currently outranks him  The highest ranking naval officer is the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Admiral James Winnefeld  Contents 1 Mission 2 History 2

aggression and maintaining freedom of the seas   Mission statement of the United States Navy 7  From the New Recruits Handbook  The mission of the United States Navy is to protect and defend the right of the United States and our allies to move freely on the oceans and to protect our country against her enemies  The United States Navy serves as a seaborne branch of the Military of the United States  10 U S C    5062 prescribes the Navy s three primary areas of responsibility   The preparation of naval forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war   The maintenance of naval aviation  including land based naval aviation  air transport essential for naval operations and all air weapons and air techniques involved in the operations and activities of the Navy   The development of aircraft  weapons  tactics  technique  organization  and equipment of naval combat and service elements   U S  Navy training manuals state the mission of the U S armed forces is  to prepare and conduct prompt and sustained combat operations in support of the national interest   As part of that establishment  the U S  Navy s functions comprise sea control  power projection and nuclear deterrence  in addition to  sealift  duties  8   edit  History Main article  History of the United States Navy  edit  Origins It follows then as certain as that night succeeds the day  that without a decisive naval force we can do nothing definitive  and with it  everything honorable and glorious   George Washington 9  In the early stages of the American Revolutionary War  the establishment of an official navy was an issue of debate among the members of the Continental Congress  Supporters argued that a navy would protect shipping  defend the coast  and make it easier to seek out support from foreign countries  Detractors countered that challenging the British Royal Navy  then the world s preeminent naval power  was a foolish undertaking  6  Commander in Chief George Washington commissioned seven ocean going cruisers to interdict British supply ships  and reported the captures to the Congress  This effectively ended the debate in Congress as to whether or not to  provoke  the British by establishing a Navy as Washington s ships had already captured British ships  somewhat a provocation  While Congress deliberated  it received word that two unarmed British supply ships from England were heading towards Quebec without escort  A plan was drawn up to intercept the ships however  the armed vessels to be used were owned not by Congress  but by individual colonies  Of greater significance then was an additional plan to equip two ships that would operate under the direct authority of Congress to capture British supply ships  This was not carried out until 13 October 1775  when George Washington announced that he had taken command of three armed schooners under Continental authority to intercept any British supply ships near Massachusetts  With the revelation that vessels were already sailing under Continental control  the decision to add two more was made easier  10  the resolution was adopted and 13 October would later become known as the U S  Navy s official birthday  11  The Continental Navy achieved mixed results  it was successful in a number of engagements and raided many British merchant vessels  but it lost 24 of its vessels 12  and at one point was reduced to two in active service  13  As Congress turned its attention after the conflict towards securing the western border of the new United States  a standing navy was considered to be dispensable because of its high operating costs and its limited number of roles  6   edit  From reestablishment to the Civil War We ought to begin a naval power  if we mean to carry on our commerce   Thomas Jefferson 14  The United States would be without a navy for nearly a decade a state of affairs that exposed its merchant ships to a series of attacks by Barbary pirates  The sole armed maritime presence between 1790 and the launching of the U S  Navy s first warships in 1797 was the U S  Revenue Cutter Service  USRCS   the primary predecessor of the U S  Coast Guard  Although USRCS Cutters conducted operations against these pirates  the depredations far outstripped the abilities of the USRCS and Congress ordered the construction and manning of six frigates on 27 March 1794  12  three years later the first three were welcomed into service  the USS United States  USS Constellation and USS Constitution  USS Constitution battles HMS Guerriere in the War of 1812  Following an undeclared Quasi War with France  the U S  Navy saw substantial action in the War of 1812  where it was victorious in numerous single ship duels with the Royal Navy  The Navy drove all significant British forces off of Lake Erie and Lake Champlain and prevented them from becoming British controlled zones of conflict  Despite this  the U S  Navy was unable to prevent the British from blockading American ports and landing troops on American soil  6  After the war  the U S  Navy again focused its attention on protecting American shipping assets  sending squadrons to the Caribbean  the Mediterranean  South America  Africa  and the Pacific  12  During the Mexican American War the U S  Navy contributed by instituting blockades of Mexican ports  capturing or burning the Mexican fleet in the Gulf of California and capturing all major cities in Baja California peninsula later returned  In 1846 1848 the navy successfully used the Pacific Squadron under Commodore  Rear Admiral  Robert Stockton and its marines and blue jackets to facilitate the capture of California with large scale land operations coordinated with the local militia organized in the California Battalion  The navy conducted the U S  military s first large scale amphibious joint operation by successfully landing 12 000 army troops with their equipment in one day at Veracruz  Mexico  When larger guns were needed to bombard Veracruz Navy volunteers landed large navy guns and manned them in the successful bombardment of the city and its surrender  This successful landing and capture of Veracruz eventually opening the way for the capture of Mexico City and the end of the war  6  The United States Navy established itself as a player in American foreign policy through the actions of Commodore Matthew Perry in Japan  which resulted in the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854  Naval power would play a significant role during the American Civil War  where the Union had a distinct advantage over the Confederacy on the seas  6  A Union blockade on shipping handicapped the Southern effort throughout the conflict  The two American navies would help usher in a new era in world naval history by putting ironclad warships into combat for the first time  The Battle of Hampton Roads in 1862  which pitted USS Monitor against CSS Virginia  became the first engagement between two steam powered ironclads  13  Soon after the war  however  the U S  Navy s fleet slipped into obsolescence because of neglect   edit  20th century The Great White Fleet demonstrates U S  naval power in 1907  it was proof that the US Navy had blue water capability  Our ships are our natural bulwarks   Woodrow Wilson 9  A modernization program beginning in the 1880s with the first steel hulled warships stimulated the American steel industry and  the new steel navy  was born  15  This rapid expansion of the US Navy and its easy victory over the Spanish Navy in 1898 brought a new respect for American technical quality  Rapid building of at first pre dreadnoughts  then dreadnoughts brought the U S  in line with the navies of countries such as Britain and Germany  In 1907  most of the Navy s battleships  with several support vessels  dubbed the Great White Fleet  were showcased in a 14 month circumnavigation of the world  Ordered by President Theodore Roosevelt  it was a mission designed to demonstrate the Navy s capability to extend to the global theater  12  By 1911  the US had begun building the super dreadnoughts at a pace to eventually become competitive with even Britain  16  Columbia  personification of the United States  wearing a warship bearing the words  World Power  as her  Easter bonnet  on the cover of Puck  April 6  1901  The Navy saw little action during World War I  but nevertheless the strength of the United States Navy grew under an ambitious ship building program associated with the Naval Act of 1916  Naval construction  especially of battleships was later limited by the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 22  Saratoga and Lexington were built on the hulls of partially built battle cruisers that had been canceled by the treaty  Construction of aircraft carriers continued however  accelerating after the New Deal  which provided funding for the construction of the USS Yorktown  CV 5  and USS Enterprise  CV 6   These ships would not have been built had it not been for the demonstrations of the capability of aircraft against ships by Gen Billy Mitchell  By 1936  with the completion of the USS Wasp  CV 7   the U S  Navy possessed a carrier fleet of 165 000 tonnes displacement  although this figure was nominally recorded as 135 000 tonnes to comply with treaty limitations   edit  World War II Main article  United States Navy in World War II A recruitment poster from 1917  emphasizing the U S  Navy s transport function The U S  Navy grew into a formidable force in the years prior to World War II  with battleship production being restarted in 1937  commencing with the USS North Carolina  BB 55   Though ultimately unsuccessful  Japan attempted to allay this strategic threat with the 1941 surprise attack on Pearl Harbor  Following American entry into the war  the U S  Navy grew tremendously as the United States was faced with a two front war on the seas  It achieved notable acclaim in the Pacific Theater  where it was instrumental to the Allies  successful  island hopping  campaign  13  The U S  Navy participated in many significant battles  including the Battle of the Coral Sea  the Battle of Midway  the Solomon Islands Campaign  the Battle of the Philippine Sea  the Battle of Leyte Gulf  and the Battle of Okinawa  By 1943  the Navy s size was larger than the combined fleets of all the other combatant nations in World War II  17  By war s end in 1945  the United States Navy had added hundreds of new ships  including 18 aircraft carriers and 8 battleships  and had over 70  of the world s total numbers and total tonnage of naval vessels of 1 000 tons or greater  18  19  At its peak  the U S  Navy was operating 6 768 ships on V J Day in August 1945  20  Doctrine had significantly shifted by the end of the war  The United States Navy had followed in the footsteps of the navies of Great Britain and Germany which favored concentrated groups of battleships as their main offensive naval weapons  21  The development of the aircraft carrier and its devastating utilization by the Japanese against the U S  at Pearl Harbor however shifted U S  thinking  The Pearl Harbor attack destroyed or took out of action a significant number of U S N  battleships  This placed much of the burden of retaliating against the Japanese on the small number of aircraft carriers  22   edit  Cold War The potential for armed conflict with the Soviet Union during the Cold War pushed the U S  Navy to continue its technological advancement by developing new weapons systems  ships  and aircraft  United States naval strategy changed to that of forward deployment in support of U S  allies with an emphasis on carrier battle groups  23  The Navy was a major participant in the Vietnam War  blockaded Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis  and  through the use of ballistic missile submarines  became an important aspect of the United States  nuclear strategic deterrence policy  The United States Navy conducted various combat operations in the Persian Gulf against Iran in 1987 and 1988  most notably Operation Praying Mantis  The Navy was extensively involved in Operation Urgent Fury  Operation Desert Shield  Operation Desert Storm  Operation Deliberate Force  Operation Allied Force  Operation Desert Fox and Operation Southern Watch  The U S  Navy has also been involved in Search and Rescue Search and Salvage operations  some times in conjunction with vessels of other countries as well as with U S  Coast Guard ships  Two examples are the 1966 Palomares B 52 crash incident and search for the nuclear bombs  and the Task Force 71 of the Seventh Fleet operation in search for Korean Air Lines Flight 007 shot down by the Soviets on Sept  1  1983   edit  21st century When a crisis confronts the nation  the first question often asked by policymakers is   What naval forces are available and how fast can they be on station    Admiral Carlisle A  H  Trost 24  Six modern amphibious assault ships of the US Navy in formation The United States Navy continues to be a major support to U S  interests in the 21st century  Since the end of the Cold War  it has shifted its focus from preparations for large scale war with the Soviet Union to special operations and strike missions in regional conflicts  25  The Navy participated in Operation Enduring Freedom  Operation Iraqi Freedom  and is a major participant in the ongoing War on Terror  largely in this capacity  Development continues on new ships and weapons  including the Gerald R  Ford class aircraft carrier and the Littoral combat ship  Because of its size  weapons technology  and ability to project force far from U S  shores  the current U S  Navy remains a potent asset for the United States Commander in Chief  the President of the United States   In 2007  the U S  Navy joined with the U S  Marine Corps and U S  Coast Guard to adopt a new maritime strategy called A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower that raises the notion of prevention of war to the same philosophical level as the conduct of war  The strategy was presented by the Chief of Naval Operations  the Commandant of the Marine Corps and Commandant of the Coast Guard at the International Sea power Symposium in Newport  R I  on 17 October 2007  26  The strategy recognized the economic links of the global system and how any disruption due to regional crises man made or natural can adversely impact the U S  economy and quality of life  This new strategy charts a course for the Navy  Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent these crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to prevent negative impacts on the United States  In 2010  Chief of Naval Operations  Admiral Gary Roughead noted that demands on the Navy have grown as the fleet has shrunk and that in the face of declining budgets in the future  the US Navy must rely even more on international partnerships  27  In its 2013 budget request  the Navy has focused on retaining all eleven big deck carriers  at the expense of cutting numbers of smaller ships and delaying the SSBN replacement  28   edit  Organization Main article  Structure of the United States Navy Simplified flowchart of U S  Navy command structure The Navy falls under the administration of the Department of the Navy  under civilian leadership of the Secretary of the Navy  SECNAV   The most senior naval officer is the Chief of Naval Operations  CNO   a four star admiral who is immediately under and reports to the Secretary of the Navy  At the same time  the Chief of Naval Operations is one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  which is the second highest deliberatory body of the armed forces after the United States National Security Council  although it only plays an advisory role to the President and does not nominally form part of the chain of command  The Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operations are responsible for organizing  recruiting  training  and equipping the Navy so that it is ready for operation under the command of the Unified Combatant Commanders   edit  Operating forces Main article  List of units of the United States Navy There are nine components in the operating forces of the U S  Navy  the United States Fleet Forces Command  United States Pacific Fleet  United States Naval Forces Central Command  United States Naval Forces Europe  Naval Network Warfare Command  Navy Reserve  United States Naval Special Warfare Command  Operational Test and Evaluation Force  and Military Sealift Command  Fleet Forces Command controls a number of unique capabilities  including Military Sealift Command  Naval Expeditionary Combat Command  and Navy Cyber Forces  The United States Navy has six active numbered fleets   Third  Fifth  Sixth  Seventh Fleet and Tenth Fleets are each led by a three star vice admiral  and the Fourth Fleet is led by a rear admiral  These six fleets are further grouped under Fleet Forces Command  the former Atlantic Fleet   Pacific Fleet  Naval Forces Europe Africa  and Naval Forces Central Command  whose commander also doubles as Commander Fifth Fleet  the first three commands being led by four star full admirals  The United States First Fleet existed after the Second World War from 1947  but it was redesignated Third Fleet in early 1973  In early 2008  the Navy reactivated the United States Fourth Fleet to control operations in the area controlled by Southern Command  which consists of US assets in and around Central and South America  29   edit  Shore establishments USS Kitty Hawk  CV 63  docks at the U S  Navy base in Yokosuka  Japan  Shore establishments exist to support the mission of the fleet through the use of facilities on land  Among the commands of the shore establishment  as of April 2011  are the Naval Education and Training Command  the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command  the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command  the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  the Naval Supply Systems Command  the Naval Air Systems Command  the Naval Sea Systems Command  the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery  the Bureau of Naval Personnel  the United States Naval Academy  the Naval Safety Center  the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center  and the United States Naval Observatory  30  Official Navy websites list the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Chief of Naval Operations  CNO  as part of the shore establishment  but these two entities effectively sit superior to the other organizations  playing a coordinating role   edit  Relationships with other service branches  edit  United States Marine Corps A Marine F A 18 from VMFA 451 prepares to launch from the USS Coral Sea  CV 43  In 1834  the Marines came under the Department of the Navy  31  Historically  the United States Navy has had a unique relationship with the United States Marine Corps  USMC   partly because they both specialize in seaborne operations  Together the Navy and Marine Corps form the Department of the Navy and report to the Secretary of the Navy  However  the USMC is considered to be a distinct  separate service branch with its own uniformed service chief   the Commandant of the Marine Corps  CMC   a four star general  The Navy and Marine Corps have a distinct relationship  the USMC depends on the Navy for religious support  i e  chaplains  and medical support  i e   dentists  medical doctors  medics known as  Corpsmen  and medical service staff   thus officers and enlisted sailors from the Navy fulfill these roles  When attached to Marine Corps units deployed to an operational environment they generally wear Marine camouflage uniforms  but otherwise they wear Navy dress uniforms unless they opt to conform to USMC grooming standards  appearance   In the operational environment  as an expeditionary force specializing in amphibious operations  Marines often embark on Navy ships in order to conduct operations from beyond territorial waters  Marine units deploying as part of a Marine Air Ground Task Force  MAGTF  operate under the command of the existing Marine chain of command  Although Marine units routinely operate from amphibious assault ships the relationship has evolved over the years much as the  CAG   Commander of the Carrier Air Group Wing  does not work for the carrier Commanding Officer  CO   but coordinates with the ship s CO and staff  Some Marine aviation squadrons  usually fixed wing assigned to Carrier Air Wings  CVW  train and operate alongside Navy squadrons  flying similar missions and often flying sorties together under the cognizance of the  CAG   Aviation is where the Navy and Marine share the most common ground  since aircrews are guided in their use of aircraft by standard procedures outlined in series of publications known as NATOPS manuals   edit  United States Coast Guard Main article  United States Coast Guard Although the Posse Comitatus Act  which prevents federal military personnel from acting in a law enforcement capacity  applies only to the Army and Air Force  Department of Defense rules effectively require the Navy and Marine Corps to act as if Posse Comitatus did apply  preventing them from enforcing Federal law  The United States Coast Guard fulfills this law enforcement role in naval operations  It provides Law Enforcement Detachments  LEDETs  to Navy vessels  where they perform arrests and other law enforcement duties during Navy boarding and interdiction missions  In times of war  or when directed by the President  the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Navy and is subject to the orders of the Secretary of the Navy until it is transferred back to the Department of Homeland Security  32  At other times  Coast Guard Port Security Units are sent overseas to guard the security of ports and other assets  The Coast Guard also jointly staffs the Navy s Naval Coastal Warfare Groups and Squadrons  the latter of which were known as Harbor Defense Commands until late 2004   which oversee defense efforts in foreign littoral combat and inshore areas  Additionally  Coast Guard and Navy vessels sometimes operate together in search and rescue operations   edit  Personnel Main article  Personnel of the United States Navy  edit  Bases Main article  List of United States Navy installations Map of Navy bases in the United States The size  complexity  and international presence of the United States Navy require a large number of navy installations to support its operations  While the majority of bases are located inside the United States itself  the Navy maintains a significant number of facilities abroad  either in U S  controlled territories or in foreign countries under a Status of Forces Agreement  SOFA    edit  Eastern United States The second largest concentration of installations is in Hampton Roads  Virginia  where the Navy occupies over 36 000 acres  146 km   of land  Located in Hampton Roads are NS

side of Coronado  and is home to Headquarters for Naval Air Forces and Naval Air Force Pacific  the bulk of the Pacific Fleet s helicopter squadrons  and part of the West Coast aircraft carrier fleet  The Naval Special Warfare Center is the primary training center for SEALs  and is also located on Coronado  The other major collection of naval bases on the west coast is in Puget Sound  Washington  Among them  Naval Station Everett is one of the newer bases and the Navy states that it is its most modern facility  34 NAS Fallon  Nevada serves as the primary training ground for Navy Strike aircrews  and is home to the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center  Master Jet Bases are also located at NAS Lemoore  California and NAS Whidbey Island  Washington  while the carrier based airborne early warning aircraft community and major air test activities are located at NAS Point Mugu  California  The naval presence in Hawaii is centered on Pearl Harbor Naval Base  which hosts the headquarters of the Pacific Fleet and many of its subordinate commands  33   edit  United States territories Guam  an island strategically located in the Western Pacific Ocean  maintains a sizable U S  Navy presence  including Naval Base Guam  The westernmost U S  territory  it contains a natural deep water harbor capable of harboring even aircraft carriers in emergencies  35  Its naval air station was deactivated 36  in 1995 and its flight activities transferred to nearby Andersen Air Force Base  Puerto Rico in the Caribbean formerly housed Roosevelt Roads Naval Station  which was shut down in 2004 shortly after the controversial closure of the live ordnance training area on nearby Vieques Island  33   edit  Foreign countries The largest overseas base is in Yokosuka  Japan  37  which serves as the homeport for the Navy s largest forward deployed fleet and is a significant base of operations in the Western Pacific  European operations revolve around facilities in Italy  Sigonella and Naples   Spain and Greece with Naples as the homeport for the Sixth Fleet and CNRE Command Naval Region Europe  which are based in Gaeta  In the Middle East  naval facilities are located almost exclusively in countries bordering the Persian Gulf  with Manama  Bahrain serving as the headquarters of U S  Naval Forces Central Command and U S  Fifth Fleet  Guant namo Bay in Cuba is the oldest overseas facility

United States Navy ships See also  List of United States Navy ships and List of current ships of the United States Navy The names of commissioned ships of the U S  Navy are prefixed with the letters  USS   designating  United States Ship   40  Non commissioned  civilian manned vessels of the Navy have names that begin with  USNS   standing for  United States Naval Ship  The names of ships are officially selected by the Secretary of the Navy  often to honor important people or places  Additionally  each ship is given a letter based hull classification symbol  for example  CVN or DDG  to indicate the vessel s type and number  All ships in the Navy inventory are placed in the Naval Vessel Register  which is part of  the Navy List   required by article 29 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea   The Register tracks data such as the current status of a ship  the date of its commissioning  and the date of its decommissioning  Vessels that are removed from the register prior to disposal are said to be stricken from the register  The Navy also maintains a reserve fleet of inactive vessels that are maintained for reactivation in times of need  The U S  Navy was one of the first to install nuclear reactors aboard naval vessels  41  today  nuclear energy powers all of U S  active aircraft carriers and submarines  In the case of the Nimitz class carrier  two naval reactors give the ship almost unlimited range and provide enough electrical energy to power a city of 100 000 people  42  The U S  Navy previously operated nuclear powered cruisers and destroyers  but all have been decommissioned  The U S  Navy has identified a need for 313 combat ships  but under the current plans will only be able to afford 232 to 243  43   edit  Aircraft carriers USS Nimitz  CVN 68   a Nimitz class aircraft carrier The Navy has established a minimum requirement for 11 aircraft carriers  but will drop to 10 when the Enterprise retires before the Gerald R  Ford is ready for service  Former defense Secretary Robert Gates has questioned this need  44  A carrier is typically deployed along with a host of additional vessels  forming a carrier strike group  The supporting ships  which usually include three or four Aegis equipped cruisers and destroyers  a frigate  and two attack submarines  are tasked with protecting the carrier from air  missile  sea  and undersea threats as well as providing additional strike capabilities themselves  Ready logistics support for the group is provided by a combined ammunition  oiler  and supply ship  Enterprise class  1 in commission  Nimitz class  10 in commission  Gerald R  Ford class  1 under construction  at least 2 more planned   edit  Amphibious warfare vessels USS Bataan  LHD 5   a Wasp class amphibious assault ship Amphibious assault ships are the centerpieces of US amphibious warfare and fulfill the same power projection role as aircraft carriers except that their striking force comprises land forces instead of aircraft  They deliver  command  coordinate  and fully support all elements of a 2200 strong Marine Expeditionary Unit in an amphibious assault using both air and amphibious vehicles  Resembling small aircraft carriers  amphibious assault ships are capable of V STOL  STOVL  VTOL  tiltrotor  and rotary wing aircraft operations  They also contain a well deck to support the use of Landing Craft Air Cushion  LCAC  and other amphibious assault watercraft  Recently  amphibious assault ships have begun to be deployed as the core of an expeditionary strike group  which usually consists of an additional amphibious transport dock and dock landing ship for amphibious warfare and an Aegis equipped cruiser and destroyer  frigate  and attack submarine for group defense  Amphibious assault ships are typically named after World War II aircraft carriers  Tarawa class  1 in commission  4 decommissioned  Wasp class  8 in commission  America class  1 under construction  at least 3 more planned  Amphibious transport docks are warships that embark  transport  and land Marines  supplies  and equipment in a supporting role during amphibious warfare missions  With a landing platform  amphibious transport docks also have the capability to serve as secondary aviation support for an expeditionary group  All amphibious transport docks can operate helicopters  LCACs  and other conventional amphibious vehicles while the newer San Antonio class of ships has been explicitly designed to operate all three elements of the Marines   mobility triad   Expeditionary Fighting Vehicles  EFVs   the V 22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft  and the previously mentioned LCACs  Amphibious transport docks are named for cities  except for USS Mesa Verde  LPD 19   named for Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado  and three San Antonio class ships named in memory of the September 11  2001 attacks  USS San Antonio  LPD 17   a San Antonio class amphibious transport dock Austin class  2 in commission  10 decommissioned  San Antonio class  5 in commission  4 under construction  1 more planned  The dock landing ship is a medium amphibious transport that is designed specifically to support and operate Landing Craft Air Cushions  LCACs   though it is able to operate other amphibious assault vehicles in the United States inventory as well  Dock landing ships are normally deployed as a component of an expeditionary strike group s amphibious assault contingent  operating as a secondary launch platform for LCACs  All dock landing ships are named after locations in the United States  Whidbey Island class  8 in commission  Harpers Ferry class  4 in commission   edit  Surface vessels USS Port Royal  CG 73   a Ticonderoga class cruiser Cruisers are large surface combat vessels that conduct anti air anti missile warfare  surface warfare  anti submarine warfare  and strike operations independently or as members of a larger task force  Modern guided missile cruisers were developed out of a need to counter the anti ship missile threat facing the United States Navy  This led to the development of the AN SPY 1 phased array radar and the Standard missile with the Aegis combat system coordinating the two  Ticonderoga class cruisers became the first to equip Aegis and were put to use primarily as anti air and anti missile defense in a battle force protection role  Later developments of vertical launch systems and the Tomahawk missile gave cruisers additional long range land and sea strike capability  making them capable of both offensive and defensive battle operations  All cruisers since CG 47 have been named for famous battles with USS Thomas S  Gates  CG 51  as the only exception  Previously  cruisers were either named for cities  until CG 12   former important navy figures  CG 15 to CG 35   or states  CGN 36 to CGN 41   Ticonderoga class  22 in commission  5 decommissioned  Destroyers are multi mission medium surface ships capable of sustained performance in anti air  anti submarine  anti ship  and offensive strike operations  Like cruisers  the guided missile destroyers of the Navy are primarily focused on surface strikes using Tomahawk missiles and fleet defense through Aegis and the Standard missile  Destroyers additionally specialize in anti submarine warfare and are equipped with VLA rockets and LAMPS Mk III Sea Hawk helicopters to deal with underwater threats  When deployed with a carrier strike group or expeditionary strike group  destroyers and their fellow Aegis equipped cruisers are primarily tasked with defending the fleet while providing secondary strike capabilities  Destroyers have been named for important navy personnel and heroes since the USS Bainbridge  DD 1   Arleigh Burke class  60 in commission  one awaiting commissioning  one under construction  at least three more planned  USS Bainbridge  DDG 96   an Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer Modern U S  frigates mainly perform anti submarine warfare for carrier strike groups and amphibious expeditionary groups and provide armed escort for supply convoys and merchant shipping  They are designed to protect friendly ships against hostile submarines in low to medium threat environments  using torpedoes and LAMPS helicopters  Independently  frigates are able to conduct counterdrug missions and other maritime interception operations  The U S  Navy expects to retire and replace its current class of frigates by 2020 as the Littoral Combat Ships are introduced into operation  45  As in the case of destroyers  frigates are named after naval heroes  Oliver Hazard Perry class  19 in commission  8 in active reserve  24 decommissioned   edit  Submarines Main article  Submarines in the United States Navy USS Kentucky  SSBN 737   an Ohio class ballistic missile submarine The primary missions of submarines in the U S  Navy are peacetime engagement  surveillance and intelligence  special operations  precision strikes  battlegroup operations  and control of the seas  46  The U S  Navy operates two types  ballistic submarines and attack submarines  Ballistic submarines have only one mission  to carry and launch the nuclear Trident missile  Attack submarines have several tactical missions  including sinking ships and other subs  launching cruise missiles  gathering intelligence  and assisting in special operations  Earlier attack submarines  such as the Los Angeles class  are typically named for cities while Ohio class and later attack submarines are typically named for states  Attack submarines prior to the Los Angeles class were named for  denizens of the deep   while pre Ohio class ballistic missile submarines were named for  famous Americans   including foreigners with notable connections to the United States   Ohio class ballistic missile submarines  18 in commission  with 4 converted into guided missile submarines  Los Angeles class attack submarines  43 in commission  2

squadrons Carrier based aircraft are able to strike air  sea  and land targets far from a carrier strike group while protecting friendly forces from enemy aircraft  ships  and submarines  In peacetime  aircraft s ability to project the threat of sustained attack from a mobile platform on the seas gives United States leaders significant diplomatic and crisis management options  Aircraft additionally provide logistics support to maintain the Navy s readiness and  through helicopters  supply platforms with which to conduct search and rescue  special operations  anti submarine warfare  ASW   and anti surface warfare  ASuW   The U S  Navy began to research the use of aircraft at sea in the 1910s  with Lt Theodore G   Spuds  Ellyson becoming the first Naval aviator on 28 January 1911  and commissioned its first aircraft carrier  USS Langley  in 1922  47  United States naval aviation fully came of age in World War II  when it became clear following the Attack on Pearl Harbor  the Battle of the Coral Sea  and the Battle of Midway that aircraft carriers and the planes that they carried had replaced the battleship as the greatest weapon on the seas  Leading Navy aircraft in World War II included the Grumman F4F Wildcat  the Grumman F6F Hellcat  the Chance Vought F4U Corsair  the Douglas SBD Dauntless  and the Grumman TBF Avenger  Navy aircraft also played a significant role in conflicts during the following Cold War years  with the F 4 Phantom II and the F 14 Tomcat becoming military icons of the era  The Navy s current primary fighter and attack airplanes are the multi mission F A 18C D Hornet and its newer cousin  the F A 18E F Super Hornet  The F 35 Lightning II is presently under development and is scheduled to replace the C and D versions of the Hornet beginning in 2012  48  The Aircraft Investment Plan sees Naval aviation growing from 30 percent of current aviation forces to half of all procurement funding over the next three decades  49   edit  Weapons Main article  List of United States Navy weapons Current U S  Navy shipboard weapons systems are almost entirely focused on missiles  both as a weapon and as a threat  In an offensive role  missiles are intended to strike targets at long distances with accuracy and precision  Because they are unmanned weapons  missiles allow for attacks on heavily defended targets without risk to human pilots  Land strikes are the domain of the BGM 109 Tomahawk  which was first deployed in the 1980s and is continually being updated to increase its capabilities  For anti ship strikes  the Navy s dedicated missile is the Harpoon missile  To defend against enemy missile attack  the Navy operates a number of systems that are all coordinated by the Aegis combat system  Medium long range defense is provided by the Standard Missile 2  which has been deployed since the 1980s  The Standard missile doubles as the primary shipboard anti aircraft weapon and is undergoing development for use in theater ballistic missile defense  Short range defense against missiles is provided by the Phalanx CIWS and the more recently developed RIM 162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile  In addition to missiles  the Navy employs Mark 46 and Mark 50 torpedoes and various types of naval mines  Aviation Ordnancemen loading GBU 12 bombs  Naval fixed wing aircraft employ much of the same weapons as the United States Air Force for both air to air and air to surface combat  Air engagements are handled by the heat seeking Sidewinder and the radar guided AMRAAM missiles along with the M61 Vulcan cannon for close range dogfighting  For surface strikes  Navy aircraft utilize a combination of missiles  smart bombs  and dumb bombs  On the list of available missiles are the Maverick  SLAM ER and JSOW  Smart bombs include the GPS guided JDAM and the laser guided Paveway series  Unguided munitions such as dumb bombs and cluster bombs make up the rest of the weapons deployed by fixed wing aircraft  Rotary aircraft weapons are focused on anti submarine warfare  ASW  and light to medium surface engagements  To combat submarines  helicopters use Mark 46 and Mark 50 torpedoes  Against small watercraft  they utilize Hellfire and Penguin air to surface missiles  Helicopters also employ various types of mounted anti personnel machine guns  including the M60  M240  GAU 16 A  and GAU 17 A  Nuclear weapons in the U S  Navy arsenal are deployed through ballistic missile submarines and aircraft  The Ohio class submarine carries the latest iteration of the Trident missile  a three stage  underwater launched  nuclear ICBM with MIRV capability  the current Trident II  D5  version is expected to be in service past 2020  50  The Navy s other nuclear weapon is the air deployed B61 nuclear bomb  The B61 is a thermonuclear device that can be dropped by strike aircraft such as the F A 18 Hornet and Super Hornet at high speed from a large range of altitudes  It can be released through free fall or parachute and can be set to detonate in the air or on the ground   edit  Naval Jack Former U S  Naval Jack The Lone Sailor at the United States Navy Memorial in Washington D C  The current naval jack of the United States is the First Navy Jack  traditionally regarded as having been used during the American Revolutionary War  On 31 May 2002  Secretary of the Navy Gordon England directed all U S  naval ships to fly the First Navy Jack for the duration of the  War on Terror   Many ships chose to shift colors later that year on the first anniversary of the September 11  2001 attacks  The previous naval jack was a blue field with 50 white stars  identical to the canton of the ensign  the flag of the United States  both in appearance and size  and continues to remain in use with vessels of the U S  Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  A jack of similar design was used in 1794  though with 13 stars arranged in a 3 2 3 2 3 pattern  When a ship is moored or anchored  the jack is flown from the bow of the ship while the ensign is flown from the stern  When underway  the ensign is raised on the mainmast  The First Naval Jack  however  has always been flown on the oldest ship in the active American fleet  currently the USS Constitution   edit  Notable sailors Main article  List of United States Navy people Many past and present United States historical figures have served in the Navy  Notable officers include John Paul Jones  John Barry  Continental Navy officer and first flag officer of the United States Navy   51 James Lawrence  whose last words  don t give up the ship  are memorialized in Bancroft Hall at the United States Naval Academy   Stephen Decatur  Jr   David Farragut  David Dixon Porter  Oliver Hazard Perry  Commodore Matthew Perry  whose Black Ships forced the opening of Japan   and Chester Nimitz  Admiral of the Pacific Fleet in World War II  A number of presidents served in the Navy before or early in their political careers  including John F  Kennedy  who commanded the famous PT 109   Lyndon B  Johnson  Richard Nixon  Gerald Ford  Jimmy Carter  and George H W  Bush  Both Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D  Roosevelt were the Assistant Secretary of the Navy prior to their presidencies  Many members of Congress served in the Navy  notably U S  Senators Bob Kerrey  John McCain  and John Kerry  Other notable former members of the U S  Navy include astronauts  entertainers  authors  and professional athletes such as David Robinson and Roger Staubach  Military of the United States portal United States Navy portal  edit  References   Precedence of
