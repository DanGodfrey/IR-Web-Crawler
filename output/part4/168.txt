Old Slavic root  serb   meaning  same   8  Another proposed etymology is that of the Indo European root  ser   to watch over  protect   akin to Latin servare  to keep  guard  protect  preserve

in the Ottoman Empire  the growing intensity of the Austro Russian rivalry in the Balkans  the intermittent warfare which consumed the energies of French and Russian Empires and the outbreak of protracted hostilities between the Porte and Russia are but a few of the major international developments which directly or indirectly influenced the course of the Serbian revolt  27  During the First Serbian Uprising  or the first phase of the revolt  led by Duke Kara or e Petrovi   Serbia was independent for almost a decade before the Ottoman army was able to reoccupy the country  Shortly after this  the Second Serbian Uprising began  Led by Milo  Obrenovi   it ended in 1815 with a compromise between the Serbian revolutionaries and the Ottoman authorities  German historian Leopold von Ranke published his book  The Serbian revolution  in 1829  28  They were the easternmost bourgeois revolutions in the 19th century world  29  Likewise  Serbia was one of the first nations in the Balkans to abolish feudalism  30  The Convention of Ackerman in 1826  the Treaty of Adrianople in 1829 and finally  the Hatt i Sharif  recognized the suzerainty of Serbia with Milo  Obrenovi  I as its hereditary Prince  31  32  The struggle for liberty  a more modern society and a nation state in Serbia won a victory under first constitution in the Balkans on 15 February 1835  It was replaced by a more

Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip  a Serbian Nationalist and member of the Young Bosnia organization  led to Austria Hungary declaring war on Serbia  36  In defense of its ally Serbia  Russia started to mobilize its troops  which resulted in Austria Hungary s ally Germany declaring war on Russia  The retaliation by Austria Hungary against Serbia activated a series of military alliances that set off a chain reaction of war declarations across the continent  leading to the outbreak of World War I within a month  37  Serbia won the first major battles of World War I  including the Battle of Cer and Battle of Kolubara   marking the first Allied victories against the Central Powers in World War I  38  Despite initial success  it was eventually overpowered by the joint forces of the German Empire

Yugoslavia severely deteriorated during World War II as a result of the creation of the Axis puppet state of the Independent State of Croatia  NDH  that comprised most of present day Croatia  Bosnia and Herzegovina  and parts of present day Serbia  The NDH committed large scale persecution and genocide of Serbs  Jews  and Roma  51  The estimate of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum indicates that between 330 000 and 390 000 ethnic Serb residents of Croatia  Bosnia and parts of Serbia  primarily the Syrmia region  were murdered during the Usta e genocide campaign  52  same figures are supported by the Jewish Virtual Library  53  54  reports that more than 500 000 Serbs were killed overall  whereas official Yugoslav sources used to estimate more than 700 000 victims  mostly Serbs  The Jasenovac memorial so far lists 75 159 names killed at the this concentration camp alone  55  out of around 100 000 estimated victims  75  of whom were of Serbian origin   56  In April 2003 Croatian president Stjepan Mesi  apologized on behalf of Croatia to the victims of Jasenovac  57  In 2006  on the same occasion  he added that to every visitor to Jasenovac it must be clear that Holocaust  genocide and war crimes took place there  58  Out of roughly 1 000 000 casualties in all of Yugoslavia up until 1944  59  60  around 250 000 were citizens of Serbia of different

politician in Tito era Yugoslavia was Aleksandar Rankovi   a high ranking official in the federal communist party and one of the  big four  Yugoslav leaders  alongside Josip Broz Tito  Edvard Kardelj  and Milovan  ilas  69  Rankovi  served as head of the UDBA internal security organization and served as vice president of Yugoslavia from 1963 to 1966  69  In 1950  Rankovi  as minister of interior reported that since 1945 the Yugoslav communist regime had arrested five million people  70  For years Rankovi  served as Tito s right hand man and supported Tito s decision to break Yugoslavia away from domination by Soviet Union by having the UDBA obstruct the USSR s efforts to infiltrate state institutions and communist party  71  These actions resulted in the Cominform accusing the Yugoslav government of being dominated by a  Tito Rankovi  clique  that they accused of being a  fascist regime   72  He supported a centralized Yugoslavia and opposed efforts that promoted decentralization that he deemed to be against the interests of Serb unity  69  Rankovi  sought to secure the position of the Serbs in Kosovo and gave them dominance in Kosovo s nomenklatura  69  Rankovi  s power and agenda waned in the 1960s with the rise to power of reformers who sought decentralization and to preserve the right of national self determination of the peoples of Yugoslavia  73  In response to his opposition to decentralization  the Yugoslav government removed Rankovi  from office in 1966 on various claims  including that he was spying on Tito  73  Rankovi  s dismissal was highly unpopular amongst Serbs  73  Pro decentralization reformers in Yugoslavia  especially from Slovenia and Croatia succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralization of powers  creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina  and recognizing a Yugoslav Muslim nationality  73  As a result of these reforms  there was a massive overhaul of Kosovo s nomenklatura and police  that shifted from being Serb dominated to ethnic Albanian dominated through firing Serbs in large scale  73  Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest  including the creation of the University of Pristina as an Albanian language institution  73  These changes created widespread fear amongst Serbs that they were being made second class citizens in Yugoslavia by these changes  74  These changes was harshly criticized by Serbian communist official Dobrica  osi   who at the time claimed that they were contrary to Yugoslavia s commitment to Marxism through conceding to nationalism  especially Albanian nationalism  75  Breakup of Yugoslavia and Political transition Main articles  Breakup of Yugoslavia  Yugoslav Wars  Kosovo War  and Republic of Serbia

Vojvodina  where his allies subsequently overtook the power  in a movement called  Anti bureaucratic revolution   76  This ignited tensions with the communist leadership of the other republics  and awoke nationalism across the country  that eventually resulted in the Breakup of Yugoslavia  with Slovenia  Croatia  Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia leaving one after another  77  In 1992  the

newly proclaimed independence  Serbia and Montenegro remained nominally uninvolved  with Yugoslav Army formally withdrawing in early stages of the war  but provided significant logistic  military and financial support to the Serb forces  who inherited most of the Army s resources  In response to that support  UN imposed sanctions to FR Yugoslavia in May 1992  78  which led to political isolation  economic decline and hyperinflation of the Yugoslav dinar  The country permanently recovered from the inflation problem in 1996  Multiparty democracy was introduced in Serbia in 1990  officially

5 October when half a million people from all over the country congregated in Belgrade  compelling Milo evi  to concede defeat  85  The fall of Milo evi  ended Yugoslavia s international isolation  Milo evi  was sent to the ICTY on accusations of sponsoring war crimes during the breakup of Yugoslavia  where he was held on trial until his death in 2006  The DOS announced that FR Yugoslavia would seek to join the European Union  In 2003  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was renamed Serbia and Montenegro and the EU opened negotiations with the country for the Stabilization and Association Agreement  On 21 May 2006  Montenegro held a referendum to determine whether or not to end its union with Serbia  The next day  state certified results showed 55 4  of voters in favor of independence

circles of organized crime and former security officials  Pro  and anti EU political forces in Serbia have remained sharply divided on the political course of Serbia in regards to its relations with
