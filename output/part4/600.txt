securities by the Treasury and other federal government agencies  The US national public debt consists of two components  Debt held by the public comprises securities held by investors outside the federal government  including that held by investors  the Federal Reserve System and foreign  state and local governments  1  Intragovernment debt comprises Treasury securities held in accounts administered by the federal government  such as the Social Security Trust Fund  Public debt increases or decreases as a result of the annual unified budget deficit or surplus  The federal government budget deficit or surplus is the cash difference between government receipts and spending  ignoring intra governmental transfers  However  there is certain spending  supplemental appropriations  that add to the debt but are excluded from the deficit  The deficit is presented on a cash rather than an accruals basis  although the accrual basis may provide more information on the longer term implications of the government s annual operations  2  The public debt has increased by over  500 billion each year since fiscal year  FY  2003  with increases of  1 trillion in FY2008   1 9 trillion in FY2009  and  1 7 trillion in FY2010  3  As of March 21  2012 the gross debt was  15 574 trillion  of which  10 822 trillion was held by the public and  4 752 trillion was intragovernmental holdings

partisan affiliation of the White House and the Congress  Main article  History of the United States public debt The United States has had a public debt since its founding in 1791  Debts incurred during the American Revolutionary War and under the Articles of Confederation amounted to  75 463 476 52 on January 1  1791  From 1796 to 1811 there were 14 budget surpluses and 2 deficits  Another sharp increase in the debt occurred as a result of the Civil War  The debt was just  65 million in 1860  but passed  1 billion in 1863 and reached  2 7 billion by the end of the war  During the following 47 years  there were 36 surpluses and 11 deficits  During this period 55  of the national debt was paid off  The next period of major increase in the national debt took place during World War I  reaching  25 5 billion at its conclusion  It was followed by 11 consecutive surpluses and saw the debt reduced by 36   Social programs enacted during the Great Depression and the buildup and involvement in World War II during the F D  Roosevelt and Truman presidencies in the 1930s and 1940s caused the largest increase   a sixteenfold increase in the gross public debt from  16 billion in 1930 to  260 billion in 1950  When Roosevelt took office in 1933  the national debt was almost  20 billion  a sum equal to 20 percent of the U S  gross domestic product  GDP   During its first term  the Roosevelt administration ran large annual deficits between 2 and 5 percent of GDP  By 1936  the national debt had increased to  33 7 billion or approximately 40 percent of GDP  8  Gross debt relative to GDP rose to over 100  to pay for WWII  The debt burden fell rapidly after the end of World War II  as the US and the rest of the world experienced a post war economic expansion  The outstanding debt held stable for the next 25 years  going up to  283 billion in 1970 from  242 billion in 1946  However  the overall debt has increased under every president  over the last 30 years  9  Debt relative to GDP rose rapidly during the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan  whose economic policies increased military spending and lowered tax rates  9  Gross debt in nominal dollars quadrupled during the Reagan and Bush presidencies from 1980 to 1992  The net public debt quintupled in nominal terms  Debt held by the public had declined from 28  to 26  of GDP in the 1970s  by contrast  it rose to 41  of GDP by the end of the 1980s  During the 1990s  debt held by the public had risen to nearly 50  of GDP in the early 1990s  but fell to 39  of GDP by the end of the decade under the presidency of Bill Clinton  The public debt burden fell due in part to decreased millitary spending after the Cold War  1990  1993 and 1997 budget deals  gridlock between White House and Congress  and increased tax revenue resulting from the Dot com bubble  10  11  12  The budget controls instituted in the 1990s successfully restrained fiscal action by the Congress and the President and together with economic growth contributed to the budget surpluses that materialized by the end of the decade  These surpluses led to a decline in the debt held by the public  and from fiscal years 1998 through 2001  the debt to GDP measure declined from about 43 percent to about 33 percent  13  Debt relative to GDP rose due to recessions and policy decisions in the early 21st century  From 2000 to 2008 debt held by the public rose from 35  to 40   and to 62  by the end of fiscal year 2010  14  During the presidency of George W  Bush  the gross public debt increased from  5 7 trillion in January 2001 to  10 7 trillion by December 2008  15  due in part to the Bush tax cuts and increased military spending caused by the wars in the Middle East  16  Under President Barack Obama  the debt increased from  10 7 trillion in 2008 to  15 5 trillion by February 2012  17  caused mainly by decreased tax revenue due to the late 2000s recession and stimulus spending  9   edit  Valuation and measurement  edit  Public and government accounts Detailed breakdown of government holders of treasury debt and debt instruments used of the public portion  The total or gross national debt is the sum of the  debt held by the public  and  intragovernmental  debt  As of February 2012  the  debt held by the public  was  10 7 trillion and the  intragovernmental debt  was  4 8 trillion  for a total of  15 8 trillion  17  The national debt can also be classified into marketable or non marketable securities  As of February 2011  total marketable securities were  9 0 trillion while the non marketable securities were  5 2 trillion  Most of the marketable securities are Treasury notes  bills  and bonds held by investors and governments globally  The non marketable securities are mainly the  government account series  owed to certain government trust funds such as the Social Security Trust Fund  which represented  2 5 trillion in 2010  17  18  Other large intragovernmental holders include the Federal Housing Administration  the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation s Resolution Fund and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund  Medicare    edit  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac obligations excluded See also  Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Although not included in the debt figures reported by the government  the U S  government has moved to more explicitly support the soundness of obligations of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae  starting in July 2008 via the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008  and the September 7  2008 Federal Housing Finance Agency  FHFA  conservatorship of both government sponsored enterprises  GSEs   The on  or off balance sheet obligations of those two independent GSEs was just over  5 trillion at the time the conservatorship was put in place  consisting mainly of mortgage payment guarantees  19  The extent to which the government will be required to pay these obligations depends on a variety of economic and housing market factors  The federal government provided over  110 billion to Fannie and Freddie by 2010  20   edit  Guaranteed obligations excluded See also  Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and Exchange Stabilization Fund U S  federal government guarantees are not included in the public debt total  until such time as there is a call on the guarantees  For example  the U S  federal government in late 2008 guaranteed large amounts of obligations of mutual funds  banks  and corporations under several programs designed to deal with the problems arising from the late 2000s financial crisis  The funding of direct investments made in response to the crisis  such as those made under the Troubled Assets Relief Program  are included in the debt   edit  Unfunded obligations excluded The U S  government is obligated under current law to mandatory payments for programs such as Medicare  Medicaid and Social Security  The GAO projects that payouts for these programs will significantly exceed tax revenues over the next 75 years  The Medicare Part A  hospital insurance  payouts already exceed program tax revenues  and social security payouts exceeded payroll taxes in fiscal 2010  These deficits require funding from other tax sources or borrowing  21  The present value of these deficits or unfunded obligations is an estimated  45 8 trillion  This is the amount that would have to be set aside during 2009 so that the principal and interest would pay for the unfunded obligations through 2084  Approximately  7 7 trillion relates to Social Security  while  38 2 trillion relates to Medicare and Medicaid  In other words  health care programs will require nearly five times the level of funding than Social Security  Adding this to the national debt and other federal obligations would bring total obligations to nearly  62 trillion  22  However  these unfunded obligations are not counted in the national debt  The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  has indicated that   Future growth in spending per beneficiary for Medicare and Medicaid   the federal government s major health care programs   will be the most important determinant of long term trends in federal spending  Changing those programs in ways that reduce the growth of costs   which will be difficult  in part because of the complexity of health policy choices   is ultimately the nation s central long term challenge in setting federal fiscal policy   23   edit  Measuring debt relative to gross domestic product 2010 Budget  Total Debt   and   to GDP 2000 2010 GDP is a measure of the total size and output of the economy  One measure of the debt burden is its size relative to GDP  In the 2007 fiscal year  U S  federal debt held by the public was approximately  5 trillion  36 8 percent of GDP  and total debt was  9 trillion  65 5 percent of GDP   24  Debt held by the public represents money owed to those holding government securities such as Treasury bills and bonds  Total debt includes intra governmental debt  which includes amounts owed to the Social Security Trust Funds  about  2 2 trillion in FY 2007  25  and Civil Service Retirement Funds  By August 2008  the total debt was  9 6 trillion  26  Based on the 2010 U S  budget  total national debt will nearly double in dollar terms between 2008 and 2015 and will grow to nearly 100  of GDP  versus a level of approximately 80  in early 2009  27  Multiple government sources including the current and previous presidents  the GAO  Treasury Department  and CBO have said the U S  is on an unsustainable fiscal path  28  However  ahead of predictions  total national debt reached 100  by the third quarter of 2011  29  If counted using the total public debt outstanding over the annual GDP in chained 2005 dollars  the ratio reached 115  on Feb  2012  30  As the debt ratio increases  the exchange value of the dollar may fall  Paying back debt with cheaper currency could cause investors  including other governments  to demand higher interest rates if they anticipate further dollar depreciation  Paying higher interest rates could slow domestic U S  growth  Higher debt increases interest payments on the debt  which already exceed  430 billion annually as discussed below  or about 15 cents of every tax dollar for 2008  31  According to the CIA Factbook  nine countries have debt to GDP ratios over 100  for 2010  the largest of which is Japan at approximately 197 5   32  Further  a high public debt to GDP ratio may also slow economic growth  Economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff calculated that countries with public debt above 90 percent of GDP grow by an average of 1 3 percentage points per year slower than less indebted countries  The public debt to GDP ratio in March 2010 is about 60 percent of GDP  CBO projects it will reach 90 percent around 2020 under policies in place in 2010  If growth slows  all of the economic challenges the U S  faces will worsen  33   edit  Calculating the annual change in debt Comparison of deficits to change in debt in 2008 The annual change in debt is not equal to the  total deficit  typically reported in the media  Social Security payroll taxes and benefit payments  along with the net balance of the U S  Postal Service  are considered  off budget   while most other expenditure and receipt categories are considered  on budget   The total federal deficit is the sum of the on budget deficit  or surplus  and the off budget deficit  or surplus   Since FY1960  the federal government has run on budget deficits except for FY1999 and FY2000  and total federal deficits except in FY1969 and FY1998 FY2001  34  In large part because of Social Security surpluses  the total deficit is smaller than the on budget deficit  The surplus of Social Security payroll taxes over benefit payments is spent by the government for other purposes  However  the government credits the Social Security Trust fund for the surplus amount  adding to the  intragovernmental debt   The total federal debt is divided into  intragovernmental debt  and  debt held by the public   In other words  spending the  off budget  Social Security surplus adds to the total national debt  by increasing the intragovernmental debt  while the surplus reduces the  total  deficit reported in the media  Certain spending called  supplemental appropriations  is outside the budget process entirely but adds to the national debt  Funding for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was accounted for this way prior to the Obama administration  Certain stimulus measures and earmarks are also outside the budget process  For example  in FY2008 an off budget surplus of  183 billion reduced the on budget deficit of  642 billion  resulting in a total federal deficit of  459 billion  Media often reported the latter figure  The national debt increased by  1 017 billion between the end of FY2007 and the end of FY2008  35  The federal government publishes the total debt owed  public and intragovernmental holdings  at the end of each fiscal year 36  and since FY1957 the amount of debt held by the federal government has increased each year   edit  Debt ceiling See also  United States debt ceiling crisis US debt ceiling at the end of each year from 1981 to 2010  Under Article I Section 8 of the United States Constitution  Congress has the sole power to borrow money on the credit of the United States  From the founding of the United States until 1917 Congress directly authorized each individual debt issuance separately  In order to provide more flexibility to finance the United States  involvement in World War I  Congress modified the method by which it authorizes debt in the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917  37  Under this act Congress established an aggregate limit  or  ceiling   on the total amount of bonds that could be issued  The current debt ceiling  in which an aggregate limit is applied to nearly all federal debt  was substantially established by Public Debt Acts 38  39  passed in 1939 and 1941  The Treasury is authorized to issue debt needed to fund government operations  as authorized by each federal budget  up to a stated debt ceiling  with some small exceptions  The process of setting the debt ceiling is separate and distinct from the regular process of financing government operations  and raising the debt ceiling does not have any direct impact on the budget deficit  The US government proposes a federal budget every year  which must be approved by Congress  This budget details projected tax collections and outlays and  if there is a budget deficit  the amount of borrowing the government would have to do in that fiscal year  A vote to increase the debt ceiling is  therefore  usually treated as a formality  needed to continue spending that has already been approved previously by the Congress and the President  The Government Accountability Office explains   The debt limit does not control or limit the ability of the federal government to run deficits or incur obligations  Rather  it is a limit on the ability to pay obligations already incurred   40  The apparent redundancy of the debt ceiling has led to suggestions that it should be abolished altogether  41  42  Since 1979  the House of Representatives passed a rule to automatically raise the debt ceiling when passing a budget  without the need for a separate vote on the debt ceiling  except when the House votes to waive or repeal this rule  The exception to the rule was invoked in 1995  which resulted in two government shutdowns  43  When the debt ceiling is reached  Treasury can declare a debt issuance suspension period and utilize  extraordinary measures  to acquire funds to meet federal obligations but which do not require the issue of new debt  44  Treasury first used these measures on December 16  2009  to remain within the debt ceiling  and avoid a government shutdown  45  and also used it during the debt ceiling crisis of 2011  However  there are limits to how much can be raised by these measures  The debt ceiling was increased on February 12  2010  to  14 294 trillion  46  47  48  On April 15  2011  Congress finally passed the 2011 United States federal budget  authorizing federal government spending for the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year  which ends on September 30  2011  with a deficit of  1 48 trillion  citation needed  without voting to increase the debt ceiling  The two Houses of Congress were unable to agree on a revision of the debt ceiling in mid 2011  resulting in the United States debt ceiling crisis  The impasse was resolved with the passing on August 2  2011  the deadline for a default by the US on its debt  of the Budget Control Act of 2011  which immediately increased the debt ceiling to  14 694 trillion  required a vote on a Balanced Budget Amendment  and established several complex mechanisms to further increase the debt ceiling and reduce federal spending  On September 8  2011  one of the complex mechanisms to further increase the debt ceiling took place as the Senate defeated a resolution to block a  500 billion automatic increase  The Senate s action allowed the debt ceiling to increase to  15 194 trillion  as agreed upon in the Budget Control Act  49  This was the third increase in the debt ceiling in 19 months  the fifth increase since President Obama took office  and the twelfth increase in 10 years  The August 2 Act also created the United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction  for the purpose of developing a set of proposals by November 23  2011  to reduce federal spending by  1 2 trillion  The Act requires both houses of Congress to convene an  up or down  vote on the proposals as a whole by December 23  2011  The Joint Select Committee met for the first time on September 8  2011  The debt ceiling was raised once more on January 30  2012  to a new high of  16 394 trillion   edit  Ownership of debt Estimated ownership each year  Because a large variety of people own the notes  bills  and bonds in the  public  portion of the debt  Treasury also publishes information that groups the types of holders by general categories to portray who owns United States debt  In this data set  some of the public portion is moved and combined with the total government portion  because this amount is owned by the Federal Reserve as part of United States monetary policy   See Federal Reserve System   As is apparent from the chart  a little less than half of the total national debt is owed to the  Federal Reserve and intragovernmental holdings   The foreign and international holders of the debt are also put together from the notes  bills  and bonds sections  To the right is a chart for the data as of June 2008   edit  Foreign ownership Composition of US Long Term Treasury Debt held by foreign states  Nov  2005 Nov  2010  June figures are results of comprehensive Treasury Department surveys  As of January 2011  foreigners owned  4 45 trillion of U S  debt  or approximately 47  of the debt held by the public of  9 49 trillion and 32  of the total debt of  14 1 trillion  50  The largest holders were the central banks of China  Japan  the United Kingdom and Brazil  52  The share held by foreign governments has grown over time  rising from 13  of the public debt in 1988 53  to 25  in 2007  54  As of May 2011 the largest single holder of US government debt was China  with 26 percent of all foreign held US Treasury securities  8  of total US public debt   55  China s holdings of government debt  as a percentage of all foreign held government debt  have decreased a bit between 2010 and 2011  but are up significantly since 2000  when China held just 6 percent of all foreign held U S  Treasury securities   56  Major Foreign Holders of U S  Treasury Securities  2000 2010 Source  http   FutureofUSChinaTrade com Major foreign holders of U S  Treasury securities  June 2010 May 2011 57  This exposure to potential financial or political risk should foreign banks stop buying Treasury securities or start selling them heavily was addressed in a June 2008 report issued by the Bank of International Settlements  which stated   Foreign investors in U S  dollar assets have seen big losses measured in dollars  and still bigger ones measured in their own currency  While unlikely  indeed highly improbable for public sector investors  a sudden rush for the exits cannot be ruled out completely   58  On May 20  2007  Kuwait discontinued pegging its currency exclusively to the dollar  preferring to use the dollar in a basket of currencies  59  Syria made a similar announcement on June 4  2007  60  In September 2009 China  India and Russia said they were interested in buying International Monetary Fund gold to diversify their dollar denominated securities  61  However  in July 2010 China s State Administration of Foreign Exchange  ruled out the option of dumping its vast holdings of US Treasury securities  and said gold  cannot become a main channel for investing our foreign exchange reserves  because the market for gold is too small and prices are too volatile  62   edit  Forecasting the debt Further information  United States federal budget Tracking current levels of debt is a cumbersome but fairly straightforward process  Making future projections is much more difficult for a number of reasons  For example  before the September 11 attacks in 2001  the George W  Bush administration projected in the 2002 budget that there would be a  1 288 trillion surplus from 2001 through 2004  63  In the 2005 Mid Session Review this had changed to a projected four year deficit of  851 billion  a swing of  2 138 trillion  64  The latter document states that 49  of this swing was due to  economic and technical re estimates   29  was due to  tax relief   mainly the Bush Tax Cuts   and the remaining 22  was due to  war  homeland  and other enacted legislation   mainly expenditures for the War on Terror  Iraq War  and homeland security   Projections between different groups will sometimes differ because they make different assumptions  For example  in August 2003  a Congressional Budget Office report projected a  1 4 trillion deficit from 2004 through 2013  65  However  a mid term and long term joint analysis a month later by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  the Committee for Economic Development  and the Concord Coalition stated that  In projecting deficits  CBO follows mechanical  baseline  rules that do not allow it to account for the costs of any prospective tax or entitlement legislation  no matter how likely the enactment of such legislation may be   The analysis added in a proposed tax cut extension and Alternative Minimum Tax reform  enacted by a 2005 act   prescription drug plan  Medicare Part D  enacted in a 2003 act   and further increases in defense  homeland security  international  and domestic spending  According to the report  this  adjusts CBO s official ten year projections for more realistic assumptions about the costs of budget policies   raising the projected deficit from  1 4 trillion to  5 trillion  66  The Office of Management and Budget forecasts that  by the end of fiscal year 2012  gross federal debt will total  16 3 trillion  Thus  the projected debt will equal 101  of projected gross domestic product  which represents a milestone in the U S  economy  Public debt alone  which excludes amounts that the government owes its citizens via various trust funds  will be 67  of GDP by the end of fiscal 2012  67  Historical analysis of government spending or debt relative to GDP can be misleading  according to the GAO  CBO and Treasury Department  This is because demographic shifts and per capita spending are causing Social Security and Medicare Medicaid expenditures to grow significantly faster than GDP  If this trend continues  government simulations under various assumptions project mandatory spending for these programs will exceed taxes dedicated to these programs by more than  40 trillion over the next 75 years on a present value basis  68  According to the GAO  this will double debt to GDP ratios by 2040 and double them again by 2060  reaching 600  by 2080  69  A GAO simulation indicates that Social Security  Medicare  and Medicaid expenditures alone will exceed 20  of GDP by 2080  which is approximately the historical ratio of taxes collected by the federal government  In other words  these mandatory programs alone will take up all government revenues under this simulation  68   edit  CBO long term scenarios CBO Public Debt Under  Extended  and  Alternate  Scenarios The CBO reported during June 2011 two scenarios for how debt held by the public will change during the 2010 2035 time period  The  extended baseline scenario  assumes that the Bush tax cuts  extended by Obama  will expire per current law in 2012  It also assumes the alternative minimum tax  AMT  will be allowed to affect more middle class families  reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates to doctors will occur  and that revenues reach 23  GDP by 2035  much higher than the historical average 18   Under this scenario  government spending on everything other than the major mandatory health care programs  Social Security  and interest on federal debt  activities such as national defense and a wide variety of domestic programs  would decline to the lowest percentage of GDP since before World War II  Under this scenario  public debt rises from 69  GDP in 2011 to 84  by 2035  with interest payments absorbing 4  of GDP vs  1  in 2011  70  CBO estimated in August 2011 that if laws currently  on the books  were enforced without changes  meaning the  extended baseline scenario  described above is implemented along with deficit reductions from the Budget Control Act of 2011  the deficit would decline from 8 5  GDP in 2011 to around 1  GDP by 2021  71  The  alternative fiscal scenario  more closely assumes the continuation of present trends  such as permanently extending the Bush tax cuts  restricting the reach of the AMT  and keeping Medicare reimbursement rates at the current level  the so called  Doc Fix  versus declining by one third as mandated under current law   Revenues are assumed to remain around the historical average 18  GDP  Under this scenario  public debt rises from 69  GDP in 2011 to 100  by 2021 and approaches 190  by 2035  70  The CBO reported   Many budget analysts believe that the alternative fiscal scenario presents a more realistic picture of the nation s underlying fiscal policies than the extended baseline scenario does  The explosive path of federal debt under the alternative fiscal scenario underscores the need for large and rapid policy changes to put the nation on a sustainable fiscal course   70   edit  Risks and obstacles Risks due to increasing entitlement spending  according to GAO s projections of future trends Components of interest on the debt  Main article  Deficit reduction in the United States A high debt level may affect inflation  interest rates  and economic growth  A variety of factors are placing increasing pressure on the value of the U S  dollar  increasing the risk of devaluation or inflation and encouraging challenges to dollar s role as the world s reserve currency  The Government Accountability Office  GAO   the federal government s auditor  argues that the U S  is on a fiscally  unsustainable  path and that politicians and the electorate have been unwilling to change this path  21  Further  the subprime mortgage crisis has significantly increased the financial burden on the U S  government  with over  10 trillion in commitments or guarantees and  2 6 trillion in investments or expenditures as of May 2009  only some of which are included in the budget document  72  The U S  also has a large trade deficit  meaning imports exceed exports  Debt levels may also affect economic growth rates  Economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart reported in 2010 that among the 20 advanced countries studied  average annual GDP growth was 3 4  when debt was relatively moderate or low  i e  under 60  of GDP   but it dips to just 1 6  when debt was high  i e   above 90  of GDP   73  The CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt levels in a July 2010 publication  A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of government debt  rather than investments in productive capital goods such as factories and computers  leading to lower output and incomes than would otherwise occur  If higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest costs  savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged  Rising interest costs would force reductions in government programs  Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to economic challenges  and An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis  in which investors demand higher interest rates  74  While there is significant debate about solutions  75  the significant long term risk posed by the increase in entitlement spending is widely recognized  76  with health care costs  Medicare and Medicaid  the primary risk category  77  78  In a June 2010 opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal  former chairman of the Federal Reserve  Alan Greenspan noted that  Only politically toxic cuts or rationing of medical care  a marked rise in the eligible age for health and retirement benefits  or significant inflation  can close the deficit   79  If significant reforms are not undertaken  benefits under entitlement programs will exceed government income by over  40 trillion over the next 75 years  78  Should interest rates return to historical averages  the interest cost would increase dramatically  Historian Niall Ferguson described the risk that foreign investors would demand higher interest rates as the U S  debt levels increase over time in a November 2009 interview  80  However  according to Paul Krugman   It s true that foreigners now hold large claims on the United States  including a fair amount of government debt  But every dollar s worth of foreign claims on America is matched by 89 cents  worth of U S  claims on foreigners  And because foreigners tend to put their U S  investments into safe  low yield assets  America actually earns more from its assets abroad than it pays to foreign investors  If your image is of a nation that s already deep in hock to the Chinese  you ve been misinformed  Nor are we heading rapidly in that direction   81   edit  Debates Main article  Political debates about the United States federal budget Debates about the public debt Economists debate whether the level of debt relative to GDP that signals a  red line  or dangerous level  or if any such level exists  In January 2010  Economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart stated that 90  of GDP might be an indicative danger level  82  Fed Chair Ben Bernanke stated in April 2010 that  Neither experience nor economic theory clearly indicates the threshold at which government debt begins to endanger prosperity and economic stability  But given the significant costs and risks associated with a rapidly rising federal debt  our nation should soon put in place a credible plan for reducing deficits to sustainable levels over time   83  Economists also debate the definition of public debt  Krugman argued in May 2010 that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use  while Reinhart has testified to the President s Fiscal Reform Commission that gross debt is the appropriate measure  84  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  CBPP  cited research by several economists supporting the use of the lower debt held by the public figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden  disagreeing with these Commission members  85  There is debate regarding the economic nature of the intragovernmental debt  which was approximately  4 6 trillion in February 2011  86  For example  the CBPP argues  that  large increases in  debt held by the public  can also push up interest rates and increase the amount of future interest payments the federal government must make to lenders outside of the United States  which reduces Americans  income  By contrast  intragovernmental debt  the other component of the gross debt  has no such effects because it is simply money the federal government owes  and pays interest on  to itself   85  However  if the U S  continues to run  on budget  deficits as projected by the CBO and OMB for the foreseeable future  it will have to issue marketable Treasury bills and bonds  i e   debt held by the public  to pay for the projected shortfall in the Social Security program  This will result in  debt held by the public  replacing  intragovernmental debt   87  88  The fact that we are here today to debate raising America s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure  It is a sign that the U S  Government can t pay its own bills  It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government s reckless fiscal policies    Increasing America s debt weakens us domestically and internationally  Leadership means that  the buck stops here   Instead  Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren  America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership  Americans deserve better   Sen  Barack Obama speaking on the floor of the Senate
