the 53rd Street in Manhattan  New York City  New York  U S  Citigroup Inc   NYSE  C  or Citi is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in Manhattan  New York City  New York  United States  Citigroup was formed from one of the world s largest mergers in history by combining the banking giant Citicorp and financial conglomerate Travelers Group on April 7  1998  3  The year 2012 marks Citi s 200th anniversary  Citigroup has the world s largest financial services network  spanning 140 countries with approximately 16 000 offices worldwide  The company currently employs approximately 260 000 staff around the world  which is down from 267 150 in 2010 according to Forbes  4  5  It also holds over 200 million customer accounts in more than 140 countries  It is a primary dealer in US Treasury securities  6  According to Forbes  at its height Citigroup used to be the largest company and bank in the world by total assets with 357 000 employees until the global financial crisis of 2008  7  Today it is ranked 10th in size by composite index  In comparison  JPMorgan Chase now ranks as the largest company and bank in the world as of 2011  Citigroup suffered huge losses during the global financial crisis of 2008 and was rescued in November 2008 in a massive stimulus package by the U S  government  8  Its largest shareholders include funds from the Middle East and Singapore  9  According to the New York Times  on February 23  2009  Citigroup announced that the United States government would take a 36  equity stake in the company by converting US 25 billion in emergency aid into common shares with a US Treasury credit line of  45 billion to prevent the bankruptcy of the largest bank in the world at the time  The government would also guarantee losses on more than  300 billion troubled assets and inject  20 billion immediately into the company  In exchange  the salary of the CEO is  1 per year and the highest salary of employees is restricted to  500 000 in cash and any amount above  500 000 must be paid with restricted stock that cannot be sold until the emergency government aid is repaid in full  The US government also gains control of half the seats in the Board of Directors  and the senior management is subjected to removal by the US government if there is poor performance  By December 2009  the US government stake was reduced to 27  majority stake from a 36  majority stake after Citigroup sold  21 billion of common shares and equity in the largest single share sale in US history  surpassing Bank of America s  19 billion share sale one month prior  Eventually by December 2010  Citigroup repaid the emergency aid in full and the US government received an additional  12 billion profit in selling its shares  10  11  12  13  14  US Government restrictions on pay and oversight of the senior management are removed after the US government sold its remaining 27  stake as of December 2010  According to the Wall Street Journal  the government aid was provided to prevent a world wide chaos and panic by the potential collapse of its Global Transactions Services division  which transports more than  3 trillion around the world each day for most of the Fortune 500 companies and over 80 national governments and 60 central banks around the world  According to the article  Pandit said if Citigroup was allowed to unravel into bankruptcy   100 governments around the world would be trying to figure out how to pay their employees   15  16  17  18  19  Despite huge losses during the global financial crisis  Citigroup built up an enormous cash reserve in the wake of the financial crisis with  248 billion  20  Citi currently has Tier 1 Common ratio of 11 6  and a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 13 6  as of the end of the second quarter  making it ironically one of the best capitalized financial institutions in the world after billions of dollars in losses from the financial crisis  This was a result of selling more than  500 billion of its special assets placed in Citi Holdings  which were guaranteed from losses by the US Treasury while under federal majority ownership  21  Additionally  according to the Washington Post  a special IRS tax exception given to Citi to allow the US Treasury to sell its shares at a profit while it still owned Citigroup shares  which eventually net  12 billion dollars  According to Treasury spokeswoman Nayyera Haq   This  IRS tax  rule was designed to stop corporate raiders from using loss corporations to evade taxes  and was never intended to address the unprecedented situation where the government owned shares in banks  And it was certainly not written to prevent the government from selling its shares for a profit   22  Citigroup is one of the Big

Citicorp and Travelers Group to create the world s largest financial services organization  3  The history of the company is  thus  divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into Citicorp  a multinational banking corporation operating in more than 100 countries  or Travelers Group  whose businesses covered credit services  consumer finance  brokerage  and insurance  As such  the company history dates back to the founding of  the City Bank of New York  later Citibank  in 1812  Bank Handlowy in 1870  Smith Barney in 1873  Banamex in 1884  Salomon Brothers in 1910  30   edit  Citicorp The history begins with the City Bank of New York  which was chartered by New York State on June 16  1812  with  2 million of capital  Serving a group of New York merchants  the bank opened for business on September 14 of that year  and Samuel Osgood was elected as the first President of the company  31  The company s name was changed to The National City Bank of New York in 1865 after it joined the new U S  national banking system  and it became the largest American bank by 1895  31  It became the first contributor to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1913  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a U S  bank in Buenos Aires  although the bank had  since the mid 19th century  been active in plantation economies  such as the Cuban sugar industry  The 1918 purchase of U S  overseas bank International Banking Corporation helped it become the first American bank to surpass  1 billion in assets  and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in 1929  31  As it grew  the bank became a leading innovator in financial services  becoming the first major U S  bank to offer compound interest on savings  1921   unsecured personal loans  1928   customer checking accounts  1936  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  1961   31  The bank changed its name to The First National City Bank of New York in 1955  which was shortened in 1962 to First National City Bank on the 150th anniversary of the company s foundation  31  The company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors  and its introduction of U S  dollar denominated certificates of deposit in London marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since 1888  Later to become MasterCard  the bank introduced its First National City Charge Service credit card   popularly known as the  Everything card    in 1967  31  In 1976  under the leadership of CEO Walter B  Wriston  First National City Bank  and its holding company First National City Corporation  was renamed as Citibank  N A   and Citicorp  respectively   Shortly afterward  the bank launched the Citicard  which pioneered the use of 24 hour ATMs  31 John S  Reed was elected CEO in 1984  and Citi became a founding member of the CHAPS clearing house in London  Under his leadership  the next 14 years would see Citibank become the largest bank in the United States  the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world  and expand its global reach to over 90 countries  31   edit  Travelers Group Travelers Group  at the time of merger  was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under CEO Sandy Weill  Its roots came from Commercial Credit  a subsidiary of Control Data Corporation that was taken private by Weill in November 1986 after taking charge of the company earlier that year  3  32  Two years later  Weill mastered the buyout of Primerica   a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer A L Williams as well as stock broker Smith Barney  The new company took the Primerica name  and employed a  cross selling  strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each other s services  Its non financial businesses were spun off  32  The corporate logo of Travelers Inc   1993 1998  prior to merger with Citicorp  In September 1992  Travelers Insurance  which had suffered from poor real estate investments 3  and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew  33  formed a strategic alliance with Primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in December 1993  With the acquisition  the group became Travelers Inc  Property  amp  casualty and life  amp  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business  32  Meanwhile  the distinctive Travelers red umbrella logo  which was also acquired in the deal  was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization  During this period  Travelers acquired Shearson Lehman   a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by Weill until 1985 3    and merged it with Smith Barney  32   edit  Salomon Brothers Finally  in November 1997  Travelers Group  which had been renamed again in April 1995 when they merged with Aetna Property and Casualty  Inc    made the  9 billion deal to purchase Salomon Brothers  a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank  32  This deal complemented Travelers Smith Barney well as Salomon was focused on fixed income and institutional clients whereas Smith Barney was strong in equities and retail  Salomon Brothers absorbed Smith Barney into the new securities unit termed Salomon Smith Barney  a year later  the division incorporated Citicorp s former securities operations as well  The Salomon Smith Barney name was ultimately abandoned in October 2003 after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the bank s reputation   edit  Citicorp and Travelers merger On April 6  1998  the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group was announced to the world  creating a  140 billion firm with assets of almost  700 billion  3  The deal would enable Travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to Citicorp s retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers  Although presented as a merger  the deal was actually more like a stock swap  with Travelers Group purchasing the entirety of Citicorp shares for  70 billion  and issuing 2 5 new Citigroup shares for each Citicorp share  Through this mechanism  existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm  3  While the new company maintained Citicorp s  Citi  brand in its name  it adopted Travelers  distinctive  red umbrella  as the new corporate logo  which was used until 2007  The chairmen of both parent companies  John Reed and Sandy Weill respectively  were announced as co chairmen and co CEOs of the new company  Citigroup  Inc   although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup  The remaining provisions of the Glass Steagall Act   enacted following the Great Depression   forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters  and meant Citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets  However  Weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed  that over that time the legislation will change   we have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem   3  Indeed  the passing of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act in November 1999 vindicated Reed and Weill s views  opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking  investment banking  insurance underwriting and brokerage  34  Joe Plumeri headed the integration of the consumer businesses of Travelers Group and Citicorp after the merger  and was appointed CEO of Citibank North America by Weill and Reed  35  36  He oversaw its network of 450 retail branches  36  37  38  J  Paul Newsome  an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer  said   He s not the spit and polish executive many people expected  He s rough on the edges  But Citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble it can t get away anymore with passive selling and Plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank   39  It was conjectured that he might become a leading contender to run all of Citigroup when Weill and Reed stepped down  if he were to effect a big  noticeable victory at Citibank  39  In that position  Plumeri boosted the unit s earnings from  108 million to  415 million in one year  an increase of nearly 400   40  41  42  He unexpectedly retired from Citibank  however  in January 2000  43  44  In 2000  Citigroup acquired Associates First Capital Corporation  which  until 1989  had been owned by Gulf Western  now part of National Amusements   The Associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and Citi eventually settled with the Federal Trade Commission by agreeing to pay  240 million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices  including  flipping  mortgages   packing  mortgages with optional credit insurance  and deceptive marketing practices  45  In 2001  Citigroup made additional acquisitions  European American Bank  in July  for  1 9 billion  46  and Banamex in August  for  12 5 billion  47   edit  Travelers spin off The current logo for Travelers Companies The company spun off its Travelers Property and Casualty insurance underwriting business in 2002  The spin off was prompted by the insurance unit s drag on Citigroup stock price because Traveler s earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters  particularly the September 11  2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in downtown New York City  It was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker  The Travelers Property Casualty Corporation merged with The St  Paul Companies Inc  in 2004 forming The St  Paul Travelers Companies  Citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business  however  it sold those businesses to MetLife in 2005  Citigroup still heavily sells all forms of insurance  but it no longer underwrites insurance  In spite of their divesting Travelers Insurance  Citigroup retained Travelers  signature red umbrella logo as its own until February 2007  when Citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to St  Paul Travelers  48  which renamed itself Travelers Companies  Citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand  Citi  for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries  except Primerica and Banamex  48   edit  Subprime mortgage crisis Heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of Collateralized debt obligation  CDOs   compounded by poor risk management led Citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened in 2008  The company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas  but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn  or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages  Indeed  trading head Thomas Maheras was close friends with senior risk officer David Bushnell  which undermined risk oversight  49  50  As Treasury Secretary  Robert Rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed Travelers and Citicorp to merge in 1998  Then on the board of directors of Citigroup  Rubin and Charles Prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards MBS and CDOs in the subprime mortgage market  As the crisis began to unfold  Citigroup announced on April 11  2007  that it would eliminate 17 000 jobs  or about 5 percent of its workforce  in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock  51  Even after securities and brokerage firm Bear Stearns ran into serious trouble in summer 2007  Citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its CDO s was so tiny  less than 1 100 of 1   that they excluded them from their risk analysis  With the crisis worsening  Citigroup announced on January 7  2008 that it was considering cutting another 5 percent to 10 percent of its work force  which totaled 327 000  52   edit  European debt crisis Due to extended domestic financial debt crisis and European debt crisis  on December 7  2011 Citigroup announced it will cut 4 500 jobs worlwide in the coming months from 267 000 employees registered as of September 30  2011  The aim is to reduce costs amid slumping revenue and  unprecedented  market conditions  while Citigroup share has dropped 37 percent year to date  53   edit  Federal assistance Over the past several decades  the United States government has engineered at least four different rescues of the institution now known as Citigroup  54  During the most recent tax payer funded rescue  by November 2008  Citigroup was insolvent  despite its receipt of  25 billion in federal TARP funds  and on November 17  2008  Citigroup announced plans for about 52 000 new job cuts  on top of 23 000 cuts already made during 2008 in a huge job cull resulting from four quarters of consecutive losses and reports that it was unlikely to be in profit again before 2010  On the same day  Wall Street responded by dropping its stock market value to  6 billion  down from  300 billion two years prior  55  As a result  Citigroup and Federal regulators negotiated a plan to stabilize the company and forestall a further deterioration in the company s value  The arrangement calls for the government to back about  306 billion in loans and securities and directly invest about  20 billion in the company  The assets remain on Citigroup s balance sheet  the technical term for this arrangement is ring fencing  In a New York Times op ed  Michael Lewis and David Einhorn described the  306 billion guarantee as  an undisguised gift  without any real crisis motivating it  56  The plan was approved late in the evening on November 23  2008  8  A joint statement by the US Treasury Department  the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp announced   With these transactions  the U S  government is taking the actions necessary to strengthen the financial system and protect U S  taxpayers and the U S  economy   Citigroup in late 2008 held  20 billion of mortgage linked securities  most of which have been marked down to between 21 cents and 41 cents on the dollar  and has billions of dollars of buyout and corporate loans  It faces potential massive losses on auto  mortgage and credit card loans if the economy worsens  citation needed   This paragraph requires a reference  particularly to the  20 billion figure quoted above  It is likely that this number is a severe underestimate of the value of CDO holdings held in off balance sheet SIVs   On January 16  2009  Citigroup announced its intention to reorganize itself into two operating units  Citicorp for its retail and institutional client business  and Citi Holdings for its brokerage and asset management  57  Citigroup will continue to operate as a single company for the time being  but Citi Holdings managers will be tasked to  tak e  advantage of value enhancing disposition and combination opportunities as they emerge   57  and eventual spin offs or mergers involving either operating unit have not been ruled out  58  On February 27  2009 Citigroup announced that the United States government would be taking a 36  equity stake in the company by converting  25 billion in emergency aid into common shares  Citigroup shares dropped 40  on the news  On June 1  2009  it was announced that Citigroup would be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average effective June 8  2009  due to significant government ownership  Citigroup was replaced by Travelers Co  59   edit  Return to profitability  non governmental shareholder ownership In 2010  Citigroup achieved its first profitable year since 2007  It reported  10 6 billion in net profit  compared with a  1 6 billion loss in 2009  60  Late in 2010  the government sold its remaining stock holding in the company  yielding an overall net profit to taxpayers of  12 billion  61   edit  Failed 2012 Federal Reserve Stress Test On Tuesday  March 13  2012  the Federal Reserve reported Citigroup are one of the four banks out of 19 major banks that have failed its stress tests  The tests make sure banks have enough capital to withstand huge losses in a financial crisis like one Citigroup faced in 2008 and early 2009 when it almost collapsed  The 2012 stress tests determine whether bank could withstand a financial crisis that has unemployment at 13 percent  stock prices to be cut in half  and home prices decreased by 21 percent from current levels   62

the subprime mortgage crisis began to unfold  heavy exposure to toxic mortgages in the forms of Collateralized debt obligations  CDOs   compounded by poor risk management  led the company into serious trouble  In early 2007  Citigroup began eliminating about 5 percent of its workforce in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock  51  By November 2008  the ongoing crisis hit Citigroup hard and despite federal TARP money  the company announced further staff cuts that eventually totaled over 100 000 employees  100  Its stock market value dropped to  20 5 billion  down from  244 billion two years earlier  55  As a result  Citigroup and federal regulators negotiated a plan to stabilize the company  8  On November 24  2008  the U S  government announced a massive stimulus package for Citigroup  designed to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major say in its operations  The Treasury would provide another  20 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program  TARP  funds in addition to  25 billion given in October  The Treasury Department  the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  FDIC  would cover 90  of the losses on its  335 billion portfolio after Citigroup absorbed the first  29 billion in losses  101  In return the bank would give Washington  27 billion of preferred shares and warrants to acquire stock  The government would obtain wide powers over banking operations  Citigroup agreed to try to modify mortgages  using standards set up by the FDIC after the collapse of IndyMac Bank  with the goal of keeping as many homeowners as possible in their houses  Executive salaries would be capped  102  As a condition of the federal assistance  Citigroup s dividend payment was reduced to one cent per share  In September 2011  a book titled Confidence Men Confidence Men  Wall Street  Washington and the Education of a President  written by former Wall Street reporter Ron Suskind  states that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ignored a 2009 order from President Barack Obama to break up Citigroup in an enormous restructuring and liquidation  According to the book  Obama wanted to consider restructuring the bank into several leaner and smaller companies while Geithner was executing stress tests of American financial institutions  Another book  A Presidency in Peril by Robert Kuttner  says that in spring 2009 Geithner and chief economic adviser Larry Summers believed that they could not seize  liquidate  and break up Citigroup because they lacked the legal authority or the tools to do so  The Treasury Department denied the account in an e mail to the media stating  This account is simply untrue  The directive given by the president in March 2009 was to develop a contingency plan for tough restructurings if the government ended up owning large shares of institutions at the conclusion of the stress tests that Secretary Geithner worked aggressively to put in place as part of the Administration s Financial Stability Plan  While Treasury began work on those contingency plans  there was fortunately never a need to put them in place   103  104   edit

Parsons hired long time Washington  D C  lobbyist Richard F  Hohlt to advise Parsons and the company about relations with the U S  government  though not to lobby for the company  While some speculated anonymously that the FDIC would have been a particular focus of Hohlt s attention  Hohlt said he d had no contact with the government insurance corporation  Some former regulators found room to criticize  in the news report  Hohlt s involvement with Citigroup  because of his earlier involvement with the financial services industry during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s  Hohlt responded that though mistakes were made in the earlier episode  not to mention by other more recent clients of his like Fannie Mae and Washington Mutual  he d never been investigated by any government agency and his experience gave him reason to be back in the  operating room  as parties address the more recent crisis  107   edit  Public and governmental relations In 2010  the company named Edward Skyler  formerly in New York City government and at Bloomberg LP  to its senior public and governmental relations position  108  Before Skyler was named and before he began his job search  the company reportedly held discussions with three other individuals to fill the position  NY Deputy Mayor Kevin Sheekey  Mayor Michael Bloomberg s  political guru      who  spearheaded     his short lived flirtation with a presidential run      who will soon leave City Hall for a position at the mayor s company  Bloomberg L P       After Mr  Bloomberg s improbable victory in the 2001 mayor s race  both Mr  Skyler and Mr  Sheekey followed him from his company to City Hall  Since then  they have been a part of an enormously influential coterie of advisers   Howard Wolfson  the former communications director for Hillary Rodham Clinton s presidential campaign and Mr  Bloomberg s re election bid  and Gary Ginsberg  now at Time Warner and formerly at News Corporation  109   edit
