States This box  view talk edit Health care in the United States is provided by many separate legal entities  Health care facilities are largely owned and operated by the private sector  Health insurance is now primarily provided by the government in the public sector  with 60 65  of healthcare provision and spending coming from programs such as Medicare  Medicaid  TRICARE  the Children s Health Insurance Program  and the Veterans Health Administration  The U S  Census Bureau reported that a record 50 7 million residents  which includes 9 9 million non citizens  or 16 7  of the population were uninsured in 2009  1  2  More money per person is spent on health care in the USA than in any other nation in the world  3  4  and a greater percentage of total income in the nation is spent on health care in the USA than in any United Nations member state except for East Timor  4  Although not all people are insured  the USA has the third highest public healthcare expenditure per capita  because of the high cost of medical care in the country  clarification needed  5  6  A 2001 study in five states found that medical debt contributed to 46 2  of all personal bankruptcies and in 2007  62 1  of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses  7  Since then  health costs and the numbers of uninsured and underinsured have increased  8  Active debate about health care reform in the United States concerns questions of a right to health care  access  fairness  efficiency  cost  choice  value  and quality  Some have argued that the system does not deliver equivalent value for the money spent  The USA pays twice as much yet lags behind other wealthy nations in such measures as infant mortality and life expectancy  Currently  the USA has a higher infant mortality rate than most of the world s industrialized nations  nb 1  9  In the United States life expectancy is 42nd in the world  after some other industrialized nations  lagging the other nations of the G5  Japan  France  Germany  UK  USA  and just after Chile  35th  and Cuba  37th   10  Life expectancy at birth in the USA is 50th in the world  below most developed nations and some developing nations  It is below the average life expectancy for the European Union  11  12  The World Health Organization  WHO   in 2000  ranked the U S  health care system as the highest in cost  first in responsiveness  37th in overall performance  and 72nd by overall level of health  among 191 member nations included in the study   13  14  The Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States last in the quality of health care among similar countries  15  and notes U S  care costs the most  16  The USA is the only wealthy  industrialized nation that does not ensure that all citizens have coverage  i e   some kind of private or public health insurance   17  In 2004  the Institute of Medicine report observed  lack of health insurance causes roughly 18 000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States   17  while a 2009 Harvard study estimated that 44 800 excess deaths occurred annually due to lack of health insurance  18  On March 23  2010  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  PPACA  became law  providing for major changes in health insurance  19  Contents 1 Providers 1 1 Facilities 1 2 Physicians 1 3 Medical products  research and development 2 Spending 2 1 Impact on U S  economic

individual health care personnel  health care facilities and medical products   edit  Facilities Main article  Medical centers in the United States In the United States  ownership of the health care system is mainly in private hands  though federal  state  county  and city governments also own certain facilities  The non profit hospitals share of total hospital capacity has remained relatively stable  about 70   for decades  20  There are also privately owned for profit hospitals as well as government hospitals in some locations  mainly owned by county and city governments  There is no nationwide system of government owned medical facilities open to the general public but there are local government owned medical facilities open to the general public  The federal Department of Defense operates field hospitals as well as permanent hospitals  the Military Health System   to provide military funded care to active military personnel  The federal Veterans Health Administration operates VA hospitals open only to veterans  though veterans who seek medical care for conditions they did not receive while serving in the military are charged for services  The Indian Health Service operates facilities open only to Native Americans from recognized tribes  These facilities  plus tribal facilities and privately contracted services funded by IHS to increase system capacity and capabilities  provide medical care to tribespeople beyond what can be paid for by any private insurance or other government programs  21  Hospitals provide some outpatient care in their emergency rooms and specialty clinics  but primarily exist to provide inpatient care  Hospital emergency departments and urgent care centers are sources of sporadic problem focused care   Surgicenters  are examples of specialty clinics  Hospice services for the terminally ill who are expected to live six months or less are most commonly subsidized by charities and government  Prenatal  family planning  and  dysplasia  clinics are government funded obstetric and gynecologic specialty clinics respectively  and are usually staffed by nurse practitioners   edit  Physicians Main article  Physician in the United States Physicians in the United States include those trained by the US medical education system  and those that are international medical graduates who have progressed through the necessary steps to acquire a medical license to practice in a state  The American College of Physicians  uses the term physician to describe all medical practitioners holding a professional medical degree  The American Medical Association as well as the American Osteopathic Association both currently use the term physician to describe members   edit  Medical products  research and development As in most other countries  the manufacture and production of pharmaceuticals and medical devices is carried out by private companies  The research and development of medical devices and pharmaceuticals is supported by both public and private sources of funding  In 2003  research and development expenditures were approximately  95 billion with  40 billion coming from public sources and  55 billion coming from private sources  22  23  These investments into medical research have made the United States the leader in medical innovation  measured either in terms of revenue or the number of new drugs and devices introduced  24  25  In 2006  the United States accounted for three quarters of the world s biotechnology revenues and 82  of world R amp D spending in biotechnology  24  25  According to multiple international pharmaceutical trade groups  the high cost of patented drugs in the U S  has encouraged substantial reinvestment in such research and development  24  25  26   edit  Spending U S  healthcare costs exceed those of other countries  relative to the size of the economy or GDP  Total U S  healthcare spending as a percent of U S  GDP  gross domestic product   27  Click on chart for data  Current estimates put U S  health care spending at approximately 16  of GDP  second highest to East Timor  Timor Leste  among all United Nations member nations  4  The Health and Human Services Department expects that the health share of GDP will continue its historical upward trend  reaching 19 5  of GDP by 2017  28  29  Of each dollar spent on health care in the United States  31  goes to hospital care  21  goes to physician clinical services  10  to pharmaceuticals  4  to dental  6  to nursing homes and 3  to home health care  3  for other retail products  3  for government public health activities  7  to administrative costs  7  to investment  and 6  to other professional services  physical therapists  optometrists  etc   30  The Office of the Actuary  OACT  of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services publishes data on total health care spending in the United States  including both historical levels and future projections  31  In 2007  the U S  spent  2 26 trillion on health care  or  7 439 per person  up from  2 1 trillion  or  7 026 per capita  the previous year  32  Spending in 2006 represented 16  of GDP  an increase of 6 7  over 2004 spending  Growth in spending is projected to average 6 7  annually over the period 2007 through 2017  In 2009  the United States federal  state and local governments  corporations and individuals  together spent  2 5 trillion   8 047 per person  on health care  This amount represented 17 3  of the GDP  up from 16 2  in 2008  33  Health insurance costs are rising faster than wages or inflation  34  and medical causes were cited by about half of bankruptcy filers in the United States in 2001  35  The Congressional Budget Office has found that  about half of all growth in health care spending in the past several decades was associated with changes in medical care made possible by advances in technology   Other factors included higher income levels  changes in insurance coverage  and rising prices  36  Hospitals and physician spending take the largest share of the health care dollar  while prescription drugs take about 10   37  The use of prescription drugs is increasing among adults who have drug coverage  38  One analysis of international spending levels in the year 2000 found that while the U S  spends more on health care than other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD   the use of health care services in the U S  is below the OECD median by most measures  The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U S  39  Economist Hans Sennholz has argued that the Medicare and Medicaid programs may be the main reason for rising health care costs in the U S  40  Health care spending in the United States is concentrated  An analysis of the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey found that the 1  of the population with the highest spending accounted for 27  of aggregate health care spending  The highest spending 5  of the population accounted for more than half of all spending  This reflects spending in 2009  as well  41  These patterns were stable through the 1970s and 1980s  and some data suggest that they may have been typical of the mid to early 20th century as well  42  One study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  AHRQ  found significant persistence in the level of health care spending from year to year  Of the 1  of the population with the highest health care spending in 2002  24 3  maintained their ranking in the top 1  in 2003  Of the 5  with the highest spending in 2002  34  maintained that ranking in 2003  Individuals over age 45 were disproportionately represented among those who were in the top decile of spending for both years  43  Health care cost rise based on total expenditure on health as   of GDP  Countries are USA  Germany  Austria  Switzerland  United Kingdom and Canada  Seniors spend  on average  far more on health care costs than either working age adults or children  The pattern of spending by age was stable for most ages from 1987 through 2004  with the exception of spending for seniors age 85 and over  Spending for this group grew less rapidly than that of other groups over this period  44  The 2008 edition of the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care 45  found that providing Medicare beneficiaries with severe chronic illnesses with more intense health care in the last two years of life increased spending  more tests  more procedures and longer hospital stays is not associated with better patient outcomes  There are significant geographic variations in the level of care provided to chronically ill patients  only 4  of which are explained by differences in the number of severely ill people in an area  Most of the differences are explained by differences in the amount of  supply sensitive  care available in an area  Acute hospital care accounts for over half  55   of the spending for Medicare beneficiaries in the last two years of life  and differences in the volume of services provided is more significant than differences in price  The researchers found no evidence of  substitution  of care  where increased use of hospital care would reduce outpatient spending  or vice versa   45  46  Increased spending on disease prevention is often suggested as a way of reducing health care spending  47  Whether prevention saves or costs money depends on the intervention  Childhood vaccinations  47  or contraceptives 48  save much more than they cost  Research suggests that in many cases prevention does not produce significant long term cost savings  47  Some interventions may be cost effective by providing health benefits  while others are not cost effective  47  Preventive care is typically provided to many people who would never become ill  and for those who would have become ill is partially offset by the health care costs during additional years of life  47  In September 2008 The Wall Street Journal reported that consumers were reducing their health care spending in response to the current economic slow down  Both the number of prescriptions filled and the number of office visits dropped between 2007 and 2008  In one survey  22  of consumers reported going to the doctor less often  and 11  reported buying fewer prescription drugs  49  In 2009  the average private room in a nursing home cost  219 daily  Assisted living costs averaged  3 131 monthly  Home health aides averaged  21 per hour  Adult day care services averaged  67 daily  50   edit  Impact on U S  economic productivity On March 1  2010  billionaire investor Warren Buffett said that the high costs paid by U S  companies for their employees  health care put them at a competitive disadvantage  He compared the roughly 17  of GDP spent by the U S  on health care with the 9  of GDP spent by much of the rest of the world  noted that the U S  has fewer doctors and nurses per person  and said    t hat kind of a cost  compared with the rest of the world  is like a tapeworm eating at our economic body   51   edit  Allegations of waste In December 2011  the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare  amp  Medicaid Services  Dr  Donald Berwick  asserted that 20  to 30  of health care spending is waste  He listed five causes for the waste   1  overtreatment of patients   2  the failure to coordinate care   3  the administrative complexity of the health care system   4  burdensome rules and  5  fraud  52   edit  Payment See also  Bundled payment  Capitation  healthcare   and Fee for service Doctors and hospitals are generally funded by payments from patients and insurance plans in return for services rendered  fee for service or FFS   Around 84 7  of Americans have some form of health insurance  either through their employer or the employer of their spouse or parent  59 3    purchased individually  8 9    or provided by government programs  27 8   there is some overlap in these figures   53  All government health care programs have restricted eligibility  and there is no government health insurance company which covers all Americans  Americans without health insurance coverage in 2007 totaled 15 3  of the population  or 45 7 million people  53  Among those whose employer pays for health insurance  the employee may be required to contribute part of the cost of this insurance  while the employer usually chooses the insurance company and  for large groups  negotiates with the insurance company  In 2004  private insurance paid for 36  of personal health expenditures  private out of pocket 15   federal government 34   state and local governments 11   and other private funds 4   54  Due to  a dishonest and inefficient system  that sometimes inflates bills to ten times the actual cost  even insured patients can be billed more than the real cost of their care  55  Insurance for dental and vision care  except for visits to ophthalmologists  which are covered by regular health insurance  is usually sold separately  Prescription drugs are often handled differently than medical services  including by the government programs  Major federal laws regulating the insurance industry include COBRA and HIPAA  Individuals with private or government insurance are limited to medical facilities which accept the particular type of medical insurance they carry  Visits to facilities outside the insurance program s  network  are usually either not covered or the patient must bear more of the cost  Hospitals negotiate with insurance programs to set reimbursement rates  some rates for government insurance programs are set by law  The sum paid to a doctor for a service rendered to an insured patient is generally less than that paid  out of pocket  by an uninsured patient  In return for this discount  the insurance company includes the doctor as part of their  network   which means more patients are eligible for lowest cost treatment there  The negotiated rate may not cover the cost of the service  but providers  hospitals and doctors  can refuse to accept a given type of insurance  including Medicare and Medicaid  Low reimbursement rates have generated complaints from providers  and some patients with government insurance have difficulty finding nearby providers for certain types of medical services  Charity care for those who cannot pay is sometimes available  and is usually funded by non profit foundations  religious orders  government subsidies  or services donated by the employees  Massachusetts and New Jersey have programs where the state will pay for health care when the patient cannot afford to do so  56  The City and County of San Francisco is also implementing a citywide health care program for all uninsured residents  limited to those whose incomes and net worth are below an eligibility threshold  Some cities and counties operate or provide subsidies to private facilities open to all regardless of the ability to pay  Means testing is applied  and some patients of limited means may be charged for the services they use  The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act requires virtually all hospitals to accept all patients  regardless of the ability to pay  for emergency room care  The act does not provide access to non emergency room care for patients who cannot afford to pay for health care  nor does it provide the benefit of preventive care and the continuity of a primary care physician  Emergency health care is generally more expensive than an urgent care clinic or a doctor s office visit  especially if a condition has worsened due to putting off needed care  Emergency rooms are typically at  near  or over capacity  Long wait times have become a problem nationally  and in urban areas some ERs are put on  diversion  on a regular basis  meaning that ambulances are directed to bring patients elsewhere  57   edit  Private This

insurance coverage type  for those under 65 years of age Most Americans under age 65  59 3   receive their health insurance coverage through an employer  which includes both private as well as civilian public sector employers  under group coverage  although this percentage is declining  Costs for employer paid health insurance are rising rapidly  since 2001  premiums for family coverage have increased 78   while wages have risen 19  and inflation has risen 17   according to a 2007 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation  34  Workers with employer sponsored insurance also contribute  in 2007  the average percentage of premium paid by covered workers is 16  for single coverage and 28  for family coverage  34  In addition to their premium contributions  most covered workers face additional payments when they use health care services  in the form of deductibles and copayments  Just less than 9  of the population purchases individual health care insurance  53  Insurance payments are a form of cost sharing and risk management where each individual or their employer pays predictable monthly premiums  This cost spreading mechanism often picks up much of the cost of health care  but individuals must often pay up front a minimum part of the total cost  a   deductible     or a small part of the cost of every procedure  a copayment   Private insurance accounts for 35  of total health spending in the United States  by far the largest share among OECD countries  Beside the United States  Canada and France are the two other OECD countries where private insurance represents more than 10  of total health spending  58  Provider networks can be used to reduce costs by negotiating favorable fees from providers  selecting cost effective providers  and creating financial incentives for providers to practice more efficiently  59  A survey issued in 2009 by America s Health Insurance Plans found that patients going to out of network providers are sometimes charged extremely high fees  60  61  Defying many analysts  expectations  PPOs have gained market share at the expense of HMOs over the past decade  62  Just as the more loosely managed PPOs have edged out HMOs  HMOs themselves have also evolved towards less tightly managed models  The first HMOs in the U S   such as Kaiser Permanente in Oakland  California  and the Health Insurance Plan  HIP  in New York  were  staff model  HMOs  which owned their own health care facilities and employed the doctors and other health care professionals who staffed them  The name health maintenance organization stems from the idea that the HMO would make it its job to maintain the enrollee s health  rather than merely to treat illnesses  In accordance with this mission  managed care organizations typically cover preventive health care  Within the tightly integrated staff model HMO  the HMO can develop and disseminate guidelines on cost effective care  while the enrollee s primary care doctor can act as patient advocate and care coordinator  helping the patient negotiate the complex health care system  Despite a substantial body of research demonstrating that many staff model HMOs deliver high quality and cost effective care  they have steadily lost market share  They have been replaced by more loosely managed networks of providers with whom health plans have negotiated discounted fees  It is common today for a physician or hospital to have contracts with a dozen or more health plans  each with different referral networks  contracts with different diagnostic facilities  and different practice guidelines   edit  Public Government programs directly cover 27 8  of the population  83 million   53  including the elderly  disabled  children  veterans  and some of the poor  and federal law mandates public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay  Public spending accounts for between 45  and 56 1  of U S  health care spending  63  Per capita spending on health care by the U S  government placed it among the top ten highest spenders among United Nations member countries in 2004  64  Government funded programs include  Medicare  generally covering citizens and long term residents 65 years and older and the disabled  Medicaid  generally covering low income people in certain categories  including children  pregnant women  and the disabled   Administered by the states   State Children s Health Insurance Program  which provides health insurance for low income children who do not qualify for Medicaid   Administered by the states  with matching state funds   Various programs for federal employees  including TRICARE for military personnel  for use in civilian facilities  The Veterans Administration  which provides care to veterans  their families  and survivors through medical centers and clinics  65  Title X which funds reproductive health care State and local health department clinics Indian health service National Institutes of Health treats patients who enroll in research for free  Medical Corps of various branches of the military  Certain county and state hospitals Government run community clinics The exemption of employer sponsored health benefits from federal income and payroll taxes distorts the health care market  66  The U S  government  unlike some other countries  does not treat employer funded health care benefits as a taxable benefit in kind to the employee  The value of the lost tax revenue from a benefits in kind tax is an estimated  150 billion a year  67  Some regard this as being disadvantageous to people who have to buy insurance in the individual market which must be paid from income received after tax  68  Health insurance benefits are an attractive way for employers to increase the salary of employees as they are nontaxable  As a result  65  of the non elderly population and over 90  of the privately insured non elderly population receives health insurance at the workplace  69  Additionally  most economists agree that this tax shelter increases individual demand for health insurance  leading some to claim that it is largely responsible for the rise in health care spending  69  In addition the government allows full tax shelter at the highest marginal rate to investors in health savings accounts  HSAs   Some have argued that this tax incentive adds little value to national health care as a whole because the most wealthy in society tend also to be the most healthy  Also it has been argued  HSAs segregate the insurance pools into those for the wealthy and those for the less wealthy which thereby makes equivalent insurance cheaper for the rich and more expensive for the poor  70  However  one advantage of health insurance accounts is that funds can only be used towards certain HSA qualified expenses  including medicine  doctor s fees  and Medicare Parts A and B  Funds cannot be used towards expenses such as cosmetic surgery  71  There are also various state and local programs for the poor  In 2007  Medicaid provided health care coverage for 39 6 million low income Americans  although Medicaid covers approximately 40  of America s poor   72  and Medicare provided health care coverage for 41 4 million elderly and disabled Americans  53  Enrollment in Medicare is expected to reach 77 million by 2031  when the baby boom generation is fully enrolled  73  It has been reported that the number of physicians accepting Medicaid has decreased in recent years due to relatively high administrative costs and low reimbursements  74  In 1997  the federal government also created the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   a joint federal state program to insure children in families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford health insurance  75  SCHIP covered 6 6 million children in 2006  76  but the program is already facing funding shortfalls in many states  77  The government has also mandated access to emergency care regardless of insurance status and ability to pay through the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act  EMTALA   passed in 1986  78  but EMTALA is an unfunded mandate  79   edit  The uninsured Main article  Health insurance coverage in the United States Some Americans do not qualify for government provided health insurance  are not provided health insurance by an employer  and are unable to afford  cannot qualify for  or choose not to purchase  private health insurance  When charity or  uncompensated  care is not available  they sometimes simply go without needed medical treatment  This problem has become a source of considerable political controversy on a national level  According to the US Census Bureau  in 2007  45 7 million people in the U S   15 3  of the population  were without health insurance for at least part of the year  This number was down slightly from the previous year  with nearly 3 million more people receiving government coverage and a slightly lower percentage covered under private plans than the year previous  53  Other studies have placed the number of uninsured in the years 2007 2008 as high as 86 7 million  about 29  of the US population  80  81  Among the uninsured population  the Census Bureau says  nearly 37 million were employment age adults  ages 18 to 64   and more than 27 million worked at least part time  About 38  of the uninsured live in households with incomes of  50 000 or more  53  According to the Census Bureau  nearly 36 million of the uninsured are legal U S citizens  Another 9 7 million are non citizens  but the Census Bureau does not distinguish in its estimate between legal non citizens and illegal immigrants  53  Nearly one fifth of the uninsured population is able to afford insurance  almost one quarter is eligible for public coverage  and the remaining 56  need financial assistance  8 9  of all Americans   82  Extending coverage to all who are eligible remains a fiscal challenge  83  A 2003 study in Health Affairs estimated that uninsured people in the U S  received approximately  35 billion in uncompensated care in 2001  84  The study noted that this amount per capita was half what the average insured person received  The study found that various levels of government finance most uncompensated care  spending about  30 6 billion on payments and programs to serve the uninsured and covering as much as 80 85  of uncompensated care costs through grants and other direct payments  tax appropriations  and Medicare and Medicaid payment add ons  Most of this money comes from the federal government  followed by state and local tax appropriations for hospitals  Another study by the same authors in the same year estimated the additional annual cost of covering the uninsured  in 2001 dollars  at  34 billion  for public coverage  and  69 billion  for private coverage   These estimates represent an increase in total health care spending of 3 6  and would raise health care s share of GDP by less than one percentage point  the study concluded  85  Another study published in the same journal in 2004 estimated that the value of health forgone each year because of uninsurance was  65  130 billion and concluded that this figure constituted  a lower bound estimate of economic losses resulting from the present level of uninsurance nationally   86  The health insurance system in America  in contrast with health insurance in almost all other developed nations  is fundamentally a voluntary one  There are many perspectives on the purpose of health insurance in the United States  For consumers  health insurance serves two main purposes  it provides access to affordable health care through preferential pricing and it offers financial protection from unexpected health care costs  For clinicians and other health care providers  insurance ensures financial stability of the practice office  Health insurance was first developed by Baylor University Hospital for exactly that purpose  87  In 2004  the Institute of Medicine  IOM  issued a comprehensive series of six reports on the consequences of uninsurance for children  adults  families  communities  and the nation  lt  17  The reports concluded that the committee recommended that the nation should implement a strategy to achieve universal health insurance coverage  As of 2011  a comprehensive national plan to address what universal health plan supporters terms  America s uninsured crisis   has yet to be enacted  A few states have achieved progress towards the goal of universal health insurance coverage  such as Maine  Massachusetts  and Vermont  but other states including California  have failed attempts of reforms  88  The six reports created by the Institute of Medicine  IOM  found that the principle consequences of uninsurance were the following  Children and Adults without health insurance did not receive needed medical care  they typically live in poorer health and die earlier than children or adults who have insurance  The financial stability of a whole family can be put at risk if only one person is uninsured and needs treatment for unexpected health care costs  The overall health status of a community can be adversely affected by a higher percentage of uninsured people within the community  The coverage gap between the insured and the uninsured has not decreased even after the recent federal initiatives to extend health insurance coverage  88  The last report was published in 2004 and was named Insuring America s Health  Principles and Recommendations  This report recommended the following  The President and Congress need to develop a strategy to achieve universal insurance coverage and establish a firm schedule to reach this goal by the year 2010  The committee also recommended that the federal and state governments provide sufficient resources for Medicaid and the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  to cover all persons currently eligible until the universal coverage takes effect  They also warned that the federal and state governments should prevent the erosion of outreach efforts  eligibility  enrollment  and coverage of these specific programs  88  Some people think that not having health insurance will have adverse consequences for the health of the uninsured  89 On the other hand  some people believe that children and adults without health insurance have access to needed health care services at hospital emergency rooms  community health centers  or other safety net facilities offering charity care  90  Some observers note that there is a solid body of evidence showing that a substantial proportion of U S  health care expenditures is directed toward care that is not effective and may sometimes even be harmful  91  At least for the insured population  spending more and using more health care services does not always yield better health outcomes or increase life expectancy  92  Children in America are typically perceived as in good health relative to adults  due to the fact that most serious health problems occur later in one s life  Certain conditions including asthma  diabetes  and obesity have become much more prevalent among children in the past few decades  88  There is also a growing population of vulnerable children with special health care needs that require ongoing medical attention  which would not be accessible without health insurance  More than 10 million children in the United States meet the federal definition of children with special health care needs  who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical  development  behavioral  or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally   93  These children require health related services of an amount beyond that required by the average children in America  Typically when children acquire health insurance  they are much less likely to experience previously unmet health care needs  this includes the average child in America and children with special health care needs  88  The Committee on Health Insurance Status and Its Consequences concluded that the effects of health insurance on children s health outcomes  Children with health insurance receive more timely diagnosis of serious health conditions  experience fewer hospitalizations  and miss fewer days of school  The same committee analyzed the effects of health insurance on adult s health outcomes  adults who do not have health insurance coverage who acquire Medicare coverage at age 65  experience substantially improved health and functional status  particularly those who have cardiovascular disease or diabetes  Adults who have cardiovascular disease or other cardiac risk factors that are uninsured are less likely to be aware of their condition  which leads to worse health outcomes for those individuals  Without health insurance  adults are more likely to be diagnosed with certain cancers that would have been detectable earlier by screening by a clinician if they had regularly visited a doctor  As a consequence  these adults are more likely to die from their diagnosed cancer or suffer poorer health outcomes  88  Many towns and cities in the United States have high concentrations of people under the age of 65 who lack health insurance  94  There are implications of high rates of uninsurance for communities and for insured people in those communities  Institute of Medicine committee warned of the potential problems of high rates of uninsurance for local health care  including reduced access to clinic based primary care  specialty services  and hospital based emergency services  17  Estimates for 2008 reported that the uninsured would spend  30 billion for healthcare and receive  56 billion in uncompensated care  and that if everyone were covered by insurance then overall costs would increase by  123 billion  95  Other studies projected the uninsured would spend  30 billion out of pocket and an estimated  43 billion would be covered through various government subsidies including Medicare and Medicaid  leaving  13 billion  less than 1  of annual spending  uncompensated  17   edit  Role of government in health care market Numerous publicly funded health care programs help to provide for the elderly  disabled  military service families and veterans  children  and the poor  96  and federal law ensures public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay  97  however  a system of universal health care has not been implemented nation wide  However  as the OECD has pointed out  the total U S  public expenditure for this limited population would  in most other OECD countries  be enough for the government to provide primary health insurance for the entire population  58  Although the federal Medicare program and the federal state Medicaid programs possess some monopsonistic purchasing power  the highly fragmented buy side of the U S  health system is relatively weak by international standards  and in some areas  some suppliers such as large hospital groups have a virtual monopoly on the supply side  98  In most OECD countries  there is a high degree of public ownership and public finance  99  The resulting economy of scale in providing health care services appears to enable a much tighter grip on costs  100  The U S   as a matter of oft stated public policy  largely does not regulate prices of services from private providers  assuming the private sector to do it better  101  Massachusetts has adopted a universal health care system through the Massachusetts 2006 Health Reform Statute  It mandates that all residents who can afford to do so purchase health insurance  provides subsidized insurance plans so that nearly everyone can afford health insurance  and provides a  Health Safety Net Fund  to pay for necessary treatment for those who cannot find affordable health insurance or are not eligible  102  In July 2009  Connecticut passed into law a plan called SustiNet  with the goal of achieving health care coverage of 98  of its residents by 2014  103   edit  Regulation and oversight Further information  American Board of Medical Specialties  United States Medical Licensing Examination  and National Association of Insurance Commissioners  edit  Involved organizations and institutions Healthcare is subject to extensive regulation at both the federal and the state level  much of which  arose haphazardly   104  Under this system  the federal government cedes primary responsibility to the states under the McCarran Ferguson Act  Essential regulation includes the licensure of health care providers at the state level and the testing and approval of pharmaceuticals and medical devices by the Food and Drug Administration  and laboratory testing  These regulations are designed to protect consumers from ineffective or fraudulent healthcare  Additionally  states regulate the health insurance market and they often have laws which require that health insurance companies cover certain procedures  105  although state mandates generally do not apply to the self funded health care plans offered by large employers  which exempt from state laws under preemption clause of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act  In 2010  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  PPACA  was passed  and includes various new regulations  with one of the most notable being a health insurance mandate which requires all citizens to purchase health insurance  While not regulation per se  the federal government also has a major influence on the healthcare market through its payments to providers under Medicare and Medicaid  which in some cases are used as a reference point in the negotiations between medical providers and insurance companies  104  At the federal level  United States Department of Health and Human Services oversees the various federal agencies involved in health care  The health agencies are a part of the United States Public Health Service  and include the Food and Drug Administration  which certifies the safety of food  effectiveness of drugs and medical products  the Centers for Disease Prevention  which prevents disease  premature death  and disability  the Agency of Health Care Research and Quality  the Agency Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  which regulates hazardous spills of toxic substances  and the National Institutes of Health  which conducts medical research  State governments maintain state health departments  and local governments  counties and municipalities  often have their own health departments  usually branches of the state health department  Regulations of a state board may have executive and police strength to enforce state health laws  In some states  all members of state boards must be health care professionals  Members of state boards may be assigned by the governor or elected by the state committee  Members of local boards may be elected by the mayor council  The McCarran Ferguson Act  which cedes regulation to the states  does not itself regulate insurance  nor does it mandate that states regulate insurance   Acts of Congress  that do not expressly purport to regulate the  business of insurance  will not preempt state laws or regulations that regulate the  business of insurance   The Act also provides that federal anti trust laws will not apply to the  business of insurance  as long as the state regulates in that area  but federal anti trust laws will apply in cases of boycott  coercion  and intimidation  By contrast  most other federal laws will not apply to insurance whether the states regulate in that area or not  Self policing of providers by providers is a major part of oversight  Many health care organizations also voluntarily submit to inspection and certification by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations  JCAHO  Providers also undergo testing to obtain board certification attesting to their skills  A report issued by Public Citizen in April 2008 found that  for the third year in a row  the number of serious disciplinary actions against physicians by state medical boards declined from 2006 to 2007  and called for more oversight of the boards  106  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  publishes an on line searchable database of performance data on nursing homes  107  The regulation is controversial  In 2004  conservative think tank Cato Institute published a study which concluded that regulation provides benefits in the amount of  170 billion but costs the public up to  340 billion  108  The study concluded that the majority of the cost differential arises from medical malpractice  U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  regulations  and facilities regulations  108   edit   Certificates of need  for hospitals In 1978  the federal government required that all states implement Certificate of Need  CON  programs for cardiac care  meaning that hospitals had to apply and receive certificates prior to implementing the program  the intent was to reduce cost by reducing duplicate investments in facilities  109  It has been observed that these certificates could be used to increase costs through weakened competition  104  Many states removed the CON programs after the federal requirement expired in 1986  but some states still have these programs  109  Empirical research looking at the costs in areas where these programs have been discontinued have not found a clear effect on costs  and the CON programs could decrease costs because of reduced facility construction or increase costs due to reduced competition  109   edit  Licensing of providers American Medical Association  AMA  has lobbied the government to highly limit physician education since 1910  currently at 100 000 doctors per year  110  which has led to a shortage of doctors 111  and physicians  wages in the U S  are double those in the Europe  which is a major reason for the more expensive health care  112  An even bigger problem may be that the doctors are paid for procedures instead of results  112  AMA has also aggressively lobbied for many restrictions that require doctors to carry out operations that might be carried out by cheaper workforce  For example  in 1995  36 states banned or restricted midwifery even though it delivers equally safe care to that by doctors  according to studies  The regulation lobbied by AMA has decreased the amount and quality of health care  according to the consensus of economist  the restrictions do not add to quality  they decrease the supply of care  110  113  Moreover  psychologists  nurses and pharmacologists are not allowed to prescribe medicines  clarification needed  Previously nurses were not even allowed to vaccinate the patients without direct supervision by doctors  36 states require that health care workers undergo criminal background checks  114   edit  Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act  EMTALA  Main article  Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act EMTALA  enacted by the federal government in 1986  requires that hospital emergency departments treat emergency conditions of all patients regardless of their ability to pay and is considered a critical element in the  safety net  for the uninsured  but established no direct payment mechanism for such care  Indirect payments and reimbursements through federal and state government programs have never fully compensated public and private hospitals for the full cost of care mandated by EMTALA  In fact  more than half of all emergency care in the U S  now goes uncompensated  115  According to some analyses  EMTALA is an unfunded mandate that has contributed to financial pressures on hospitals in the last 20 years  causing them to consolidate and close facilities  and contributing to emergency room overcrowding  According to the Institute of Medicine  between 1993 and 2003  emergency room visits in the U S  grew by 26   while in the same period  the number of emergency departments declined by 425  116  Mentally ill patients present a unique challenge for emergency departments and hospitals  In accordance with EMTALA  mentally ill patients who enter emergency rooms are evaluated for emergency medical conditions  Once mentally ill patients are medically stable  regional mental health agencies are contacted to evaluate them  Patients are evaluated as to whether they are a danger to themselves or others  Those meeting this criterion are admitted to a mental health facility to be further evaluated by a psychiatrist  Typically  mentally ill patients can be held for up to 72 hours  after which a court order is required  citation needed   edit  Quality assurance Health care quality assurance is the  activities and programs intended to assure or improve the quality of care in either a defined medical setting or a program  The concept includes the assessment or evaluation of the quality of care  identification of problems or shortcomings in the delivery of care  designing activities to overcome these deficiencies  and follow up monitoring to ensure effectiveness of corrective steps   117  One innovation in encouraging quality of health care is the public reporting of the performance of hospitals  health professionals or providers  and healthcare organizations  However  there is  no consistent evidence that the public release of performance data changes consumer behaviour or improves care   118   edit  Overall system effectiveness compared to other countries The CIA World Factbook ranked the United States 41st in the world for infant mortality rate 119  and 46th for total life expectancy  120  A study found that between 1997 and 2003  preventable deaths declined more slowly in the United States than in 18 other industrialized nations  121  For example  the United States was listed as 37th for life expectancy and 41st in low birth weight  122  The U S  stands 50th in the world for a life expectancy of 78 37  Australia  the first major country on the list stands ninth with a life expectancy of 81 81  123  The Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD  found that the United States ranked poorly in terms of Years of potential life lost  YPLL   a statistical measure of years of life lost under the age of 70 that were amenable to being saved by health care  Among OECD nations for which data are available  the United States ranked third last for the health care of women  after Mexico and Hungary  and fifth last for men  Slovakia and Poland were also worse   See the table and source at YPLL for details  Recent studies find growing gaps in life expectancy based on income and geography  In 2008  a government sponsored study found that life expectancy declined from 1983 to 1999 for women in 180 counties  and for men in 11 counties  with most of the life expectancy declines occurring the Deep South  Appalachia  along the Mississippi River  in the Southern Plains and in Texas  The gap is growing between rich and poor and by educational level  but narrowing between men and women and by race  124  Another study found that the mortality gap between the well educated and the poorly educated widened significantly between 1993 and 2001 for adults ages 25 through 64  the authors speculated that risk factors such as smoking  obesity and high blood pressure may lie behind these disparities  125  In 2011 the United States National Research Council forecasted that deaths attributed to smoking  on the decline in the US  will drop dramatically  improving life expectancy  it also suggested that 1 5 to 1 3 of the life expectancy difference can be attributed to obesity which is the worst in the world and has been increasing  126  In an analysis of breast cancer  colorectal cancer  and prostate cancer diagnosed during 1990 1994 in 31 countries  the United States had the highest five year relative survival rate for breast cancer and prostate cancer  although survival was systematically and substantially lower in black U S  men and women  127  The debate about U S  health care concerns questions of access  efficiency  and quality purchased by the high sums spent  The World Health Organization  WHO  in 2000 ranked the U S  health care system first in responsiveness  but 37th in overall performance and 72nd by overall level of health  among 191 member nations included in the study   13  14  The WHO study has been criticized by the free market advocate David Gratzer because  fairness in financial contribution  was used as an assessment factor  marking down countries with high per capita private or fee paying health treatment  128  The WHO study has been criticized  in an article published in Health Affairs  for its failure to include the satisfaction ratings of the general public  129  The study found that there was little correlation between the WHO rankings for health systems and the stated satisfaction of citizens using those systems  130  Some countries  such as Italy and Spain  which were given the highest ratings by WHO were ranked poorly by their citizens while other countries  such as Denmark and Finland  were given low scores by WHO but had the highest percentages of citizens reporting satisfaction with their health care systems  130  WHO staff  however  say that the WHO analysis does reflect system  responsiveness  and argue that this is a superior measure to consumer satisfaction  which is influenced by expectations  131  A report released in April 2008 by the Foundation for Child Development  which studied the period from 1994 through 2006  found mixed results for the health of children in the U S  Mortality rates for children ages 1 through 4 dropped by a third  and the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels dropped by 84   The percentage of mothers who smoked during pregnancy also declined  On the other hand  both obesity and the percentage of low birth weight babies increased  The authors note that the increase in babies born with low birth weights can be attributed to women delaying childbearing and the increased use of fertility drugs  132  133   edit  System efficiency and equity Variations in the efficiency of health care delivery can cause variations in outcomes  The Dartmouth Atlas Project  for instance  reported that  for over 20 years  marked variations in how medical resources are distributed and used in the United States were accompanied by marked variations in outcomes  134   edit  Efficiency  edit  Value for money A study of international health care spending levels published in the health policy journal Health Affairs in the year 2000 found that the U S  spends substantially more on health care than any other country in the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD   and that the use of health care services in the U S  is below the OECD median by most measures  The authors of the study conclude that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U S  than elsewhere  39   edit  Delays in seeking care and increased use of emergency care Uninsured Americans are less likely to have regular health care and use preventive services  They are more likely to delay seeking care  resulting in more medical crises  which are more expensive than ongoing treatment for such conditions as diabetes and high blood pressure  A 2007 study published in JAMA concluded that uninsured people were less likely than the insured to receive any medical care after an accidental injury or the onset of a new chronic condition  The uninsured with an injury were also twice as likely as those with insurance to have received none of the recommended follow up care  and a similar pattern held for those with a new chronic condition  135  Uninsured patients are twice as likely to visit hospital emergency rooms as those with insurance  burdening a system meant for true emergencies with less urgent care needs  136  In 2008 researchers with the American Cancer Society found that individuals who lacked private insurance  including those covered by Medicaid  were more likely to be diagnosed with late stage cancer than those who had such insurance  137   edit  Shared costs of the uninsured Main article  Uninsured in the United States The costs of treating the uninsured must often be absorbed by providers as charity care  passed on to the insured via cost shifting and higher health insurance premiums  or paid by taxpayers through higher taxes  138  However  hospitals and other providers are reimbursed for the cost of providing uncompensated care via a federal matching fund program  Each state enacts legislation governing the reimbursement of funds to providers  In Missouri  for example  providers assessments totaling  800 million are matched    2 for each assessed  1   to create a pool of approximately  2 billion  By federal law these funds are transferred to the Missouri Hospital Association for disbursement to hospitals for the costs incurred providing uncompenstated care including Disproportionate Share Payments  to hospitals with high quantities of uninsured patients   Medicaid shortfalls  Medicaid managed care payments to insurance companies and other costs incurred by hospitals  139  In New Hampshire  by statute  reimbursable uncompensated care costs shall include  charity care costs  any portion of Medicaid patient care costs that are unreimbursed by Medicaid payments  and any portion of bad debt costs that the commissioner determines would meet the criteria under 42 U S C  section 1396r 4 g  governing hospital specific limits on disproportionate share hospital payments under Title XIX of the Social Security Act  140  A report published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in April 2008 found that economic downturns place a significant strain on state Medicaid and SCHIP programs  The authors estimated that a 1  increase in the unemployment rate would increase Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment by 1 million  and increase the number uninsured by 1 1 million  State spending on Medicaid and SCHIP would increase by  1 4 billion  total spending on these programs would increase by  3 4 billion   This increased spending would occur at the same time state government revenues were declining  During the last downturn  the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003  JGTRRA  included federal assistance to states  which helped states avoid tightening their Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility rules  The authors conclude that Congress should consider similar relief for the current economic downturn  141   edit  Variations in provider practices The treatment given to a patient can vary significantly depending on which health care providers they use  Research suggests that some cost effective treatments are not used as often as they should be  while overutilization occurs with other health care services  Unnecessary treatments increase costs and can cause patients unnecessary anxiety  142  The use of prescription drugs varies significantly by geographic region  143  The overuse of medical benefits is known as moral hazard  individuals who are insured are then more inclined to consume health care  The way the Health care system tries to eliminate this problem is through cost sharing tactics like co pays and deductibles  If patients face more of the economic burden they will then only consume health care when it is necessary  According to the RAND health insurance experiment  individuals with higher Coinsurance rates consumed less health care then those with lower rates  The experiment concluded that with less consumption of care there was generally no loss in societal welfare but  for the poorer and sicker groups of people there were definitely negative effects  These patients were forced to forgo necessary preventative care measures in order to save money leading to late diagnosis of easily treated diseases and more expensive procedures later  With less preventative care  the patient is hurt financially with an increase in expensive visits to the ER The Health Care costs in the U S will also rise with these procedures as well  More expensive procedures leads to greater costs  144  145  One study has found significant geographic variations in Medicare spending for patients in the last two years of life  These spending levels are associated with the amount of hospital capacity available in each area  Higher spending did not result in patients living longer  45  146   edit  Care coordination Primary care doctors are often the point of entry for most patients needing care  but in the fragmented health care system of the U S   many patients and their providers experience problems with care coordination  For example  a Harris Interactive survey of California physicians found that  Four of every ten physicians report that their patients have had problems with coordination of their care in the last 12 months  More than 60  of doctors report that their patients  sometimes  or  often  experience long wait times for diagnostic tests  Some 20  of doctors report having their patients repeat tests because of an inability to locate the results during a scheduled visit  147  According to an article in The New York Times  the relationship between doctors and patients is deteriorating  148  A study from Johns Hopkins University found that roughly one in four patients believe their doctors have exposed them to unnecessary risks  and anecdotal evidence such as self help books and web postings suggest increasing patient frustration  Possible factors behind the deteriorating doctor patient relationship include the current system for training physicians and differences in how doctors and patients view the practice of medicine  Doctors may focus on diagnosis and treatment  while patients may be more interested in wellness and being listened to by their doctors  148  Many primary care physicians no longer see their patients while they are in the hospital  Instead  hospitalists are used  which fragments care because hospitalists usually have had no previous relationship with the patient they are treating and do not have a personal knowledge of the patient s medical history  149  150  The use of hospitalists is sometimes mandated by health insurance companies as a cost saving measure which is resented by some primary care physicians  151   edit  Administrative costs The health care system in the U S  has a vast number of players  There are hundreds  if not thousands  of insurance companies in the U S  67  152  This system has considerable administrative overhead  far greater than in nationalized  single payer systems  such as Canada s  An oft cited study by Harvard Medical School and the Canadian Institute for Health Information determined that some 31  of U S  health care dollars  or more than  1 000 per person per year  went to health care administrative costs  nearly double the administrative overhead in Canada  on a percentage basis  153  According to the insurance industry group America s Health Insurance Plans  administrative costs for private health insurance plans have averaged approximately 12  of premiums over the last 40 years  There has been a shift in the type and distribution of administrative expenses over that period  The cost of adjudicating claims has fallen  while insurers are spending more on other administrative activities  such as medical management  nurse help lines  and negotiating discounted fees with health care providers  154  A 2003 study published by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association also found that health insurer administrative costs were approximately 11  to 12  of premiums  with Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans reporting slightly lower administrative costs  on average  than commercial insurers  155  For the period 1998 through 2003  average insurer administrative costs declined from 12 9  to 11 6  of premiums  The largest increases in administrative costs were in customer service and information technology  and the largest decreases were in provider services and contracting and in general administration  156  The McKinsey Global Institute estimated that excess spending on  health administration and insurance  accounted for as much as 21  of the estimated total excess spending   477 billion in 2003   157  According to a report published by the CBO in 2008  administrative costs for private insurance represent approximately 12  of premiums  Variations in administrative costs between private plans are largely attributable to economies of scale  Coverage for large employers has the lowest administrative costs  The percentage of premium attributable to administration increases for smaller firms  and is highest for individually purchased coverage  158  A 2009 study published by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association found that the average administrative expense cost for all commercial health insurance products was represented 9 18  of premiums in 2008  159  Administrative costs were 11 12  of premiums for small group products and 16 35  in the individual market  159  One study of the billing and insurance related  BIR  costs borne not only by insurers but also by physicians and hospitals found that BIR among insurers  physicians  and hospitals in California represented 20 22  of privately insured spending in California acute care settings  160   edit  Third party payment problem and consumer driven insurance Most Americans pay for medical services largely through insurance  and this can distort the incentives of consumers since the consumer pays only a portion of the ultimate cost  104  The lack of price information on medical services can also distort incentives  104  The insurance which pays on behalf of insureds negotiate with medical providers  sometimes using government established prices such as Medicaid billing rates as a reference point  104  This reasoning has led for calls to reform the insurance system to create a consumer driven health care system whereby consumers pay more out of pocket  161  In 2003  the Medicare Prescription Drug  Improvement  and Modernization Act was passed  which encourages consumers to have a high deductible health plan and a health savings account   edit  Overall costs The cost impact of the existing mixed public private system is subject to debate  The United States spends more as a percentage of GDP than similar countries  and this can be explained either through higher prices for services themselves  higher costs to administer the system  or more utilization of these services  for example  due to the United States having a more sickly population   or to a combination of these elements  162  Free market advocates claim that the health care system is  dysfunctional  because the system of third party payments from insurers removes the patient as a major participant in the financial and medical choices that affect costs  Because government intervention has expanded insurance availability through programs such as Medicare and Medicaid  this has exacerbated the problem  163  According to a study paid for by America s Health Insurance Plans  a Washington lobbyist for the health insurance industry  and carried out by PriceWaterhouseCoopers  increased utilization is the primary driver of rising health care costs in the U S  164  The study cites numerous causes of increased utilization  including rising consumer demand  new treatments  more intensive diagnostic testing  lifestyle factors  the movement to broader access plans  and higher priced technologies  164  The study also mentions cost shifting from government programs to private payers  Low reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid have increased cost shifting pressures on hospitals and doctors  who charge higher rates for the same services to private payers  which eventually affects health insurance rates  165  Health care costs rising far faster than inflation have been a major driver for health care reform in the United States  In March 2010  Massachusetts released a report on the cost drivers which it called  unique in the nation   166  The report noted that providers and insurers negotiate privately  and therefore the prices can vary between providers and insurers for the same services  and it found that the variation in prices did not vary based on quality of care but rather on market leverage  the report also found that price increases rather than increased utilization explained the spending increases in the past several years  166   edit  Equity  edit  Coverage Enrollment rules in private and governmental programs result in millions of Americans going without health care coverage  including children  The U S  Census Bureau estimated that 45 7 million Americans  15 3  of the total population  had no health insurance coverage in 2007  53  However  statistics regarding the insured population are difficult to pinpoint for a number of factors  with the Census Bureau writing that  health insurance coverage is likely to be underreported   10  Further  such statistics do not provide insight into the reason a given person might be uninsured  For example  studies have shown that approximately one third of this 45 7 million person population of uninsured persons is actually eligible for government insurance programmes such as Medicaid Medicare  but has elected not to enroll  The largest proportion of the population of uninsured Americans is persons earning in excess of  50 000 per annum  with those earning over  75 000 p a  comprising the fastest growing segment of the uninsured population  US Citizens who earn too much money to qualify for government assistance with insurance programs but who do not earn enough to purchase a private health insurance plan make up approxmiately 2 7  percent of the total US population  8 2 million of approximately 300 million total population  by 2003 figures   11  Some states  like California  do offer insurance coverage for children of low income families  but not for adults  other states do not offer such coverage at all  and so  both parent and child are caught in the notorious coverage  gap   Although EMTALA 167  certainly keeps alive many working class people who are badly injured  the 1986 law neither requires the provision of preventive or rehabilitative care  nor subsidizes such care  and it does nothing about the difficulties in the American mental health system  Coverage gaps also occur among the insured population  Johns Hopkins University professor Vicente Navarro stated in 2003   the problem does not end here  with the uninsured  An even larger problem is the underinsured  and  The most credible estimate of the number of people in the United States who have died because of lack of medical care was provided by a study carried out by Harvard Medical School Professors Himmelstein and Woolhandler  New England Journal of Medicine 336  no  11  1997   They concluded that almost 100 000 people died in the United States each year because of lack of needed care   168  Another study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U S  adults were underinsured in 2003  The study defined underinsurance as characterized by at least one of the following conditions  annual out of pocket medical expenses totaling 10  or more of income  or 5  or more among adults with incomes below 200  of the federal poverty level  or health plan deductibles equaling or exceeding 5  of income  The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care  report financial stress because of medical bills  and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs  The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes 73  of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200  of the federal poverty level  169  Another study focusing on the effect of being uninsured found that individuals with private insurance were less likely to be diagnosed with late stage cancer than either the uninsured or Medicaid beneficiaries  137  A study examining the effects of health insurance cost sharing more generally found that chronically ill patients with higher co payments sought less care for both minor and serious symptoms while no effect on self reported health status was observed  The authors concluded that the effect of cost sharing should be carefully monitored  170  Coverage gaps and affordability also surfaced in a 2007 international comparison by the Commonwealth Fund  Among adults surveyed in the U S   37  reported that they had foregone needed medical care in the previous year because of cost  either skipping medications  avoiding seeing a doctor when sick  or avoiding other recommended care  The rate was even higher  42  among those with chronic conditions  The study reported that these rates were well above those found in the other six countries surveyed  Australia  Canada  Germany  the Netherlands  New Zealand  and the UK  171  The study also found that 19  of U S  adults surveyed reported serious problems paying medical bills  more than double the rate in the next highest country   edit  Mental health A lack of mental health coverage for Americans bears significant ramifications to the U S  economy and social system  A report by the U S  Surgeon General found that mental illnesses are the second leading cause of disability in the nation and affect 20  of all Americans  172  It is estimated that less than half of all people with mental illnesses receive treatment due to factors such as stigma and lack of access to care  173  The Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 mandates that group health plans provide mental health and substance related disorder benefits that are at least equivalent to benefits offered for medical and surgical procedures  The legislation renews and expands provisions of the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996  The law requires financial equity for annual and lifetime mental health benefits  and compels parity in treatment limits and expands all equity provisions to addiction services  Up to 2008 insurance companies used loopholes and  though providing financial equity  they often worked around the law by applying unequal co payments or setting limits on the number of days spent in in patient or out patient treatment facilities  174   edit  Medical underwriting and the uninsurable In most states in the U S   people seeking to purchase health insurance directly must undergo medical underwriting  Insurance companies seeking to mitigate the problem of adverse selection and manage their risk pools screen applicants for pre existing conditions  Insurers reject many applicants or quote increased rates for those with pre existing conditions  Diseases that can make an individual uninsurable include serious conditions  such as arthritis  cancer  and heart disease  but also such common ailments as acne  being 20 pounds over or under weight  and old sports injuries  175  An estimated 5 million of those without health insurance are considered  uninsurable  because of pre existing conditions  176  Proponents of medical underwriting argue that it ensures that individual health insurance premiums are kept as low as possible  177  Critics of medical underwriting believe that it unfairly prevents people with relatively minor and treatable pre existing conditions from obtaining health insurance  178  One large industry survey found that 13  of applicants for individual health insurance who went through medical underwriting were denied coverage in 2004  Declination rates increased significantly with age  rising from 5  for those under 18 to just under one third for those aged 60 to 64  179  Among those who were offered coverage  the study found that 76  received offers at standard premium rates  and 22  were offered higher rates  180  The frequency of increased premiums also increased with age  so for applicants over 40  roughly half were affected by medical underwriting  either in the form of denial or increased premiums  In contrast  almost 90  of applicants in their 20s were offered coverage  and three quarters of those were offered standard rates  Seventy percent of applicants age 60 64 were offered coverage  but almost half the time  40   it was at an increased premium  The study did not address how many applicants who were offered coverage at increased rates chose to decline the policy  A study conducted by the Commonwealth Fund in 2001 found that  among those aged 19 to 64 who sought individual health insurance during the previous three years  the majority found it unaffordable  and less than a third ended up purchasing insurance  This study did not distinguish between consumers who were quoted increased rates due to medical underwriting and those who qualified for standard or preferred premiums  181  Some states have outlawed medical underwriting as a prerequisite for individually purchased health coverage  182  These states tend to have the highest premiums for individual health insurance  183   edit  Demographic differences Main articles  Health disparities and Race and health In the United States  health disparities are well documented in ethnic minorities such as African Americans  Native Americans  and Hispanics  184  When compared to whites  these minority groups have higher incidence of chronic diseases  higher mortality  and poorer health outcomes  Among the disease specific examples of racial and ethnic disparities in the United States is the cancer incidence rate among African Americans  which is 25  higher than among whites  185  In addition  adult African Americans and Hispanics have approximately twice the risk as whites of developing diabetes  Minorities also have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and HIV AIDS than whites  185  Caucasian Americans have much lower life expectancy than Asian Americans  186  A 2001 study found large racial differences exist in healthy life expectancy at lower levels of education  187  Public spending is highly correlated with age  average per capita public spending for seniors was more than five times that for children   6 921 versus  1 225   Average public spending for non Hispanic blacks   2 973  was slightly higher than that for whites   2 675   while spending for Hispanics   1 967  was significantly lower than the population average   2 612   Total public spending is also strongly correlated with self reported health status   13 770 for those reporting  poor  health versus  1 279 for those reporting  excellent  health   63  Seniors comprise 13  of the population but take 1 3 of all prescription drugs  The average senior fills 38 prescriptions annually  188  There is a great deal of research into inequalities in health care  In some cases these inequalities are caused by income disparities that result in lack of health insurance and other barriers to receiving services  189  According to the 2009 National Healthcare Disparities Report  uninsured Americans are less likely to receive preventive services in health care  190  For example  minorities are not regularly screened for colon cancer and the death rate for colon cancer has increased among African Americans and Hispanic people  In other cases  inequalities in health care reflect a systemic bias in the way medical procedures and treatments are prescribed for different ethnic groups  Raj Bhopal writes that the history of racism in science and medicine shows that people and institutions behave according to the ethos of their times  191  Nancy Krieger wrote that racism underlies unexplained inequities in health care  including treatment for heart disease  192  renal failure  193  bladder cancer  194  and pneumonia  195 Raj Bhopal writes that these inequalities have been documented in numerous studies  The consistent and repeated findings were that black Americans received less health care than white Americans  particularly when the care involved expensive new technology  196  One recent study has found that when minority and white patients use the same hospital  they are given the same standard of care  197  198   edit  Drug efficacy and safety See also  Regulation of therapeutic goods in the United States The Food and Drug Administration  FDA  199  is the primary institution tasked with the safety and effectiveness of human and veterinary drugs  It also is responsible for making sure drug information is accurately and informatively presented to the public  The FDA reviews and approves products and establishes drug labeling  drug standards  and medical device manufacturing standards  It sets performance standards for radiation and ultrasonic equipment  One of the more contentious issues related to drug safety is immunity from prosecution  In 2004  the FDA reversed a federal policy  arguing that FDA premarket approval overrides most claims for damages under state law for medical devices  In 2008 this was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Riegel v  Medtronic  200  On 30 June 2006  an FDA ruling went into effect extending protection from lawsuits to pharmaceutical manufacturers  even if it was found that they submitted fraudulent clinical trial data to the FDA in their quest for approval  This left consumers who experience serious health consequences from drug use with little recourse  In 2007  opposition was raised in the Congressional House to the FDA ruling  but the Senate upheld the status quo  On 4 March 2009  an important U S  Supreme Court decision was handed down  In Wyeth v  Levine  the court asserted that state level rights of action could not be pre empted by federal immunity and could provide  appropriate relief for injured consumers   201  In June 2009  under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act  Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius signed an order extending protection to vaccine makers and federal officials from prosecution during a declared health emergency related to the administration of the swine flu vaccine  202  203   edit  Impact of drug companies The United States is one of two countries in the world that allows direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs  Critics note that drug ads costs money which they believe have raised the overall price of drugs  204  When health care legislation was being written in 2009  the drug companies were asked to support the legislation in return for not allowing importation of drugs from foreign countries  205   edit  Political issues  edit  Prescription drug prices The following text needs to be harmonized with text in Prescription drug prices in the United States  Main article  Prescription drug prices in the United States During the 1990s  the price of prescription drugs became a major issue in American politics as the prices of many new drugs increased exponentially  and many citizens discovered that neither the government nor their insurer would cover the cost of such drugs  Per capita  the U S  spends more on pharmaceuticals than any other country  National expenditures on pharmaceuticals accounted for 12 9  of total health care costs  compared to an OECD average of 17 7   2003 figures   206  Some 25  of out of pocket spending by individuals is for prescription drugs  207  The U S  government has taken the position  through the Office of the United States Trade Representative  that U S  drug prices are rising because U S  consumers are effectively subsidizing costs which drug companies cannot recover from consumers in other countries  because many other countries use their bulk purchasing power to aggressively negotiate drug prices   208  The U S  position  consistent with the primary lobbying position of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  is that the governments of such countries are free riding on the backs of U S  consumers  Such governments should either deregulate their markets  or raise their domestic taxes in order to fairly compensate U S  consumers by directly remitting the difference  between what the companies would earn in an open market versus what they are earning now  to drug companies or to the U S  government  In turn  pharmaceutical companies would be able to continue to produce innovative pharmaceuticals while lowering prices for U S  consumers  Currently  the U S   as a purchaser of pharmaceuticals  negotiates some drug prices but is forbidden by law from negotiating drug prices for the Medicare program due to the Medicare Prescription Drug  Improvement  and Modernization Act passed in 2003  Democrats have charged that the purpose of this provision is merely to allow the pharmaceutical industry to profiteer off of the Medicare program  which is already in imminent danger of becoming financially insolvent  209   edit  Debate Main article  Health care reform in the United States A poll released in March 2008 by the Harvard School of Public Health and Harris Interactive found that Americans are divided in their views of the U S  health system  and that there are significant differences by political affiliation  When asked whether the U S  has the best health care system or if other countries have better systems  45  said that the U S  system was best and 39  said that other countries  systems are better  Belief that the U S  system is best was highest among Republicans  68    lower among independents  40    and lowest among Democrats  32    Over half of Democrats  56   said they would be more likely to support a presidential candidate who advocates making the U S  system more like those of other countries  37  of independents and 19  of Republicans said they would be more likely to support such a candidate  45  of Republicans said that they would be less likely to support such a candidate  compared to 17  of independents and 7  of Democrats  210  211  According to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences  the United States is the only wealthy  industrialized nation that does not ensure universal coverage  17  There is currently an ongoing political debate centering around questions of access  efficiency  quality  and sustainability  Whether a government mandated system of universal health care should be implemented in the U S  remains a hotly debated political topic  with Americans divided along party lines in their views of the U S  health system and what should be done to improve it  Those in favor of universal health care argue that the large number of uninsured Americans creates direct and hidden costs shared by all  and that extending coverage to all would lower costs and improve quality  212 Cato Institute Senior Fellow Alan Reynolds argues that people should be free to opt out of health insurance  citing a study by Economists Craig Perry and Harvey Rosen that found  the lack of health insurance among the self employed does not affect their health  For virtually every subjective and objective measure of their health status  the self employed and wage earners are statistically indistinguishable for each other   213  Both sides of the political spectrum have also looked to more philosophical arguments  citation needed  debating whether people have a fundamental right to have health care provided to them by their government  214  215  An impediment to implementing any US healthcare reform that does not benefit insurance companies or the private health care industry is the power of insurance company and health care industry lobbyists  216  217  Possibly as a consequence of the power of lobbyists  key politicians such as Senator Max Baucus have taken the option of single payer health care off the table entirely  218  In a June 2009 NBC News Wall Street Journal survey  76  said it was either  extremely  or  quite  important to  give people a choice of both a public plan administered by the federal government and a private plan for their health insurance   219  Advocates for single payer health care often point to other countries  where national government funded systems produce better health outcomes at lower cost  Opponents deride this type of system as  socialized medicine   and it has not been one of the favored reform options by Congress or the President in both the Clinton and Obama reform efforts  220  221  It has been pointed out that socialized medicine is a system in which the government owns the means of providing medicine  Britain is an example of socialized system  as  in America  is the Veterans Health Administration  Medicare is an example of a mostly single payer system  as is France  Both of these systems have private insurers to choose from  but the government is the dominant purchaser  222  As an example of how government intervention has had unintended consequences  in 1973  the federal government passed the Health Maintenance Organization Act  which heavily subsidized the HMO business model   a model that was in decline prior to such legislative intervention  The law was intended to create market incentives that would lower health care costs  but HMOs have never achieved their cost reduction potential  223  Piecemeal market based reform efforts are complex  One study evaluating current popular market based reform policy packages concluded that if market oriented reforms are not implemented on a systematic basis with appropriate safeguards  they have the potential to cause more problems than they solve  224  According to economist and former US Secretary of Labor  Robert Reich  only a  big  national  public option  can force insurance companies to cooperate  share information  and reduce costs  Scattered  localized   insurance cooperatives  are too small to do that and are  designed to fail  by the moneyed forces opposing Democratic health care reform  225  226  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  signed into law in March  2010  did not include such an option   edit  Reform Main articles  Health care reform in the United States and Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Health care reform in the United States

care reform bill that was signed into law in the United States by President Barack Obama on March 23  2010  Along with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010  passed March 25   the Act is a product of the health care reform agenda of the Democratic 111th Congress and the Obama administration  The law includes a large number of health related provisions to take effect over the next four years  including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133  of FPL  227  subsidizing insurance premiums for peoples making up to 400  of FPL   88 000 for family of 4  so their maximum  out of pocket  pay will be from 2  to 9 8  of income for annual premium  228  229  providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits  prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre existing conditions  establishing health insurance exchanges  prohibiting insurers from establishing annual spending caps and support for medical research  The costs of these provisions are offset by a variety of taxes  fees  and cost saving measures  such as new Medicare taxes for high income brackets  taxes on indoor tanning  cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare  and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies  230  there is also a tax penalty for citizens who do not obtain health insurance  unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons   231  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the net effect  including the reconciliation act  will be a reduction in the federal deficit by  143 billion over the first decade  232  In May of 2011  the state of Vermont became the first state to pass legislation establishing a Single Payer health care system  The legislation  known as Act 48  establishes health care in the state as a  human right  and lays the responsibility on the state to provide a health care system which best meets the needs of the citizens of Vermont  The state is currently in the studying phase of how best to implement this system  citation needed   edit  Health Insurance Coverage of Immigrants Of the 26 2 million foreign immigrants living in the US in 1998  62 9  were non citizens  In 1997  34 3  of non citizens living in America did not have health insurance coverage opposed to the 14 2  of native born Americans who do not have health insurance coverage  Among those immigrants who became citizens  18 5  were uninsured as opposed to non citizens who are 43 6  uninsured  In each age and income group  immigrants are less likely to have health insurance
