for msnbc com  NBC supplied the space with an 18 month old America s Talking network   edit  Early history Main article  History of MSNBC  1996 2007 MSNBC was launched on July 15  1996  The first show  which was anchored by Jodi Applegate  broadcast a lineup of news  interviews  and opinions  19  During the day  rolling news coverage continued with The Contributors  a show that featured Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham  as well as interactive programming coordinated by Applegate  John Gibson  and John Seigenthaler  Stories were generally longer and more detailed than the stories running on CNN at the time  NBC also highlighted their broadcast connections by airing stories direct from the NBC network affiliates  along with breaking news coverage from the same sources  20  Gradually MSNBC began to put more emphasis on politics 21  The Project for Excellence in Journalism found in 2007 after a seven year survey of cable channels that  MSNBC is moving to make politics a brand  with a large dose of opinion and personality   22  In January 2001  Mike Barnicle got a show on MSNBC  but it was canceled in June 2001 due to high production costs  23  In June  in a sign of continuing trouble at MSNBC  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said that he would not have started MSNBC if he knew then what he knows now  24  After the September 11  2001 attacks  MSNBC served as an outlet for NBC News to provide up to the minute coverage  in contrast to broadcast NBC s longer stories  CNBC and CNBC Europe  with little financial news to report  ran MSNBC for many hours of the day following the attacks  The year also boosted the profile of Ashleigh Banfield  who had escaped injury while covering the World Trade Center on September 11  Her Region In Conflict program capitalized on her newfound celebrity and showcased exclusive interviews from Afghanistan  On December 23  2005  it was announced that NBC Universal would acquire an additional 32  share of the television channel from Microsoft  solidifying its control over television operations and allowing NBC to further consolidate MSNBC s backroom operations with NBC News and its other cable properties  Msnbc com would continue to be 50  owned by both NBC and Microsoft  and its operations would be largely unaffected  NBC would have the option  which it exercised  to buy the remaining 18  share from Microsoft after two years  MSNBC  which along with other US news networks had been criticized of having a distorted and biased Media coverage of the Iraq War began from 2005 onwards to attract liberal and progressive viewers when host Keith Olbermann began critiquing and satirizing conservative media commentators in his program Countdown With Keith Olbermann  Olbermann especially focused his attention to Fox News Channel and its main primetime anchor  Bill O Reilly  In June 2006  Don Kaplan of the tabloid New York Post  owned by News Corporation  which also owns Fox News  wrote a column titled  Do We Need MSNBC   Addressing MSNBC S low ratings  Kaplan quoted CNN co founder Reese Schonfeld  who said that   e verybody compares MSNBC to Fox and CNN   when its real competition is Headline News   Schonfeld pointed out that the ratings for MSNBC and Headline News are roughly the same  about 300 000 viewers on average and that  by comparison  Fox and CNN regularly average three or four times as many viewers   In the column Kaplan remarked that  the running joke in TV news is Fox and CNN are news channels with websites  but MSNBC is a website with a cable channel   25  On June 7  2006  Rick Kaplan resigned as president of MSNBC  after holding the post for two years  26  Following the announcement  it was announced on June 12  2006  that Dan Abrams  a nine year veteran of MSNBC and NBC News  had been named General Manager of the NBC News 24 hour cable news television channel  effective immediately  NBC News Senior Vice President Phil Griffin would oversee MSNBC  Griffin would also continue to oversee NBC News  Today  and Abrams would report to Griffin  On June 29  2006  Abrams announced a revamp to MSNBC s early primetime and primetime schedule  On July 10  Tucker  formerly The Situation with Tucker Carlson  started airing at 4 p m  and 6 p m  ET  taking over Abrams  old timeslot   while Rita Cosby s Live  amp  Direct was taken off the schedule  Cosby was instead given the role of primary anchor for MSNBC Investigates at 10 and 11 p m  ET  a new program that took over Cosby and Carlson s timeslots  According to the press release  MSNBC Investigates promised to     complement MSNBC s existing programming by building on  the channel s  library of award winning documentaries   27  The move to taped programming during 10 and 11 p m  was likely a result of the success that MSNBC saw with their Friday  experiment  of replacing all primetime programming with taped specials  On September 24  2007  Abrams announced that he would leave the position of General Manager to focus on his 9 00 p m  ET talk show   Live With Dan Abrams   Oversight of MSNBC is now provided by Phil Griffin  a senior vice president at NBC  28  MSNBC s current studio in NYC The current MSNBC studio MSNBC and NBC News launched broadcasts from their new studios at NBC s  30 Rock  complex in New York City on October 22  2007  29  After extensive renovations of the associated studios  NBC essentially merged its entire news operation into one building  and all MSNBC broadcasts  as well as the NBC Nightly News program  originate in the new studios  More than 12 5 hours of live television across the NBC News family originate from the New York studios daily  MSNBC is also expected to expand West Coast operations  as the channel recently when   announced new studios near the Universal Studios lot  which will assemble all NBC West Coast news operations in one building  MSNBC s Master Control did not make the move to 30 Rock  It remained in the old Secaucus headquarters until it completed its move to the NBC Universal Network Origination Center located inside the CNBC Global Headquarters building in Englewood Cliffs  New Jersey  on December 21  2007  Shortly thereafter  Major League Baseball firmed up a long term lease of the former MSNBC building to become the home studios of MLB Network  which launched from the facility on January 1  2009   edit  Changes since 2008 Main article  History of MSNBC  2008 present From mid 2007 to mid 2008  MSNBC received a large increase in its ratings  30  Primetime viewings increased by 61  over that time  30  In May 2008  NBC News President Steve Capus said that  It used to be people didn t have to worry about MSNBC because it was an also ran cable channel     That s not the case anymore   30 Tim Russert s sudden death in June 2008 removed what The Wall Street Journal called the  rudder for the network  and led to a period of transition  31  During the 2008 Presidential election  MSNBC s coverage was anchored by Keith Olbermann  Chris Matthews  and David Gregory  The three were widely viewed as the face of the channel s political coverage  31  During the first three months of the presidential campaign  MSNBC s ratings grew by 158 percent  32  However  during the election coverage  anchors Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews were criticized for expressing left leaning viewpoints on the channel  and both of them were later removed from the position of anchor  33  Audience viewership during the 2008 Presidential election more than doubled from the 2004 Presidential election  and the channel topped CNN in ratings for the first time during the last three months of the campaign in the key 25 54 age demographic  34  35  In September 2008  the channel hired political analyst and Air America Radio personality Rachel Maddow to host a new political opinion program called The Rachel Maddow Show  The move to create a new program for the channel was widely seen as a smart ratings move  where beforehand  MSNBC lagged behind in coveted primetime ratings  36  The show regularly outperformed CNN s Larry King Live  and made the channel competitive in the program s time slot for the first time in over a decade  37  38  In the first quarter of 2010  MSNBC beat CNN in primetime and overall ratings  marking the first time doing so since 2001  39  The channel also beat CNN in total adult viewers in March  marking the seventh out of the past eight months MSNBC achieved that result  39  In addition  the programs Morning Joe  The Ed Show  Hardball with Chris Matthews  Countdown with Keith Olbermann  and The Rachel Maddow Show all finished ahead of their time slot competitors on CNN  39  In the third quarter of 2010  MSNBC continued its solid lead over CNN  beating the network in total day for the first time since 2Q 2001 in the key adult demographic  40  The network also beat CNN for the fourth consecutive quarter  among both primetime and total viewers  as well as becoming the only cable news network to have its key adult demographic viewership grow over the last quarter  increasing by 4   During this time  MSNBC also became the number one cable news network in primetime among both African American and Hispanic viewers  40  On 11 October 2010  MSNBC unveiled a new televised advertising campaign and slogan called  Lean Forward    We ve taken on CNN and we beat them   MSNBC President Phil Griffin told employees at a series of celebratory  town hall  meetings   Now it s time to take on Fox   Concerning the campaign  Griffin said   It is active  it is positive  it is about making tomorrow better than today  a discussion about politics and the actions and passions of our time   41  The new campaign embraces the network s politically progressive identity  42  The two year advertising campaign will cost  2 million and will consist of Internet  television  and print advertising  41  The new positioning has created brand image issues for msnbc com  the umbrella website for the television network  A New York Times article quotes Charlie Tillinghast  president of msnbc com  a separate company  as saying   Both strategies are fine  but naming them the same thing is brand insanity   43  As a result  msnbc com is considering changing its name to prevent confusion with the television network  MSNBC  43  On January 21  2011  Olbermann announced his departure from MSNBC and the episode would be the final episode of Countdown  44  45  His departure received much media attention   46  47  48  MSNBC issued a statement that it had ended its contract with Olbermann  with no further explanation  Keith Olbermann later revealed that he had taken his show to Current TV  It is expected to compete with MSNBC following Olbermann s debut on the network in late spring 2011  49   edit  Carriage issues MSNBC s former New Jersey headquarters studio  now the home of MLB Network MSNBC was not available to Verizon FiOS and AT amp T U verse TV subscribers in portions of New York  northern New Jersey and Connecticut which overlapped with Cablevision s cable television territory until 2010  The reason for the lack of availability was  in part  due to an exclusive carriage agreement that MSNBC entered into with Cablevision  which prohibited competing wired providers from carrying MSNBC  50  The terms of the agreement were not publicly known  A suit from Verizon to the FCC was filed in order to force the termination of this deal  Connecticut attorney general Richard Blumenthal wrote to new FCC chairman Julius Genachowski  agreeing with Verizon  saying that the deal may be illegal  51  After reaching a new contract  FiOS added the channel in New York City and in New Jersey on February 2  2010  52   edit  High Definition MSNBC HD is a 1080i high definition simulcast of MSNBC that

the last of which is replaced frequently by the name of the guest or correspondent currently being shown  For a short time in 2009 from the debut  MSNBC HD daytime included a widget on the right side of the screen which served as a secondary news ticker displaying the weather and news headlines as well as a blue bar which showed more stocks and business news graphics  but both features were eventually dropped in favor of full video encompassing both sides of the screen  the widget reflected a similar widget which appears on CNBC HD for the display of a stocks graph chart  and which has been retained to the present day   The news ticker only appears during news bulletins and rolling news broadcasts  and is removed from the screen during talk shows and documentaries   edit

Todd Meredith Vieira Brian Williams Pete Williams Alex Witt Jenna Wolfe John Yang  edit  Criticism and controversy Main article  MSNBC Controversies  edit  Assertions of liberal bias Commentators have described MSNBC as having a bias towards left leaning politics and the Democratic Party  In November 2007  a New York Times article stated that MSNBC s prime time lineup is tilting more to the left  10 Washington Post media analyst Howard Kurtz has stated that the channel s evening lineup  has clearly gravitated to the left in recent years and often seems to regard itself as the antithesis of Fox News   30  In 2011  Salon com noted that  MSNBC s prime time lineup is now awash in progressive politics   64  That same year  Politico referred to MSNBC as  left leaning   65  In reference to changes in the channel s evening programming  senior vice president of NBC News Phil Griffin has said that  It happened naturally  There isn t a dogma we re putting through  There is a  Go for it    10  A study conducted by Harvard University on media bias during the 2008 presidential election found that  A positive tone pervaded  on MSNBC  coverage of candidates from both parties  Nearly half  47   of the stories about Democratic candidates were positive  vs  19  negative and 34  neutral  Coverage of Republican candidates was not quite as rosy but still more stories were positive  38   than neutral  33   or negative  30     66  In the February 2008 issue of Men s Journal magazine  a MSNBC interviewee quoted a senior executive who said that liberal commentator Keith Olbermann  runs MSNBC  and that  because of his success  he s in charge  of the channel  67 The New York Times has called Olbermann MSNBC s  most recognizable face   10  In September 2008  MSNBC stated that they were removing both Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews as live political event anchors  and replacing them with David Gregory  due to growing criticism that they were  too opinionated to be seen as neutral in the heat of the presidential campaign   11  12  Olbermann continued to broadcast Countdown both before and after the presidential and vice presidential debates  and both Matthews and Olbermann joined Gregory on the channel s election night coverage  In September 2009  a Pew Research Poll showed that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to rate the channel favorably and Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to see MSNBC unfavorably  68  69  On November 13  2009  in the days leading up to the release of 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin s book  Going Rogue   MSNBC s Dylan Ratigan used photoshopped pictures of Palin on the channel s Morning Meeting program  Ratigan apologized a few days later stating   I want to apologize to Governor Palin and all of our viewers  On Friday  in a very misguided attempt to have some fun in advance of Sarah Palin s upcoming book Going Rogue  our staff mistakenly used some clearly photoshopped images of Ms  Palin without any acknowledgment   70  In October 2010  MSNBC began using the tagline  lean forward   which was described by some media outlets  including msnbc com  as the network embracing its politically progressive identity  42  71  72  73  A poll conducted by Farleigh Dickinson University concluded that MSNBC viewers are the second most uninformed on certain issues  behind Fox News viewers  Dan Cassino  analyst for the PublicMind poll said  People who tune into ideological media are motivated to hear their side of the debate and so you can have someone who watches MSNBC be so used to hearing about protests coming from the right that they automatically believe that Occupy is mostly a Republican protest    74  However  former Vice President Al Gore  who co founded the other liberal network  Current TV  has taken aim at MSNBC  calling it  the prison channel on weekends  and while admitting that it has liberal news shows  has also claimed it  demands balance   In January 2012  MSNBC used Rachel Maddow  Chris Matthews and other network commentators during coverage of the 2012 Iowa Republican caucuses  a move seen by some as  giving up on the straight news coverage  and instead  appearing  to be aiming to create some controversy    75   edit  Assertions of pro Obama bias Some Democratic Party supporters  most notably former Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania  Ed Rendell and Clinton advisor Lanny Davis  76  criticized MSNBC during and after the 2008 Democratic Primaries  as covering Barack Obama more favorably than Hillary Clinton  Rendell said   MSNBC was the official network of the Obama campaign   and called their coverage  absolutely embarrassing   77  78  A study done by the Project for Excellence in Journalism showed that MSNBC had less negative coverage of Obama  14  of stories vs  29  in the press overall  and more negative stories about Republican presidential candidate John McCain  73  of its coverage vs  57  in the press overall   79  MSNBC s on air slogan during the week of the 2008 presidential election   The Power of Change   was criticized as being overtly similar to Obama s campaign slogan of  Change   80  Following the 2008 presidential election  conservative talk show host  John Ziegler worked on a documentary called Media Malpractice     How Obama Got Elected  which was very critical of the media  especially MSNBC s role  in the 2008 Presidential Election  While promoting the documentary  he engaged in an on air dispute with MSNBC news anchor Contessa Brewer  on how the media  especially MSNBC  had portrayed Sarah Palin  81  After Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann made controversial on air comments during the 2008 Republican National Convention  NBC News correspondent David Gregory replaced them  but Matthews and Olbermann continued working as analysts  82  On November 4 5  Matthews teamed with Rachel Maddow  Eugene Robinson  David Gregory  and Keith Olbermann to cover the presidential election  During MSNBC s coverage of the Potomac primary  Matthews had this to say about then presidential candidate Barack Obama    I have to tell you  you know  it s part of reporting this case  this election  the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama s speech  My  I felt this thrill going up my leg  I mean  I don t have that too often  25    This led many on the right to assert that both he and MSNBC were biased toward Obama  83   edit  Phil Donahue Iraq War dismissal  Donahue presents a  difficult public face for NBC in a time of war   He seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti war  anti Bush and skeptical of the administration s motives   NBC internal study 84  See also  Media coverage of the Iraq War Phil Donahue s 2002 program Donahue was canceled in late February 2003 during the buildup to the Iraq War  Despite earlier claims of cancellation because of low ratings  85 Donahue was MSNBC s highest rated show that month  84  A leaked NBC internal study revealed that the studio was concerned that Donahue would act as  a home for the liberal antiwar agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity   84   edit  Michael Savage dismissal During the spring and early summer of 2003  MSNBC featured a weekend talk show hosted by conservative radio host Michael Savage  In July of that year  Savage responded to a prank caller on his show by calling him a  pig  and a  sodomite   and telling him he  should get AIDS and die   Savage s show was canceled and Savage was fired from the channel shortly afterward  with some reports placing the termination immediately after the episode in question went off air   86   edit  Don Imus controversy In early April 2007  Don Imus  whose radio show Imus in the Morning was simulcast on MSNBC  described members of the Rutgers University women s basketball team  as  some nappy headed hoes   The comments sparked outrage  as many considered them to be racist and sexist  After sponsors began to withdraw advertisements from the show  MSNBC canceled the simulcast  Imus  as well as NBC News  apologized to the Rutgers Basketball team for the remarks  87  Don Imus now has a feature show on the Fox Business Network   edit   Rise of the New Right  documentary In June 2010  a documentary airing on MSNBC and hosted by Chris Matthews called Rise of the New Right drew significant criticism from conservatives and the Tea Party movement  The documentary features interviews with Dick Armey  the former House Majority Leader  Orly Taitz  a leading figure in the  birther  movement  and radio host Alex Jones  The documentary also showed the Michigan Militia s survival training camp and hit the campaign trail with Kentucky Senatorial candidate Rand Paul  88  After the documentary aired  FreedomWorks  which is chaired by one of the stars of the documentary  Dick Armey  issued a letter calling for a boycott of Dawn and Procter  amp  Gamble  which advertises during Hardball with Chris Matthews  89  90  The boycott was ineffective  Procter  amp  Gamble continued to advertise with the show   edit  Suspensions of hosts  Olbermann s separation On November 5  2010  MSNBC President Phil Griffin suspended Olbermann indefinitely without pay for contributing  2 400  the maximum personal donation limit  to each of three Democratic candidates during the 2010 midterm election cycle  91  Contributions to political campaigns  under NBC News policy  are not allowed without prior permission  On November 7  2010  Olbermann posted a thank you message to supporters via Twitter  92  That same day  MSNBC announced that he would be back on the air starting Tuesday  November 9  93  Two weeks later  Griffin announced the suspension of Joe Scarborough for the same offense  as the Morning Joe host had donated  4 000 to Republican candidates in Florida  Like Olbermann s suspension  Scarborough s suspension was brief  and he returned to the airwaves on November 24  94  On January 21  2011 MSNBC announced that Olbermann would host his final show that same night   edit  Tucson shootings During the news cycle following the 2011 Tucson shooting  conservative talk radio host Mark Levin threatened to sue Chris Matthews and several other MSNBC commentators who suggested that he might have influenced the shooter  Jared Lee Loughner  Levin also defended Republican politician Sarah Palin  from MSNBC punditry linking her political rhetoric to the heated political atmosphere surrounding the killings  95  96  Paul Bond of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that  MSNBC was crucial in driving the narrative that the killer was egged on by violent political rhetoric  particularly from Palin   Bond also wrote that  even after it was learned that the shooter was an atheist  flag burning  Bush hating  9 11 Truther who enjoyed joking about abortion  not exactly the portrait of a Palin supporter   MSNBC still did not let up on that story line   97   edit  References   Ariens  Chris  2009 04
