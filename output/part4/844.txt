     o     i    was a prominent Spanish surrealist painter born in Figueres  Catalonia  Spain  Dal  was a skilled draftsman  best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work  His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters  2  3  His best known work  The Persistence of Memory  was completed in 1931  Dal  s expansive artistic repertoire includes film  sculpture  and photography  in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media  Dal  attributed his  love of everything that is gilded and excessive  my passion for luxury and my love of oriental clothes  4  to a self styled  Arab lineage   claiming that his ancestors were descended from the Moors  Dal  was highly imaginative  and also had an affinity for partaking in unusual and grandiose behavior  His eccentric manner and attention grabbing public actions sometimes drew more attention than his artwork to the dismay of those who held his work in high esteem and to the irritation of his critics  5  Contents 1 Biography 1 1 Early life 1 2 Madrid and Paris 1 3 1929 to World War II 1 4 World War II 1 5 Later years in Catalonia 2 Symbolism 2 1 Science 3 Endeavors

the town of Figueres  in the Empord  region  close to the French border in Catalonia  Spain  7  Dal  s older brother  also named Salvador  born October 12  1901   had died of gastroenteritis nine months earlier  on August 1  1903  His father  Salvador Dal  i Cus   was a middle class lawyer and notary 8  whose strict disciplinary approach was tempered by his wife  Felipa Domenech Ferr s  who encouraged her son s artistic endeavors  9  When he was five  Dal  was taken to his brother s grave and told by his parents that he was his brother s reincarnation  10  a concept which he came to believe  11  Of his brother  Dal  said       we  resembled each other like two drops of water  but we had different reflections   12  He  was probably a first version of myself but conceived too much in the absolute   12  Dal  also had a sister  Ana Mar a  who was three years younger  8  In 1949  she published a book about her brother  Dal  As Seen By His Sister  13  His childhood friends included future FC Barcelona footballers Sagibarba and Josep Samitier  During holidays at the Catalan resort of Cadaqu s  the trio played football together  Dal  attended drawing school  In 1916  Dal  also discovered modern painting on a summer vacation trip to Cadaqu s with the family of Ramon Pichot  a local artist who made regular trips to Paris  8  The next year  Dal  s father organized an exhibition of his charcoal drawings in their family home  He had his first public exhibition at the Municipal Theater in Figueres in 1919  In February 1921  Dal  s mother died of breast cancer  Dal  was 16 years old  he later said his mother s death  was the greatest blow I had experienced in my life  I worshipped her    I could not resign myself to the loss of a being on whom I counted to make invisible the unavoidable blemishes of my soul   14  After her death  Dal  s father married his deceased wife s sister  Dal  did not resent this marriage  because he had a great love and respect for his aunt  8   edit  Madrid and Paris Wild eyed antics of Dal   left  and fellow surrealist artist Man Ray in Paris on June 16  1934  In 1922  Dal  moved into the Residencia de Estudiantes  Students  Residence  in Madrid 8  and studied at the Academia de San Fernando  School of Fine Arts   A lean 1 72 m  5 ft  7  in   tall  15  Dal  already drew attention as an eccentric and dandy  He wore long hair and sideburns  coat  stockings  and knee breeches in the style of English aesthetes of the late 19th century  At the Residencia  he became close friends with  among others  Pep n Bello  Luis Bu uel  and Federico Garc a Lorca  The friendship with Lorca had a strong element of mutual passion  16  but Dal  rejected the poet s sexual advances  17  However it was his paintings in which he experimented with Cubism that earned him the most attention from his fellow students  At the time of these early works  Dal  probably did not completely understand the Cubist movement  His only information on Cubist art came from magazine articles and a catalog given to him by Pichot  since there were no Cubist artists in Madrid at the time  In 1924  the still unknown Salvador Dal  illustrated a book for the first time  It was a publication of the Catalan poem  Les bruixes de Llers    The Witches of Llers   by his friend and schoolmate  poet Carles Fages de Climent  Dal  also experimented with Dada  which influenced his work throughout his life  Dal  was expelled from the Academia in 1926  shortly before his final exams when he was accused of starting an unrest  18  His mastery of painting skills was evidenced by his realistic Basket of Bread  painted in 1926  19  That same year  he made his first visit to Paris  where he met Pablo Picasso  whom the young Dal  revered  Picasso had already heard favorable reports about Dal  from Joan Mir   As he developed his own style over the next few years Dal  made a number of works heavily influenced by Picasso and Mir   Some trends in Dal  s work that would continue throughout his life were already evident in the 1920s  Dal  devoured influences from many styles of art  ranging from the most academically classic  to the most cutting edge avant garde  20  His classical influences included Raphael  Bronzino  Francisco de Zurbar n  Vermeer  and Vel zquez  21  He used both classical and modernist techniques  sometimes in separate works  and sometimes combined  Exhibitions of his works in Barcelona attracted much attention along with mixtures of praise and puzzled debate from critics  Dal  grew a flamboyant moustache  influenced by 17th century Spanish master painter Diego Vel zquez  The moustache became an iconic trademark of his appearance for the rest of his life   edit  1929 to World War II In 1929  Dal  collaborated with surrealist film director Luis Bu uel on the short film Un Chien Andalou  An Andalusian Dog   His main contribution was to help Bu uel write the script for the film  Dal  later claimed to have also played a significant role in the filming of the project  but this is not substantiated by contemporary accounts  22  Also  in August 1929  Dal  met his muse  inspiration  and future wife Gala  23  born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova  She was a Russian immigrant ten years his senior  who at that time was married to surrealist poet Paul  luard  In the same year  Dal  had important professional exhibitions and officially joined the Surrealist group in the Montparnasse quarter of Paris  His work had already been heavily influenced by surrealism for two years  The Surrealists hailed what Dal  called the paranoiac critical method of accessing the subconscious for greater artistic creativity  8  9  Meanwhile  Dal  s relationship with his father was close to rupture  Don Salvador Dal  y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son s romance with Gala  and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals  The last straw was when Don Salvador read in a Barcelona newspaper that his son had recently exhibited in Paris a drawing of the  Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ   with a provocative inscription   Sometimes  I spit for fun on my mother s portrait   24  Outraged  Don Salvador demanded that his son recant publicly  Dal  refused  perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group  and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on December 28  1929  His father told him that he would disinherit him  and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu s again  The following summer  Dal  and Gala rented a small fisherman s cabin in a nearby bay at Port Lligat  He bought the place  and over the years enlarged it  gradually building his much beloved villa by the sea  The Persistence of Memory In 1931  Dal  painted one of his most famous works  The Persistence of Memory  25  which introduced a surrealistic image of soft  melting pocket watches  The general interpretation of the work is that the soft watches are a rejection of the assumption that time is rigid or deterministic  This idea is supported by other images in the work  such as the wide expanding landscape  and the other limp watches  shown being devoured by ants  26  Dal  and Gala  having lived together since 1929  were married in 1934 in a civil ceremony  They later remarried in a Catholic ceremony in 1958  Dal  was introduced to America by art dealer Julian Levy in 1934  The exhibition in New York of Dal  s works  including Persistence of Memory  created an immediate sensation  Social Register listees feted him at a specially organized  Dal  Ball   He showed up wearing a glass case on his chest  which contained a brassiere  27  In that year  Dal  and Gala also attended a masquerade party in New York  hosted for them by heiress Caresse Crosby  For their costumes  they dressed as the Lindbergh baby and his kidnapper  The resulting uproar in the press was so great that Dal  apologized  When he returned to Paris  the Surrealists confronted him about his apology for a surrealist act  28  While the majority of the Surrealist artists had become increasingly associated with leftist politics  Dal  maintained an ambiguous position on the subject of the proper relationship between politics and art  Leading surrealist Andr  Breton accused Dal  of defending the  new  and  irrational  in  the Hitler phenomenon   but Dal  quickly rejected this claim  saying   I am Hitlerian neither in fact nor intention   29  Dal  insisted that surrealism could exist in an apolitical context and refused to explicitly denounce fascism  citation needed  Among other factors  this had landed him in trouble with his colleagues  Later in 1934  Dal  was subjected to a  trial   in which he was formally expelled from the Surrealist group  23  To this  Dal  retorted   I myself am surrealism   18  In 1936  Dal  took part in the London International Surrealist Exhibition  His lecture  titled Fantomes paranoiaques authentiques  was delivered while wearing a deep sea diving suit and helmet  30  He had arrived carrying a billiard cue and leading a pair of Russian wolfhounds  and had to have the helmet unscrewed as he gasped for breath  He commented that  I just wanted to show that I was  plunging deeply  into the human mind   31  Also in 1936  at the premiere screening of Joseph Cornell s film Rose Hobart at Julian Levy s gallery in New York City  Dal  became famous for another incident  Levy s program of short surrealist films was timed to take place at the same time as the first surrealism exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art  featuring Dal  s work  Dal  was in the audience at the screening  but halfway through the film  he knocked over the projector in a rage   My idea for a film is exactly that  and I was going to propose it to someone who would pay to have it made   he said   I never wrote it down or told anyone  but it is as if he had stolen it   Other versions of Dal  s accusation tend to the more poetic   He stole it from my subconscious   or even  He stole my dreams   32  At this stage  Dal  s main patron in London was the very wealthy Edward James  He had helped Dal  emerge into the art world by purchasing many works and by supporting him financially for two years  They also collaborated on two of the most enduring icons of the Surrealist movement  the Lobster Telephone and the Mae West Lips Sofa  citation needed  In 1938  Dal  met Sigmund Freud thanks to Stefan Zweig  Later  in September 1938  Salvador Dal  was invited by Gabrielle Coco Chanel to her house La Pausa in Roquebrune on the French Riviera  There he painted numerous paintings he later exhibited at Julien Levy Gallery in New York  33  34  La Pausa has been partially replicated at the Dallas Museum of Art to welcome the Reves collection and part of Chanel s original furniture for the house  35  In 1939  Breton coined the derogatory nickname  Avida Dollars   an anagram for Salvador Dal   and a phonetic rendering of the French avide   dollars  which may be translated as  eager for dollars   36  This was a derisive reference to the increasing commercialization of Dal  s work  and the perception that Dal  sought self aggrandizement through fame and fortune  Some surrealists henceforth spoke of Dal  in the past tense  as if he were dead  citation needed  The Surrealist movement and various members thereof  such as Ted Joans  would continue to issue extremely harsh polemics against Dal  until the time of his death and beyond   edit  World War II In 1940  as World War II was in full swing at Europe  Dal  and Gala moved to the United States  where they lived for eight years  After the move  Dal  returned to the practice of Catholicism   During this period  Dal  never stopped writing   wrote Robert and Nicolas Descharnes  37  In 1941  Dal  drafted a film scenario for Jean Gabin called Moontide  In 1942  he published his autobiography  The Secret Life of Salvador Dal   He wrote catalogs for his exhibitions  such as that at the Knoedler Gallery in New York in 1943  Therein he expounded   Surrealism will at least have served to give experimental proof that total sterility and attempts at automatizations have gone too far and have led to a totalitarian system      Today s laziness and the total lack of technique have reached their paroxysm in the psychological signification of the current use of the college   He also wrote a novel  published in 1944  about a fashion salon for automobiles  This resulted in a drawing by Edwin Cox in The Miami Herald  depicting Dal  dressing an automobile in an evening gown  37  Also in The Secret Life  Dal  suggested that he had split with Bu uel because the latter was a Communist and an atheist  Bu uel was fired  or resigned  from MOMA  supposedly after Cardinal Spellman of New York went to see Iris Barry  head of the film department at MOMA  Bu uel then went back to Hollywood where he worked in the dubbing department of Warner Bros  from 1942 to 1946  In his 1982 autobiography Mon Dernier soupir  English translation My Last Sigh published 1983   Bu uel wrote that  over the years  he rejected Dal  s attempts at reconciliation  38  An Italian friar  Gabriele Maria Berardi  claimed to have performed an exorcism on Dal  while he was in France in 1947  39  In 2005  a sculpture of Christ on the Cross was discovered in the friar s estate  It had been claimed that Dal  gave this work to his exorcist out of gratitude  39  and two Spanish art experts confirmed that there were adequate stylistic reasons to believe the sculpture was made by Dal   39   edit  Later years in Catalonia From 1949 onwards  Dal  spent his remaining years back in Catalonia  The fact that he chose to live in Spain while it was ruled by Franco drew criticism from progressives and from many other artists  40  As such  it is probable that the common dismissal of Dal  s later works by some Surrealists and art critics was related partially to politics rather than to the artistic merit of the works themselves  In 1959  Andr  Breton organized an exhibit called Homage to Surrealism  celebrating the fortieth anniversary of Surrealism  which contained works by Dal   Joan Mir   Enrique T bara  and Eugenio Granell  Breton vehemently fought against the inclusion of Dal  s Sistine Madonna in the International Surrealism Exhibition in New York the following year  41  Late in his career  Dal  did not confine himself to painting  but experimented with many unusual or novel media and processes  he made bulletist works 42  and was among the first artists to employ holography in an artistic manner  43  Several of his works incorporate optical illusions  In his later years  young artists such as Andy Warhol proclaimed Dal  an important influence on pop art  44  Dal  also had a keen interest in natural science and mathematics  This is manifested in several of his paintings  notably in the 1950s  in which he painted his subjects as composed of rhinoceros horns  According to Dal   the rhinoceros horn signifies divine geometry because it grows in a logarithmic spiral  He also linked the rhinoceros to themes of chastity and to the Virgin Mary  45  Dal  was also fascinated by DNA and the hypercube  a 4 dimensional cube   an unfolding of a hypercube is featured in the painting Crucifixion  Corpus Hypercubus   Dal  s post World War II period bore the hallmarks of technical virtuosity and an interest in optical illusions  science  and religion  He became an increasingly devout Catholic  while at the same time he had been inspired by the shock of Hiroshima and the dawning of the  atomic age   Therefore Dal  labeled this period  Nuclear Mysticism   In paintings such as  The Madonna of Port Lligat   first version   1949  and  Corpus Hypercubus   1954   Dal  sought to synthesize Christian iconography with images of material disintegration inspired by nuclear physics  46   Nuclear Mysticism  included such notable pieces as La Gare de Perpignan  1965  and The Hallucinogenic Toreador  1968 70   In 1960  Dal  began work on the Dal  Theatre and Museum in his home town of Figueres  it was his largest single project and the main focus of his energy through 1974  He continued to make additions through the mid 1980s  citation needed  In 1968  Dal  filmed a humorous television advertisement for Lanvin chocolates  47  In this  he proclaims in French  Je suis fou de chocolat Lanvin    I m crazy about Lanvin chocolate  while biting a morsel causing him to become crosseyed and his moustache to swivel upwards  In 1969  he designed the Chupa Chups logo in addition to facilitating the design of the advertising campaign for the 1969 Eurovision Song Contest and creating a large on stage metal sculpture that stood at the Teatro Real in Madrid  Dal  in 1972  In the television programme Dirty Dal   A Private View broadcast on Channel 4 on June 3  2007  art critic Brian Sewell described his acquaintance with Dal  in the late 1960s  which included lying down in the fetal position without trousers in the armpit of a figure of Christ and masturbating for Dal   who pretended to take photos while fumbling in his own trousers  48  49  In 1980  Dal  s health took a catastrophic turn  His near senile wife  Gala  allegedly had been dosing him with a dangerous cocktail of unprescribed medicine that damaged his nervous system  thus causing an untimely end to his artistic capacity  At 76 years old  Dal  was a wreck  and his right hand trembled terribly  with Parkinson like symptoms  50  In 1982  King Juan Carlos bestowed on Dal  the title of Marqu s de Dal  de P bol 51  52   Marquis of Dal  de P bol  in the nobility of Spain  hereby referring to P bol  the place where he lived  The title was in first instance hereditary  but on request of Dal  changed for life only in 1983  51  To show his gratitude for this  Dal  later gave the king a drawing  Head of Europa  which would turn out to be Dal  s final drawing  after the king visited him on his deathbed  Sant Pere in Figueres  scene of Dal  s Baptism  First Communion  and funeral Dal  Theatre and Museum in Figueres  where he is also buried Dal  s crypt at the Dal  Theatre and Museum in Figueres  stating his titles Gala died on June 10  1982  After Gala s death  Dal  lost much of his will to live  He deliberately dehydrated himself  possibly as a suicide attempt  or perhaps in an attempt to put himself into a state of suspended animation as he had read that some microorganisms could do  He moved from Figueres to the castle in P bol  which he had bought for Gala and was the site of her death  In 1984  a fire broke out in his bedroom 53  under unclear circumstances  It was possibly a suicide attempt by Dal   or possibly simple negligence by his staff  18  In any case  Dal  was rescued and returned to Figueres  where a group of his friends  patrons  and fellow artists saw to it that he was comfortable living in his Theater Museum in his final years  There have been allegations that Dal  was forced by his guardians to sign blank canvases that would later  even after his death  be used in forgeries and sold as originals  54  As a result  art dealers tend to be wary of late works attributed to Dal   citation needed  In November 1988  Dal  entered the hospital with heart failure  and on December 5  1988 was visited by King Juan Carlos  who confessed that he had always been a serious devotee of Dal   55  On January 23  1989  while his favorite record of Tristan and Isolde played  he died of heart failure at Figueres at the age of 84  and  coming full circle  is buried in the crypt of his Teatro Museo in Figueres  The location is across the street from the church of Sant Pere  where he had his baptism  first communion  and funeral  and is three blocks from the house where he was born  56  The Gala Salvador Dal  Foundation currently serves as his official estate  57  The U S  copyright representative for the Gala Salvador Dal  Foundation is the Artists Rights Society  58  In 2002  the Society made the news when they asked Google to remove a customized version of its logo put up to commemorate Dal   alleging that portions of specific artworks under their protection had been used without permission  Google complied with the request  but denied that there was any copyright violation  citation needed   edit  Symbolism Dal  employed extensive symbolism in his work  For instance  the hallmark  soft watches  that first appear in The Persistence of Memory suggest Einstein s theory that time is relative and not fixed  26  The idea for clocks functioning symbolically in this way came to Dal  when he was staring at a runny piece of Camembert cheese on a hot day in August  59  The elephant is also a recurring image in Dal  s works  It first appeared in his 1944 work Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening  The elephants  inspired by Gian Lorenzo Bernini s sculpture base in Rome of an elephant carrying an ancient obelisk  60  are portrayed  with long  multijointed  almost invisible legs of desire  61  along with obelisks on their backs  Coupled with the image of their brittle legs  these encumbrances  noted for their phallic overtones  create a sense of phantom reality   The elephant is a distortion in space   one analysis explains   its spindly legs contrasting the idea of weightlessness with structure   61   I am painting pictures which make me die for joy  I am creating with an absolute naturalness  without the slightest aesthetic concern  I am making things that inspire me with a profound emotion and I am trying to paint them honestly    Salvador Dal   in Dawn Ades  Dal  and Surrealism  The egg is another common Dal esque image  He connects the egg to the prenatal and intrauterine  thus using it to symbolize hope and love  62  it appears in The Great Masturbator and The Metamorphosis of Narcissus  The Metamorphosis of Narcissus also symbolized death and petrification  Various animals appear throughout his work as well  ants point to death  decay  and immense sexual desire  the snail is connected to the human head  he saw a snail on a bicycle outside Freud s house when he first met Sigmund Freud   and locusts are a symbol of waste and fear  62   edit  Science References to Dal  in the context of science are made in terms of his fascination with the paradigm shift that accompanied the birth of quantum mechanics in the twentieth century  Inspired by Werner Heisenberg s Uncertainty Principle  in 1958 he wrote in his  Anti Matter Manifesto    In the Surrealist period  I wanted to create the iconography of the interior world and the world of the marvelous  of my father Freud  Today  the exterior world and that of physics has transcended the one of psychology  My father today is Dr  Heisenberg   63  In this respect  The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory  which appeared in 1954  in hearkening back to The Persistence of Memory  and in portraying that painting in fragmentation and disintegration summarizes Dal  s acknowledgment of the new science  63   edit  Endeavors outside painting Dal  was a versatile artist  Some of his more popular works are sculptures and other objects  and he is also noted for his contributions to theatre  fashion  and photography  among other areas   edit  Sculptures and other objects The Dali Atomicus  photo by Philippe Halsman  1948   shown before its supporting wires were removed  Two of the most popular objects of the surrealist movement were Lobster Telephone and Mae West Lips Sofa  completed by Dal  in 1936 and 1937  respectively  Surrealist artist and patron Edward James commissioned both of these pieces from Dal   James inherited a large English estate in West Dean  West Sussex when he was five and was one of the foremost supporters of the surrealists in the 1930s  64   Lobsters and telephones had strong sexual connotations for  Dal     according to the display caption for the Lobster Telephone at the Tate Gallery   and he drew a close analogy between food and sex   65  The telephone was functional  and James purchased four of them from Dal  to replace the phones in his retreat home  One now appears at the Tate Gallery  the second can be found at the German Telephone Museum in Frankfurt  the third belongs to the Edward James Foundation  and the fourth is at the National Gallery of Australia  64  The wood and satin Mae West Lips Sofa was shaped after the lips of actress Mae West  whom Dal  apparently found fascinating  23  West was previously the subject of Dal  s 1935 painting The Face of Mae West  Mae West Lips Sofa currently resides at the Brighton and Hove Museum in England  Between 1941 and 1970  Dal  created an ensemble of 39 jewels  The jewels are intricate  and some contain moving parts  The most famous jewel   The Royal Heart   is made of gold and is encrusted with 46 rubies  42 diamonds  and four emeralds and is created in such a way that the center  beats  much like a real heart  Dal  himself commented that  Without an audience  without the presence of spectators  these jewels would not fulfill the function for which they came into being  The viewer  then  is the ultimate artist    Dal   1959   The  Dal    Joies    The Jewels of Dal    collection can be seen at the Dal  Theater Museum in Figueres  Catalonia  Spain  where it is on permanent exhibition   edit  Theatre and film In theatre  Dal  constructed the scenery for Federico Garc a Lorca s 1927 romantic play Mariana Pineda  66  For Bacchanale  1939   a ballet based on and set to the music of Richard Wagner s 1845 opera Tannh user  Dal  provided both the set design and the libretto  67 Bacchanale was followed by set designs for Labyrinth in 1941 and The Three Cornered Hat in 1949  68  Dal  became intensely interested in film when he was young  going to the theatre most Sundays  He was part of the era where silent films were being viewed and drawing on the medium of film became popular  He believed there were two dimensions to the theories of film and cinema   things themselves   the facts that are presented in the world of the camera  and  photographic imagination   the way the camera shows the picture and how creative or imaginative it looks  69  Dal  was active in front of and behind the scenes in the film world  He created pieces of artwork such as Destino  on which he collaborated with Walt Disney  He is credited as co creator of Luis Bu uel s surrealist film Un Chien Andalou  a 17 minute French art film co written with Luis Bu uel that is widely remembered for its graphic opening scene simulating the slashing of a human eyeball with a razor  This film is what Dal  is known for in the independent film world  Un Chien Andalou was Dal  s way of creating his dreamlike qualities in the real world  Images would change and scenes would switch  leading the viewer in a completely different direction from the one they were previously viewing  The second film he produced with Bu uel was entitled L Age d Or  and it was performed at Studio 28 in Paris in 1930  L Age d Or was  banned for years after fascist and anti Semitic groups staged a stink bomb and ink throwing riot in the Paris theater where it was shown   70  Although negative aspects of society were being thrown into the life of Dal  and obviously affecting the success of his artwork  it did not hold him back from expressing his own ideas and beliefs in his art  Both of these films  Un Chien Andalou and L Age d Or  have had a tremendous impact on the independent surrealist film movement   If Un Chien Andalou stands as the supreme record of Surrealism s adventures into the realm of the unconscious  then L  ge d Or is perhaps the most trenchant and implacable expression of its revolutionary intent   71  Dal  also worked with other famous filmmakers  such as Alfred Hitchcock  The most well known of his film projects is probably the dream sequence in Hitchcock s Spellbound  which heavily delves into themes of psychoanalysis  Hitchcock needed a dreamlike quality to his film  which dealt with the idea that a repressed experience can directly trigger a neurosis  and he knew that Dal  s work would help create the atmosphere he wanted in his film  He also worked on a documentary called Chaos and Creation  which has a lot of artistic references thrown into it to help one see what Dal  s vision of art really is  He also worked on the Disney short film production Destino  Completed in 2003 by Baker Bloodworth and Roy E  Disney  it contains dreamlike images of strange figures flying and walking about  It is based on Mexican songwriter Armando Dominguez  song  Destino   When Disney hired Dal  to help produce the film in 1946  they were not prepared for the work that lay ahead  For eight months  they continuously animated until their efforts had to come to a stop when they realized they were in financial trouble  They had no more money to finish the production of the animated film  however  it was eventually finished and shown in various film festivals  The film consists of Dal  s artwork interacting with Disney s character animation  Dal  completed only one other film in his lifetime  Impressions of Upper Mongolia  1975   in which he narrated a story about an expedition in search of giant hallucinogenic mushrooms  The imagery was based on microscopic uric acid stains on the brass band of a ballpoint pen on which Dal  had been urinating for several weeks  72   edit  Fashion and photography Dal  built a repertoire in the fashion and photography industries as well  In fashion  his cooperation with Italian fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli is well known  where Dal  was hired by Schiaparelli to produce a white dress with a lobster print  Other designs Dal  made for her include a shoe shaped hat and a pink belt with lips for a buckle  He was also involved in creating textile designs and perfume bottles  In 1950  Dal  created a special  costume for the year 2045  with Christian Dior  67  Photographers with whom he collaborated include Man Ray  Brassa   Cecil Beaton  and Philippe Halsman  With Man Ray and Brassa   Dal  photographed nature  with the others  he explored a range of obscure topics  including  with Halsman  the Dal  Atomica series  1948  inspired by his painting Leda Atomica   which in one photograph depicts  a painter s easel  three cats  a bucket of water  and Dal  himself floating in the air   67  One of Dal  s most unorthodox artistic creations may have been an entire person  At a French nightclub in 1965  Dal  met Amanda Lear  a fashion model then known as Peki D Oslo  73  Lear became his prot g  and muse  73  writing about their affair in the authorized biography My Life With Dal   1986   74  Transfixed by the mannish  larger than life Lear  Dal  masterminded her successful transition from modeling to the music world  advising her on self presentation and helping spin mysterious stories about her origin as she took the disco art scene by storm  According to Lear  she and Dal  were united in a  spiritual marriage  on a deserted mountaintop  73  Referred to as Dal  s  Frankenstein   75  some believe Lear s name is a pun on the French  L Amant Dal    or Lover of Dal   Lear took the place of an earlier muse  Ultra Violet  Isabelle Collin Dufresne   who had left Dal  s side to join The Factory of Andy Warhol  76   edit  Architecture Architectural achievements include his Port Lligat house near Cadaqu s  as well as the Dream of Venus surrealist pavilion at the 1939 World s Fair  which contained within it a number of unusual sculptures and statues  His literary works include The Secret Life of Salvador Dal   1942   Diary of a Genius  1952 63   and Oui  The Paranoid Critical Revolution  1927 33   The artist worked extensively in the graphic arts  producing many etchings and lithographs  While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings as he grew older  he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself  In addition  a large number of unauthorized fakes were produced in the eighties and nineties  thus further confusing the Dal  print market  He took a stab at industrial design in the 1970s with a 500 piece run of the upscale Suomi tableware by Timo Sarpaneva that Dal  decorated for the German Rosenthal porcelain maker s Studio Linie  77   edit  Novels Under the encouragement of poet Federico Garc a Lorca  Dal  attempted an approach to a literary career through the means of the  pure novel   In his only literary production  Hidden Faces  1944   Dal  describes  in vividly visual terms  the intrigues and love affairs of a group of dazzling  eccentric aristocrats who  with their luxurious and extravagant lifestyle  symbolize the decadence of the 1930s   edit  Politics and personality Dal  in the 1960s wearing the flamboyant mustache style he popularized  Salvador Dal  s politics played a significant role in his emergence as an artist  In his youth  he embraced both anarchism and communism  though his writings account anecdotes of making radical political statements more to shock listeners than from any deep conviction  This was in keeping with Dal  s allegiance to the Dada movement  As he grew older his political allegiances changed  especially as the Surrealist movement went through transformations under the leadership of Trotskyist Andr  Breton  who is said to have called Dal  in for questioning on his politics  In his 1970 book Dal  by Dal   Dal  was declaring himself an anarchist and monarchist  With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War  Dal  fled from fighting and refused to align himself with any group  Likewise  after World War II  George Orwell criticized Dal  for  scuttling off like a rat as soon as France is in danger  after Dal  prospered there for years   When the European War approaches he has one preoccupation only  how to find a place which has good cookery and from which he can make a quick bolt if danger comes too near    78  In a notable 1944 review of Dal  s autobiography  Orwell wrote   One ought to be able to hold in one s head simultaneously the two facts that Dal  is a good draughtsman and a disgusting human being    78  After his return to Catalonia after World War II  Dal  became closer to the authoritarian Franco regime  Some of Dal  s statements supported the Franco regime  congratulating Franco for his actions aimed  at clearing Spain of destructive forces   40  Dal   having returned to the Catholic faith and becoming increasingly religious as time went on  may have been referring to the Republican atrocities during the Spanish Civil War  79  80  Dal  sent telegrams to Franco  praising him for signing death warrants for prisoners  40  He even met Franco personally 81  and painted a portrait of Franco s granddaughter  He also once sent a telegram praising the Conduc tor  Romanian Communist leader Nicolae Ceau escu  for his adoption of a scepter as part of his regalia  The Romanian daily newspaper Sc nteia published it  without suspecting its mocking aspect  One of Dal  s few possible bits of open disobedience was his continued praise of Federico Garc a Lorca even in the years when Lorca s works were banned  not in citation given  17  Dal   a colorful and imposing presence in his ever present long cape  walking stick  haughty expression  and upturned waxed mustache  was famous for having said that  every morning upon awakening  I experience a supreme pleasure  that of being Salvador Dal    82  The entertainer Cher and her husband Sonny Bono  when young  came to a party at Dal  s expensive residence in New York s Plaza Hotel and were startled when Cher sat down on an oddly shaped sexual vibrator left in an easy chair  When signing autographs for fans  Dal  would always keep their pens  When interviewed by Mike Wallace on his 60 Minutes television show  Dal  kept referring to himself in the third person  and told the startled Mr  Wallace matter of factly that  Dal  is immortal and will not die   During another television appearance  on The Tonight Show  Dal  carried with him a leather rhinoceros and refused to sit upon anything else  citation needed  Salvador Dal  frequently traveled with his pet ocelot Babou  even bringing it aboard the luxury ocean liner  SS France   edit  Legacy Salvador Dal  has been cited as major inspiration from many modern artists  such as Damien Hirst  Noel Fielding  Jeff Koons and most other modern surrealists  Salvador Dal  s manic expression and famous moustache have made him something of a cultural icon for the bizarre  amp  surreal  He has been portrayed on film by Robert Pattinson in Little Ashes  and Adrien Brody in Midnight in Paris  He was also parodied in a series of painting skits on Captain Kangaroo as  Salvador Silly   played by Cosmo Allegretti  and in a Sesame Street muppet skit as  Salvador Dada   an orange gold AM performed by Jim Henson    edit  Listing of selected works Main article  List of works by Salvador Dal  The Philadelphia Museum of Art used a surreal entrance display including its steps  for the 2005 Salvador Dal  exhibition Dal  produced over 1 500 paintings in his career 83  in addition to producing illustrations for books  lithographs  designs for theatre sets and costumes  a great number of drawings  dozens of sculptures  and various other projects  including an animated short film for Disney  He also collaborated with director Jack Bond in 1965  creating a movie titled Dal  in New York  Below is a chronological sample of important and representative work  as well as some notes on what Dal  did in particular years  3  In Carlos Lozano s biography  Sex  Surrealism  Dal   and Me  produced with the collaboration of Clifford Thurlow  Lozano makes it clear that Dal  never stopped being a surrealist  As Dal  said of himself   the only difference between me and the surrealists is that I am a surrealist   36  1910 Landscape Near Figueras 1913 Vilabertin 1916 Fiesta in Figueras  begun 1914  1917 View of Cadaqu s
