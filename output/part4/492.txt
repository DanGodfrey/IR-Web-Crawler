1957 in the United States  Rand s fourth and last novel  it was also her longest  and the one she considered to be her magnum opus in the realm of fiction writing  1 Atlas Shrugged includes elements of mystery and science fiction  2  and it contains Rand s most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction  The book explores a dystopian United States where many of society s most productive citizens refuse to be exploited by increasing taxation and government regulations and disappear  They are led by John Galt  Galt describes the strike as  stopping the motor of the world  by withdrawing the minds that drive society s growth and productivity  In their efforts  these people  of the mind  hope to demonstrate that a world in which the individual is not free to create is doomed  that civilization cannot exist where every person is a slave to society and government  and that the destruction of the profit motive leads to the collapse of society  The protagonist  Dagny Taggart  sees society collapse around her as the government increasingly asserts control over all industry  The novel s title is a reference to Atlas  a Titan of Greek mythology  who in the novel is described as  the giant who holds the world on his shoulders   3  The significance of this reference is seen in a conversation between the characters Francisco d Anconia and Hank Rearden  in which d Anconia asks Rearden what sort of advice he would give to Atlas upon seeing that  the greater  the titan s  effort  the heavier the world bore down on his shoulders   With Rearden unable to answer  d Anconia gives his own response   To shrug   The theme of Atlas Shrugged  as Rand described it  is  the role of man s mind in existence   The book explores a number of philosophical themes that Rand would subsequently develop into the philosophy of Objectivism  4  5  It advocates the core tenets of Rand s philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement  In doing so  it expresses many facets of Rand s philosophy  such as the advocacy of reason  individualism  capitalism  and the failures of government coercion  Atlas Shrugged received largely negative reviews after its 1957 publication citation needed   but achieved enduring popularity and consistent sales in the following decades  Contents 1 Context and writing 2 Synopsis 2 1 Setting 2 2 Structure

6  Her stated goal for writing the text was  to show how desperately the world needs prime movers and how viciously it treats them  and to portray  what happens to a world without them   6  Rand remarked that the core idea for the book came to her after a 1943 telephone conversation with a friend  who asserted that Rand owed it to her readers to write a nonfiction book about her philosophy  Rand replied   What if I went on strike  What if all the creative minds of the world went on strike   7  Rand then set out to create a work of fiction that explored the role of the mind in human life and the morality of rational self interest  8  by exploring the consequences when the people  of the mind  go on strike  refusing to allow their inventions  art  business leadership  scientific research  or new ideas to be taken from them by the government or by the rest of the world  The working title throughout her writing was The Strike  but Rand thought this title would have revealed the mystery element of the novel prematurely  9  so she was pleased when her husband suggested Atlas Shrugged  previously the title of one of the chapters  as a better title for the book  10  To produce Atlas Shrugged  Rand conducted research on American industry  specifically the railroad industry  which forms a key element in her novel  Her previous work on a proposed  but never realized  screenplay based on the development of the atomic bomb  including her interviews of J  Robert Oppenheimer  was used in the portrait of the character Robert Stadler and the novel s depiction of the development of  Project X   In order to do further background research  Rand toured and inspected a number of industrial facilities such as the Kaiser Steel plant  rode the locomotives of the New York Central Railroad  and even learned to operate the locomotive of the Twentieth Century Limited  and proudly reported that when operating it   nobody touched a lever except me    7  11  Rand s self identified literary influences include Victor Hugo  Fyodor Dostoyevsky  Edmond Rostand  and O  Henry  12  In addition  Justin Raimondo has observed similarities between Atlas Shrugged and the 1922 novel The Driver  written by Garet Garrett  13  which concerns an idealized industrialist named Henry Galt  who is a transcontinental railway owner trying to improve the world and fighting against government and socialism  In contrast  Chris Matthew Sciabarra found Raimondo s  claims that Rand plagiarized   The Driver  to be  unsupported   14  and Stephan Kinsella doubts that Rand was in any way influenced by Garrett  15  Writer Bruce Ramsey observed   Both The Driver and Atlas Shrugged have to do with running railroads during an economic depression  and both suggest pro capitalist ways in which the country might get out of the depression  But in plot  character  tone  and theme they are very different   16  In order to persuade Rand to publish her novel with Random House  publisher Bennet Cerf proposed a  philosophic contest  in which Rand would submit her work to various publishers to judge their response to its ideas  so she could evaluate who might best promote her work  17  Because of the success of Rand s 1943 novel The Fountainhead  the initial print run was 100 000 copies  It marked a turning point in her life  ending her career as novelist and beginning her tenure as a popular philosopher  18   edit  Synopsis  edit  Setting Atlas Shrugged is set in an alternative dystopian United States at an unspecified time  in which the United States has a  National Legislature  instead of Congress and a  Head of State  instead of President  Writer Edward Younkins noted   The story may be simultaneously described as anachronistic and timeless  The pattern of industrial organization appears to be that of the late 1800s   the mood seems to be close to that of the depression era 1930s  Both the social customs and the level of technology remind one of the 1950s   19  Many early 20th century technologies are available  and the steel and railroad industries are especially significant  jet planes are described as a relatively new technology  and television is a novelty significantly less influential than radio  While many other countries are mentioned in passing  there is no mention of the Soviet Union  no reference to World War II or the Cold War  It is implied that the countries of the world are converting to big government statism  along vaguely Marxist lines  in references to  People s States  in Europe and South America  There are also plot elements that refer to nationalization of businesses in these  People s States   as well as in America  The  mixed economy  of the book s present is often contrasted with the  pure  capitalism of 19th century America  wistfully recalled as a lost Golden Age   edit  Structure The novel is divided into three parts consisting of ten chapters each  Robert James Bidinotto noted  the titles of the parts and chapters suggest multiple layers of meaning  The three parts  for example  are named in honor of Aristotle s laws of logic   Part One is titled  Non Contradiction    Part Two  titled  Either Or     and  Part Three is titled  A Is A   a reference to  the Law of Identity    20   edit  Plot summary See also  List of characters in Atlas Shrugged As the novel opens  protagonist Dagny Taggart  the Operating Vice President of Taggart Transcontinental  a giant railroad company originally pioneered by her grandfather  attempts to keep the company alive during difficult economic times marked by collectivism and statism  While Dagny runs the company from behind the scenes  her brother  James Taggart  the railroad s President  is peripherally aware of the company s troubles but will not make any difficult choices  preferring to avoid responsibility for any actions while watching his company go under  He seems to make irrational decisions such as preferring to buy steel from Orren Boyle s Associated Steel  rather than Hank Rearden s Rearden Steel  despite the former continually delaying delivery of vital rail  In this as in other decisions Dagny simply goes ahead with her own policy and challenges him to repeal it  As this unfolds  Dagny is disappointed to discover that Francisco d Anconia  a true genius and her only childhood friend  first love  and king of the copper industry  appears to have become a worthless playboy who is destroying his family s international copper company  which has made him into one of the richest and most powerful men in the world  Hank Rearden  a self made steel magnate of great integrity  has recently developed a metal alloy called Rearden Metal  now the strongest and most reliable metal in the world  Hank chooses to keep the instructions to its creation a secret  sparking jealousy and uproar among competitors  False claims are made about the danger of the alloy and are backed by government agencies  As a result of this  pressure is put on Dagny to use conventional steel but she refuses  Hank s career is hindered by his feelings of obligation toward his manipulative wife  mother  and ungrateful younger brother  who show no appreciation for everything he provides for them  Dagny also becomes acquainted with Wesley Mouch  a Washington lobbyist initially working for Hank Rearden  whom he betrays  Mouch eventually leads the government s efforts in controlling all commerce and enterprise  intentionally destroying the common man s opportunity to build a largely successful  free market business  The reader also becomes acquainted with Ellis Wyatt  the sole founder and supervisor of the successful enterprise Wyatt Oil  He is a young  self possessed  hard working man one of the few men still loyal to Dagny and Hank s efforts in pushing for a system of business free of government meddling and control  While economic conditions worsen and government agencies continue to enforce their control on successful businesses  the na ve  yet weary mass of citizens are often heard reciting the new  popular street phrase   Who is John Galt   This sarcastic phrase is given in response to what tend to be sincere questions about heavy subjects  wherein the individual can find no answer  It sarcastically means   Don t ask important questions  because we don t have answers   or more broadly   What s the point   or  Why bother   Dagny begins to notice the nation s brightest innovators and business leaders abruptly disappearing  one by one  under mysterious circumstances  all leaving their top industrial businesses to certain failure  The most recent of these leaders to have vanished is Dagny s friend Ellis Wyatt  who  like the others  has suddenly disappeared into thin air with no warning  leaving nothing behind except an empty office and his most successful oil well now spewing petroleum and fire high into the air  later to be named  Wyatt s Torch    Each of these men proves to be absent despite a thorough search put on by ever anxious politicians  who ve now found themselves trapped within a government that has been  left to dry   by its leaders in business   utterly helpless without them  In a romantic subplot  Dagny and Hank fall deeply in love  Rand refers to their love as a purer kind of love than the one that most men and women experience  These two people have a similar purpose in life  and they see in each other a kindred soul  In the universe of the novel  men and women with purpose are rare and  to an extent  deified   thus making their love especially sacred  Hank and Dagny go on a vacation drive across the USA  They discover  amongst the ruins of an abandoned factory  an incomplete motor that transforms atmospheric static electricity into kinetic electricity  Deeply moved by the significance of a motor which has the potential to completely transform the world  Dagny sets out to find the inventor  In the final section of the novel  Taggart discovers the truth about John Galt  who is leading an organized  strike  against those who use the force of law and moral guilt to confiscate the accomplishments of society s productive members  With the collapse of the nation and its rapacious government all but certain  Galt emerges to reconstruct a society that will celebrate individual achievement and enlightened self interest  delivering a long speech  seventy pages in the first edition  serving to explain the novel s theme and Rand s philosophy of Objectivism  in the book s longest single chapter  21   edit  Themes  edit  Philosophy Main article  Objectivism  Ayn Rand  The story of Atlas Shrugged dramatically expresses Rand s philosophy of Objectivism  Rand s ethical egoism  her advocacy of  rational selfishness   is perhaps her most well known position  For Rand  all of the principal virtues and vices are applications of the role of reason as man s basic tool of survival  or a failure to apply it   rationality  honesty  justice  independence  integrity  productiveness  and pride   each of which she explains in some detail in  The Objectivist Ethics   22  Rand s characters often personify her view of the archetypes of various schools of philosophy for living and working in the world  Robert James Bidinotto wrote that  Rand rejected the literary convention that depth and plausibility demand characters who are naturalistic replicas of the kinds of people we meet in everyday life  uttering everyday dialogue and pursuing everyday values  But she also rejected the notion that characters should be symbolic rather than realistic   20  and Rand herself stated   My characters are never symbols  they are merely men in sharper focus than the audience can see with unaided sight         My characters are persons in whom certain human attributes are focused more sharply and consistently than in average human beings   20  In addition to the plot s more obvious statements about the significance of industrialists to society  and the sharp contrast it provides to the Marxist version of exploitation and the Labor theory of value  this explicit conflict is used by Rand to draw wider philosophical conclusions  both implicit in the plot and via the characters  own statements  Atlas Shrugged portrays fascism  socialism and communism   any form of state intervention in society   as systemically and fatally flawed  In addition  positions are expressed on a variety of other topics  including sex  politics  friendship  charity  childhood  and many others  Rand said that it is not a fundamentally political book  but a demonstration of the individual mind s position and value in society  23  Rand argues that independence and individual achievement enables society to survive and thrive  and should be embraced  But this requires a rational moral code  She argues that  over time  coerced self sacrifice must cause any society to self destruct  Similarly  Rand rejects faith  that  short cut to knowledge   she writes in the novel  which in fact is only a  short circuit  destroying knowledge   along with any sort of a god or higher being  Rand urges the rejection of anything claiming  authority  over one s own mind   apart from the absolute of existence  itself  The book positions itself against religion specifically  often directly within the characters  dialogue   edit  Sanction of the victim The concept  sanction of the victim  is defined by Leonard Peikoff as  the willingness of the good to suffer at the hands of the evil  to accept the role of sacrificial victim for the  sin  of creating values   24  This concept may be original in the thinking of Rand  she holds that evil is a parasite on the good and can only exist if the good tolerates it  Atlas Shrugged can be seen as an answer to the question of what would happen if this sanction were revoked  When Atlas shrugs  relieving himself of the burden of carrying the world  he is revoking his sanction  Throughout Atlas Shrugged  numerous characters admit that there is something wrong with the world that they cannot identify  frequently  they are struggling with the idea of sanction of the victim  We first glimpse the concept when Hank Rearden feels he is duty bound to support his family  despite their hostility towards him  later  the principle is stated explicitly by Dan Conway   I suppose somebody s got to be sacrificed  If it turned out to be me  I have no right to complain   John Galt vows to stop the motor of the world by persuading the creators of the world to withhold their sanction   Evil is impotent and has no power but that which we let it extort from us   and   I saw that evil was impotent   and the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it   In Rand s view  morality requires that we do not sanction our own victimhood  She assigns virtue to the trait of rational self interest  However  Rand contends that moral selfishness does not mean a license to do whatever one pleases  guided by whims  It means the exacting discipline of defining and pursuing one s rational self interest  A code of rational self interest rejects every form of human sacrifice  whether of oneself to others or of others to oneself   edit  Government and business Atlas Shrugged endorses the belief that a society s best hope rests on adopting a system of pure laissez faire  Rand s view of the ideal government is expressed by John Galt  who says   The political system we will build is contained in a single moral premise  no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force   and claims that  no rights can exist without the right to translate one s rights into reality   to think  to work and to keep the results   which means  the right of property   Galt himself lives a life of laissez faire capitalism as the only way to live consistently with his beliefs  In the world of Atlas Shrugged  society stagnates when independent productive achievers are socially demonized and even punished for their accomplishments  25  Independence and personal happiness had flourished to the extent that people were free  and achievement was rewarded to the extent that individual ownership of private property was strictly respected  This is in line with an excerpt from a 1964 interview with Playboy magazine in which Rand states  What we have today is not a capitalist society  but a mixed economy   that is  a mixture of freedom and controls  which  by the presently dominant trend  is moving toward dictatorship  The action in Atlas Shrugged takes place at a time when society has reached the stage of dictatorship  When and if this happens  that will be the time to go on strike  but not until then   26  Rand characterizes the actions of government employees in a way that is consistent with public choice theory  describing how the language of altruism is used to pass legislation that is nominally in the public interest  e g   the  Anti Dog Eat Dog Rule   and  The Equalization of Opportunity Bill   but which in reality serves special interests and government agencies at the expense of the public and the producers of value  27   edit  Property rights and individualism  Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil  That sentence is the leper s bell of an approaching looter   28    Francisco d Anconia  Atlas Shrugged Rand s heroes must continually fight against  parasites    looters   and  moochers  who demand the benefits of the heroes  labor  Edward Younkins describes Atlas Shrugged as  an apocalyptic vision of the last stages of conflict between two classes of humanity   the looters and the non looters  The looters are proponents of high taxation  big labor  government ownership  government spending  government planning  regulation  and redistribution   29   Looters  confiscate others  earnings by force   at the point of a gun   and include government officials  whose demands are backed by the implicit threat of force  Some officials are merely executing government policy  such as those who confiscate one state s seed grain to feed the starving citizens of another  others are exploiting those policies  such as the railroad regulator who illegally sells the railroad s supplies for his own profit  Both use force to take property from the people who produced or earned it   Moochers  demand others  earnings on behalf of the needy and those unable to earn themselves  however  they curse the producers who make that help possible and are jealous and resentful of the talented on whom they depend  They are ultimately as destructive as the looters   destroying the productive through guilt  and appealing to  moral right  while enabling the  lawful  looting performed by governments  Looting and mooching are seen at all levels of the world Atlas Shrugged portrays  from the looting officials Dagny Taggart must work around and the mooching brother Hank Rearden struggles with  to the looting of whole industries by companies like Associated Steel and the mooching demands for foreign aid by the starving countries of Europe  One of the novel s heroes  Francisco d Anconia  indicates the role of  looters  in relation to money itself   So you think that money is the root of all evil     Have you ever asked what is the root of money  Money is a tool of exchange  which can t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them  Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value  Money is not the tool of the moochers  who claim your product by tears  or the looters who take it from you by force  Money is made possible only by the men who produce  Is this what you consider evil      Not an ocean of tears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into bread you need to survive tomorrow      Whenever destroyers appear among men  they start by destroying money  for money is men s protection and the base of a moral existence  Destroyers seize gold and leave its owners a counterfeit pile of paper  This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values    Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist  backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it  Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs  upon the virtue of the victims  Watch for the day when it bounces  marked   Account Overdrawn    28   edit  Theory of sex  Through Dagny s associations   Rand illustrates what a relationship between two self actualized  equal human beings can be   Rand denies the existence of a split between the physical and the mental  the desires of the flesh and the longings of the spirit   30    Mimi Reisel Gladstein  Ayn Rand and Feminism  An Unlikely Alliance In rejecting the traditional altruistic moral code  Rand also rejects the sexual code that  in her view  is the logical implication of altruism  In Atlas Shrugged Rand introduces a theory of sex that is based in her broader ethical and psychological theories  Rather than considering sexual desire a debasing animal instinct  Rand portrays it as the highest celebration of human values  a physical response to intellectual and spiritual values that gives concrete expression to what could otherwise be experienced only in the abstract  In Atlas Shrugged  characters are sexually attracted to those who embody or seem to embody their values  be they higher or lower values by Rand s standards  Characters who lack clear purpose find sex devoid of meaning  This is illustrated in the contrasting relationships of Hank Rearden with Lillian Rearden and Dagny Taggart  by the relationships of James Taggart with Cherryl Brooks and with Lillian Rearden  and finally in the relationship between Dagny and John Galt   edit  Fictional technology and Atlas as science fiction Technological progress and intellectual breakthroughs in scientific theory both figure prominently in Atlas Shrugged  leading some observers to classify Atlas in the genre of science fiction  Writer Jeff Riggenbach notes   Galt s motor is one of the three inventions that propel the action of Atlas Shrugged   the other two being Rearden Metal and the government s sonic weapon  Project X  31  Other fictional technologies included in the story are refractor rays  Gulch mirage   a sophisticated electrical torture device  the Ferris Persuader   voice activated door locks  Gulch power station   palm activated door locks  Galt s NY lab   and a process for extracting oil from shale  Riggenbach adds   Rand s overall message with regard to science seems clear  the role of science in human life and human society is to provide the knowledge on the basis of which technological advancement and the related improvements in the quality of human life can be realized  But science can fulfill this role only in a society in which human beings are left free to conduct their business as they see fit   32   edit  Reception Atlas Shrugged debuted on The New York Times Bestseller List at  6 three days after its publication date  7  It remained on the list for 21 weeks  peaking at  4 for a six week period beginning December 8  1957  7   Both conservatives and liberals were unstinting in disparaging the book  the right saw promotion of godlessness  and the left saw a message of greed is good  Rand is said to have cried every day as the reviews came out     Harriet Rubin  2007  in The New York Times 6  Atlas Shrugged was generally disliked by critics  despite being a popular success  The book was dismissed by some as  a homage to greed   while author Gore Vidal described its philosophy as  nearly perfect in its immorality   6  Helen Beal Woodward  reviewing Atlas Shrugged for The Saturday Review  opined that the novel was written with  dazzling virtuosity  but that it was  shot through with hatred   33  This was echoed by Granville Hicks  writing for The New York Times Book Review  who also stated that the book was  written out of hate   34  The reviewer for Time magazine asked   Is it a novel  Is it a nightmare  Is it Superman   in the comic strip or the Nietzschean version   35  In the magazine National Review  Whittaker Chambers called Atlas Shrugged  sophomoric  and  remarkably silly   and said it  can be called a novel only by devaluing the term   36  Chambers argued against the novel s implicit endorsement of atheism  whereby  Randian man  like Marxian man is made the center of a godless world   36  Chambers also wrote that the implicit message of the novel is akin to  Hitler s National Socialism and Stalin s brand of Communism    To a gas chamber   go     36  The negative reviews produced responses from some of Rand s admirers  including a letter by Alan Greenspan to The New York Times Book Review  in which he responded to Hicks  claim that  the book was written out of hate  by saying      Atlas Shrugged is a celebration of life and happiness  Justice is unrelenting  Creative individuals and undeviating purpose and rationality achieve joy and fulfillment  Parasites who persistently avoid either purpose or reason perish as they should   37  Greenspan had read unpublished drafts of the work in Rand s salon at least three years earlier  38  In an unpublished 39  letter to the National Review  Leonard Peikoff wrote       Mr  Chambers is an ex Communist  He has attacked Atlas Shrugged in the best tradition of the Communists   by lies  smears  and cowardly misrepresentations  Mr  Chambers may have changed a few of his political views  he has not changed the method of intellectual analysis and evaluation of the Party to which he belonged   Positive reviews appeared in a number of publications  Richard McLaughlin  reviewing the novel for The American Mercury  compared it to Uncle Tom s Cabin in importance  40  Well known journalist and book reviewer John Chamberlain  writing in The New York Herald Tribune  found Atlas Shrugged satisfying on many levels  science fiction  a  Dostoevsky  detective story and  most importantly  a  profound political parable   41  42  However  Mimi Reisel Gladstein writes that reviewers who have  appreciated not only Rand s writing style but also her message  have been  far outweighed by those who have been everything from hysterically hostile to merely uncomprehending   43  Former Rand friend  associate  business partner and lover Nathaniel Branden  to whom the book was originally dedicated  has had differing views of Atlas Shrugged in his life  He was initially quite favorable to it  praising it in the book he and Barbara Branden wrote in 1962 called Who is Ayn Rand  44  After he and Ayn Rand ended their business romantic relationship in 1968  both he and Barbara Branden repudiated their book in praise of Rand and her novels  45  As of 1971 though  in an interview he gave to  Reason  he listed some critiques  but concluded   But what the hell  so there are a few things one can quarrel with in the book  so what  ATLAS SHRUGGED is the greatest novel that has ever been written  in my judgment  so let s let it go at that   46  But years later  in 1984  two years after Rand s death  he argued that Atlas Shrugged  encourages emotional repression and self disowning  and that her works contained contradictory messages  Branden claimed that the characters rarely talk  on a simple  human level without launching into philosophical sermons   He criticized the potential psychological impact of the novel  stating that John Galt s recommendation to respond to wrongdoing with  contempt and moral condemnation  clashes with the view of psychologists who say this only causes the wrongdoing to repeat itself  47  Rand herself  however  would not have regarded a novel as needing to portray such  ordinary  human interaction at all  even if an entire philosophy of life does need to address this  48   edit  Praise  criticism  influence  and renewed popularity For more details on this topic  see Bibliography for Ayn Rand and Objectivism  Over the years  Atlas Shrugged has attracted an energetic and committed fan base  Each year the Ayn Rand Institute donates 400 000 copies of works by Ayn Rand  including Atlas Shrugged  to high school students  6  According to a 1991 survey done for the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club  Atlas Shrugged was situated between The Bible and M  Scott Peck s The Road Less Traveled as the book that made the most difference in the lives of 5 000 Book of the Month club members surveyed  with a  large gap existing between the  1 book and the rest of the list   49 Modern Library s 1998 nonscientific online poll of the 100 best novels of the 20th century 50  51  found Atlas rated  1 although it was not included on the list chosen by the Modern Library board of authors and scholars  52  In 1997  the libertarian Cato Institute held a joint conference with The Atlas Society  an Objectivist organization  to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the publication of Atlas Shrugged  53  At this event  Howard Dickman of Reader s Digest stated that the novel had  turned millions of readers on to the ideas of liberty  and said that the book had the important message of the readers   profound right to be happy   53  The C SPAN television series American Writers listed Rand as one of twenty two surveyed figures of American literature  though primarily mentioning The Fountainhead rather than Atlas Shrugged  54  Rand s impact on contemporary libertarian thought has been considerable  and it is noteworthy that the title of the leading libertarian magazine  Reason  Free Minds  Free Markets  is taken directly from John Galt  the hero of Atlas Shrugged  who argues that  a free mind and a free market are corollaries   The Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises admired the unapologetic elitism of Rand s work  In a private letter to Rand written a few months after the novel s publication  he declared      Atlas Shrugged is not merely a novel  It is also  or may I say  first of all  a cogent analysis of the evils that plague our society  a substantiated rejection of the ideology of our self styled  intellectuals  and a pitiless unmasking of the insincerity of the policies adopted by governments and political parties    You have the courage to tell the masses what no politician told them  you are inferior and all the improvements in your conditions which you simply take for granted you owe to the efforts of men who are better than you   55  Acclaim has not been unanimous  Nobel Prize winning economist and liberal commentator Paul Krugman alluded to an oft quoted quip 56  in his blog   There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen year old s life  The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged  One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes  leading to an emotionally stunted  socially crippled adulthood  unable to deal with the real world  The other  of course  involves orcs   57   I know from talking to a lot of Fortune 500 C E O  s that Atlas Shrugged has had a significant effect on their business decisions  even if they don t agree with all of Ayn Rand s ideas     John A  Allison  former CEO of BB amp T  6  In the late 2000s  the book gained more media attention and conservative commentators suggested the book as a warning against a socialistic reaction to the finance crisis  Conservative commentators Neal Boortz  58 Glenn Beck  and Rush Limbaugh 59  have offered high praise of the book on their respective radio and television programs  In 2006 Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Clarence Thomas cited Atlas Shrugged as among his favorite novels  60 Republican Congressman John Campbell said for example   People are starting to feel like we re living through the scenario that happened in  the novel     We re living in Atlas Shrugged   echoing Stephen Moore in an article published in The Wall Street Journal on January 9  2009  titled  Atlas Shrugged From Fiction to Fact in 52 Years   61  The sales of Atlas Shrugged have since then sharply increased  according to The Economist magazine and The New York Times  The Economist reported that the fifty two year old novel ranked  33 among Amazon com s top selling books on January 13  2009 and that its thirty day sales average showed the novel selling three times faster than during the same period of the previous year  With an attached sales chart  The Economist reported that sales  spikes  of the book seemed to coincide with the release of economic data  Subsequently  on April 2  2009  Atlas Shrugged ranked  1 in the  Fiction and Literature  category at Amazon and  15 in overall sales  62  63  64  Total sales of the novel in 2009 exceeded 500 000 copies  65   edit  Film and television adaptations Main article  Atlas Shrugged  Part I A film adaptation of Atlas Shrugged was in  development hell  for nearly 40 years  66  In 1972  Albert S  Ruddy approached Rand to produce a cinematic adaptation  but Rand insisted on having final script approval  which Ruddy refused to give her  thus preventing a deal  In 1978  Henry and Michael Jaffe negotiated a deal for an eight hour Atlas Shrugged television miniseries on NBC  Michael Jaffe hired screenwriter Stirling Silliphant to adapt the novel and he obtained approval from Rand on the final script  However  in 1979  with Fred Silverman s rise as president of NBC  the project was scrapped  67  Rand  a former Hollywood screenwriter herself  began writing her own screenplay  but died in 1982 with only one third of it finished  She left her estate  including the film rights to Atlas  to her student Leonard Peikoff  who sold an option to Michael Jaffe and Ed Snider  Peikoff would not approve the script they wrote  and the deal fell through  In 1992  investor John Aglialoro bought an option to produce the film  paying Peikoff over  1 million for full creative control  67  In 1999  under Aglialoro s sponsorship  Ruddy negotiated a deal with Turner Network Television  TNT  for a four hour miniseries  but the project was killed after the AOL Time Warner merger  After the TNT deal fell through Howard and Karen Baldwin obtained the rights while running Phillip Anschutz s Crusader Entertainment  The Baldwins left Crusader and formed Baldwin Entertainment Group in 2004  taking the rights to Atlas Shrugged with them  Michael Burns of Lions Gate Entertainment approached the Baldwins to fund and distribute Atlas Shrugged  67  A draft screenplay was written by James V  Hart 68  and re written by Randall Wallace  69  but was never produced  In May 2010  Brian Patrick O Toole and Aglialoro wrote a screenplay  intent on filming in June 2010  Stephen Polk was set to direct  70  However  Polk was fired and principal photography began on June 13  2010 under the direction of Paul Johansson and produced by Harmon Kaslow and Aglialoro  71  This resulted in Aglialoro s retention of his rights to the property  which were set to expire on June 15  2010  Filming was completed on July 20  2010  72  and the movie was released on April 15  2011  73  Dagny Taggart was played by Taylor Schilling and Hank Rearden by Grant Bowler  74  The film was met with a generally negative reception from professional critics  getting an 11   rotten  rating on movie review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes  75  and had less than  5 million in total box office receipts  76  The producer and screenwriter John Aglialoro blamed critics for the film s paltry box office take and said he might go on strike  77  However  on February 2  2012  Kaslow and Aglialoro announced Atlas Shrugged  Part 2 was fully funded and that principal photography was tentatively scheduled to commence in early April 2012 with a release date of October 2012  78   edit  See
