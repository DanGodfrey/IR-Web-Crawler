comprises 114 counties and the independent city of St  Louis  The four largest urban areas are St  Louis  Kansas City  Springfield  and Columbia  8  Missouri s capital is Jefferson City  The land that is now Missouri was acquired from France as part of the Louisiana Purchase and became known as the Missouri Territory  Part of the Territory was admitted into the union as the 24th state on August 10  1821  Missouri mirrors the demographic  economic and political makeup of the nation  in general  with a mix of urban and rural culture  It has long been considered a political bellwether state  9  With the exceptions of 1956 and 2008  Missouri s results in U S  presidential elections have accurately predicted the next President of the United States in every election since 1904  It has both Midwestern and Southern cultural influences  reflecting its history as a border state  It is also a transition between the Eastern and Western United States  as St  Louis is often called the  western most Eastern city  and Kansas City the  eastern most Western city   Missouri s geography is highly varied  The northern part of the state lies in dissected till plains while the southern part lies in

was named after the Siouan language tribe  They were called the ouemessourita  wimihsoorita 13    meaning  those who have dugout canoes   by the Miami Illinois language speakers  The Illini were the first natives encountered by Europeans in the region and they adopted the name of the Missouri from them  14   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Missouri See also  List of Missouri state

north by Iowa  on the east  across the Mississippi River  by Illinois  Kentucky  and Tennessee  on the south by Arkansas  and on the west by Oklahoma  Kansas  and Nebraska  the last across the Missouri River   The two largest Missouri rivers are the Mississippi  which defines the eastern boundary of the state  and the Missouri River  which flows from west to east through the state  essentially connecting the two largest metros  Kansas City and St  Louis  Although today the state is usually considered part of the Midwest  15  16  historically Missouri was considered by many to be a Southern state  17  chiefly because of the settlement of migrants from the South and its status as a slave state before the Civil War  The counties that made up  Little Dixie  were those along the Missouri River in the center of the state  settled by Southern migrants who held the greatest concentration of slaves  In 2005  Missouri received 16 695 000 visitors to its national parks and other recreational areas totaling 202 000 acres  820 km2   giving it  7 41 mil  in annual revenues  26 6  of its operating expenditures  18   edit  Topography A physiographic map of Missouri North of  and in some cases just south of  the Missouri River lie the Northern Plains that stretch into Iowa  Nebraska  and Kansas  Here  gentle rolling hills remain from the glaciation that once extended from the Canadian Shield to the Missouri River  Missouri has many large river bluffs along the Mississippi  Missouri  and Meramec Rivers  Southern Missouri rises to the Ozark Mountains  a dissected plateau surrounding the Precambrian igneous St  Francois Mountains  This region also hosts karst topography characterized by high limestone content with the formation of sinkholes and caves  19  A portion of the Ozarks in Southern Missouri The southeastern part of the state is the Bootheel region  part of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain or Mississippi embayment  This region is the lowest  flattest  and wettest part of the state  It is also among the poorest  as the economy is mostly agricultural  20  It is also the most fertile  with cotton and rice crops predominant  The Bootheel was the epicenter of the four New Madrid Earthquakes of 1811 1812   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Missouri Missouri generally has a humid continental climate  K ppen climate classification Dfa  with cold winters and hot and humid summers  In the southern part of the state  particularly in the Bootheel  the climate turns into a humid subtropical climate  Koppen Cfa   Located in the interior United States  Missouri often experiences extremes in temperatures  Without high mountains or oceans nearby to moderate temperature  its climate is alternately influenced by air from the cold Arctic and the hot and humid Gulf of Mexico  Missouri s highest recorded temperature is 118  F  48  C  at Warsaw and Union on July 14  1954 while the lowest recorded temperature is  40  F   40  C  also at Warsaw on February 13  1905  Missouri also receives extreme weather in the form of thunderstorms and powerful tornadoes  The most recent EF5 tornado in the state to cause damage and casualties was the 2011 Joplin tornado  which destroyed roughly 1 3 of the city of Joplin  The tornado caused an estimated  1 3 billion dollars in damages  killed 159   1 non tornadic   and injured over 1 000 people  The tornado was the first EF5 to hit the state since 1957  The tornado was the deadliest in the U S  since 1947  making it the 7th deadliest tornado in American history  but the 27th deadliest in the

years before European exploration and settlement  Archaeological excavations along the rivers have shown continuous habitation for more than 7 000 years  Beginning before 1000 CE  there arose the complex Mississippian culture  whose people created regional political centers at present day St  Louis and across the Mississippi River at Cahokia  near present day Collinsville  Illinois  Their large cities included thousands of individual residences  but they are known for their surviving massive earthwork mounds  built for religious  political and social reasons  in platform  ridgetop and conical shapes  Cahokia was the center of a regional trading network that reached from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico  The civilization declined by 1400 CE  and most descendants left the area long before the arrival of Europeans  St  Louis was at one time known as Mound City by the European Americans  because of the numerous surviving prehistoric mounds  since lost to urban development  The Mississippian culture left mounds throughout the middle Mississippi and Ohio river valleys  extending into the southeast as well as the upper river  The first European settlers were mostly ethnic French Canadians  who created their first settlement in Missouri at present day Ste  Genevieve  about an hour south of St  Louis  They had migrated about 1750 from the Illinois Country  They came from colonial villages on the east side of the Mississippi River  where soils were becoming exhausted and there was insufficient river bottom land for the growing population  Ste  Genevieve became a thriving agricultural center  producing enough surplus wheat  corn and tobacco to ship tons of grain annually downriver to Lower Louisiana for trade  Grain production in the Illinois Country was critical to the survival of Lower Louisiana and especially the city of New Orleans  St  Louis was founded soon after by French from New Orleans  It became the center of a regional fur trade with Native American tribes that extended up the Missouri and Mississippi rivers  which dominated the regional economy for decades  Trading partners of major firms shipped their furs from St  Louis by river down to New Orleans for export to Europe  They provided a variety of goods to traders  for sale and trade with their Native American clients  The fur trade and associated businesses made St  Louis an early financial center and provided the wealth for some to build fine houses and import luxury items  Its location near the confluence of the Illinois River meant it also handled produce from the agricultural areas  River traffic and trade along the Mississippi were integral to the state s economy  and as the area s first major city  St  Louis expanded greatly after the invention of the steamboat and the increased river trade  Part of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase by the United States  Missouri earned the nickname  Gateway to the West  because it served as a major departure point for expeditions and settlers heading to the West in the 19th century  St  Charles  just west of St  Louis  was the starting point and the return destination of the Lewis and Clark Expedition  which departed up the Missouri River in 1804 to explore the western territories to the Pacific Ocean  St  Louis was a major supply point for decades for parties of settlers heading west  Ste  Genevieve  one of the oldest towns in the United States As many of the early American settlers in western Missouri migrated from the Upper South  they brought enslaved African Americans for labor  and a desire to continue their culture and the institution of slavery  They settled predominantly in 17 counties along the Missouri River  in an area of flatlands that enabled plantation agriculture and became known as  Little Dixie   In 1821 the territory was admitted as a slave state in 1821 as part of the Missouri Compromise with a temporary state capitol in St  Charles  In 1826 the capital was shifted to its permanent location of Jefferson City  also on the Missouri  The state was rocked by the 1812 New Madrid earthquake  Casualties were light due to the sparse population  Originally the state s western border was a straight line  defined as the meridian passing through the Kawsmouth  22  the point where the Kansas River enters the Missouri River  The river has moved since this designation  This line is known as the Osage Boundary  23  In 1835 the Platte Purchase was added to the northwest corner of the state after purchase of the land from the native tribes  making the Missouri River the border north of the Kansas River  This addition increased the land area of what was already the largest state in the Union at the time  about 66 500 square miles  172 000 km2  to Virginia s 65 000 square miles  which then included West Virginia   24  In the early 1830s  Mormon migrants from northern states and Canada began settling near Independence and areas just north of there  Conflicts over religion and slavery arose between the  old settlers   mainly from the South  and the Mormons  mainly from the North   The Mormon War erupted in 1838  By 1839  with the help of an  Extermination Order  by Governor Lilburn Boggs  the old settlers forcefully expelled the Mormons from Missouri and confiscated their lands  Fur Traders Descending the Missouri by Missouri painter George Caleb Bingham Conflicts over slavery exacerbated border tensions among the states and territories  In 1838 1839 a border dispute with Iowa over the so called Honey Lands resulted in both states  calling up militias along the border  With increasing migration  from the 1830s to the 1860s Missouri s population almost doubled with every decade  Most of the newcomers were American born  but many Irish and German immigrants arrived in the late 1840s and 1850s  As they were mostly Catholic  they mostly set up their own religious institutions in the state  which had been mostly Protestant  Having fled famine and oppression in Ireland  and revolutionary upheaval in Germany  the immigrants were not sympathetic to slavery  Many settled in cities  where they created a regional and then state network of Catholic churches and schools  Nineteenth century German immigrants created the wine industry along the Missouri River and the beer industry in St  Louis  Most Missouri farmers practiced subsistence farming before the Civil War  The majority of those who held slaves had fewer than 5 each  Planters  defined by historians as those holding 20 or more slaves  were concentrated in the counties known as  Little Dixie   in the central part of the state along the Missouri River  The tensions over slavery had chiefly to do with the future of the state and nation  In 1860 enslaved African Americans made up less than 10  of the state s population of 1 182 012  25  To try to control regular flooding of farmland and low lying villages along the Mississippi  by 1860 the state had completed construction of 140 miles  230 km  of levees along the river  26   edit  American Civil War Main article  Missouri in the American Civil War After the secession of Southern states began in 1861  the Missouri legislature called for the election of a special convention on secession  The convention voted decisively to remain within the Union  Pro Southern Governor Claiborne F  Jackson ordered the mobilization of several hundred members of the state militia who had gathered in a camp in St  Louis for training  Alarmed at this action  Union General Nathaniel Lyon struck first  encircling the camp and forcing the state troops to surrender  Lyon directed his soldiers  largely non English speaking German immigrants  to march the prisoners through the streets  and they opened fire on the largely hostile crowds of civilians who gathered around them  Soldiers killed unarmed prisoners as well as men  women and children of St  Louis in the incident that became known as the  St  Louis Massacre   These events heightened Confederate support within the state  Governor Jackson appointed Sterling Price  president of the convention on secession  as head of the new Missouri State Guard  In the face of Union General Lyon s rapid advance through the state  Jackson and Price were forced to flee the capital of Jefferson City on June 14  1861  In the town of Neosho  Missouri  Jackson called the state legislature into session  They enacted a secession ordinance  However  even under the Southern view of secession  only the state convention had the sole power to secede  Since the convention was dominated by unionists  and the state was more pro Union than pro Confederate in any event  the ordinance of secession adopted by the legislature is generally given little credence  The Confederacy nonetheless recognized it on October 30  1861  Price s Raid in the Trans Mississippi Theater  1864 With the elected governor absent from the capital and the legislators largely dispersed  the state convention was reassembled with most of its members present  save 20 that fled south with Jackson s forces  The convention declared all offices vacant  and installed Hamilton Gamble as the new governor of Missouri  President Lincoln s administration immediately recognized Gamble s government as the legal Missouri government  The federal government s decision enabled raising pro Union militia forces for service within the state as well as volunteer regiments for the Union Army  Fighting ensued between Union forces and a combined army of General Price s Missouri State Guard and Confederate troops from Arkansas and Texas under General Ben McCulloch  After winning victories at the battle of Wilson s Creek and the siege of Lexington  Missouri and suffering losses elsewhere  the Confederate forces retreated to Arkansas and later Marshall  Texas  in the face of a largely reinforced Union Army  Though regular Confederate troops staged some large scale raids into Missouri  the fighting in the state for the next three years consisted chiefly of guerrilla warfare   Citizen soldiers  or insurgents such as Colonel William Quantrill  Frank and Jesse James  the Younger brothers  and William T  Anderson made use of quick  small unit tactics  Pioneered by the Missouri Partisan Rangers  such insurgencies also arose in portions of the Confederacy occupied by the Union during the Civil War  Recently historians have assessed the James brothers  outlaw years as continuing guerrilla warfare after the official war was over  The activities of the  Bald Knobbers  of south central Missouri in the 1880s has also been seen as an unofficial continuation of insurgent hostilities long after the official end of the war   edit  20th century to present In 1930  there was a diphtheria epidemic in the area around Springfield  which killed approximately 100 people  Serum was rushed to the area  and medical personnel stopped the epidemic  During the mid 1950s and 1960s  St  Louis and Kansas City suffered deindustrialization and loss of jobs in railroads and manufacturing  as did other Midwestern industrial cities  In 1956 St  Charles was the site of the first interstate highway project  27  Such highway construction made it easy for middle class residents to leave the city for newer housing developed in the suburbs  often former farmland where land was available at lower prices  These major cities have gone through decades of readjustment to develop different economies and adjust to demographic changes  Suburban areas have developed separate job markets  both in knowledge industries and services  such as major retail malls   edit  Demographics Missouri Population Density Map Historical populations Census Pop     1810 19 783   1820 66 586 236 6  1830 140 455

Missouri bellwether Further information  Political party strength in Missouri Missouri is widely regarded as a state bellwether in American politics  The state has a longer stretch of supporting the winning presidential candidate than any other state  having voted with the nation in every election since 1904 with two exceptions  in 1956 when it voted for Governor Adlai Stevenson of Illinois over the winner  incumbent President Dwight Eisenhower of Kansas  and in 2008 when it voted for Senator John McCain of Arizona over national winner Senator Barack Obama of Illinois  both by extremely narrow margins  Missouri was the closest state in both of those presidential elections   edit  Laissez faire alcohol and tobacco laws Missouri has been known for its population s generally  stalwart  conservative  noncredulous  attitude toward regulatory regimes  which is one of the origins of the state s unofficial nickname  the  Show Me State   39  As a result  and combined with the fact that Missouri is one of America s leading alcohol and tobacco producing states  regulation of alcohol and tobacco in Missouri is among the most laissez faire in America  Main article  Alcohol laws of Missouri With a large German immigrant population and the development of a brewing industry  Missouri always has had among the most permissive alcohol laws in the United States  It never enacted statewide prohibition  Missouri voters rejected prohibition in three separate referenda in 1910  1912  and 1918  Alcohol regulation did not begin in Missouri until 1934  Today  alcohol laws are controlled by the state government  and local jurisdictions are prohibited from going beyond those state laws  Missouri has no statewide open container law or prohibition on drinking in public  no alcohol related blue laws  no local option  no precise locations for selling liquor by the package  thus allowing even drug stores and gas stations to sell any kind of liquor   and no differentiation of laws based on alcohol percentage  Missouri had no laws prohibiting  consumption  of alcohol by minors  as opposed to possession   and state law protects persons from arrest or criminal penalty for public intoxication  40  Missouri law expressly prohibits any jurisdiction from going dry  41  Missouri law also expressly allows parents and guardians to serve alcohol to their children  42  The Power  amp  Light District in Kansas City is one of the few places in the United States where a state law explicitly allows persons over the age of 21 to possess and consume open containers of alcohol in the street  as long as the beverage is in a plastic cup   43  See also  Smoking laws of Missouri As for tobacco  as of May 2010 Missouri has the lowest cigarette excise taxes in the United States  44  and the electorate voted in 2002 and 2006 to keep it that way  45  In 2007  Forbes named Missouri s largest metropolitan area  St  Louis  America s  best city for smokers   46  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  in 2008 Missouri had the fourth highest percentage of adult smokers among U S states  at 24 5   47  Although Missouri s minimum age for purchase and distribution of tobacco products is 18  tobacco products can be distributed to persons under 18 by family members on private property  48  No statewide smoking ban ever has been seriously entertained before the Missouri General Assembly  and in October 2008  a statewide survey by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services found that only 27 5  of Missourians support a statewide ban on smoking in all bars and restaurants  49  Missouri state law permits bars  restaurants which seat less than 50 people  bowling alleys  and billiard parlors to decide their own smoking policies  without limitation  50  Additionally  in Missouri  it is  an improper employment practice  for an employer to refuse to hire  to fire  or otherwise to disadvantage any person because that person lawfully uses alcohol and or tobacco products when he or she is not at work  51   edit  Counties The highly photographed Jasper County Courthouse in Carthage  Missouri is listed in the National Register of Historic

use of the unofficial nickname the Show Me State has several possible origins  The phrase  I m from Missouri  means  I m skeptical of the matter and not easily convinced   This is related to the state s unofficial motto of  Show Me   whose origin is popularly ascribed to an 1899 speech by Congressman Willard Vandiver  who declared that  I come from a country that raises corn and cotton  cockleburs and Democrats  and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me  I m from Missouri  and you have got to show me   However  according to researchers  the phrase was in circulation earlier in the 1890s  57  According to another legend  the phrase was a reference to Missouri miners brought to Leadville  Colorado to take the place of striking miners and being unfamiliar with the mining methods there required frequent instruction  58  Missouri is also known as  The Cave State  with over 6000 recorded caves  second to Tennessee   Perry County has both the largest number of caves and the single longest cave in the state  59  Other nicknames include  The Lead State    The Bullion State    The Ozark State    Mother of the West    The Iron Mountain State    The Puke State  and  Pennsylvania of the West   60  There is no official state nickname  61  However  the official state motto is  Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto   Latin for  Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law   62   edit  See also Geography portal North America portal United States portal Missouri portal Outline of geography Outline of North America Outline of the United States Outline of Missouri
