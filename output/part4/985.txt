inspired lyrics with tuned down guitars and achieving multiple platinum records in the 1970s  Despite an association with occult and horror themes  Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability  political corruption  the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophesies of the horrors of war  Black Sabbath are cited as pioneers of heavy metal  2  3  The band helped define the genre with releases such as quadruple platinum Paranoid  released in 1970  4  They were ranked by MTV as the  Greatest Metal Band  of all time  5  and placed second in VH1 s  100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock  list  behind Led Zeppelin  6 Rolling Stone called the band  the heavy metal kings of the  70s   7  They have sold over 15 million records in the United States 8  and over 70 million records worldwide  9  Black Sabbath were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006  and were included among Rolling Stone s list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  10  Vocalist Ozzy Osbourne s heavy alcohol and drug usage led to him being fired from the band in April 1979  after which he began a successful solo career  selling over 55 million albums  He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio  After a few albums with Dio s vocals and songwriting collaborations  Black Sabbath endured a revolving line up in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan  Glenn Hughes  Ray Gillen and Tony Martin  In 1992  Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer  The original line up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and

Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward sought to form a heavy blues rock band in Aston  Birmingham  The two enlisted bassist Geezer Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne  who had played together in a band called Rare Breed  Osbourne having placed an advertisement in a local music shop   Ozzy Zig Needs Gig   has own PA   14  The new group was initially named The Polka Tulk Blues Band  after a cheap brand of talcum powder Osbourne saw in his mother s bathroom  15  and also featured slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips and saxophonist Alan  Aker  Clarke  After shortening the name to Polka Tulk  the band changed their name to Earth  which Osbourne hated  16  and continued as a four piece without Phillips and Clarke  17  18  While the band was performing under the Earth title  they recorded several demos written by Norman Haines such as  The Rebel    Song for Jim   and  When I Came Down   19  In December 1968  Iommi abruptly left Earth to join Jethro Tull  20  Although his stint with the band would be short lived  Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on the The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV show  Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull  Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969   It just wasn t right  so I left   Iommi said   At first I thought Tull were great  but I didn t much go for having a leader in the band  which was Ian Anderson s way  When I came back from Tull  I came back with a new attitude altogether  They taught me that to get on  you got to work for it   21  While playing shows in England in 1969  the band discovered they were being mistaken for another English group named Earth  and decided to change their name again  A cinema across the street from the band s rehearsal room was showing the 1963 Boris Karloff horror film Black Sabbath directed by Mario Bava  While watching people line up to see the film  Butler noted that it was  strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies   22  Following that  Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called  Black Sabbath   which was inspired by the work of occult writer Dennis Wheatley  23  24  along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot of his bed  25  Making use of the musical tritone  also known as  The Devil s Interval   26  the song s ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction  27  28  a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s  which was dominated by flower power  folk music  and hippie culture  Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford has called the track  probably the most evil song ever written   29  Inspired by the new sound  the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969  30  and made the decision to focus on writing similar material  in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films   edit  Black Sabbath and Paranoid  1970 1971  Black Sabbath were signed to Philips Records in November 1969  31  and released their first single   Evil Woman   a cover of a song by the band Crow  through Philips subsidiary Fontana Records in January 1970  Later releases were handled by Philips  newly formed progressive rock label  Vertigo Records  Although the single failed to chart  the band were afforded two days of studio time in November to record their debut album with producer Rodger Bain  Iommi recalls recording live   We thought  We have two days to do it and one of the days is mixing   So we played live  Ozzy was singing at the same time  we just put him in a separate booth and off we went  We never had a second run of most of the stuff   32  Black Sabbath was released on Friday the 13th  February 1970  The album reached number 8 in the UK Albums Chart  and following its US and Canadian release in May 1970 by Warner Bros  Records  the album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200  where it remained for over a year  33  34  While the album was a commercial success  it was widely panned by critics  with Lester Bangs dismissing the album in a Rolling Stone review as  discordant jams with bass and guitar reeling like velocitised speedfreaks all over each other s musical perimeters  yet never quite finding synch   35  It sold in substantial numbers despite being panned  giving the band their first mainstream exposure  36  It has since been certified platinum in both US by the Recording Industry Association of America  RIAA  and in the UK by British Phonographic Industry  BPI   37  38  To capitalise on their chart success in the US  the band returned to the studio in June 1970  just four months after Black Sabbath was released  The new album was initially set to be named War Pigs after the song  War Pigs   which was critical of the Vietnam War  however  Warner changed the title of the album to Paranoid  The album s lead off single  Paranoid  was written in the studio at the last minute  As Bill Ward explains   We didn t have enough songs for the album  and Tony just played the  Paranoid  guitar lick and that was it  It took twenty  twenty five minutes from top to bottom   39  The single was released in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts  remaining Black Sabbath s only top ten hit  34  The album followed in the UK in October 1970  where  pushed by the success of the  Paranoid  single  it made number one in the charts  The US release was held until January 1971  as the Black Sabbath album was still on the charts at the time of Paranoid s UK release  The album reached No  12 in the US in March 1971  40  and would go on to sell four million copies in the US  41  with virtually no radio airplay  34  Like Black Sabbath  the album was slated by rock critics of the era  but modern day reviewers such as Allmusic s Steve Huey cite Paranoid as  one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time   which  defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history   4  In 2003  the album was ranked at No  130 on Rolling Stone magazine s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time  Paranoid s chart success allowed the band to tour the US for the first time in October 1970  which spawned the release of the album s second single  Iron Man   Although the single failed to reach the top 40   Iron Man  remains one of Black Sabbath s most popular songs  as well as the band s highest charting US single until 1998 s  Psycho Man   33   edit  Master of Reality and Volume 4  1971 1973  In February 1971  Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album  Following the chart success of Paranoid  the band were afforded more studio time  along with a  briefcase full of cash  to buy drugs  42   We were getting into coke  big time   Ward explained   Uppers  downers  Quaaludes  whatever you like  It got to the stage where you come up with ideas and forget them  because you were just so out of it   43  Production completed in April 1971  and in July the band released Master of Reality  just six months after the US release of Paranoid  The album reached the top ten in both the US and UK  and was certified gold in less than two months  44  eventually receiving platinum certification in the 1980s 44  and Double Platinum in the early 21st century  44 Master of Reality contained Black Sabbath s first acoustic songs  alongside fan favourites such as  Children of the Grave  and  Sweet Leaf   45  Critical response of the era was generally unfavourable  with Lester Bangs delivering an ambivalent review of Master of Reality in Rolling Stone  describing the closing song  Children of the Grave  as  na ve  simplistic  repetitive  absolute doggerel   but in the tradition  of rock n roll       The only criterion is excitement  and Black Sabbath s got it   46  yet the very same magazine would in 2003 place the album at number 298 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list  Following the Master of Reality world tour in 1972  Black Sabbath took its first break in three years  As Bill Ward explained   The band started to become very fatigued and very tired  We d been on the road non stop  year in and year out  constantly touring and recording  I think Master of Reality was kind of like the end of an era  the first three albums  and we decided to take our time with the next album   47  In June 1972  the band reconvened in Los Angeles to begin work on their next album at the Record Plant  The recording process was plagued with problems  many as a result of substance abuse issues  While struggling to record the song  Cornucopia  after  sitting in the middle of the room  just doing drugs   48  Bill Ward was nearly fired from the band   I hated the song  there were some patterns that were just    horrible  Ward said   I nailed it in the end  but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody  It was like  Well  just go home  you re not being of any use right now   I felt like I d blown it  I was about to get fired   49  The album was originally titled  Snowblind  after the song of the same name  which deals with cocaine abuse  The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol  4  with Ward stating  There was no Volume 1  2 or 3  so it s a pretty stupid title really   50  Black Sabbath s Volume 4 was released in September 1972  and while critics were dismissive of the album upon release  it achieved gold status in less than a month  51  and was the band s fourth consecutive release to sell a million copies in the US  33  51  With more time in the studio  Volume 4 saw the band starting to experiment with new textures  such as strings  piano  orchestration and multi part songs  52  The song  Tomorrow s Dream  was released as a single the band s first since Paranoid but failed to chart  53  Following an extensive tour of the US  the band travelled to Australia and New Zealand for the first time in 1973  and later mainland Europe   edit  Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage  1973 1976  Following the Volume 4 world tour  Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles to begin work on their next release  Pleased with the Volume 4 album  the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere  and returned to the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles  With new musical innovations of the era  the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a  giant synthesiser   The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973  but in part because of substance issues and fatigue  they were unable to complete any songs   Ideas weren t coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent  Iommi said   Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something  I just couldn t think of anything  And if I didn t come up with anything  nobody would do anything   54  Tony Iommi and Ozzy Osbourne on stage at Kooyong Stadium in Melbourne  Australia on 13 January 1973  After a month in Los Angeles with no results  the band opted to return to England  where they rented Clearwell Castle in The Forest of Dean   We rehearsed in the dungeons and it was really creepy but it had some atmosphere  it conjured up things  and stuff started coming out again   55  While working in the dungeon  Iommi stumbled onto the main riff of  Sabbath Bloody Sabbath   which set the tone for the new material  Recorded at Morgan Studios in London by Mike Butcher and building off the stylistic changes introduced on Volume 4  new songs incorporated synthesisers  strings  and complex arrangements  Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman was brought in as a session player  appearing on  Sabbra Cadabra   56  In November 1973  Black Sabbath released the critically acclaimed Sabbath Bloody Sabbath  For the first time in their career  the band began to receive favourable reviews in the mainstream press  with Gordon Fletcher of Rolling Stone calling the album  an extraordinarily gripping affair   and  nothing less than a complete success   57  Later reviewers such as Allmusic s Eduardo Rivadavia cite the album as a  masterpiece  essential to any heavy metal collection   while also displaying  a newfound sense of finesse and maturity   58  The album marked the band s fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the US  59  reaching number four on the UK charts  and number eleven in the US  The band began a world tour in January 1974  which culminated at the California Jam festival in Ontario  California on 6 April 1974  Attracting over 200 000 fans  Black Sabbath appeared alongside 1970s rock and pop giants Deep Purple  Eagles  Emerson  Lake  amp  Palmer  Rare Earth  Seals  amp  Crofts  Black Oak Arkansas  and Earth  Wind  amp  Fire  Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the US  exposing the band to a wider American audience  In the same year  the band shifted management  signing with notorious English manager Don Arden  The move caused a contractual dispute with Black Sabbath s former management  and while on stage in the US  Osbourne was handed a subpoena that led to two years of litigation  54  Black Sabbath began work on their sixth album in February 1975  again in England at Morgan Studios in Willesden  this time with a decisive vision to differ the sound from Sabbath  Bloody Sabbath   We could ve continued and gone on and on  getting more technical  using orchestras and everything else which we didn t particularly want to  We took a look at ourselves  and we wanted to do a rock album   Sabbath  Bloody Sabbath wasn t a rock album  really   60  Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher  Sabotage was released in July 1975  As with its precursor  the album initially saw favourable reviews  with Rolling Stone stating  Sabotage is not only Black Sabbath s best record since Paranoid  it might be their best ever   61  although later reviewers such as Allmusic noted that  the magical chemistry that made such albums as Paranoid and Volume 4 so special was beginning to disintegrate   62  Sabotage reached the top 20 in both the US and the UK  but was the band s first release not to achieve Platinum status in the US  only achieving Gold certification  63  Although the album s only single  Am I Going Insane  Radio   failed to chart  Sabotage features fan favourites such as  Hole in the Sky   and  Symptom of the Universe   62  Black Sabbath toured in support of Sabotage with openers Kiss  but were forced to cut the tour short in November 1975  following a motorcycle accident in which Osbourne ruptured a muscle in his back  In December 1975  the band s record companies released a Greatest hits album without input from the band  titled We Sold Our Soul for Rock  n  Roll  The album charted throughout 1976  eventually selling two million copies in the US  64   edit  Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die   1976 1979  Black Sabbath began work for their next album at Criteria Studios in Miami  Florida  in June 1976  To expand their sound  the band added keyboard player Gerry Woodruffe  who also had appeared to a less extent on Sabotage  Technical Ecstasy  released on 25 September 1976  was met with mixed reviews  For the first time the reviews did not become more favourable as time passed  two decades after its release Allmusic gave the album two stars  and noted that the band was  unravelling at an alarming rate   65  The album featured less of the doomy  ominous sound of previous efforts  and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs  Technical Ecstasy failed to reach the top 50 in the US  and was the band s second consecutive release not to achieve platinum status  although it was later certified gold in 1997  66  The album included  Dirty Women   which remains a live staple  as well as Bill Ward s first lead vocal on the song  It s Alright   65  Touring in support of Technical Ecstasy began in November 1976  with openers Boston and Ted Nugent in the US  and completed in Europe with AC DC in April 1977  30  In November 1977  while in rehearsal for their next album  and just days before the band was set to enter the studio  Ozzy Osbourne quit the band   The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me   Osbourne said   I was doing it for the sake of what we could get out of the record company  just to get fat on beer and put a record out   67  Former Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown vocalist Dave Walker was brought into rehearsals in October 1977  and the band began working on new songs  33  Black Sabbath made their first and only appearance with Walker on vocals  playing an early version of the song  Junior s Eyes  on the BBC Television program  Look  Hear    30  Tony Iommi in 2005  Osbourne initially set out to form a solo project  which featured ex Dirty tricks members John Frazer Binnie  Terry Horbury  and Andy Bierne  As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978  Osbourne had a change of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath   Three days before we were due to go into the studio  Ozzy wanted to come back to the band   Iommi explained   He wouldn t sing any of the stuff we d written with the other guy  so it made it very difficult  We went into the studio with basically no songs  We d write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night  It was so difficult  like a conveyor belt  because you couldn t get time to reflect on stuff   Is this right  Is this working properly   It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick   67  The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto  Canada  writing and recording what would become Never Say Die    It took quite a long time   Iommi said   We were getting really drugged out  doing a lot of dope  We d go down to the sessions  and have to pack up because we were too stoned  we d have to stop  Nobody could get anything right  we were all over the place  everybody s playing a different thing  We d go back and sleep it off  and try again the next day   67  The album was released in September 1978  reaching number twelve in the UK  and number 69 in the US  Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic stating two decades after its release that the album s  unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band s tense personnel problems and drug abuse   68  The album featured the singles  Never Say Die  and  Hard Road   both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK  and the band made their second appearance on the Top of the Pops  performing  Never Say Die   It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US  69  Touring in support of Never Say Die  began in May 1978 with openers Van Halen  Reviewers called Black Sabbath s performance  tired and uninspired   a stark contrast to the  youthful  performance of Van Halen  who were touring the world for the first time  30  The band filmed a performance at the Hammersmith Odeon in June 1978  which was later released on DVD as Never Say Die  The final show of the tour  and Osbourne s last appearance with the band  until later reunions  was in Albuquerque  New Mexico on 11 December  Following the tour  Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles and again rented a house in Bel Air  where they spent nearly a year working on material for the next album  With pressure from the record label  and frustrations with Osbourne s lack of ideas coming to a head  Tony made the decision to fire Ozzy Osbourne in 1979   At that time  Ozzy had come to an end   Iommi said   We were all doing a lot of drugs  a lot of coke  a lot of everything  and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time  We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening  It was like  Rehearse today  No  we ll do it tomorrow   It really got so bad that we didn t do anything  It just fizzled out   70  Drummer Bill Ward  who was close with Osbourne  was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer   I hope I was professional  I might not have been  actually  When I m drunk I am horrible  I am horrid   Ward said   Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath  We were destined to destroy each other  The band were toxic  very toxic   71   edit  Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules  1979 1982  Sharon Arden  later Sharon Osbourne   daughter of Black Sabbath manager Don Arden  suggested former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio to replace Ozzy Osbourne in 1979  Dio officially joined in June  and the band began writing their next album  With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne s  Dio s addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath s sound   They were totally different altogether   Iommi explains   Not only voice wise  but attitude wise  Ozzy was a great showman  but when Dio came in  it was a different attitude  a different voice and a different musical approach  as far as vocals  Dio would sing across the riff  whereas Ozzy would follow the riff  like in  Iron Man   Ronnie came in and gave us another angle on writing   72  Dio s term in Black Sabbath has also brought the  metal horns  gesture to popularity in heavy metal subculture  Dio adopted it  originally a superstitious move to ward off the  evil eye   as a greeting to the audience  Since then  the gesture became widely copied by fans and other musicians alike  73  74  Geezer Butler temporarily left the band in September 1979  and was initially replaced by Geoff Nicholls of Quartz on bass  The new line up returned to Criteria Studios in November to begin recording work  with Butler returning to the band in January 1980  and Nicholls moving to keyboards  Produced by Martin Birch  Heaven and Hell  was released on 25 April 1980  to critical acclaim  Over a decade after its release Allmusic said the album was  one of Sabbath s finest records  the band sounds reborn and re energised throughout   75 Heaven and Hell peaked at number 9 in the UK  and number 28 in the US  the band s highest charting album since Sabotage  The album eventually sold a million copies in the US  76  and the band embarked on an extensive world tour  making their first live appearance with Dio in Germany on 17 April 1980  Black Sabbath toured the US throughout 1980 with Blue  yster Cult on the  Black and Blue  tour  with a show at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale  New York filmed and released theatrically in 1981 as Black and Blue  77  On 26 July 1980  the band played to 75 000 fans at a sold out Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles with Journey  Cheap Trick  and Molly Hatchet  78  The next day  the band appeared at the 1980 Day on the Green at Oakland Coliseum  While on tour  Black Sabbath s former label in England issued a live album culled from a seven year old performance  entitled Live at Last without any input from the band  The album reached number five on the British charts  and saw the re release of  Paranoid  as a single  which reached the top 20  33  Vocalist Ronnie James Dio On 18 August 1980  after a show in Minneapolis  Minnesota  Bill Ward quit the band   It was intolerable for me to get on the stage without Ozzy  And I drank 24 hours a day  my alcoholism accelerated   Geezer Butler stated that after the show  Bill came in drunk  talking about the things where   He might as well be a martian   Bill then got angry  and decided to pack his things  and get on a bus to leave  The group then brought in drummer Vinny Appice to replace Ward  The band completed the Heaven and Hell world tour in February 1981  and returned to the studio to begin work on their next album  79  Black Sabbath s second studio album produced by Martin Birch and featuring Ronnie James Dio as vocalist  Mob Rules was released in October 1981  to be well received by fans  but less so by the critics  Rolling Stone reviewer J  D  Considine gave the album one star  claiming  Mob Rules finds the band as dull witted and flatulent as ever   80  Like most of the band s earlier work  time helped to improve the opinions of the music press  a decade after its release  Allmusic s Eduardo Rivadavia called Mob Rules  a magnificent record   81  The album was certified gold  82  and reached the top 20 on the UK charts  The album s title track  The Mob Rules   which was recorded at John Lennon s old house in England  79  also featured in the 1981 animated film Heavy Metal  although the film version is an alternate take  and differs from the album version  79  Unhappy with the quality of 1980 s Live at Last  the band recorded another live album titled Live Evil during the Mob Rules world tour  across the United States in Dallas  San Antonio  and Seattle  in 1982  83  During the mixing process for the album  Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio  Misinformed by their then current mixing engineer  Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals  84  In addition  Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork  85   Ronnie wanted more say in things   Iommi said   And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in  Live Evil is when it all fell apart  Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing  and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn t know what to do  because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another  At the end of the day  we just said   That s it  the band is over    86   When it comes time for the vocal  nobody tells me what to do  Nobody  Because they re not as good as me  so I do what I want to do   Dio later said   I refuse to listen to Live Evil  because there are too many problems  If you look at the credits  the vocals and drums are listed off to the side  Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony  and how many there are of me and Vinny   87  Ronnie James Dio left Black Sabbath in November 1982 to start his own band  and took drummer Vinny Appice with him  Live Evil was released in January 1983  but was overshadowed by Ozzy Osbourne s Speak of the Devil  a platinum selling 88  live album that contained only Black Sabbath songs  released five months earlier  30   edit  Born Again  1983 1984  The two original members left  Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler  began auditioning new singers for the band s next release  Samson s Nicky Moore  and Lone Star s John Sloman were considered  The band settled on former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan to replace Ronnie James Dio in December 1982  33  89  While the project was not initially set to be called Black Sabbath  pressures from the record label forced the group to retain the name  89  The band entered The Manor Studios in Shipton on Cherwell  Oxfordshire  in June 1983 with a returned and newly sober Bill Ward on drums  89 Born Again was panned upon release by critics  Despite the negative reception of the album  it reached number four on the UK charts  and number 39 in the US  53  Even a decade after its release Allmusic s Eduardo Rivadavia called the album  dreadful   noting that  Gillan s bluesy style and humorous lyrics were completely incompatible with the lords of doom and gloom   90  Although he performed on the album  drummer Bill Ward was unable to tour because of the pressures of the road  and quit the band after the commencement of the Born Again album   I fell apart with the idea of touring   Ward later said   I got so much fear behind touring  I didn t talk about the fear  I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake   91  Ward was replaced by former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan for the Born Again  83   84 world tour  89   often unofficially referred to as the  Feigh Death Sabbath  83    84  World Tour  which began in Europe with Diamond Head  and later in the US with Quiet Riot and Night Ranger  The band headlined the 1983 Reading Festival  adding the Deep Purple song  Smoke on the Water  to their set list  The tour in support of Born Again included a giant set of the Stonehenge monument  In a move that would be later parodied in the mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap  the band made a mistake in ordering the set piece  As Geezer Butler later explained  We had Sharon Osbourne s dad  Don Arden  managing us  He came up with the idea of having the stage set be Stonehenge  He wrote the dimensions down and gave it to our tour manager  He wrote it down in meters but he meant to write it down in feet  The people who made it saw fifteen meters instead of fifteen feet  It was 45 feet high and it wouldn t fit on any stage anywhere so we just had to leave it in the storage area  It cost a fortune to make but there was not a building on earth that you could fit it into  92   edit  Hiatus and Seventh Star  1984 1986  Following the completion of the Born Again tour in March 1984  vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re join Deep Purple  which was reforming after a long hiatus  Bevan left at the same time  and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like  hired help  by Iommi  The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato  The new line up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984  and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October  Unhappy with the results  the band parted ways with Donato shortly after  33  Disillusioned with the band s revolving line up  bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band   When Ian Gillan took over that was the end of it for me   Butler later said   I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left  When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album  After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros  and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn t have a leg to stand on  I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it  That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it   92  Following Butler s exit  sole remaining original member Tony Iommi put Black Sabbath on hiatus  and began work on a solo album with long time Sabbath keyboardist Geoff Nicholls  While working on new material  the original Black Sabbath line up were offered a spot at Bob Geldof s Live Aid benefit concert  the band agreed  performing at the Philadelphia show  on 13 July 1985  30  89  The event marked the first time the original line up appeared on stage since 1978  and also featured reunions of The Who and Led Zeppelin  93  Returning to his solo work  Iommi enlisted bassist Dave Spitz and drummer Eric Singer  and initially intended to use multiple singers  including Rob Halford of Judas Priest  ex Deep Purple and Trapeze vocalist Glenn Hughes  and ex Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio  but this plan didn t work as he forcasted  89   We were going to use different vocalists on the album  guest vocalists  but it was so difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies  Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album   94  The band spent the remainder of the year in the studio  recording what would become Seventh Star  Warner Bros  refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release  instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath  95  Pressured by the band s manager  Don Arden  the two compromised and released the album as  Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi  in January 1986  96   It opened up a whole can of worms really   Iommi explained   because I think if we could have done it as a solo album  it would have been accepted a lot more   97 Seventh Star  which sounded little like a Black Sabbath album  incorporated more hard rock elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene  and was panned by the critics of the era  although later reviewers such as Allmusic gave the album favourable reviews  calling the album  often misunderstood and underrated   95  The new line up rehearsed for six weeks  preparing for a full world tour  although the band were eventually forced to use the Black Sabbath name   I was into the  Tony Iommi project   but I wasn t into the Black Sabbath moniker   Hughes said   The idea of being in Black Sabbath didn t appeal to me whatsoever  Glenn Hughes singing in Black Sabbath is like James Brown singing in Metallica  It wasn t gonna work   94  98  Just four days before the start of the tour  vocalist Glenn Hughes got into a bar fight with the band s production manager John Downing which splintered the singer s orbital bone  The injury interfered with Hughes  ability to sing  and the band brought in vocalist Ray Gillen to continue the tour with W A S P  and Anthrax  although nearly half of the US dates would eventually be cancelled because of poor ticket sales  99  One vocalist whose status is disputed  both inside and outside Black Sabbath  is Christian evangelist and former Joshua frontman  Jeff Fenholt  Fenholt has insisted that he was a singer in Black Sabbath between January and May 1985  30  Tony Iommi has never confirmed this  as he was working on a solo release that was later named as a Sabbath album  Fenholt gives a detailed account of his time with Iommi and Sabbath in Garry Sharpe Young s book Sabbath Bloody Sabbath  The Battle for Black Sabbath  100   edit  The Eternal Idol  Headless Cross and TYR  1986 1990  Black Sabbath began work on new material in October 1986 at Air Studios in Montserrat with producer Jeff Glixman  The recording was fraught with problems from the beginning  as Glixman left after the initial sessions  and was replaced by producer Vic Coppersmith Heaven  Bassist Dave Spitz quit over  personal issues   and ex Rainbow bassist Bob Daisley was brought in  Daisley re recorded all of the bass tracks  and wrote the album s lyrics  but before the album was complete  he left to join Gary Moore s backing band  taking drummer Eric Singer with him  33  After problems with second producer Coppersmith Heaven  the band returned to Morgan Studios in England in January 1987 to work with new producer Chris Tsangarides  While working in the UK  new vocalist Ray Gillen abruptly left Black Sabbath to form Blue Murder with John Sykes  The band enlisted ex Alliance vocalist Tony Martin to re record Gillen s tracks  and former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan to complete a few percussion overdubs  30  Before the release of the new album  Black Sabbath accepted an offer to play six shows at Sun City  South Africa during the apartheid era  The band drew criticism from activists and artists involved with Artists United Against Apartheid  who had been boycotting South Africa since 1985  101  Drummer Bev Bevan refused to play the shows  and was replaced by Terry Chimes  formerly of The Clash  30  After nearly a year in production  The Eternal Idol was released on 8 December 1987 and ignored by contemporary reviewers  On line internet era reviews were mixed  Allmusic said that  Martin s powerful voice added new fire  to the band  and the album contained  some of Iommi s heaviest riffs in years   102 Blender gave the album two stars  claiming the album was  Black Sabbath in name only   103  The album would stall at No  66 in the UK  while peaking at 168 in the US  53  The band toured in support of Eternal Idol in Germany  Italy and for the first time  Greece  Unfortunately  in part because of a backlash from promoters over the South Africa incident  other European shows were cancelled  104  Bassist Dave Spitz left the band shortly before the tour  and was replaced by Jo Burt  formerly of Virginia Wolf  Following the poor commercial performance of The Eternal Idol  Black Sabbath were dropped by Vertigo Records and Warner Bros  Records  and signed with I R S  Records  30  The band took time off in 1988  returning in August to begin work on their next album  As a result of the recording troubles with Eternal Idol  Tony Iommi opted to produce the band s next album himself   It was a completely new start   Iommi said   I had to rethink the whole thing  and decided that we needed to build up some credibility again   105  Iommi enlisted ex Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell  long time keyboardist Nicholls and session bassist Laurence Cottle  and rented a  very cheap studio in England   105  Black Sabbath released Headless Cross in April 1989  and again ignored by contemporary reviewers  Eventually  Allmusic would give the album four stars  calling Headless Cross  the finest non Ozzy or Dio Black Sabbath album   106  Anchored by the number 62 charting single  Headless Cross   the album reached number 31 on the UK charts  and number 115 in the US  53 Queen guitarist Brian May  a good friend of Iommi s  played a guest solo on the song  When Death Calls   Following the album s release  the band added touring bassist Neil Murray  formerly of Whitesnake  Gary Moore s backing band  and Vow Wow  33  The ill fated Headless Cross U S  tour began in May 1989 with openers Kingdom Come and Silent Rage  but because of poor ticket sales  the tour was cancelled after just eight shows  30  The European leg of the tour began in September  where the band were enjoying chart success  After a string of Japanese shows  the band embarked on a 23 date Russian tour with Girlschool  Black Sabbath was one of the first bands to tour Russia  after Mikhail Gorbachev opened the country to western acts for the first time in 1989  104  The band returned to the studio in February 1990 to record TYR  the follow up to Headless Cross  While not technically a concept album  some of the album s lyrical themes are loosely based on Norse mythology  30 TYR was released on 6 August 1990  and reached number 24 on the UK albums chart  but was the first Black Sabbath release not to break the Billboard 200 in the US  53  The album would receive mixed internet era reviews  with Allmusic noting that the band  mix myth with metal in a crushing display of musical synthesis   107  while Blender gave the album just one star  claiming that  Iommi continues to besmirch the Sabbath name with this unremarkable collection   108  The band toured in support of TYR with Circus of Power in Europe  but the final seven UK dates were cancelled because of poor ticket sales  109  For the first time in their career  the band s touring cycle did not include US dates  110   edit  Dehumanizer  1990 1992  Following a performance in 1990  both Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler  pictured  expressed interest in rejoining Black Sabbath While on his own Lock Up The Wolves US tour in August 1990  former Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio was joined on stage at the Minneapolis Forum by former Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler to perform  Neon Knights   Following the show  the two expressed interest in rejoining Black Sabbath  Butler convinced Iommi  who in turn broke up the current line up  dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray   I do regret that in a lot of ways   Iommi said   We were at a good point then  We decided to  reunite with Dio  and I don t even know why  really  There s the financial aspect  but that wasn t it  I seemed to think maybe we could recapture something we had   105  Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler joined Tony Iommi and Cozy Powell in the fall of 1990 to begin working on the next Black Sabbath release  While rehearsing in November  Powell suffered a broken hip when his horse died  falling on the drummer s legs  111  Unable to complete work on the album  Powell was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice  reuniting the Mob Rules era line up  and the band entered the studio with producer Reinhold Mack  The year long recording process was plagued with problems  primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio  and some songs were re written multiple times  112   Dehumanizer took a long time  it was just hard work   Iommi said   We took too long on it  that album cost us a million dollars  which is bloody ridiculous   105  Dio later recalled the album as difficult  but worth the effort   It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves  but I think that s why it works   he said   Sometimes you need that kind of tension  or else you end up making the Christmas album   113  The resulting album  Dehumanizer was released on 22 June 1992  In the US  the album was released on 30 June 1992 by Reprise Records  as Ronnie James Dio and his namesake band were still under contract with the label at the time  While the album received mixed reviews  111  114  it was the band s biggest commercial success in a decade  33  Anchored by the top 40 rock radio single  TV Crimes   the album peaked at number 44 on the Billboard 200  33  The album also featured the song  Time Machine   a version of which had been recorded for the 1992 film Wayne s World  Additionally  the perception by many fans of a return of some semblance of the  real  Black Sabbath provided the band with some much needed momentum  Black Sabbath began touring in support of Dehumanizer in July 1992 with Testament  Danzig  Prong  and Exodus  While on tour  former vocalist Ozzy Osbourne announced his first retirement  and invited Black Sabbath to open for his solo band at the final two shows of his No More Tours tour in Costa Mesa  California  The band agreed  aside from vocalist Ronnie James Dio  who said  I was told in the middle of the tour that we would be opening for Ozzy in Los Angeles  And I said   No  Sorry  I have more pride than that   A lot of bad things were being said from camp to camp  and it created this horrible schism  So by  the band  agreeing to play the shows in L A  with Ozzy  that  to me  spelled out reunion  And that obviously meant the doom of that particular project  113  Dio quit Black Sabbath following a show in Oakland  California on 13 November 1992  one night before the band were set to appear at Osbourne s retirement show  Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford stepped in at the last minute  performing two nights with the band  115  Iommi and Butler also joined Osbourne and former drummer Bill Ward on stage for the first time since 1985 s Live Aid concert  performing a brief set of Black Sabbath songs   edit  Cross Purposes and Forbidden  1993 1996  Drummer Vinny Appice left the band following the reunion show to join Ronnie James Dio s solo band  later appearing on Dio s Strange Highways and Angry Machines  Iommi and Butler enlisted former Rainbow drummer Bobby Rondinelli  and reinstated former vocalist Tony Martin  The band returned to the studio to work on new material  although the project was not originally intended to be released under the Black Sabbath name  As Geezer Butler explains  It wasn t even supposed to be a Sabbath album  I wouldn t have even done it under the pretence of Sabbath  That was the time when the original band were talking about getting back together for a reunion tour  Tony and myself just went in with a couple of people  did an album just to have  while the reunion tour was  supposedly  going on  It was like an Iommi Butler project album  116  Under pressure from their record label  the band released their seventeenth studio album  Cross Purposes  on 8 February 1994  under the Black Sabbath name  The album received mixed reviews  with Blender giving the album two stars  calling Soundgarden s 1994 album Superunknown  a far better Sabbath album than this by the numbers potboiler   117  Allmusic s Bradley Torreano called Cross Purposes  the first album since Born Again that actually sounds like a real Sabbath record   118  The album just missed the Top 40 in the UK reaching number 41  and also reached 122 on the Billboard 200 in the US  Cross Purposes contained the song  Evil Eye   which was co written by Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen  although uncredited because of record label restrictions  30  Touring in support of Cross Purposes began in February with Morbid Angel and Mot rhead in the US  The band filmed a live performance at the Hammersmith Apollo on 13 April 1994  which was released on VHS accompanied by a CD  entitled Cross Purposes Live  After the European tour with Cathedral and Godspeed in June 1994  drummer Bobby Rondinelli quit the band and was replaced by original Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward for five shows in South America  Following the touring cycle for Cross Purposes  bassist Geezer Butler quit the band for the second time   I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album  and I much preferred the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing   116  Butler formed a solo project called GZR  and released Plastic Planet in 1995  The album contained the song  Giving Up the Ghost   which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name  with the lyrics  You plagiarised and parodied   the magic of our meaning   a legend in your own mind   left all your friends behind   you can t admit that you re wrong   the spirit is dead and gone  119  Following Butler s departure  newly returned drummer Bill Ward once again left the band  Iommi reinstated former members Neil Murray on bass  and Cozy Powell on drums  effectively reuniting the Tyr line up  The band enlisted Body Count guitarist Ernie C to produce the new album  which was recorded in London in the fall of 1994  The album featured a guest vocal on  Illusion of Power  by Body Count vocalist Ice T  120  The resulting Forbidden  was released on 8 June 1995  but failed to chart in the US or the UK  121  122  The album was widely panned by critics  Allmusic s Bradley Torreano said  with boring songs  awful production  and uninspired performances  this is easily avoidable for all but the most enthusiastic fan   123  while Blender magazine called Forbidden  an embarrassment     the band s worst album   124  Black Sabbath embarked on a world tour in July 1995 with openers Mot rhead and Tiamat  but two months into the tour  drummer Cozy Powell left the band  citing health issues  and was replaced by former drummer Bobby Rondinelli  After completing Asian dates in December 1995  Tony Iommi put the band on hiatus  and began work on a solo album with former Black Sabbath vocalist Glenn Hughes  and former Judas Priest drummer Dave Holland  The album was not officially released following its completion  although a widely traded bootleg called Eighth Star surfaced soon after  The album was officially released in 2004 as The 1996 DEP Sessions  with Holland s drums re recorded by session drummer Jimmy Copley  125  In 1997  Tony Iommi disbanded the current line up to officially reunite with Ozzy Osbourne and the original Black Sabbath line up  Vocalist Tony Martin claimed that an original line up reunion had been in the works since the band s brief reunion at Ozzy Osbourne s 1992 Costa Mesa show  and that the band released subsequent albums to fulfill their record contract with I R S  records  Martin later recalled Forbidden as a  filler album that got the band out of the label deal  rid of the singer  and into the reunion  However I wasn t privy to that information at the time   126 I R S  Records released a compilation album in 1996 to fulfill the band s contract  entitled The Sabbath Stones  which featured songs from Born Again to Forbidden   edit  Osbourne Reunion  1997 2006  Ozzy Osbourne in 2007  In the summer of 1997  Tony Iommi  Geezer Butler  and Ozzy Osbourne officially reunited to co headline the Ozzfest festival tour along side Osbourne s solo band  The line up featured Osbourne s drummer Mike Bordin filling in for Bill Ward  who was unable to participate because of previous commitments with his solo project  The Bill Ward Band  33  In December 1997  the group was joined by Ward  marking the first reunion of the original four members since Osbourne s 1992  retirement show   The original line up recorded two shows at the Birmingham NEC  which were released as the double live album Reunion on 20 October 1998  Reunion reached number eleven on the Billboard 200  53  and went platinum in the US  33  127  The album spawned the single  Iron Man   which won Black Sabbath its first and only Grammy award in 2000 for Best Metal Performance  30 years after the song was originally released  Reunion also featured two new studio tracks   Psycho Man  and  Selling My Soul   both of which cracked the top 20 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart  53  Shortly before the band embarked on a European tour in the summer of 1998  drummer Bill Ward suffered a heart attack and was temporarily replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice  128  Ward returned in time for the US tour with openers Pantera  which began in January 1999 and continued through the summer  headlining the annual Ozzfest tour  33  Following the Ozzfest appearances  the band was put on hiatus while members worked on solo material  Tony Iommi released his first official solo album  Iommi  in 2000  while Osbourne continued work on his next solo release  Down to Earth  Black Sabbath returned to the studio to work on new material with all four original members and producer Rick Rubin in the spring of 2001  33  but the sessions were halted when Osbourne was called away to finish tracks for his solo album in the summer of 2001  129   It just came to an end   Iommi said   We didn t go any further  and it s a shame because  the songs  were really good   130  Iommi commented on the difficulty getting all of the band members together to work on material  It s quite different recording now  We ve all done so much in between  In  the early  days there was no mobile phone ringing every five seconds  When we first started  we had nothing  We all worked for the same thing  Now everybody has done so many other things  It s great fun and we all have a good chat  but it s just different  trying to put an album together  130  In March 2002  Ozzy Osbourne s Emmy winning reality TV show The Osbournes debuted on MTV  and quickly became a worldwide hit  33  The show introduced Osbourne to a broader audience and to capitalise  the band s back catalogue label  Sanctuary Records released a double live album Past Lives  which featured concert material recorded in the  70s  including the previously unofficial Live at Last album  The band remained on hiatus until the summer of 2004 when they returned to headline Ozzfest 2004 and 2005  In November 2005  Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame  131  and in March 2006  after eleven years of eligibility  the band were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  132  At the awards ceremony Metallica played two Black Sabbath songs   Hole in the Sky  and  Iron Man  in tribute to the band  133   edit  The Dio Years and Heaven  amp  Hell  2006 2010  For more details on this topic  see Heaven  amp  Hell  band   Vinny Appice performing a drum solo with Heaven  amp  Hell at Spodek in Katowice on 20 June 2007 While Ozzy Osbourne was working on new solo album material in 2006  Rhino Records released Black Sabbath  The Dio Years  a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio  For the release  Iommi  Butler  Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath  The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007  reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200  while the single  The Devil Cried  reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart  53  Pleased with the results  Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the Heaven and Hell era line up for a world tour  While the line up of Osbourne  Butler  Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath  the new line up opted to call themselves Heaven  amp  Hell  after the album of the same name  to avoid confusion  Drummer Bill Ward was initially set to participate  but dropped out before the tour began due to musical differences with  a couple of the band members   134  He was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice  effectively reuniting the line up that had featured on the Mob Rules and Dehumanizer albums  Heaven  amp  Hell toured the US with openers Megadeth and Machine Head  and recorded a live album and DVD in New York on 30 March 2007  entitled Live from Radio City Music Hall  In November 2007  Dio confirmed that the band had plans to record a new studio album  135  which was recorded in the following year  In April 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box

Sabbath albums  was supported by the Metal Masters Tour  In 2009  the band announced the name of their debut studio album  The Devil You Know  released on 28 April  137  In March 2010  Black Sabbath announced that along with Metallica they would be releasing a limited edition single together to celebrate Record Store Day  It was released on 17 April 2010  138  On 26 May 2009 Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name  Iommi noted that he has been the only band member for the full forty one years of the band  and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s  therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band  Although  in the suit  Osbourne is seeking 50  ownership of the trademark  he has said that he hopes the proceedings will lead to equal ownership among the four original members  139  On 16 May 2010  Ronnie James Dio passed away after a battle against stomach cancer  140  In June 2010  the legal battle between Ozzy Osbourne and Tony Iommi over the trademarking of the Black Sabbath name ended  but the terms of the settlement have not been disclosed  141   edit  Reunion  2010 present  In a January 2010 interview while promoting his biography I Am Ozzy  Osbourne stated that although he was not ruling out a reunion  he was doubtful there would be a reunion with all original members  Osbourne stated   I m not gonna say I ve written  a reunion  out forever  but right now I don t think there is any chance  But who knows what the future holds for me  If it s my destiny  fine   Osbourne compares it to going back to an ex girlfriend  stating   I had girlfriends when I was younger and I would go   Oh  I would really like to go back with Shirley   and then you do and you go to yourself   What the fuck was I thinking    142  According to Geezer Butler  there would be no Black Sabbath reunion with Osbourne in 2011  as Osbourne would be touring with his solo band  143  On 15 August 2011  an article on music site MetalTalk seemed to confirm an original line up Black Sabbath reunion  stating that Osbourne  Iommi  Butler and Ward had decided to reunite on 1 August and on 15 August  gathered in their secret rehearsal studio  and began the process of getting the show back on the road   with a look to a  possible new album   144  However  two days later  Tony Iommi posted on his official website that the Birmingham journalist who he had spoken with about the possible reunion exaggerated the truth  Iommi was merely speculating and no actual plans of a reunion were made  145  Black Sabbath hosted a private announcement ceremony on 11 November 2011 at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood  California  Hosted by former Black Flag vocalist Henry Rollins  the event featured all four original Black Sabbath band members  146  147  148  149  At the event  Black Sabbath announced they would be officially reuniting following months of rumours  The reunion was said to feature an appearance at the 2012 Download Festival  and a newly recorded studio album by producer Rick Rubin expected to be released in late 2012  11  When Rollins asked the band why they chose to reunite now  Iommi responded  It s now or never  We get along great  Everything s really good   11  Butler also commented that the new material sounds like the  old Sabbath style and sound   11  On 18 November the band announced a string of European tour dates to take place in May and June 2012  150  On 9 January 2012 it was announced Tony Iommi had been diagnosed with the early stages of lymphoma  151  which was not expected to impede the group s activity  On 2 February 2012  Ward publicly announced that he would not participate in the Black Sabbath reunion unless he was given a  signable contract   The following day  the other group members announced they had  no choice but to continue recording without him   but also said  our door is always open  for Ward to return to the band  13  In February 2012  the band announced that they will not continue the world tour but will play the Download festival in June 2012  Instead of Black Sabbath  the tour will feature Osbourne and a revolving line up of guest musicians  billed as  Ozzy and Friends     edit  Musical style Although Black Sabbath have gone through many line ups and stylistic changes  their original sound focused on ominous lyrics and doomy music  27  often making use of the musical tritone  also called the  devil s interval   26  Standing in stark contrast to popular music of the early 1970s  Black Sabbath s dark sound was dismissed by rock critics of the era  33  Much like many of their early heavy metal contemporaries  the band received virtually no airplay on rock radio  152  As the band s primary songwriter  Tony Iommi wrote the majority of Black Sabbath s music  while Osbourne would write vocal melodies  and bassist Geezer Butler would write lyrics  The process was sometimes frustrating for Iommi  who often felt pressured to come up with new material   If I didn t come up with anything  nobody would do anything   54  On Iommi s influence  Osbourne later said  Black Sabbath never used to write a structured song  There d be a long intro that would go into a jazz piece  then go all folky    and it worked  Tony Iommi and I have said this a zillion times should be up there with the greats  He can pick up a guitar  play a riff  and you say   He s gotta be out now  he can t top that   Then you come back  and I bet you a billion dollars  he d come up with a riff that d knock your fucking socks off  153  Early Black Sabbath albums feature tuned down guitars  which contributed to the dark feel of the music  33  In 1966  before forming Black Sabbath  guitarist Tony Iommi suffered an accident while working in a sheet metal factory  losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand  Iommi almost gave up music  but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt  a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers  154  Inspired by Reinhardt  Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips  The guitarist began using lighter strings  and detuning his guitar  to better grip the strings with his prosthesis  a move which inadvertently gave the music a darker feel  154  Early in the band s history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings  including C  tuning  or 3 semitones down  before settling on E  D  tuning  or a half step down from standard tuning  155   edit  Legacy Black Sabbath are one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time  The band helped to create the genre with ground breaking releases such as Paranoid  an album that Rolling Stone magazine said  changed music forever   156  and called the band  The Beatles of heavy metal   157 Time Magazine called Paranoid  the birthplace of heavy metal   placing it in their Top 100 Albums of All Time  158  MTV placed Black Sabbath at number one on their Top Ten Heavy Metal Bands 159  and VH1 placed them at number two on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock  160  VH1 ranked Black Sabbath s  Iron Man  the number one song on their 40 Greatest Metal Songs countdown  161  Allmusic s William Ruhlmann said  Black Sabbath has been so influential in the development of heavy metal rock music as to be a defining force in the style  The group took the blues rock sound of late  60s acts like Cream  Blue Cheer  and Vanilla Fudge to its logical conclusion  slowing the tempo  accentuating the bass  and emphasising screaming guitar solos and howled vocals full of lyrics expressing mental anguish and macabre fantasies  If their predecessors clearly came out of an electrified blues tradition  Black Sabbath took that tradition in a new direction  and in so doing helped give birth to a musical style that continued to attract millions of fans decades later  33   edit  Influence and innovation Black Sabbath have influenced many acts including Iron Maiden  162 Slayer  19 Death  19 Korn  19 Mayhem  19 Venom  19 Judas Priest  163 Guns N  Roses  163 Metallica  19 Alice in Chains  164 Anthrax  165 Disturbed  166 Opeth  167 Pantera  19 Megadeth  168 The Smashing Pumpkins  169 Slipknot  170  the Foo Fighters  171 Fear Factory  172 Candlemass  173  and Godsmack  174  Two gold selling tribute albums have been released  Nativity in Black Volume 1  amp  2  including covers by Sepultura  White Zombie  Type O Negative  Faith No More  Machine Head  Primus  System of a Down and Monster Magnet  175  176  Metallica s Lars Ulrich  who  along with bandmate James Hetfield inducted Black Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006  said  Black Sabbath is and always will be synonymous with heavy metal   177  while Hetfield said  Sabbath got me started on all that evil sounding shit  and it s stuck with me  Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff   178  Ex Guns N  Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album   There s just something about that whole record that  when you re a kid and you re turned onto it  it s like a whole different world  It just opens up your mind to another dimension   Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience  very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time  Tony s playing style   doesn t matter whether it s off  Paranoid  or if it s off  Heaven and Hell    it s very distinctive   178 Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said  I always get the question in every interview I do   What are your top five metal albums   I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums   178 Lamb of God s Chris Adler said   If anybody who plays heavy metal says that they weren t influenced by Black Sabbath s music  then I think that they re lying to you  I think all heavy metal music was  in some way  influenced by what Black Sabbath did   179 Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford commented   They were and still are a groundbreaking band  you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30 odd years ago  And that s because great music has a timeless ability  To me  Sabbath are in the same league as the Beatles or Mozart  They re on the leading edge of something extraordinary   180  On Black Sabbath s standing  Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello states   The heaviest  scariest  coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer  You can hear the despair and menace of the working class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick ass  evil groove  Their arrival ground hippy  flower power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come   180  In addition to being pioneers of heavy metal  they also have been credited for laying the foundations for heavy metal subgenres thrash metal  181 stoner rock  182 sludge metal  183  184 black metal  185  and doom metal  185  Black Sabbath were also one of the earliest to turn gothic music into a genre  185  Culturally  Black Sabbath have exerted a huge influence in both television and literature and have in many cases become synonymous with heavy metal  In the film Almost Famous  Lester Bangs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band  plot point one  with the immortal line   Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath   Contemporary music and arts publication Trebuchet Magazine has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece  500 words  on Black Sabbath as a means of proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject  186   edit  Members Main
