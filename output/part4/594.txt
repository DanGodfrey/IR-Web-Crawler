Mississippi River is the largest river system in North America  3  4  Flowing entirely in the United States  it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for 2 530 miles  4 070 km  5  to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico  With its many tributaries  the Mississippi s watershed drains all or parts of 31 U S  states between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains and even reaches into southern Canada  The Mississippi ranks fourth longest and tenth largest among the world s rivers  Native Americans lived along the Mississippi and its tributaries  Most were hunter gatherers or herders  but some  such as the Mound builders  formed prolific agricultural societies  The arrival of Europeans in the 1500s forever changed the native way of life as first explorers  then settlers  ventured into the basin in increasing numbers  The river served first as barrier   forming borders for New Spain  New France  and the early United States   then as vital transportation artery and communications link  In the 19th century  during the height of Manifest Destiny  the Mississippi and several western tributaries  most notably the Missouri  formed pathways for pioneers partaking in the western expansion of the United States  Formed from thick layers of this river s silt deposits  the Mississippi River Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions of the country  which resulted in the river s storied steamboat era  During the American Civil War  the Mississippi s capture by Union forces marked a turning point towards victory because of this very importance as a route of trade and travel  not least to the Confederacy  Because of substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and barges that have supplanted riverboats  the decades following the 1900s saw massive engineering works applied to the river system  such as the often in combination construction of levees  locks and dams  Since modern development of the basin began  the Mississippi has also seen its share of pollution and environmental problems   most notably large volumes of agricultural runoff  which has led to the Gulf of Mexico dead zone off the Delta  In recent years  the river has shown a steady shift towards the Atchafalaya River channel in the Delta  a course change would prove disastrous to seaports such as New Orleans  A system of dikes and gates has  so far  held the Mississippi at bay but  due to fluvial processes  the shift becomes more likely each year  Contents 1 Name 2 Physical geography 2 1 River course 2 1 1 Upper Mississippi 2 1 2 Middle

External links  edit  Name In addition to historical traditions shown by names  there are at least two other measures of a river s identity  one being the largest branch  by water volume   and the other being the longest branch  Using the largest branch criterion  the Ohio would be the main branch of the Lower Mississippi  not the Middle and Upper Mississippi  Using the longest branch criterion  the Middle Mississippi Missouri Jefferson Beaverhead Red Rock Hellroaring Creek River would be the main branch  In either of these cases  the Upper Mississippi from St  Louis  Missouri  to Minnesota  despite its name  would not be part of the more significant branch  While the Missouri River  flowing from the confluence of the Jefferson  Madison and Gallatin Rivers to the Mississippi  is the longest continuously named river in the United States  4  the serial combination of Hellroaring Creek and the Red Rock  Beaverhead  Jefferson  Missouri  Middle Mississippi  and Lower Mississippi rivers  considered as one continuous waterway  is the longest river in North America and the third or fourth longest river in the world  Its length of at least 3 745 mi  6 027 km  citation needed  is exceeded only by the Nile  the Amazon  6  and perhaps the Yangtze River 7  among the longest rivers in the world  The source of this waterway is at Brower s Spring  8 800 feet  2 700 m  above sea level in southwestern Montana  along the Continental Divide outside Yellowstone National Park  The unifying name  Great American River  has been suggested for this multiple named waterway  citation needed  However  the names  Mississippi River  for the water course from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico   Missouri River  for its major western tributary  and  Ohio River  for its major eastern tributary are so well established that neither reassignment of names nor creation of novel names can be seriously considered as replacements for current usage  Furthermore  the north south course of the waterway commonly known as the Mississippi River is widely considered a convenient if approximate dividing line between the Eastern  Southern  and Midwestern United States and the Western U S   as exemplified by the Gateway Arch in St  Louis and the phrase  Trans Mississippi   used for example in the name of the 1898 Trans Mississippi Exposition held in Omaha  Nebraska   edit  Physical geography The geographical setting of the Mississippi River includes considerations of the course of the river itself  its watershed  its outflow  its prehistoric and historic course changes  and possibilities of future course changes  The New Madrid Seismic Zone along the river is also noteworthy  These various basic geographical aspects of the river in turn underlie its human history and present uses of the waterway and its adjacent lands   edit  River course The Mississippi River is divided into the Upper Mississippi  the Middle Mississippi  and the Lower Mississippi  with the Upper Mississippi upriver of its confluence with the Missouri River  the Middle Mississippi from there downriver to the Ohio River  and the Lower Mississippi from there downriver to the Gulf of Mexico  The Mississippi River is known as the Upper Mississippi from its headwaters to its confluence with the Missouri River at St  Louis  Missouri  The Upper Mississippi is divided into two sections  The headwaters  493 miles  793 km   from the source to Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis  Minnesota A navigable channel  formed by a series of man made lakes between Minneapolis and St  Louis  Missouri  664 miles  1 069 km  The source of the Upper Mississippi branch is traditionally accepted as Lake Itasca  1 475 feet  450 m  above sea level in Itasca State Park in Clearwater County  Minnesota  The name  Itasca  is a combination of the last four letters of the Latin word for truth  veritas  and the first two letters of the Latin word for head  caput   8  However  the lake is in turn fed by a number of smaller streams  of which one might be selected as the river s ultimate source  The beginning of the Mississippi River at Lake Itasca  2004  Mississippi Head of Navigation  Coon Rapids Dam  edit  Upper Mississippi From its origin at Lake Itasca to St  Louis  Missouri  the waterway s flow is moderated by 43 dams  Fourteen of these dams are located above Minneapolis in the headwaters region and serve multiple purposes  including power generation and recreation  The remaining 29 dams  beginning in downtown Minneapolis  all contain locks and were constructed to improve commercial navigation of the upper river  Taken as a whole these 43 dams significantly shape the geography and influence the ecology of the upper river  Beginning just below Saint Paul  Minnesota  and continuing throughout the upper and lower river  the Mississippi is further controlled by thousands of wing dikes that moderate the river s flow in order to maintain an open navigation channel and prevent the river from eroding its banks  The head of navigation on the Mississippi is the Coon Rapids Dam in Coon Rapids  Minnesota  Before its construction in 1913  steamboats could occasionally go upstream as far as Saint Cloud  Minnesota  depending on river conditions  The uppermost lock and dam on the Upper Mississippi River is the Upper St  Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in Minneapolis  Above the dam  the river s elevation is 799 feet  244 m   Below the dam  the river s elevation is 750 feet  230 m   This 49 foot  15 m  drop is the largest of all the Mississippi River locks and dams  The origin of the dramatic drop is a waterfall preserved adjacent to the lock under an apron of concrete  Saint Anthony Falls is the only true waterfall on the entire Mississippi River  The water elevation continues to drop steeply as it passes through the gorge carved by the waterfall  The Upper Mississippi features various natural and artificial lakes  with its widest point being Lake Winnibigoshish  near Grand Rapids  Minnesota  over 7 miles  11 km  across  Also of note is Lake Onalaska  created by Lock and Dam No  7   near La Crosse  Wisconsin  over 4 miles  6 4 km  wide  On the other hand  Lake Pepin is natural  formed due to the delta formed by the Chippewa River of Wisconsin as it enters the Upper Mississippi  it is more than 2 miles  3 2 km  wide  9  By the time the Upper Mississippi reaches Saint Paul  Minnesota  below Lock and Dam  1  it has dropped more than half its original elevation and is 687 feet  209 m  above sea level  From St  Paul to St  Louis  Missouri  the river elevation falls much more slowly  and is controlled and managed as a series of pools created by 26 locks and dams  10  The Upper Mississippi River is joined by the Minnesota River at Fort Snelling in the Twin Cities  the St  Croix River near Prescott  Wisconsin  the Cannon River near Red Wing  Minnesota  the Black  La Crosse  and Root rivers in La Crosse  Wisconsin  the Wisconsin River at Prairie du Chien  Wisconsin  the Rock River at the Quad Cities  the Iowa River near Wapello  Iowa  the Skunk River south of Burlington  Iowa  and the Des Moines River at Keokuk  Iowa  Other major tributaries of the Upper Mississippi include the Crow River in Minnesota  the Chippewa River in Wisconsin  the Maquoketa River and the Wapsipinicon River in Iowa  and the Big Muddy River and Illinois River  The Upper Mississippi is largely a multi thread stream with many bars and islands  From its confluence with the St  Croix River downstream to Dubuque  Iowa  the river is entrenched  with high bedrock bluffs lying on either side  The height of these bluffs decreases to the south of Dubuque  though they are still significant through Savanna  Illinois  This topography contrasts strongly with the Lower Mississippi  which is a meandering river in a broad  flat area  only rarely flowing alongside a bluff  as at Vicksburg  Mississippi   The confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers at Cairo  Illinois  the demarcation between the Middle and the Lower Mississippi River   edit  Middle Mississippi The Mississippi River is known as the Middle Mississippi from the Upper Mississippi River s confluence with the Missouri River at St  Louis  Missouri  for 190 miles  310 km  to its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo  Illinois  11  12  The Middle Mississippi is a relatively free flowing river  From St  Louis to the Ohio River confluence  the Middle Mississippi falls a total of 220 feet  67 m  over a distance of 180 miles  290 km  for an average rate of 1 2 feet per mile  23 cm km   At its confluence with the Ohio River  the Middle Mississippi is 315 feet  96 m  above sea level  Apart from the Missouri River  and the Kaskaskia River in Illinois  no major tributaries enter the Middle Mississippi River  Measured by length  the Middle Mississippi s primary branch is the Missouri River  not the Upper Mississippi  whether or not additional tributaries upstream are considered  Thus  by length  the main branch of the Mississippi River system at St  Louis can be considered to be the Missouri River  rather than the Upper Mississippi  By taking the longer branch at each significant fork  this continuous but multiply named waterway can be identified and measured  One name for it is the Lower  amp  Middle Mississippi Missouri Jefferson Beaverhead Red Rock Hellroaring Creek River  The name  Great American River  has also been suggested for this longest American waterway  citation needed   edit  Lower Mississippi Lower Mississippi River near New Orleans The Mississippi River is called the Lower Mississippi River from its confluence with the Ohio River to its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico  Measured by water volume  the Lower Mississippi s primary branch is the Ohio River  At the confluence of the Ohio and the Middle Mississippi  the Ohio is the bigger river  with its long term mean discharge at Cairo  Illinois being 281 500 cu ft s  7 970 m3 s   13  while the long term mean discharge of the Mississippi at Thebes  Illinois  just upriver from Cairo  is 208 200 cu ft s  5 900 m3 s   14  Thus  by volume  the main branch of the Mississippi River system at Cairo can be considered to be the Ohio River  and the Allegheny River further upstream   rather than the Middle Mississippi  In addition to the Ohio River  the major tributaries of the Lower Mississippi River are the White River  flowing in at the White River National Wildlife Refuge in east central Arkansas  the Arkansas River  joining the Mississippi at Arkansas Post  the Big Black River in Mississippi  the Yazoo River  meeting the Mississippi at Vicksburg  Mississippi  and the Red River in Louisiana  The widest point of the Mississippi River is in the Lower Mississippi portion where it exceeds 1 mile  1 6 km  in width in several places  Due to deliberate water diversion at the Old River Control Structure in Louisiana  the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana is now a major distributary of the Mississippi River  with 30  of the Mississippi s flow routinely being sent to the Gulf of Mexico by this route  rather than continuing down the Mississippi s current channel past Baton Rouge and New Orleans on a longer route to the Gulf  15  16  17   edit  Watershed Mississippi watershed  2005  See also  List of drainage basins by area The Mississippi River has the world s fourth largest drainage basin   watershed  or  catchment    The basin covers more than 1 245 000 sq mi  3 220 000 km2   including all or parts of 32 U S  states and two Canadian provinces  The drainage basin empties into the Gulf of Mexico  part of the Atlantic Ocean  The total catchment of the Mississippi River covers nearly 40  of the landmass of the continental United States  Sequence of NASA MODIS images showing the outflow of fresh water from the Mississippi  arrows  into the Gulf of Mexico  2004  In the United States  the Mississippi River drains the majority of the area between crest of the Rocky Mountains and the crest of the Appalachian Mountains  except for various regions drained to Hudson Bay by the Red River of the North  to the Atlantic Ocean by the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River  and to the Gulf of Mexico by the Rio Grande  the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers  the Chattahoochee and Appalachicola rivers  and various smaller coastal waterways along the Gulf  The Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico about 100 miles  160 km  downstream from New Orleans  Measurements of the length of the Mississippi from Lake Itasca to the Gulf of Mexico vary somewhat  but the United States Geological Survey s number is 2 340 miles  3 770 km   The retention time from Lake Itasca to the Gulf is typically about 90 days  18   edit  Outflow The Mississippi River discharges at an annual average rate of between 200 and 700 thousand cubic feet per second  7 000 20 000 m3 s   19  Although it is the 5th largest river in the world by volume  this flow is a mere fraction of the output of the Amazon  which moves nearly 7 million cubic feet per second  200 000 m3 s  during wet seasons  On average  the Mississippi has only 8  the flow of the Amazon River  20  Fresh river water flowing from the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico does not mix into the salt water immediately  The images from NASA s MODIS  to the right  show a large plume of fresh water  which appears as a dark ribbon against the lighter blue surrounding waters  These images demonstrate that the plume did not mix with the surrounding sea water immediately  Instead  it stayed intact as it flowed through the Gulf of Mexico  into the Straits of Florida  and entered the Gulf Stream  The Mississippi River water rounded the tip of Florida and traveled up the southeast coast to the latitude of Georgia before finally mixing in so thoroughly with the ocean that it could no longer be detected by MODIS  Prior to 1900  the Mississippi River transported an estimated 400 million metric tons of sediment per year from the interior of the United States to coastal Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico  During the last two decades  this number was only 145 million metric tons per year  The reduction in sediment transported down the Mississippi River is the result of engineering modification of the Mississippi  Missouri  and Ohio rivers and their tributaries by dams  meander cutoffs  river training structures  and bank revetments and soil erosion control programs in the areas drained by them  21   edit  Course changes Over geologic time  the Mississippi River has experienced numerous large and small changes to its main course  as well as additions  deletions  and other changes among its numerous tributaries  and the lower Mississippi River has used different pathways as its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico across the delta region  Through a natural process known as avulsion or delta switching  the lower Mississippi River has shifted its final course to the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico every thousand years or so  This occurs because the deposits of silt and sediment begin to clog its channel  raising the river s level and causing it to eventually find a steeper  more direct route to the Gulf of Mexico  The abandoned distributaries diminish in volume and form what are known as bayous  This process has  over the past 5 000 years  caused the coastline of south Louisiana to advance toward the Gulf from 15 to 50 miles  25 80 km   The currently active delta lobe is called the Birdfoot Delta  after its shape  or the Balize Delta  after La Balize  Louisiana  the first French settlement at the mouth of the Mississippi   edit  Prehistoric courses The current form of the Mississippi River basin was largely shaped by the Laurentide Ice Sheet of the most recent Ice Age  The southernmost extent of this enormous glaciation extended well into the present day United States and Mississippi basin  When the ice sheet began to recede  hundreds of feet of rich sediment were deposited  creating the flat and fertile landscape of the Mississippi Valley  During the melt  giant glacial rivers found drainage paths into the Mississippi watershed  creating such features as the Minnesota River  James River  and Milk River valleys  When the ice sheet completely retreated  many of these  temporary  rivers found paths to Hudson Bay or the Arctic Ocean  leaving the Mississippi Basin with many features  oversized  for the existing rivers to have carved in the same time period  Ice sheets during the Illinoian Stage about 300 000 to 132 000 years before present  blocked the Mississippi near Rock Island  Illinois  diverting it to its present channel farther to the west  the current western border of Illinois  The Hennepin Canal roughly follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi downstream from Rock Island to Hennepin  Illinois  South of Hennepin  to Alton  Illinois  the current Illinois River follows the ancient channel used by the Mississippi River before the Illinoian Stage  View along the former riverbed at the Tennessee Arkansas state line near Reverie  Tennessee  2007   edit  Historic course changes In March 1876  the Mississippi suddenly changed course near the settlement of Reverie  Tennessee  leaving a small part of Tipton County  Tennessee  attached to Arkansas and separated from the rest of Tennessee by the new river channel  Since this event was an avulsion  rather than the effect of incremental erosion and deposition  the state line remains located in the old channel  22   edit  Future course changes Geologists consider the next major change in the course of the Lower Mississippi now overdue  Either of two new routes   through the Atchafalaya Basin or through Lake Pontchartrain   might become the Mississippi s main channel if flood control structures are overtopped or heavily damaged during a severe flood  23  24  25  26  However  the Mississippi returned to its present course following the great floods in 2011  27  Failure of the Old River Control Structure  the Morganza Spillway  or nearby levees would likely re route the main channel of the Mississippi through Louisiana s Atchafalaya Basin and down the Atchafalaya River to reach the Gulf of Mexico south of Morgan City in southern Louisiana  This route provides a more direct path to the Gulf of Mexico than the present Mississippi River channel through Baton Rouge and New Orleans  25  While the risk of such a diversion is present during any major flood event  such as those of 1973 or 2011   such a change has so far been prevented by active human intervention involving the construction  maintenance  and operation of various levees  spillways  and other control structures by the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  The Old River Control Structure complex  View is to the east southeast  looking downriver on the Mississippi  with the three dams across channels of the Atchafalaya River to the right of the Mississippi  Concordia Parish  Louisiana is in the foreground  on the right  and Wilkinson County  Mississippi  is in the background  across the Mississippi on the left  The Old River Control Structure  between the present Mississippi River channel and the Atchafalaya Basin  sits at the normal water elevation and is ordinarily used to divert 30  of the Mississippi s flow to the Atchafalaya River  There is a steep drop here away from the Mississippi s main channel into the Atchafalaya Basin  If this facility were to fail during a major flood  there is a strong concern the water would scour and erode the river bottom enough to capture the Mississippi s main channel  The structure was nearly lost during the 1973 flood  but repairs and improvements were made after engineers studied the forces at play  In particular  the Corps of Engineers made many improvements and constructed additional facilities for routing water through the vicinity  These additional facilities give the Corps much more flexibility and potential flow capacity than they had in 1973  which further reduces the risk of a catastrophic failure in this area during other major floods  such as those of 2011  Because the Morganza Spillway is located at slightly higher elevation well back from the river  it is normally dry on both sides  28  Even if this structure were to fail at the crest during a severe flood  the flood waters would have to cause a significant amount of erosion  down to normal water levels  before the Mississippi could permanently jump channel at this location   During the 2011 floods  the Corps of Engineers decided to open the Morganza Spillway to 1 4 of its capacity to allow 150 000 ft3 sec of water to flood the Morganza and Atchafalaya floodways and continue directly to the Gulf of Mexico  bypassing Baton Rouge and New Oreans  29  In addition to reducing the Mississippi River crest downstream  this diversion is also reducing the chances of a channel change by reducing stress on the other elements of the control system  30  Some geologists have noted that the possibility for course change into the Atchafalaya also exists in the area immediately north of the Old River Control Structure  Army Corps of Engineers geologist Fred Smith once stated   The Mississippi wants to go west  1973 was a forty year flood  The big one lies out there somewhere when the structures can t release all the floodwaters and the levee is going to have to give way  That is when the river s going to jump its banks and try to break through   31  If the main channel of the lower Mississippi River changes permanently to the Old River and Atchafalya River channels in the Atchafalaya Basin  thus bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans  the ecological and economic consequences for Louisiana  the region  the nation  and international commerce would be immense  Sedimentation and erosion patterns would quickly change greatly  including development of a new river channel and delta  as well as a new pattern of floodplains  natural levees  and backswamps  Changes to salinity of coastal waters  less saline near new delta  more saline near the present delta  would affect marine life  fisheries  beaches  and coastal marshes  The abandoned river channel would eventually fill and revegetate  probably with a major influx of invasive non native species  On the other hand  the low lying outer parts of the present delta  lacking replenishment  would mostly soon erode away  Over time  the new channel would itself develop meanders and cutoffs  eventually leading to formation of new oxbow lakes  Human society would also be greatly altered locally  with broader consequences nationally and globally  Transportation by road  rail  sea  and river barge would all be dramatically affected  and various sizable new bridges would be urgently needed  Existing port facilities may have to be relocated or replaced  and channel alterations would be needed to maintain any substantial degree of commercial shipping on either the new or the old channel of the Mississippi  Power lines  pipelines  and fiber optic and other communications lines would be similarly disrupted  and housing  agriculture  forestry  petroleum production facilities  and other land uses would be suddenly altered  as would patterns of recreational activities  Morgan City in particular would be quite heavily impacted  Values of many properties would be greatly altered  some increasing  some decreasing  and ownership claims would need to be resolved for the newly exposed land of the old riverbed  Another possible course change for the Mississippi River is a diversion into Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans  Louisiana  This route is currently controlled by the he Bonnet Carr  Spillway  built to reduce flooding in New Orleans  However  the spillway and an imperfect natural levee about 4 6 meters  12 to 20 feet  high are all that prevents the Mississippi from taking a new  shorter course through Lake Pontchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico  32  Diversion of the Mississippi s main channel through Lake Pontchartrain would have generally similar consequences to an Atchafalaya diversion  but to a lesser extent  since the present river channel would remain in use past Baton Rouge and into the New Orleans area  Following a Lake Pontchartrain diversion  the Mississippi s new delta would develop offshore of southern Mississippi   edit  New Madrid Seismic Zone The New Madrid Seismic Zone  along the Mississippi River near New Madrid  Missouri  between Memphis and St  Louis  is related to an aulacogen  failed rift  that formed at the same time as the Gulf of Mexico  This area is still quite active seismically  Four great earthquakes in 1811 and 1812  estimated at approximately 8 on the Richter magnitude scale  had tremendous local effects in the then sparsely settled area  and were felt in many other places in the midwestern and eastern U S  These earthquakes created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee from the altered landscape near the river  and temporarily reversed the direction of flow of the Mississippi itself   edit  Cultural geography  edit  State boundaries The Mississippi River runs through or along 10 states  from Minnesota to Louisiana  and was used to define portions of these states  borders  with Wisconsin  Illinois  Kentucky  Tennessee  and Mississippi along the east side of the river  and Iowa  Missouri  and Arkansas along its west side  Substantial parts of both Minnesota and Louisiana are on either side of the river  although the Mississippi defines part of the boundary of each of these states  In all of these cases  the middle of the riverbed at the time the borders were established was used as the line to define the borders between adjacent states  33  34  In various areas  the river has since shifted  but the state borders have not changed  still following the former bed of the Mississippi River as of their establishment  leaving several small isolated areas of one state across the new river channel  contiguous with the adjacent state  Also  due to a meander in the river  a small part of western Kentucky is contiguous with Tennessee  but isolated from the rest of its state   edit  Communities along the river In Minnesota  the Mississippi River runs through the Twin Cities  2007  Community of boathouses on the Mississippi River in Winona  MN

Memphis  Tennessee A clear channel is needed for the barges and other vessels that make the main stem Mississippi one of the great commercial waterways of the world  The task of maintaining a navigation channel is the responsibility of the United States Army Corps of Engineers  which was established in 1802  36  Earlier projects began as early as 1829 to remove snags  close off secondary channels and excavate rocks and sandbars  Steamboats entered trade in the 1820s  so the period 1830   1850 became the golden age of steamboats  As there were few roads or rails in the lands of the Louisiana Purchase  river traffic was an ideal solution  Cotton  timber and food came down the river  as did Appalachian coal  The port of New Orleans boomed as it was the trans shipment point to deep sea ocean vessels  As a result  the image of the twin stacked  wedding cake Mississippi steamer entered into American mythology  Steamers worked the entire route from the trickles of Montana  to the Ohio river  down the Missouri and Tennessee  to the main channel of the Mississippi  Only the arrival of the railroads in the 1880s did steamboat traffic diminish  Steamboats remained a feature until the 1920s  Most have been superseded by pusher tugs  A few survive as icons the Delta Queen and the River Queen for instance  A series of 29 locks and dams on the upper Mississippi  most of which were built in the 1930s  is designed primarily to maintain a 9 feet  2 7 m  deep channel for commercial barge traffic  37  38  The lakes formed are also used for recreational boating and fishing  The dams make the river deeper and wider but do not stop it  No flood control is intended  During periods of high flow  the gates  some of which are submersible  are completely opened and the dams simply cease to function  Below St  Louis  the Mississippi is relatively free flowing  although it is constrained by numerous levees and directed by numerous wing dams  Barges on the Mississippi River near Ste  Genevieve  Missouri   edit  19th century Lock and Dam No  11  north of Dubuque  Iowa  2007  In 1829  there were surveys of the two major obstacles on the upper Mississippi  the Des Moines Rapids and the Rock Island Rapids  where the river was shallow and the riverbed was rock  The Des Moines Rapids were about 11 mi  18 km  long and just above the mouth of the Des Moines River at Keokuk  Iowa  The Rock Island Rapids were between Rock Island and Moline  Illinois  Both rapids were considered virtually impassable  In 1848  the Illinois and Michigan Canal was built to connect the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan via the Illinois River near Peru  Illinois  The canal allowed shipping between these important waterways  In 1900  the canal was replaced by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal  The second canal  in addition to shipping  also allowed Chicago to address specific health issues  typhoid fever  cholera and other waterborne diseases  by sending its waste down the Illinois and Mississippi river systems rather than polluting its water source of Lake Michigan  The Corps of Engineers recommended the excavation of a 5 ft  1 5 m  deep channel at the Des Moines Rapids  but work did not begin until after Lieutenant Robert E  Lee endorsed the project in 1837  The Corps later also began excavating the Rock Island Rapids  By 1866  it had become evident that excavation was impractical  and it was decided to build a canal around the Des Moines Rapids  The canal opened in 1877  but the Rock In 1878  Congress authorized the Corps to establish a 4 5 feet  1 4 m  deep channel to be obtained by building wing dams which direct the river to a narrow channel causing it to cut a deeper channel  by closing secondary channels and by dredging  The channel project was complete when the Moline Lock  which bypassed the Rock Island Rapids  opened in 1907  To improve navigation between St  Paul  Minnesota  and Prairie du Chien  Wisconsin  the Corps constructed several dams on lakes in the headwaters area  including Lake Winnibigoshish and Lake Pokegama  The dams  which were built beginning in the 1880s  stored spring run off which was released during low water to help maintain channel depth  In 1907  Congress authorized a 6 feet  1 8 m  deep channel project on the Mississippi  which was not complete when it was abandoned in the late 1920s in favor of the 9 feet  2 7 m  deep channel project  Lock and Dam No  2  near Hastings  Minnesota  2007  Lock and Dam No  15  is the largest roller dam in the world Davenport  Iowa  Rock Island  Illinois   1990   edit  20th century In 1913  construction was complete on a dam at Keokuk  Iowa  the first dam below St  Anthony Falls  Built by a private power company to generate electricity  the Keokuk dam was one of the largest hydro electric plants in the world at the time  The dam also eliminated the Des Moines Rapids  Lock and Dam No  1 was completed in Minneapolis  Minnesota in 1917  Lock and Dam No  2  near Hastings  Minnesota was completed in 1930  Prior to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927  the Corps  primary strategy was to close off as many side channels as possible to increase the flow in the main river  It was thought that the river s velocity would scour off bottom sediments  deepening the river and decreasing the possibility of flooding  The 1927 flood proved this to be so wrong that communities threatened by the flood began to create their own levee breaks to relieve the force of the rising river  The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930 authorized the 9 feet  2 7 m  channel project  which called for a navigation channel 9 ft  2 7 m  deep and 400 ft  120 m  wide to accommodate multiple barge tows  39  40  This was achieved by a series of locks and dams  and by dredging  Twenty three new locks and dams were built on the upper Mississippi in the 1930s in addition to the three already in existence  Project design flood flow capacity for the Mississippi river in thousands of cubic feet per second  41  Formation of the Atchafalaya River and construction of the Old River Control Structure  Until the 1950s  there was no dam below Lock and Dam 26 at Alton  Illinois  Chain of Rocks Lock  Lock and Dam No  27   which consists of a low water dam and an 8 4 mi  13 5 km  long canal  was added in 1953  just below the confluence with the Missouri River  primarily to bypass a series of rock ledges at St  Louis  It also serves to protect the St  Louis city water intakes during times of low water  U S  government scientists determined in the 1950s that the Mississippi River was starting to switch to the Atchafalaya River channel because of its much steeper path to the Gulf of Mexico  Eventually the Atchafalaya River would capture the Mississippi River and become its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico  leaving New Orleans on a side channel  As a result  the U S  Congress authorized a project called the Old River Control Structure  which has prevented the Mississippi River from leaving its current channel that drains into the Gulf via New Orleans  42  Because the large scale of high energy water flow threatened to damage the structure  an auxiliary flow control station was built adjacent to the standing control station  This US  300 million project was completed in 1986 by the U S  Army Corps Of Engineers  Beginning in the 1970s  the Corps applied hydrological transport models to analyze flood flow and water quality of the Mississippi  Dam 26 at Alton  Illinois  which had structural problems  was replaced by the Mel Price Lock and Dam in 1990  The original Lock and Dam 26 was demolished  A low water dam deepens the pool above the Chain of Rocks Lock near St  Louis  2006  Soldiers of the Missouri Army National Guard sandbag the River in Clarksville  Missouri  June 2008  following flooding   edit  21st century The Corps now actively creates and maintains spillways and floodways to divert periodic water surges into backwater channels and lakes  as well as route part of the Mississippi s flow into the Atchafalaya Basin and from there to the Gulf of Mexico  bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans  The main structures are the Birds Point New Madrid Floodway in Missouri  the Old River Control Structure and the Morganza Spillway in Louisiana  which direct excess water down the west and east sides  respectively  of the Atchafalaya River  and the Bonnet Carr  Spillway  also in Louisiana  which directs floodwaters to Lake Pontchartrain  see diagram   Some of the pre 1927 strategy is still in use today  with the Corps actively cutting the necks of horseshoe bends  allowing the water to move faster and reducing flood heights   43   edit  History  edit  Native Americans Main articles  Woodland period  Hopewell tradition  and

Mississippi River basin was first settled by hunting and gathering Native American peoples and is considered one the few independent centers of plant domestication in human history  44  Evidence of early cultivation of sunflower  a goosefoot  a marsh elder and an indigenous squash dates to the 4th millennium BCE  The lifestyle gradually became more settled after around 1000 BCE during what is now called the Woodland period  with increasing evidence of shelter construction  pottery  weaving and other practices  A network of trade routes referred to as the Hopewell interaction sphere was active along the waterways between about 200 and 500 CE  spreading common cultural practices over the entire area between the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes  A period of more isolated communities followed  and agriculture introduced from Mesoamerica based on the Three Sisters  maize  beans and squash  gradually came to dominate  After around 800 CE there arose an advanced agricultural society today referred to as the Mississippian culture  with evidence of highly stratified complex chiefdoms and large population centers  The most prominent of these  now called Cahokia  was occupied between about 600 and 1400 CE 45  and at its peak numbered between 8 000 and 40 000 inhabitants  larger than London  England of that time  At the time of first contact with Europeans  Cahokia and many other Mississippian cities had dispersed  and archaeological finds attest to increased social stress  46  47  48  Modern American Indian nations inhabiting the Mississippi basin include Cheyenne  Sioux

is now Mississippi  In Spanish  the river is called R o Mississippi  52  French explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette began exploring the Mississippi in the 17th century  Marquette traveled with a Sioux Indian who named it Ne Tongo   Big river  in Sioux language  in 1673  Marquette proposed calling it the River of the Immaculate Conception  When Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi

less than 2 miles  3 2 km   3 km  would join the Mississippi and the Great Lakes  53  In 1848  the continental divide separating the waters of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley was breached by the Illinois and Michigan canal via the Chicago River  54  This both accelerated the development  and forever changed the ecology of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes  In 1682  Ren  Robert Cavelier  Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti claimed the entire Mississippi River Valley for France  calling the river Colbert River after Jean Baptiste Colbert and the region La Louisiane  for King Louis XIV  On March 2  1699  Pierre Le Moyne d Iberville rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi  following the death of La Salle  55  The French built the small fort of La Balise there to control

the border between the British and Spanish Empires  The Treaty of Paris  1763  gave Great Britain rights to all land east of the Mississippi and Spain rights to land west of the Mississippi  Spain also ceded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba  which the British occupied during the war  Britain then divided the territory into East and West Florida  Article 8 of the Treaty of Paris  1783  states   The navigation of the river Mississippi  from its source to the ocean  shall forever remain free and open to the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States   With this treaty  which ended the American Revolutionary War  Britain also ceded West Florida back to Spain to regain the Bahamas  which Spain had occupied during the war  In 1800  under duress from Napoleon of France  Spain ceded an undefined portion of West Florida to France  When France then sold the Louisiana Territory to the US in 1803  a dispute arose again between Spain and the U S  on which parts of West Florida exactly had Spain ceded to France  which would in turn decide which parts of West Florida were now U S  property versus Spanish property  These aspirations ended when Spain was pressured into signing Pinckney s Treaty in 1795  France reacquired  Louisiana  from Spain in the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800  The United States then bought the territory from France in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803  In 1815  the U S  defeated Britain at the Battle of New Orleans  part of the War of 1812  securing American control of the river  So many settlers traveled westward through the Mississippi river basin  as well as settled in it  that Zadok Cramer wrote a guide book called The Navigator  detailing the features and dangers and navigable waterways of the area  It was so popular that he updated and expanded it through 12 editions over a period of 25 years  Shifting sand bars made early navigation difficult  The colonization of the area was barely slowed by the three

Mississippi Mark Twain s book  Life on the Mississippi  covered the steamboat commerce which took place from 1830 to 1870 on the river before more modern ships replaced the steamer  The book was published first in serial form in Harper s Weekly in seven parts in 1875  The full version  including a passage from the unfinished Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and works from other authors  was published by James R  Osgood  amp  Company in 1885  The first steamboat to travel the full length of the Lower Mississippi from the Ohio River to New Orleans was the New Orleans in December 1811  Its maiden voyage occurred during the series of New Madrid earthquakes in 1811 12  Steamboat transport remained a viable industry  both in terms of passengers and freight until the end of the first decade of the 20th century  Among the several Mississippi River system steamboat companies was the noted Anchor Line  which  from 1859 to 1898  operated a luxurious fleet of steamers between St  Louis and

found within the woods surrounding the Mississippi River  Many of the works of Mark Twain deal with or take place near the Mississippi River  One of his first major works  Life on the Mississippi  is in part a history of the river  in part a memoir of Twain s experiences on the river  and a collection of tales that either take place on or are associated with the river  The river was noted for the number of bandits which called its islands and shores home  including John Murrell who was a well known murderer  horse stealer and slave  re trader   His notoriety was such that author Twain devoted an entire chapter to him in Life on the Mississippi  and Murrell was rumored to have an island headquarters on the river at Island 37  Twain s most famous work  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  is largely a journey down the river  The novel works as an episodic meditation on American culture with the river having multiple different meanings including independence  escape  freedom  and adventure  Herman Melville s novel The Confidence Man portrayed a Canterbury Tales style group of steamboat passengers whose interlocking stories are told as they travel down the Mississippi River  The novel is written both as cultural satire and a metaphysical treatise  Like Huckleberry Finn  it uses the Mississippi River as a metaphor for the larger aspects of American and human identity that unify the otherwise disparate characters  The river s fluidity is reflected by the often shifting personalities and identities of Melville s  confidence man    edit  Music On The Mississippi  music sheet cover
