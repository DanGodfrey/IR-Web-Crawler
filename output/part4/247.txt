branch of the United States Armed Forces responsible for land based military operations  It is the largest and oldest established branch of the U S  military  and is one of seven U S  uniformed services  The modern Army has its roots in the Continental Army which was formed on 14 June 1775  1  before the establishment of the United States  to meet the demands of the American Revolutionary War  The Congress of the Confederation officially created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 2  3  after the end of the Revolutionary War to replace the disbanded Continental Army  The Army considers itself to be descended from the Continental Army and thus dates its inception from the origins of that force  1  The primary mission of the army is  to fight and win our Nation s wars by providing prompt  sustained land dominance across the full range of military operations and spectrum of conflict in support of combatant commanders   4  The Army is a military service within the Department of the Army  one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense  The army is headed by the Secretary of the Army  and the top military officer in the department is the Chief of Staff of the Army  The highest ranking army officer is currently the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  During fiscal year 2010  the Regular Army reported a strength of 561 979 soldiers  the Army National Guard  ARNG  reported 362 015 and the United States Army Reserve  USAR  reported 205 281 putting the combined component strength total at 1 129 275 soldiers  5  Contents 1 Mission 2

the army as  6  preserving the peace and security and providing for the defense of the United States  the Commonwealths and possessions and any areas occupied by the United States supporting the national policies implementing the national objectives overcoming any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the United States  edit  History Main article  History of the United States Army  This section has been split to History of the United States Army  This section may need to be cleaned up or summarized  edit  Origins Storming of Redoubt  10 during the Siege of Yorktown  The Continental Army was created on 14 June 1775 by the Continental Congress as a unified army for the states to fight Great Britain  with George Washington appointed as its commander  1  The army was initially led by men who had served in the British Army or colonial militias and who brought much of British military heritage with them  As the Revolutionary War progressed  French aid  resources  and military thinking influenced the new army  while Prussian assistance and instructors  such as Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben  had a strong influence  George Washington used the Fabian strategy and used hit and run tactics  hitting where the enemy was weakest  to wear down the British forces and their Hessian mercenary allies  Washington led victories against the British at Trenton and Princeton  and then turned south  With a decisive victory at Yorktown  and the help of the French  the Spanish and the Dutch  the Continental Army prevailed against the British  and with the Treaty of Paris  the independence of the United States was acknowledged  After the war  though  the Continental Army was quickly disbanded as part of the American distrust of standing armies  and irregular state militias became the new nation s sole ground army  with the exception of a regiment to guard the Western Frontier and one battery of artillery guarding West Point s arsenal  However  because of continuing conflict with Native Americans  it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army  The first of these  the Legion of the United States  was established in 1791 and disbanded in 1796   edit  19th century The War of 1812  the second and last American war against Britain  was less successful than the Revolution had been  An invasion of Canada failed  and U S  troops were unable to stop the British from burning the new capital of Washington  D C   However  the Regular Army  under Generals Winfield Scott and Jacob Brown  proved they were professional and capable of defeating a British army in the Niagara campaign of 1814  Two weeks after a treaty was signed  though  Andrew Jackson defeated the British invasion of New Orleans  However this had little effect  as per the treaty both sides returned to the status quo  Between 1815 and 1860  a spirit of Manifest Destiny was common in the U S   and as settlers moved west the U S  Army engaged in a long series of skirmishes and battles with Native Americans that the settlers uprooted  The U S  Army also fought and won the Mexican American War  1846 1848   which was a defining event for both countries  7  The U S  victory resulted in acquisition of territory that eventually became all or parts of the states of California  Nevada  Utah  Colorado  Arizona  Wyoming and New Mexico  The Battle of Gettysburg  the turning point of the American Civil War The Civil War was the most costly war for the U S  in terms of casualties  After most states in the South seceded to form the Confederate States of America  CSA troops opened fire on the Union held Fort Sumter in Charleston  South Carolina  starting the war  For the first two years Confederate forces solidly defeated the U S  Army  but after the decisive battles of Gettysburg in the east and Vicksburg in the west  combined with superior industrial might and numbers  Union troops fought a brutal campaign through Confederate territory and the war ended with a Confederate surrender at Appomatox Courthouse in April 1865  The war remains the deadliest conflict in American history  resulting in the deaths of 620 000 soldiers  Based on 1860 census figures  8  of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war  including 6  in the North and 18  in the South  8  Following the Civil War  the U S  Army fought a long battle with Native Americans  who resisted U S  expansion into the center of the continent  By the 1890s the U S  saw itself as a potential international player  U S  victories in the Spanish American War and the controversial and less well known Philippine American War  as well as U S  intervention in Latin America and the Boxer Rebellion  gained America more land and power   edit  20th century Soldiers from the U S  Army 89th Infantry Division cross the Rhine River in assault boats  1945  Starting in 1910  the army began acquiring fixed wing aircraft  9  In 1910  Mexico was having a civil war  peasant rebels fighting government soldiers  The army was deployed to American towns near the border to ensure safety to lives and property  In 1916  Pancho Villa  a major rebel leader  attacked Columbus  New Mexico  prompting a U S  intervention in Mexico until February 7  1917  They fought the rebels and the Mexican federal troops until 1918  The United States joined World War I in 1917 on the side of Britain  France  Russia  and other allies  U S  troops were sent to the front and were involved in the push that finally broke through the German lines  With the armistice in November 1918  the army once again decreased its forces  The U S  joined World War II after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor  On the European front  U S  Army troops formed a significant portion of the forces that captured North Africa and Sicily  On D Day and in the subsequent liberation of Europe and defeat of Nazi Germany  millions of U S  Army troops played a central role  In the Pacific  army soldiers participated alongside U S  Marines in capturing the Pacific Islands from Japanese control  Following the Axis surrenders in May  Germany  and August  Japan  of 1945  army troops were deployed to Japan and Germany to occupy the two defeated nations  Two years after World War II  the Army Air Forces separated from the army to become the United States Air Force in September 1947 after decades of attempting to separate  Also  in 1948 the army was desegregated  However  the end of World War II set the stage for the East West confrontation known as the Cold War  With the outbreak of the Korean War  concerns over the defense of Western Europe rose  Two corps  V and VII  were reactivated under Seventh United States Army in 1950 and American strength in Europe rose from one division to four  Hundreds of thousands of U S  troops remained stationed in West Germany  with others in Belgium  the Netherlands and the United Kingdom  until the 1990s in anticipation of a possible Soviet attack  Soldiers of the 2nd Infantry Division man a machine gun during the Korean War During the Cold War  American troops and their allies fought Communist forces in Korea and Vietnam  The Korean War began in 1950  when the Soviets walked out of a U N  Security meeting  removing their possible veto  Under a United Nations umbrella  hundreds of thousands of U S  troops fought to prevent the takeover of South Korea by North Korea  and later  to invade the northern nation  After repeated advances and retreats by both sides  and the PRC People s Volunteer Army s entry into the war  the Korean Armistice Agreement returned the peninsula to the status quo in 1953  An infantry patrol moves up to assault the last Viet Cong position at Dak To  South Vietnam after an attempted overrun of the artillery position by the Viet Cong during Operation Hawthorne The Vietnam War is often regarded by whom   as a low point for the army due to the use of drafted personnel  the unpopularity of the war with the American public  and frustrating restrictions placed on the military by US political leaders  While American forces had been stationed in the Republic of Vietnam since 1959  in intelligence  amp  advising training roles  they did not deploy in large numbers until 1965  after the Gulf of Tonkin Incident  American forces effectively established and maintained control of the  traditional  battlefield  however they struggled to counter the guerrilla hit and run tactics of the communist Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army  On a tactical level  American soldiers  and the US military as a whole  did not lose a sizable battle  10  The Total Force Policy was adopted by Chief of Staff of the Army General Creighton Abrams in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and involves treating the three components of the army   the Regular Army  the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve as a single force  11  Believing that no U S  president should be able to take the United States  and more specifically the US Army  to war without the support of the American people  General Abrams intertwined the structure of the three components of the army in such a way as to make extended operations impossible  without the involvement of both the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve  12  The 1980s was mostly a decade of reorganization  The army converted to an all volunteer force with greater emphasis on training and technology  The Goldwater Nichols Act of 1986 created unified combatant commands bringing the army together with the other four military under unified  geographically organized command structures  The army also played a role in the invasions of Grenada in 1983  Operation Urgent Fury  and Panama in 1989  Operation Just Cause   By 1989 Germany was nearing reunification and the Cold War was coming to a close  The army leadership reacted by starting to plan for a reduction in strength  By November 1989 Pentagon briefers were laying out plans to reduce Army endstrength by 23   from 750 000 to 580 000  13  A number of incentives such as early retirement were used  In 1990 Iraq invaded its smaller neighbor  Kuwait  and U S  land forces  quickly deployed to assure the protection of Saudi Arabia  In January 1991 Operation Desert Storm commenced  a U S  led coalition which deployed over 500 000 troops  the bulk of them from U S  Army formations  to drive out Iraqi forces  The campaign ended in total victory  as Western coalition forces routed the Iraqi Army  organized along Soviet lines  in just one hundred hours  After Desert Storm  the army did not see major combat operations for the remainder of the 1990s but did participate in a number of peacekeeping activities  In 1990 the Department of Defense issued guidance for  rebalancing  after a review of the Total Force Policy  14  but in 2004  Air War College scholars concluded the guidance would reverse the Total Force Policy which is an  essential ingredient to the successful application of military force   15   edit  21st century US and Iraqi Soldiers patrol borders in Iraq  After the September 11 attacks  and as part of the Global War on Terror  U S  and NATO combined

more than 4 000 U S service members  as of March 2008  and injuries to thousands more  16  Approximately 654 965 civilians 17  18  and 23 813 insurgents 19  were killed in Iraq between 2003 2011  The lack of stability in the theater of operations has led to longer deployments for Regular Army as well as Reserve and Guard troops  citation needed  The army s chief modernization plan was the FCS

permanent forts and perform other non wartime duties such as engineering and construction works  During times of war  the U S  Army was augmented by the much larger United States Volunteers which were raised independently by various state governments  States also maintained full time militias which could also be called into the service of the army  By the twentieth century  the U S  Army had mobilized the U S  Volunteers on four separate occasions during each of the major wars of the nineteenth century  During World War I  the  National Army  was organized to fight the conflict  replacing the concept of U S  Volunteers  22  It was demobilized at the end of World War I  and was replaced by the Regular Army  the Organized Reserve Corps  and the State Militias  In the 1920s and 1930s  the  career  soldiers were known as the  Regular Army  with the  Enlisted Reserve Corps  and  Officer Reserve Corps  augmented to fill vacancies when needed  23  In 1941  the  Army of the United States  was founded to fight World War II  The Regular Army  Army of the United States  the National Guard  and Officer Enlisted Reserve Corps  ORC and ERC  existed simultaneously  After World War II  the ORC and ERC were combined into the United States Army Reserve  The Army of the United States was re established for the Korean War and Vietnam War and was demobilized upon the suspension of the Draft  23  Currently  the army is divided into the Regular Army  the Army Reserve  and the Army National Guard  22  The army is also divided into major branches such as Air Defense Artillery  Infantry  Aviation  Signal Corps  Corps of Engineers  and Armor  Prior to 1903 members of the National Guard were considered state soldiers unless federalized by the President  Since the Militia Act of 1903 all National Guard soldiers have held dual status  as National Guardsmen under the authority of the governor of their state and as a reserve of the U S  Army under the authority of the President  Since the adoption of the total force policy  in the aftermath of the Vietnam War  reserve component soldiers have taken a more active role in U S  military operations  Reserve and Guard units took part in the Gulf War  peacekeeping in Kosovo  and the 2003 invasion of Iraq  Various state defense forces also exist  sometimes known as state militias  which are sponsored by individual state governments and serve as an auxiliary to the National Guard  State militias are operated independently from the U S  Army and are seen as state government agencies rather than a component of the military  citation needed  Although the present day army exists as an all volunteer force  augmented by Reserve and National Guard forces  measures exist for emergency expansion in the event of a catastrophic occurrence  such as a large scale attack against the U S  or the outbreak of a major global war  citation needed  The final stage of army mobilization  known as  activation of the unorganized militia  would effectively place all able bodied men in the service of the U S  Army  The last time an approximation of this occurred was during the American Civil War when the Confederate States of America activated the  Home Guard  in 1865  drafting all males  regardless of age or health  into the Confederate Army  citation needed   edit  Army commands and army service component commands Army commands

is made up of three components  the active component  the Regular Army  and two reserve components  the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve  Both reserve components are primarily composed of part time soldiers who train once a month  known as battle assemblies or unit training assemblies  UTAs   and conduct two to three weeks of annual training each year  Both the Regular Army and the Army Reserve are organized under Title 10 of the United States Code  while the National Guard is organized under Title 32  While the Army National Guard is organized  trained and equipped as a component of the U S  Army  when it is not in federal service it is under the command of individual state and territorial governors  the District of Columbia National Guard  however  reports to the U S  President  not the District s Mayor  even when not federalized  Any or all of the National Guard can be federalized by presidential order and against the governor s wishes  30  Graphic legend of Army Transformation The Army is led by a civilian Secretary of the Army  who has the statutory authority to conduct all the affairs of the Army  under the authority  direction and control of the Secretary of Defense  31  The Chief of Staff of the Army who is the highest ranked military officer in the army has dual roles  one as the principal military adviser and executive agent for the Secretary of the Army  i e  its service chief  and secondly as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  a body composed of the service chiefs from each of the four military services belonging to the Department of Defense who advise the President of the United States  the Secretary of Defense  and the National Security Council on operational military matters  under the guidance of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  32  33  In 1986  the Goldwater Nichols Act mandated that operational control of the services follows a chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the unified combatant commanders  who have control of all armed forces units in their geographic or function area of responsibility  Thus  the secretaries of the military departments  and their respective service chiefs underneath them  only have the responsibility to organize  train and equip their service components  The Army provides trained forces to the combatant commanders for use as directed by the Secretary of Defense  34  Main article  Transformation of the United States Army Through 2013  the Army is shifting to six geographical commands that will line up with the six geographical unified combatant commands  COCOM   United States Army Central headquartered at Shaw Air Force Base  South Carolina United States Army North headquartered at Fort Sam Houston  Texas United States Army South headquartered at Fort Sam Houston  Texas United States Army Europe headquartered at Campbell Barracks  Germany United States Army Pacific headquartered at Fort Shafter  Hawaii  eventually to be merged with the Eighth Army   United States Army Africa headquartered at Vicenza  Italy The army is also changing its base unit from divisions to brigades  When finished  the active army will have increased its combat brigades from 33 to 48  with similar increases in the National Guard and Reserve forces  Division lineage will be retained  but the divisional HQs will be able to command any brigades  not just brigades that carry their divisional lineage  The central part of this plan is that each brigade will be modular  i e  all brigades of the same type will be exactly the same  and thus any brigade can be commanded by any division  There will be three major types of ground combat brigades  Heavy brigades will have around 3 700 troops and be equivalent to a mechanized infantry or tank brigade  Stryker brigades will have around 3 900 troops and be based on the Stryker family of vehicles  Infantry brigades will have around 3 300 troops and be equivalent to a light infantry or airborne brigade  In addition  there are combat support and service support modular brigades  Combat support brigades include Aviation  CAB  brigades  which will come in heavy and light varieties  Fires  artillery  brigades  and Battlefield Surveillance brigades  Combat service support brigades include Sustainment brigades and come in several varieties and serve the standard support

most recruits followed by AIT  Advanced Individualized Training  where they receive training for their MOS  Military Occupational Specialties   While the length of AIT school varies by the MOS  some individuals MOS s range anywhere from 14 20 weeks of One Station Unit Training  OSUT   which combines Basic Training and AIT  The length of time spent in AIT depends on the MOS of the soldier  Depending on the needs of the Army BCT  Basic Combat Training  is conducted at a number of locations  but two of the longest running are the Armor School and the Infantry School  both at Fort Benning  Georgia  Following these basic and advanced training schools  soldiers may opt to continue with their training and apply for an  ASI  which stands for  Additional Skill Identifier   The ASI allows the Army to take a wide ranging MOS and taper it into a more unique MOS  For instance  take a combat medic whose duties are to provide pre hospital emergency care  With an ASI the medic can receive additional training and become a Cardiovascular Specialist  a Dialysis Specialist or even a Licensed Practical Nurse  For officers this training includes pre commissioning training either at USMA  ROTC  or OCS  After commissioning  officers undergo branch specific training at the Basic Officer Leaders Course   formerly called Officer Basic Course  which varies in time and location based on their future jobs  Further career development is available through the Army Correspondence Course Program  Collective training takes place both at the unit s assigned station  but the most intensive collective training takes place at the three Combat Training Centers  CTC   the National Training Center  NTC  at Fort Irwin  California  the Joint Readiness Training Center  JRTC  at Fort Polk  Louisiana  and the Joint Multinational Training Center  JMRC  at the Hohenfels Training Area in Hohenfels  Germany   edit  Equipment Main article  Equipment of the United States Army  edit  Weapons An

echelon  infantry battalions are typically supported by a section of 81 mm M252 mortars  45  The largest mortar in the army s inventory is the 120 mm M120 M121  usually employed by mechanized units  46  Fire support for light infantry units is provided by towed howitzers  including the 105 mm M119A1 47  and the 155 mm M777  which will replace the M198   48  The army utilizes a variety of direct

standard infantry fighting vehicle  51  Other vehicles include the M3A3 Bradley  the Stryker  52  and the M113 armored personnel carrier  53  and multiple types of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected  MRAP  vehicles  The U S  Army s principal artillery weapons are the M109A6 Paladin self propelled howitzer 54  and the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System  MLRS   55  both mounted on tracked platforms and assigned to heavy mechanized units  While the U S  Army operates a few fixed wing aircraft  it mainly operates several types of rotary wing aircraft  These include the AH 64 Apache attack helicopter  56  the OH 58D Kiowa Warrior armed reconnaissance light attack helicopter  57  the UH 60 Black Hawk utility tactical transport helicopter  58  and the CH 47 Chinook heavy lift transport

Uniforms A US Army Ranger performing MOUT training in ACU combat gear  Main article  Uniforms of the United States Army The Army Combat Uniform  ACU  features a digital camouflage pattern and is designed for use in woodland  desert  and urban environments  Soldiers operating in Afghanistan will soon be issued a fire resistant ACU with the more appropriate  MultiCam  pattern  60  The standard garrison service uniform is known as Army Greens or Class As and has been worn by all officers and enlisted personnel since its introduction in 1956 when it replaced earlier olive drab  OD  and khaki  and tan worsted or TW  uniforms worn between the 1950s and 1985  The Army Blue uniform  dating back to the mid 19th century  is currently the Army s formal dress uniform  but in 2014  it will replace the Army Green and the Army White uniforms  a uniform similar to the Army Green uniform  but worn in tropical postings  and will become the new Army Service Uniform  which will function as both a garrison uniform  when worn with a white shirt and necktie  and a dress uniform  when worn with a white shirt and either a necktie for parades or a bow tie for after six or black tie events   The beret  having been permanently replaced with the Patrol Cap  is no longer worn with the new ACU for garrison duty  After years of complaints that it wasn t suited well for most work conditions  Army Chief of Staff General Martin Dempsey eliminated it for wear with the ACU in June 2011 with exception to soldiers who are currently in an Airborne unit  maroon beret   Rangers  tan beret   and Special Forces  green beret  and with the Army Service Uniform for non ceremonial functions  Unit commanders may still direct the wear of patrol caps in these units in training environments or motorpools
