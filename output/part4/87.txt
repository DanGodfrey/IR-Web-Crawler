Notes 4 Trivia 5 Related Articles 6 See Also 7 Links and References 7 1 Footnotes History Due to a sudden leap in evolution  Mutants  or Homo Superiors  1  are born with superhuman abilities which generally manifest themselves at puberty  Mutants are often hated and feared by humans because they are different  Group Formation The legendary X Men were founded by Professor Charles Xavier  a mutant telepath who had spent many of his adult years studying mutation  Following an encounter with the Shadow King  2  Xavier determined to protect the world from the threat of evil mutants as well as foster a world that would enshrine peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants  Working in conjunction with Moira MacTaggart  he eventually decided to start a school for mutants and train them to be what would eventually become the X Men  3  Charles turned his father s estate into Professor Xavier s School for Gifted Youngsters  his earliest student being young Jean Grey  who was only twelve years old when her mental powers manifested  4  He constructed the Danger Room to test mutants  and developed Cyberno  5  a prototype mutant detector that was later replaced by a more powerful machine called Cerebro  6  After years of preparation  Charles decided that it was time to recruit the young mutants of whom he had been keeping track when anti mutant hysteria had hit its peak  With reports about a young mutant who accidentally endangered and then saved a crowd of people with an optic blast  Charles traveled to Washington D C  and sought out FBI agent Fred Duncan  who was assigned to investigate reports of mutants  Xavier convinced Duncan to allow him to attempt to enroll young mutants in his private school and train them to battle evil mutants  after a brief show of power on the Professor s part  Duncan agreed to do things Xavier s way  7  X Men  1 Added by IronMonger2001 In the following days  Charles recruited Scott Summers  the very mutant who was involved in the news story  Rescuing the boy from the clutches of evil mutant Jack Winters  8  Scott became the first of the X Men  operating under the code name Cyclops  Next  the Professor and Cyclops rescued young Bobby Drake  a mutant with ice powers  from an angry lynch mob  9  He joined the group as Iceman  Xavier s next recruit was the winged Warren Worthington III  who had already started a solo career as the high flying Angel  10  After a brief battle  Angel agreed to join the group  11  The next recruit was the dexterous and intelligent Henry McCoy  who the X Men had to rescue from would be conqueror The Conquistador  12  Rounding off the group  Charles also had Jean Grey join as Marvel Girl  13  The Early Years The Original X Men Added by Halley After training extensively in the school s Danger Room  the students were sent on field missions to protect the world from dangerous mutants who would use their powers against humanity  The first such mission brought them to Cape Citadel  Florida in direct confrontation with the master of magnetism  Magneto  13  who would go on to become their most frequent enemy  This adventure would hail the X Men as heroes  but growing anti mutant hysteria would eventually mar the X Men s reputation  Their next adventure found them defending Washington D C  from the Vanisher  a mutant teleporter 14   They also had their first interaction with the super hero community clashing with Iron Man  15  They found that not all mutants were interested in joining the group when they invited the immovable Blob to the team  16  Magneto returned to plague the X Men again  this time with a group of his own  the so called Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  The X Men first clashed with them when the Brotherhood took over the nation of Santo Marco  17  and later when they attempted to capture the X Men  18  Next  the X Men aided The Sentry against his foe  The General  19  and clashed with the Fantastic Four when the Professor was entrapped by the FF s foe  The Puppet Master  20  The X Men also had three subsequent clashes with the Brotherhood  the first was a failed attempt by the Brotherhood to recruit the Sub Mariner  21  the second to recruit the Blob  6  and third a failed attempt to recruit the thunder god Thor into the Brotherhood s ranks  22  Following the X Men s graduation  6  they faced Unus the Untouchable  23  and aided Spider Man against Menace 24  and Sundown  25  During this period  the Professor briefly left Cyclops in charge of the school while he attempted to stop the alien Lucifer from conquering the world  This attempt was foiled thanks to the assistance of the X Men and the Avengers  beginning the two groups  long standing association  26  The X Men gained another ally in Ka Zar when an investigation of his existence on the South Pole led to the discovery of the Savage Land  The X men aided Ka Zar and his saber toothed cat  Zabu  in defeating the Swamp Men  27  The X Men finally saw the end of their greatest foes  the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  following an encounter with the alien Stranger  which ended with the Stranger taking Magneto and The Toad to his planet for study  and Mastermind being turned into dense matter  28  New threats arose  such as the Professor s stepbrother Cain Marko  who terrorized the X Men as the mystically empowered Juggernaut  29  The X Men defeated Marko with the aid of The Human Torch  30  With anti mutant hysteria on the rise  scientist Bolivar Trask invented the Sentinels  mutant hunting robots  31  However  the robots revolted against their master  capturing Trask and the Professor and taking them to their new leader  Master Mold  Master Mold planned to enslave the human race  but the X Men saved the Professor 32  and found a way to destroy the Sentinels  The encounter ended with Trask s death  33  Still recovering from their battle against the Sentinels  the X Men were once more targeted by a returning Magneto  34  who was defeated and recaptured by the Stranger  35  They next attended the wedding of Reed Richards and Susan Storm  defending it from a legion of villains gathered by Dr  Doom  36  The X Men next battled Mimic  a bitter young man who gained the ability to mimic other people s super powers and learned the X Men s secret identities  The battle ended with Mimic stripped of his powers and with no memory of the X Men s civilian identities  37  Lucifer resurfaced again to finalize his master s alien invasion of Earth  using the Blob and Unus to pose as the X Men to besmirch the team s standing with the public and keep them busy  38  Although the Blob and Unus escaped  the X Men succeeded in foiling Lucifer s plot  39  The X Men then faced two non mutant threats in foiling Count Nefaria s attempt to ransom Washington D C  40  and battling the Locust  41  During this time  Jean was forced by her parents to leave Professor Xavier s school to attend Metro College  41  Despite the fact that Jean was no longer attending Xavier s school  she would still play a part in the group  although less frequently  The rest of the team battled El Tigre 42  and prevented him from taking over the world with the power of the Mayan God Kukulcan  43  The Factor Three Conspiracy X Men vs  Mutant Master Added by Artful Dodger Fearing a threat that would soon strike his X Men  the Professor pressed the group to find new recruits for the team  They unsuccessfully pursued Quicksilver  Scarlet Witch  and Spider Man to join the group  They found their recruit in Mimic  who regained his memories and powers following a lab explosion at Metro College  and joined the group despite the Puppet Master using him as a pawn to try to destroy the X Men  44  The X Men soon learned the name of Factor Three  the organization that sent its agents Ogre and the enslaved Banshee after the X Men in an attempted kidnap of the Professor  Freeing Banshee from Factor Three s control  the X Men easily defeated Ogre  foiling the plot  45  The X Men lost Mimic as a member after he lost his powers stopping the Super Adaptoid  46  The X Men next foiled the Warlock s world domination plot  47  and stopped Ralph Roberts  rampage at Stark Industries in Roberts  Cobalt Man armor  48  Factor Three struck at the X Men again when the Professor was attempting to cure his step brother of being the Juggernaut  The resulting experiment of both science and sorcery ended with the Juggernaut s revival and the Professor near the brink of death  Factor Three mentally contacted the Juggernaut and tried to get him to join the group  49  The X Men ultimately stopped Juggernaut with the aid of Dr  Strange  who helped them force the Juggernaut into the Crimson Cosmos  However  the Professor was kidnapped by Factor Three in the process  50  While waiting for repairs to Cerebro following their fight with the Juggernaut  the X Men came to the rescue of Ralph Roberts again  getting the group mixed up in a conflict between the Mole Man and Tyrannus  51  When Banshee attempted to contact the X Men after learning of Factor Three s European headquarters  his message was interrupted  leading to the X Men briefly battle Spider Man when they mistakenly believed the Wall Crawler was a member of Factor Three  52  Without the money to pay for airfare to Europe  the X Men attempted to raise money  but in the end took a loan from the wealthy philanthropist father of Tom Regal after the X Men aided in stopping Tom s rampage as the armored Mekano  53  When the X Men arrived in Europe  they were quickly captured by Factor Three  whose members included the Vanisher  Blob  Unus  Mastermind  as well as two new villains  The Changeling and Mutant Master  The group found the X Men  guilty  of betraying mankind and sentenced them to death  Before executing the X Men  Factor Three revealed that they intended to initiate World War III by attacking both the United States and Russia to spark a nuclear exchange between the two  54  The X Men split into two  foiled both plots  7  and confronted Mutant Master at his headquarters in the United States  55  There  with the aid of the Changeling  they freed the Professor  Banshee revealed that Mutant Master was really of an alien Siris race  The X Men and Factor Three worked together to stop Mutant Master and parted peacefully  but vowing to meet again as enemies  Upon returning to their mansion  the X Men were rewarded with new costumes designed by Jean  55  The  Death  of Professor Xavier The  Death  of Professor X Added by M1shawhan The X Men next investigated the discovery of Frankeinstein s Monster  which turned out to be a malfunctioning robotic scout for an alien race  The X Men were forced to destroy it  5  Around this time  Professor Xavier learned of an impending invasion from the alien Z Nox race  Needing time to prepare  the Professor made plans to place himself in seclusion  Approached by the terminally ill Changeling  the Professor imparted part of his mental powers to the dying mutant to aid him in his role of posing as the Professor while Charles prepared for the invasion  The only other member of the X Men who was made aware of this plan was Jean  who had her mental powers unlocked by the Professor  Xavier went into seclusion while Changeling took his place  56  The subterranean Grotesk  mutated by the underground nuclear testing that destroyed his people  threatened the Earth  57  During the ensuing battle  the Changeling  posing as the Professor  sacrificed his life to stop Grotesk and saved the Earth  58  After the  Professor s  funeral  the X Men were captured and imprisoned by Magneto  who had just reformed the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  59  Also wishing to get revenge against the Avengers  Magneto allowed Angel to escape in the hope that Angel would lure the other team to Magneto s hideout  60  Angel did just that  and although Magneto pitted the X Men and the Avengers against each other  the two groups succeeded in defeating him  Magneto seemingly perished in an explosion  61  Returning to the Mansion and still mourning the loss of their mentor  the X Men were visited by FBI Agent Duncan  who had come to the X Men during their time of loss  After the X Men were read Xavier s final will  bequeathing everything to them  they were forced to battle the Juggernaut  Juggernaut had been temporarily returned to Earth before being shunted off to the Crimson Cosmos once more  After the battle  agent Duncan informed the group that by government order the X Men were to disband for their own safety  62  This split proved to be short lived  After Beast and Iceman battled the Warlock  now calling himself the Maha Yogi  63  and Cyclops and Marvel Girl battled Quasimodo  64  the group was drawn back together when Cerebro detected a large concentration of mutants in the San Francisco area  65  While investigating  the X Men met a mutant named Lorna Dane  who had arrived in San Francisco with no recollection how she got there  They learned that Mesmero  a mutant hypnotist  was amassing an army of mutants in the name of Magneto to enslave humanity  65  Believing Lorna to be the daughter of Magneto  the army captured Lorna and Iceman  and took them to Mesmero s Mutant City outside of San Francisco  There they activated Lorna s latent mutant powers  The X Men came to Bobby s rescue and learned that the group was seemingly led by Magneto  actually a robot 66   who claimed that Lorna was really his daughter  The X Men managed to escape  but Lorna stayed behind  deciding to remain loyal to her supposed father  67  The X Men returned to destroy the Mutant City  having Cyclops pose as an evil mutant named Erik the Red in order to infiltrate the militia  68  During the ensuing battle  Iceman revealed to Lorna evidence proving that she was not Magneto s daughter  and she helped the X Men defeat Magneto and Mesmero  This prompted Magneto to flee and detonate Mutant City  Escaping with the X Men  Lorna returned with them to New York City  69  There  the X Men attended the wedding of Yellowjacket and the Wasp  70  Later  an accident during a test of one of the Professor s inventions led to the X Men accidentally teleporting Blastaar from the Negative Zone to Earth  During the ensuing battle  Blastaar was seemingly killed when the machine to which he was linked short circuited  71  Havok and the Return of Professor X Enter  Havok Added by Artful Dodger Scott soon reentered the life of his brother Alex who had just graduated from university  However  Alex was captured by the Living Pharaoh  a mutant who found that his and Alex s mutant powers were linked  10  Tracking the Pharaoh to Egypt  the X Men battled him there and learned that Alex was a mutant who could control plasma energy  72  In the ensuing battle  Alex was sealed in a special sarcophagus created by the Pharaoh to allow him full access to Alex s powers  transforming Pharaoh into the Living Monolith  Alex managed to break free once more  cutting off the Pharaoh s powers  but Alex was horrified to find that he didn t have much control over his own powers  73  Before the X Men could help Alex  he was captured by Sentinels that had been rebuilt by Larry Trask  the son of Bolivar Trask  who was hunting down mutants with the aid of Judge Robert Chalmers  Trask revived the Sentinels to get revenge against mutants in general  and the X Men in particular  for the death of his father  Giving Alex a uniform to regulate his powers and naming him Havok  Trask had the confused mutant aid him and the Sentinels in capturing all the world s known mutants  including Iceman  Lorna Dane  and various X Men villains  74  However  Alex aided the X Men in defeating the Sentinels when he learned that Trask didn t intend to keep his word  Things were further complicated by the revelation that Trask was also a mutant  66  Cyclops managed to win the day by convincing the Sentinels to destroy the source of mutations  leading the Sentinels to fly into the sun  Unfortunately  the Sentinels  defeat came at the price of Alex s injury in the battle  75  The X Men put Havok into the care of Dr  Karl Lykos who was secretly required to absorb the energies from other people to survive  However  the life energies of mutants would cause Lykos to mutate into the powerful pterodactyl like humanoid called Sauron  76  Sauron battled the X Men  but later fled to Tierra del Fuego and reverted back to Lykos  Tracking Lykos there  the X Men were unable to stop him from committing suicide to avoid draining the energy of his lover  Tanya  77  Traveling into the Savage Land  the X Men searched for Lykos  body  while Cyclops  Marvel Girl  Iceman  and Beast reunited with Ka Zar and agreed to aid him against the Savage Land Mutates  Angel  searching for Lykos on his own and unaware of his comrades  subsequent team up with Ka Zar  was duped into joining with the Mutates by their leader  the Creator  secretly Magneto   78  However  Warren soon learned the truth and assisted the X Men in defeating Magneto and destroying his citadel  The resulting destruction caused the Mutates to revert back into early Savage Land lifeforms  79  Returning to the United States  the X Men went to Washington D C  to stop Sunfire  a fire wielding mutant from Japan who had been manipulated by his imperialist Uncle Tomo to despise the United States for their part in the bombing of Hiroshima during World War II  from interrupting an important delegation between US and Japanese officials  80  The X Men were shocked when Professor X turned up soon after  alive and well  Xavier explained to his X Men the reason for his ruse  The coming Z Nox invasion  with which the X Men aided the Professor in final preparations  With the help of Cyclops  and Havok s powers  the Professor linked every mind on Earth in order to drive the Z Nox invasion away  56  The victory left the Professor on the brink of death  requiring the X Men to seek out the Hulk  whose human persona had the knowledge to cure the Professor  Although they had to battle the Hulk  the X Men managed to learn of a device that could cure Charles when the Hulk briefly reverted back to into Bruce Banner  The X Men cured their mentor and teacher with the device  81  The Hidden Years The Hidden Years Added by Copycat989 After an altercation against Dr  Doom with the Fantastic Four  82  the X Men got back into training with Xavier again  83  However  Iceman briefly left the team over the romantic turbulence between him  Lorna and Havok  as well as feeling betrayed over Xavier s secrets  Learning what happened in his absence  the Professor sent the X Men to the Savage Land to recover the body of Magneto  however their plane crashed  While most of the team was recovered and nursed by the people of the Savage Land  they were told that Jean had perished in the crash  84  However  they soon learned that they had misinterpreted the explanation  as people in this region did not die  but were sent to the  Land of the Dead   The X Men were soon embroiled in stopping the Nhu Ghari race from enslaving other Savage Land natives  while Jean learned that Magneto was still alive  The X Men defeated Magneto and his revived Mutates  captured him and left the land in a ballooned aircraft  85  Meanwhile in the States Iceman  Havok and Polaris received a mental call from the Professor to seek out the others who had gone missing  86  Lorna and Havok arrived in the region to search for their friends with Ka Zar s help 87  Iceman attempted to get to the Savage Land alone  to no avail   When a storm hit their craft Magneto escaped while Angel and the Nhu Ghari named Avia were lost at sea  The remaining X Men were whisked away to Kenya where they met the young Ororo Munroe  a mutant who could control the weather  88  While Cyclops  Beast and Marvel Girl helped Ororo defeat the weather controlling Deluge  Iceman was found with amnesia by Karl Lykos  and Angel and Avia were rescued from sea by a barge that was happening by  89  Lorna and Havok picked up Bobby s mutant signature and sought him out  while Angel and Avia were sold to a man named Krueger  90  The other X Men returned home only to be attacked by the Fantastic Four  91  Explaining to the Fantastic Four that they linked every mind in the world to stop an invasion by the alien Z Nox  the X Men realized that while they saved the Earth  they did not prevent the Z Nox from turning their invasion fleet on another world and team up with the Fantastic Four to deal with their menace in space  While in space  Jean s mind was contacted by and her body briefly possessed by the Phoenix Force  however the contact was erased from everyone s mind  The X Men and the Fantastic Four then worked together to shunt the Z Nox homeworld into the Negative Zone where it couldn t harm anyone  92  Returning to Earth  and after Jean had a secret screening session with Moira MacTaggart  the Professor and Beast went to Duffee Illinois to investigate a new mutant detected by Cerebro  There they met a little girl named Ashley Martin whose mutant powers had gained control of one of Larry Trask s damaged Sentinels  however when it regained it s original programming and attempted to kill all three mutants  Ashley shut it down  Xavier and Beast battled the young Ashley Martin who had turned against them  Xavier was forced to use his mental powers to force Ashley s growth as a mutant to happen as she matured  The Professor sent Beast back to the Mansion while he stayed to monitor Ashley s recovery  Meanwhile Scott  Jean and Candy Southern went searching for Warren  leading them to a Kruger s boat run freakshow  93  They subsequently were captured and de powered by Krueger who sold them to the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants along with Angel  94  They managed to defeat the Brotherhood of Mutants  Havok and Polaris got caught up in a battle between Sauron and Magneto and his Mutates  The battle ended with Magneto s defeat  and Iceman regaining his memories and being recovered by his teammates  To insure that he was undisturbed and still believed to be dead  Lykos then used his hypnotic powers to make the three X Men forget their encounter with him  95  Candy warned Angel that his uncle Burt was attempting to marry his mother following his father s death  96  The X Men went to stop the wedding  foiling Burt s plot to marry Warren s mother  but they were too late to prevent her from dying of the subtle poisoning Burst was administering to her  97  Havok  Lorna and Iceman came home to find the Mansion empty and Cerebro detecting a new mutant in the Himalayan mountains  98  Finding their comrades gone  the X Men went after them and learned the fate of the First Line  a group of heroes pre dating the Fantastic Four who perished battling the Skrulls  and realized Cerebro was picking up the hidden realm of the Inhumans  99  Returning home  the X Men found that their friend Avia had been poisoned by Kraven the Hunter who challenged one of the X Men to beat him in combat for the cure  The Beast accepted the challenge and won the duel  Lorna was compelled to leave when put under the mental control of Tad Carter  100  Following after Lorna  the X Men found that Tad was a member of a group called the Promise  mutants who were attempting to shape human and mutant kind and spent ten year intervals in cryogenic sleep  The group decided to take Havok  Lorna and Angel into the fold 101   and rejected the others sending them to their doom  Surviving but knocked unconscious the group ended up in the realm of the Mole Man  102  As the core X Men battled off the Mole Man and his monsters  Angel was freed by a member of the Promise and was convinced to see her family  When the Family wanted nothing to do with her she returned with Angel to free Havok and Lorna  Freeing Havok first  Angel and Havok to aided him in stopping Magneto and Sub Mariner s attack on Earth  which was being opposed by the Fantastic Four  Angel refused to go  wanting to search for his friends  He ended up getting turned into stone by Pixie and Makkari of the Eternals  who did not want to be discovered  but put Angel on the right track to finding his friends  Havok went to New York to help in the fight against Magneto  but got chased off by an anti mutant mob  103   Ultimately  the rest of the X Men escaped from the Mole Man s clutches and were reunited with Warren  while Havok managed to free Lorna from the Promise  who parted company when their leader Tobias Messenger was secretly killed by one of their own  Ultimately  while Iceman realized that the Professor meant well in lying to the X Men to deal with the Z Nox invasion he was not ready to rejoin the team  104  Iceman was briefly conned into going after Spider Man by racist politician Sam Bullit  but rejoined the X Men shortly after  105  There he got into a fight with Havok over Lorna  and Bobby was injured in the ensuing fight  prompting Alex to leave the group  Lorna went after him where they got into a battle with the Hulk  who confused Lorna for his lover Jarella  106  After the battle the duo decided to return to the X Men  however they were captured by the Secret Empire before they could  107  Hank left the team for a position at the Brand Corporation where he further mutated himself into literal beast while battling the Secret Empire  Ashamed at this transformation plus in deep with the crooked Brand security  Beast ignored any calls to action from the X Men  108  The remaining X Men investigated a series of murders perpetuated by Morbius the Living Vampire that were blamed on Spider Man  Although the group battled Spider Man initially  they learned the truth  and helped Spider Man cure himself of an illness and took Morbius into custody  109  Beast subsequently battled the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants  110   Quasimodo 111   the Griffin with the aid of Angel 112   and the Juggernaut  113  Hank later came to the aid of his old girlfriend Vera Cantor to save her lover Mimic from radiation poisoning after mimicking the powers of the Hulk  a task he seemingly failed  114  He was captured by the Secret Empire  as were Warren  and later Bobby when the Professor sent the remaining X Men to check on their friends and colleagues  107  Shortly  the remaining X Men helped the Hulk defeat the Juggernaut 115   before learning that the Secret Empire was responsible for the other mutants disappearing

Brotherhood of the Evil Mutant member Mastermind  who created a rich  Lady Grey  fantasy world in her mind with his illusions using a device created by Emma Frost  Eventually believing herself to actually be Lady Grey and also consort to Wyngarde  she was easily convinced to become the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club during the X Men s battle against them  132  Phoenix broke free from

Men had been killed  Moira MacTaggert convinced him to form a new team of adolescent mutants that needed his help in controlling their powers  143  Unwilling to see more of his students perish  Xavier was only willing to train them in the use of their special abilities rather than sending them out into combat as he had with the X Men  These New Mutants ended up in many battles regardless  and

Xavier agreed to aid the desperate mutant and added her to the roster  146  Carol Danvers was furious that her friends would allow the girl who destroyed her life to join the team  and left Earth with the Starjammers  Most of Rogue s teammates still held animosity towards her for what she had done as a member of the Brotherhood  but she slowly gained their trust by continually showing her bravery

Earth to recuperate from his injuries  Using the alias of Michael Xavier  Charles Xavier s alleged cousin  Magneto was Headmaster for a long tenure  149  Magneto was later invited to join the inner circle of the Hellfire Club  an offer which he and Storm decided was worth accepting  150  Cyclops returned  but his attempts to regain leadership of the X Men was opposed by an experienced Storm  now

proposed that X Factor become a mutant hunting contractor as a cover for their activities  Rachel went dancing up the spiral paths into the Mojoverse shortly thereafter  153  The Marauders  secretly

took a gruesome toll  paralyzing Colossus  putting Nightcrawler in a coma  and trapping Shadowcat with her own power such that she was slowly discorporating  Magneto succeeded in healing Colossus  who

searching for Forge  the X Men battled the Adversary and appeared to die saving Earth on live television  157  The X Men did indeed perish but Roma resurrected them   which resulted in them becoming undetectable to electronics  While improving public opinion on the heroism of mutants  their friends and family  including the New Mutants and X Factor  believed them to be dead  The X Men maintained this as a cover story to protect their family and friends from the retribution of super villains  and relocated to the Australian Outback after defeating the Reavers  whose base they claimed  158

part of the Phoenix Force entered after committing suicide on the Moon  Pryor struck a deal with the demon N Astirh to become the Goblin Queen out of anger at Cyclops  N Astirh s intentions to

another  defeated the demon  Pryor was suicidal after learning of her origin  and killed herself in an attempt to bring Jean Grey with her  Jean survived  and absorbed the remaining Phoenix essence within Madelyne  This was the first time the X Men were able to confirm that Jean Grey was alive  Divided Rogue is pulled into the Siege Perilous Added by Autolux Besides resurrecting the X Men  Roma gave them a mysterious jewel called the Siege Perilous  The magical gem could enlarge to a giant portal  All who entered would be judged by higher powers  their good acts and ill deeds weighed  and be reborn in a new life without remembering their past lives  The X Men found no use for the jewel during the Inferno  against the alien Brood  or when returning to the Savage Land  Curious  Dazzler used her powers to take a look inside the illuminated gem  She saw various alternate versions of herself before they were all murdered and merged into a single being that warned Dazzler everyone dies sometime  Later the same day  a merged Nimrod Mastermold attacked the X Men  With only herself and Rogue left standing  Dazzler threw the Siege Perilous behind the Sentinel hoping her enemy would be sucked into the portal  While the portal appeared  the Nimrod Mastermold anchored itself to the ground and grabbed Rogue as she tried to push it through  With no other choice  Dazzler blasted both of them into the gateway  With Rogue presumed dead  and other members leaving the team  the X Men were down to only Havok  Dazzler  Colossus and Psylocke  Back in the Savage Land to rescue Polaris  Psylocke had a precognitive vision of the X Men dying back in the Australian Outback and a bound Gateway pointing to the Siege Perilous  Worried about her vision  Betsy wasn t able to warn the others before Gateway teleported them back to the Outback  Immediately sensing the Reavers approaching when they returned to Australia  Psylocke suggested using the Siege Perilous to escape as the X Men were in no condition to face the deadly cyborgs  After a brief discussion  and telepathic convincing of Havok  all four mutants entered the gateway  As the portal collapsed back into a gem  Donald Pierce arrived and smashed the jewel to pieces  Muir Island X Men Added by M1shawhan Meanwhile  Polaris boarded a freighter to travel back home  Her magnetic powers stolen by Zaladane and replaced with awkward size changing and invulnerability  Lorna couldn t simply fly back to her friends  Strangely  she noticed the sailors began to act weird and that her body had become a nexus for negative emotional energy  As chaos erupted on board  Lorna contacted Muir Island for help bringing Banshee to rescue her  Lorna informed all the Muir Island residents that the X Men were indeed alive  but a sudden siege occurred before anything could be done  A haphazardly created interim group of X Men was formed to protect allies of the mutants living on Muir Island from an attack by Pierce s Reavers  Lorna joined mutants Forge  Banshee  Multiple Man  Siryn  the Morlock Sunder  X Allies Sharon Friedlander  Tom Corsi  Alysande Stuart  Amanda Sefton  Legion and Moira MacTaggart to defend the research center  Val Cooper dispatched Freedom Force to assist  Though the attack was repelled  Sunder and Stonewall were killed by the cyborgs while Destiny was murdered by a Shadow King possessed Legion  The remaining  Muir Island X Men  stayed  under the influence of the psychic entity  Weeks after entering the gateway  Rogue returned to the empty Australian base with her memory intact  At first believing the cosmic judging was a joke  she realized the memories she contained belonging to Carol Danvers were gone  She was then attacked by Ms  Marvel  and discovered the Siege Perilous had given both personalities within Rogue a body connected to a single life force  Rogue was prepared to die  but Magneto intervened and killed Danvers  The two spent time in the Savage Land  allying themselves with Ka Zar against Zaladane  and began to become attracted to one another  Their relationship ended before it had a chance to blossom once Magneto killed Zaladane  which Rogue opposed  After the Reaver assault Forge and Banshee began to look for the missing X Men  and found Colossus in New York City under the guise of Peter Nicholas  His memory of his superhero life and his special powers gone  Colossus had become a popular artist in Soho living with Genoshan emigrants  Peter even began a relationship with the Morlock Callisto  her face molded in that of a beautiful model by Masque  Realizing he was happy in his new life  his former teammates left him alone  The fate of Colossus Added by M1shawhan Psylocke was found naked and amnesiac by agents of The Hand  Her mind and soul were transferred into the Asian body of Kwannon  and she was brainwashed into becoming the Lady Mandarin  On a mission she faced Wolverine  and upon attacking him with her psychic knife the backlash of memories of the X Men began to break her free from the Hand s control  Storm  believed killed by the Nanny  had actually been de aged to a pre teenager  loosing her memories of her adult life in the process  She was framed for murder by the Shadow King  and went back to being a thief  Eventually she crossed paths with Gambit and the two began a partnership  stealing from the rich and giving to the poor  Found by the Nanny before long  the two defeated her and though Ororo s memories were returned she remained a child  Ororo took Gambit with her to the X Mansion and reunited with Forge and Banshee as they were on their search for the missing X Men  Unfortunately  tests proved Storm was stuck without her powers as a prepubescent  Dazzler was discovered on the beach by Guido  Lila Cheney s bodyguard  Alison learned of her past life through computer files  and became trapped in the Mojoverse after a teleport of Lila s went awry when trying to save Longshot from Spiral  X Tinction Agenda The partially regrouped team at the X Mansion was soon thrown another hurdle  Magistrates from Genosha arrived to capture the mutants for crimes committed on the island  Ororo recognized one of the attackers to be Havok  but couldn t warn her teammates before she was defeated along with the New Mutant members Warlock  Wolfsbane  Rictor  and Boom Boom  All were transported to Genosha by Pipeline and brought before their true captor  Cameron Hodge  Once an X Factor ally  Hodge actually despised mutants and made a deal with the demon N Astirh to become immortal  and came to take control of the nation  Warlock  already weakened  was able to help his friends escape  Hodge intended to acquire Warlocks transformation powers  but Wolfsbane returned to stop the transfer though Warlock was already dead  Rhane was recaptured  and transformed into a mutate  Havok captures Storm Added by M1shawhan X Factor joined the remaining New Mutants and interim X Men  consisting only of Gambit  Forge  and Banshee  on a rescue mission to save their friends  In South Asia Wolverine  Psylocke  and Jubilee heard of their friend s fates on the news and ended up rescuing Boom Boom and Rictor  Jubilee tended to the young mutants  while Logan and Betsy infiltrated Hodge s citadel only to be discovered by Havok  The X Men and X Factor fared no better  with both squads becoming captives  When Havok saw his brother defeated by Hodge  Alex remembered his life before entering the Siege Perilous  Meanwhile Storm had taken Genegineer David Moreau  creator of the mutate process  hostage but was defeated by Hodge and forced to become a mutate  A mock trial found the mutants guilty  and all were given the choice of being transformed into a mutate or death  They chose death  but Hodge first had to deal with the insurrection of the Genegineer  aware Hodge s actions were insane  and many magistrates including Wipeout  As Wipeout had canceled most of the X Team s mutant powers  Hodge killed him hoping they would be permanently lost  Unbeknownst to Hodge  Moreau gave Storm the ability to return the mutants their gifts rather than into a mutate  A rebel magistrate brought Storm to the X Men and as she used her powers  Ororo reverted back into an adult and regained her powers  Ororo then restored her teammates  abilities  and all escaped and started hunting for Hodge  Concurrently  Moreau planted a bomb to destroy all laboratories within the citadel  Furious  Hodge killed the traitor  though the Genegineer was able to weaken him considerably  The X Men eventually found their enemy and attacked  Cyclops and Havok unleashed a powerful assault destroying all but Hodge s head which falls near Wolfsbane  who rips it to pieces in a rage  Rictor caused tremors to finally destroy the citadel  burying the remains of Hodge s broken body  Chief Magistrate Anderson led a revolt against the Genoshan government  and the Magistrates were able to seize power  Havok and Wolfsbane choose to stay behind and make sure mutants were given fair treatment  Because of the intense media coverage of the Genoshan disaster  the world learned the X Men were still alive  Regardless  the reunited mutants returned to Salem Center and began to rebuild the team that had been splintered for months  Upon their arrival  Warlock s ashes were spread over Doug Ramsey s grave  Muir Island Saga Xavier s legs are broken Added by M1shawhan Unfortunately  there was no rest for the X Men  Soon after Xavier returned to Earth from his adventures with the Starjammers  an old enemy returned  The Shadow King had been spreading waves of hate around the globe  and used Polaris to absorb the negative emotional energy to empower himself to unthinkable levels  Professor X used Cerebro to identify the source of the chaos  He returned from his sojourn in space and sent the X Men to Muir Island to confront their oddly acting allies  It seems Moira MacTaggart had been training the  Muir Island X Men   and new visitors Rogue and Lila Cheney had taken up residence and participated in duels  When the mutants arrived to investigate  they were surprised and defeated by the Shadow King controlled island residents  Back in Westchester  Stevie Hunter was attacked by a possessed Colossus  Xavier found no way to break Shadow King s control over him other than erasing the Peter Nicholas personality completely  Charles then asked his original students  X Factor  to rescue the current X Team  On Muir Island  Shadow King used Legion as his human host after the current one was killed while Forge eluded possession and even freed some of his friends  The remaining heroes in good mind were divided into three teams  focusing on an astral plane attack on Farouk with a second team defending Xavier from physical attacks and a third freeing Polaris and disrupting their enemies  nexus  Forge succeeded in using a neuro synaptic weapon on Psylocke so she could use her  psychic knife  on Polaris to destroy Farouk s nexus  Xavier was badly wounded during the battle  his legs broken and again confined to a wheelchair  As Shadow King disappeared  Legion fell into a coma and the devastation of Muir Island was apparent  Most importantly  all five X Factor members returned to the X Men along with Rogue and Colossus  after many years the X Men had finally reunited as one team  Blue and Gold The X Men Reunite Added by AbareKiller With the team now larger than ever before  organization suddenly became essential  To remain effective as a group  the X Men were divided into two squads  Blue and Gold  The Blue Squad battled Magneto and his Acolytes in Genosha  Discovering Moira MacTaggart had altered his DNA years ago when he was regressed to a toddler  Magneto questioned if his recent turn to heroics was a result of Moira s tampering or his own free will  Magneto forced Moira to brainwash the Blue Squad into joining his Acolytes on Asteroid M  a space station haven for mutants  To make matters worse  the American and Russian governments decided to use a plasma cannon on the space station to end the threat of Magneto once and for all  Worried about their friends  the Gold Squad sneaked on board and rescued their teammates  while a traitorous Fabian Cortez abandoned Asteroid M and planned to make Magneto a martyr so mutants around the world would join him  Xavier tried to talk the Acolytes into escaping the doomed base with the X Men  but Magneto and his followers instead stayed to die  The Gold Squad began their tenure attending a party at the Hellfire Club thrown by Emma Frost  The White Queen explained she and other members of the Club were targets of assassination  and sought the help of her former enemies  Before long  Trevor Fitzroy arrived and began to attack Frost and her Hellions  In Australia  Donald Pierce was attacked by Fitzroy s Sentinels  Gateway teleported Pierce to New York  along with three of the attacking Sentinels  The Sentinels seemingly killed Frost  Pierce  and Jean Grey  Fitzroy drained the life of every Hellion he could subdue  killing all of Frost s students  Returning her body to the X Mansion  Xavier realized Jean s consciousness had been relocated to Emma Frost s body  Jean woke up while in the custody of Fitzroy and Shinobi Shaw  who were revealed to be members of the Upstarts  The Upstarts competed in a contest of murder run by the Gamesmaster  Their first targets were former and current Hellfire Club members  and Fitzroy believed he had won and was entitled to run the Upstarts  Jean surprised the two by using telekinesis  a power Emma Frost lacked  and escaped with the X Men  Fitzroy used the Hellions life essence to open a portal to the future and brought some allies  Bishop  a mutant born in the 21st century  arrived instead  Fitzroy escaped  and Bishop joined the present day X Men  Xavier realized the White Queen s psyche also remained alive  and returned it to her own comatose body  Battles with Omega Red  a member of the Soviet Super Soldier program  and Hazard followed  X Cutioner s Song The two teams were brought together when Professor X was shot while giving a speech during a Lila Cheney peace concert  Stryfe  disguised as Cable  shot Xavier and infected him with a technoorganic virus  Simultaneously  Cyclops and Jean Grey were abducted by the Horsemen of Apocalypse in Westchester  They were delivered to Mr  Sinister  who was disguised as Apocalypse unbeknownst to the Horsemen  Sinister handed the Summers couple over to Stryfe in exchange for a mysterious container  The Gold Team searched for Scott and Jean while the Blue Team joined X Factor in hunting down X Force for information on Cable s whereabouts  Cable convinced Wolverine and Bishop it was Stryfe who shot Xavier and not himself  revealing both were from the future and had long been enemies  Apocalypse woke up from rejuvenation to find he had been impersonated  and was defeated by Stryfe  With Beast and Dr  MacTaggert unable to save Xavier  they were forced to work with Apocalypse  Apocalypse sped up the cycle of the techno organic virus  forcing the pathogen to burn itself out before it can kill the Professor  Wolverine received a subconscious telepathic message from Jean  hinting that she was being held captive on the Moon  The X Men found Stryfe s Moon base and launched an attack  Scott and Jean were rescued  though Cable disappeared with Stryfe into the timestream  Meanwhile  Sinister opened his container to find nothing inside  It was soon discovered that Essex had opened a Pandora s Box with Stryfe s final revenge on the Summers clan  the mutant infecting Legacy Virus  Fatal Attractions Following the assassination attempt  the X Men seemingly dealt with one

vowing to care for him until he healed  As Wolverine left the team following his injury  Sabretooth came to stay at the mansion for rehabilitation  A short time later  Scott and Jean finally married  They spent their honeymoon raising a young Nathan Summers in the far future  Phalanx Covenant Not long after  the X Men faced with the Phalanx  The Phalanx  a techno organic race bent on ruling the world  took over the X Mansion and assumed the form of various X Men  Banshee managed to escape along with the captive Sabretooth  a recovering Emma Frost  and the youngest X Man Jubilee  Banshee

Apocalypse began his world domination a decade earlier than he would ve otherwise  Rather than be defeated by X Factor  Apocalypse and his Horseman conquered all of North America in a world known as the Age of Apocalypse  He erected a citadel on Manhattan Island with breeding pens and ghastly experiments run by Sinister and Dark Beast  a twisted version of Hank McCoy  Humans fled to Europe  and were frequently massacred by Sentinels  In this reality  the X Men were created by Magneto and acted as freedom fighters  Although they suffered many casualties  the X Men were able to send Bishop

prepared for them  Sinister revealed that he was using Scott s mind as a map for his own mind which gave Emma the upper hand as she knew Scott s mind better than anyone  Emma used this to return the Dreaming Celestial head to its body and destroy Sinister s body and the other doppelgangers  but Sinister made one last doppelganger  He congratulated the heroes on their effort and revealed that all
