American middle class From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search The American middle class is a social class in the United States  1  2  While the concept is typically ambiguous in popular opinion and common language use  3  contemporary social scientists have put forward several  more or less congruent  theories on the American middle class  Depending on class model used  the middle class may constitute anywhere from 25  to 66  of households  One of first major studies of the middle class in America  White Collar  The American Middle Classes  was made by sociologist C  Wright Mills in 1951  Later sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert of Hamilton College commonly divide the middle class into two sub groups  Constituting roughly 15  to 20  of households is the upper or professional middle class consisting of highly educated  salaried professionals and managers  Constituting roughly one third of households is the lower middle class consisting mostly of semi professionals  skilled craftsmen and lower level management  2  4  Middle class persons commonly have a comfortable standard of living  significant economic security  considerable work autonomy and rely on their expertise to sustain themselves  5  Everyone wants to believe they are middle class   But this eagerness   has led the definition to be stretched like a bungee cord   used to defend attack describe everything   The Drum Major Institute   places the range for middle class at individuals making between  25 000 and  100 000 a year  Ah yes  there s a group of people bound to run into each other while house hunting   Dante Chinni 3  Members of the middle class belong to diverse groups which overlap with each other  Overall  middle class persons  especially upper middle class individuals  are characterized by conceptualizing  creating and consulting  Thus  college education is one of the main indicators of middle class status  Largely attributed to the nature of middle class occupations  middle class values tend to emphasize independence  adherence to intrinsic standards  valuing innovation and respecting non conformity  2  5 Politically more active than other demographics  college educated middle class professionals are split between the two major parties  6 Income varies considerably from near the national median to well in excess of  100 000  2  4 Household income figures  however  do not always reflect class status and standard of living  as they are largely influenced by the number of income earners and fail to recognize household size  It is therefore possible for a large  dual earner  lower middle class household to out earn a small  one earner  upper middle class household  5  The middle classes are very influential  as they encompass the majority of voters  writers  teachers  journalists  and editors  7  Most societal trends in the US originate within the middle classes  8  Contents 1 History 2 Sub divisions 2 1 The professional

Social class in American history  edit  Sub divisions The middle class by one definition consists of an upper middle class  made up of professionals distinguished by exceptionally high educational attainment as well as high economic security  and a lower middle class  consisting of semi professionals  While the groups overlap  differences between those at the center of both groups are considerable  The lower middle class has lower educational attainment  considerably less workplace autonomy  and lower incomes than the upper middle class  With the emergence of a two tier labor market  the economic benefits and life chances of upper middle class professionals have grown considerably compared to those of the lower middle class  2  5  The lower middle class needs two income earners in order to sustain a comfortable standard of living  while many upper middle class households can maintain a similar standard of living with just one income earner  9  10   edit  The professional managerial middle class For more details on this topic  see Upper middle class in the United States  The  professional class   also called the  upper middle class   consists mostly of white collar professionals  most of whom are highly educated  salaried professionals whose work is largely self directed  Many have graduate degrees  with educational attainment serving as the main distinguishing feature of this class  Household incomes commonly exceed  100 000  2  5  11  Class members typically hold graduate degrees  2  12  These professionals typically conceptualize  create  consult  and supervise  As a result  upper middle class employees enjoy great autonomy in the work place and are more satisfied with their careers than non professional middle class individuals  In terms of financial wealth income  the professional middle class fits in the top third  but seldom reach the top 5  of American society  13  According to sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert  James Henslin  Joseph Hickey  and William Thompson  the upper middle class constitutes 15  of the population  2  The upper middle class has grown    and its composition has changed  Increasingly salaried managers and professionals have replaced individual business owners and independent professionals  The key to the success of the upper middle class is the growing importance of educational certification    its lifestyles and opinions are becoming increasingly normative for the whole society  It is in fact a porous class  open to people    who earn the right credentials  outdated    Dennis Gilbert  The American Class Structure  1998  14  Values and mannerisms are difficult to pinpoint for a group encompassing millions of persons  Naturally  any large group of people will feature social diversity to some extent  However  some generalizations can be made using education and income as class defining criteria  William Thompson and Joseph Hickey noted that upper middle class individual have a more direct and confident manner of speech  2  In her 1989 publication Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech  Erica Hoff Ginsberg found that among her surveyed subjects   Upper middle class mothers talked more per unit of time and sustained longer interactions with children   She also found that the speech of upper middle class mothers differs  in its functional  discourse  and lexico syntactic properties   from those in the working class  15  Upper middle class manners tend to require individuals to engage in conversational discourse with rather distant associates and to abstain from sharing excessive personal information  This contradicts working class speech patterns  which often include frequent mentions of one s personal life  16  Further research also suggests that working class parents emphasize conformity  traditional gender roles  and the adherence to external standards in their children  such as being neat and clean and   believing  in strict leadership    Gilbert  1998  This contrasted with professional class households  where gender roles were more egalitarian and loosely defined  Upper middle class children were largely taught to adhere to internal standards  with curiosity  individuality  self direction  and openness to new ideas being emphasized  14  While a recent Gallup survey showed mass affluent households to be conservative on economic issues while liberal on social issues  the upper middle class seems to be relatively politically polarized  In the 2006 mid term elections both Democrats and Republicans received over 40  of the vote from those with advanced degrees and those in households with six figure incomes  While households with incomes exceeding  100 000 tend to favor Republicans slightly  they are also the only income demographic where Ralph Nader won more than 1  of the vote  Among those with graduate degrees  a smaller group than those with six figure incomes  the majority tends to vote Democratic 17  with roughly 1  having voted for Nader in 2004  18  Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert  William Thompson  and Joseph Hickey estimate the upper middle class to constitute roughly 15  of the population  Using this figure  one may conclude that the American upper middle class consist of professionals making more than  62 500 who commonly reside in households with six figure incomes  2  14  19  20  Both of these figures are considerably above the national median of  32 000 regarding individual income and  46 000 for households  Many upper middle class professions feature salaries above  67 348  which was the median household income for a household with two income earners in 2003  21  22  For example  the median salary for economists was  72 780  meaning that the majority of economists out earn the majority of two income households with their single salaries alone  23  Overall  the median household income of a household whose householder had a bachelor s degree or higher was  77 179  The median household income for those with a master s degree was  81 023  while those with a doctorate or professional degree had a median income above  100 000 annually  2  14  24   edit  Lower middle class The lower middle class is the second most populous according to both Gilbert s as well as Thompson  amp  Hickey s models  constituting roughly one third of the population  the same percentage as the working class  However  according to James M  Henslin  who also divides the middle class into two sub groups  the lower middle class is the most populous  constituting 34  of the population  4  In all three class models the lower middle class is said to consist of  semi professionals  and lower level white collar employees  An adaptation by sociologists Brian K  William  Stacy C  Sawyer  and Carl M  Wahlstrom of Dennis Gilbert s class model gave the following description of the lower middle class  4  The lower middle class    these are people in technical and lower level management positions who work for those in the upper middle class as lower managers  craftspeople  and the like  They enjoy a reasonably comfortable standard of living  although it is constantly threatened by taxes and inflation  Generally  they have a Bachelor s and sometimes Masters college degree   Brian K  William  Stacy C  Sawyer and Carl M  Wahlstrom  Marriages  Families  amp  Intimate Relationships  2006  Adapted from Dennis Gilbert 1997  and Joseph Kahl 1993  4  Taking into account the percentages provided in the six class model by Gilbert  as well as the model of Thompson and Hickey  one can apply US Census Bureau statistics regarding income  According to these class models the lower middle class is located roughly between the 52nd and 84th percentile of society  In terms of personal income distribution in 2005  that would mean gross annual personal incomes from about  32 500 to  60 000  20  As 42  of all households  and the majority of those in the top 40   had two income earners  household income figures would be significantly higher  ranging from roughly  50 000 to  100 000 annually  13  In terms of educational attainment  27  of persons had a Bachelor s degree or higher  If the upper middle and upper class combined are to constitute 16  of the population  it becomes clear that some of those in the lower middle class boast college degrees or some college education  25   edit  Working class majority Seen from a sociological perspective based on class cleavages  the majority of Americans can be described as members of the working class  26  The use of the term  working class  is applicable if the position of individuals  households and families in relation to the production of goods and services is the main determinant of social class  Class distinctions are seen in the distribution of individuals within society whose influence and importance differ  The nature of a person s work and the associated degrees of influence  responsibility  and complexity determine a person s social class  The degree of influence and responsibility a person has or the more complex the work  the higher his or her status in society  27  As qualified personnel become scarce for relatively important  responsible  and complex occupations income increases  following the economic theory of scarcity resulting in value  According to this approach  occupation becomes more essential in determining class than income  27  Whereas professionals tend to create  conceptualize  consult and instruct  most Americans do not enjoy a high degree of independence in their work  as they merely follow set instructions  8  26  Definitions of the working class are confusing  Defined in terms of income  they may be split into middle middle or statistical middle class in order to speak to issues of class structure  Class models such as Dennis Gilbert or Thompson and Hickey estimate that roughly 53  of Americans are members of the working or lower classes  2  14  Factors such as nature of work and lack of influence within their jobs leads some theorists to the conclusion that most Americans are working class  They have data that shows the majority of workers are not paid to share their ideas  These workers are closely supervised and do not enjoy independence in their jobs  Also they are not paid to think  For example  The median annual earnings of salaried dentists were  136 960 in May 2006  indicating a high degree of scarcity for qualified personnel  The opinions and thoughts of dentists  much like those of other professionals  are sought after by their organizations and clients  The dentist creates a diagnosis  consults the patient  and conceptualizes a treatment  28 Dental assistants made roughly  14 40 an hour  about  32 000 annually  Unlike dentists  dental assistants do not have much influence over the treatment of patients  29  They carry out routine procedures and follow the dentists  instructions  Here we see that a dental assistant being classified as working class  Similar relationships can be observed in other occupations   edit  Vernacular middle class The term middle class in more colloquial language use may refer to all those individuals who might at one point or another be identified as middle class  as they occupy neither extreme of the socio economic strata  Most of those with households income between  40 000 and  95 000 identify as  middle class   The term can also be used to describe those at the actual center of the income strata  who may also be referred to as the middle middle class  There are many different theories on the middle middle class  The middle middle class may be composed of those households with annual incomes of 80  to 120  of the national median household income  Persons in this income range could  in accordance to solely economic reasoning  be referred to as the American average  Such households would boast annual incomes ranging from  35 200 to  52 800  and thus be located in the middle of the income range  13  Some of these households  while actually being in the middle and thus sometimes referred to as being middle class  cannot  however  afford the middle class lifestyle  9  Yet another definition states that the statistical middle class includes all those households with income ranging from  25 000 to  100 000  1  This is  however  a very vague definition  as it includes persons from all but the lowest quintile  Using this definition creates a class so economically fragmented that it would lump together those who are struggling to make ends meet with two incomes and those who are able to live the iconic middle class lifestyle with just one income and are highly educated   edit  Weberian definition Some modern theories of political economy consider a large middle class to be a beneficial  stabilizing influence on society  because it has neither the possibly explosive revolutionary tendencies of the lower class  nor the absolutist tendencies of an entrenched upper class  Most sociological definitions of middle class follow Max Weber  Here the middle class is defined as consisting of professionals or business owners who share a culture of domesticity and sub urbanity and a level of relative security against social crisis  in the form of socially desired skill or wealth  Thus the theory on the middle class by Max Weber can be cited as one that supports the notion of the middle class being composed of a quasi elite of professionals and managers  who are largely immune to economic downturns and trends such as out sourcing which affect the statistical middle class  10   edit  Income Main articles  Personal income in the United States and Household income in the United States As social classes lack clear boundaries and overlap there are no definite income thresholds as for what is considered middle class  Sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies a male making  57 000 and a female making  40 000 with a combined households income of  97 000 as a typical middle class family  30  Sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey estimate an income range of roughly  35 000 to  75 000 for the lower middle class and  100 000 or more for the upper middle class  Many social scientists including economist Michael Zweig and sociologist Dennis Gilbert contend that middle class persons usually have above median incomes  Median income levels Households Persons  age 25 or older with earnings Household income by race All households Dual earner households Per household member Males Females Both sexes

Education and income Educational attainment is one of the most prominent determinants of class status  As educational attainment represents expertise  which is a necessary component of the capitalistic market system  its ownership may be seen as the ownership of one of the factors of production  11  In other words  those with advanced degrees already own one of the essential buttresses of the economy  expertise  Additionally educational attainment is basis for occupational selection  Those with higher educational attainment tend to be positioned in occupations with greater autonomy  influence over the organizational process  and better financial compensation  While economic compensation is merely the result of scarcity  educational attainment may be related to that very economic principle as well  The attainment of a graduate degree represents the acquisition of expertise  a factor of production  that in itself may be scarce  thus leading to better financial compensation for the owner  11  As stated above  the upper middle class features a strong reliance on educational attainment  the ownership of expertise  for much of its social and economic well being  8  24  The

households among the quintiles Income is one of a household s attributes most commonly used to determine its class status  Yet  income may not always accurately reflect a household s position within society or the economy  27  Unlike personal income  household income does not reflect occupational achievement as much as it measures the number of income earners  Sociologist Dennis Gilbert acknowledges that a working class household with two income earners may out earn a single income upper middle class household  as the number of income earners has evolved into one of the most important variables in determining household income  For example  according to the US Department of Labor  two registered nurses could quite easily command a household income of  126 000 annually  31  while the median income for a lawyer was  94 930  32  Furthermore  household income fails to recognize household size  For example  a single attorney  earning  95 000  may have a higher standard of living than a family of four with an income of  120 000  Yet household income is still a commonly used class indicator  as household members share the same economic fate and class position  14  The parade  of income earners with height representing income  suggest that  the  relationship between the distribution of income and the class structure is    blurred in the middle    we saw dual income working class marchers looking down on single income upper middle class marchers  In sum  the class structures as we have defined it    does not exactly match the distribution of household income   Dennis Gilbert  The American Class Structure  1998  edit  Influence The influence of the middle class depends on which theory one utilizes  If the middle class is defined as a modern bourgeoisie  the  middle class  has great influence  If middle class is used in a manner that includes all persons who are at neither extreme of the social strata  it might still be influential  as such definition may include the  professional middle class   which is then commonly referred to as the  upper middle class   Despite the fact that the professional  upper  middle class is a privileged minority  it is the perhaps the most influential class in the United States  8  Most ideas that find their way into the cultural mainstream    are crafted by a relative elite  people who are well educated  reasonably well paid  and who overlap  socially and through family ties  with at least the middling levels of the business community in short  the professional middle class   Barbara Ehrenreich Several reasons can be cited as to why the professional middle class is so influential  One is that journalists  commentators  writers  professors  economists  and political scientists  who are essential in shaping public opinion  are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class  Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle class persons in post secondary education  another essential instrument in regards to shaping public opinion  it should come as no surprise that the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi elite has become indicative of the American mainstream itself  In addition to setting trends  the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties  meaning that middle class professionals spend much of their work life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker  8  Yet another reason is the economic clout generated by this class  In 2005  according to US Census statistics  the top third of society  excluding the top 5   controlled the largest share of income in the United States  13  Although some in the statistical middle class  for example  police officers and fire fighters in the more affluent suburbs in the San Francisco Bay Area  may have lifestyles as comfortable as those found among the ranks of the professional middle class  only few have the same degree of autonomy and influence over society as those in the professional middle class  8  Other white collar members of the statistical middle class may not only be unable to afford the middle class lifestyle 9  but also lack the influence found in the professional middle class  33   edit  Typical occupations Office buildings such as this are often the place of work for the vast majority of middle class Americans  whether they are upper middle class professional or lower middle class secretaries  Note that according to the many different ways of sub dividing the middle class  some of the occupations indicative of the professional middle class might be categorized as upper middle or lower middle  As mentioned above  typical occupations for members of the middle class are those identified as being part of  the professions  and often include managerial duties as well  with all being white collar  There is great diversity among the occupations found among those living the middle class lifestyle  and the appropriateness of some occupations being placed here will depend on each individual s personal outlook  The following is a list of occupations one might expect to find among this class  Accountants  Professors  Post secondary educators   Physicians  Engineers  Lawyers  Architects  Journalists  Mid level corporate managers  Writers  Economists  Political Scientists  Urban planners  Financial managers  High school teachers  Registered Nurses  RNs   Pharmacists and analysts  etc    8  34  Autonomy is often seen as one of the greatest measurement of a person s class status  Even though some working class employees might also enjoy largely self directed work  large degrees of autonomy in the work place  as well as influence over the organizational process  which are commonly the results of obtained expertise  these can still be seen as hallmarks of upper middle class or professional middle class professions  11  As for the lower middle class  other less prestigious occupations  many sales positions  entry level management  secretaries  etc   would be included  35  In addition to professionals whose work is largely self directed and includes managerial duties  many other less privileged members of the statistical middle class would find themselves in semi independent to independent white collar positions  Many of those in the statistical middle class might work in what are called the professional support fields  These fields include occupations such as dental hygienists  and other professional and sales support   edit  Consumption An upscale home in Salinas  California The American middle class  at least those living the lifestyle  has become known around the world for conspicuous consumption  To this day  the professional middle class in the United States holds the world record for having the largest homes  most appliances  and most automobiles  In 2005  the average new home had a square footage of 2 434 square feet  roughly 226 square meters  with 58  of these homes having ceilings with heights in excess of nine feet on the first floor  As new homes only represent a small portion of the housing stock in the US  with most suburban homes having been built in the 1970s when the average square footage was 1 600  36  it is fair to assume that these large new suburban homes will be inhabited by members of the professional middle class  Overall  many social critics and intellectuals  most of whom are members of the professional middle class themselves  have commented on the extravagant consumption habits of the professional middle class  It is also often pointed out that the suburban lifestyle of the American professional middle class is a major reason for its record consumption  The increasing materialism  even among such a highly educated class  is also often claimed to be connected to the notion of rugged individualism which gained popularity among the ranks of the professional middle class in the 1970s and 80s  8  34   edit  Academic models

share of net income was 14   27 8  less than its share of gross income  but nonetheless nearly twice as large as in 1979  when it was clocked at 7 5   37  The reduced size of the share of aggregate share of income  both pre and after tax  of the middle class has been attributed to the reduced bargaining power of wage earning employees  caused by the decline of unions  a lessening of government redistribution  43  and technological changes which have created opportunities for certain people to accumulate far greater relative wealth very quickly  including larger markets due to globalization and Information Age technologies allowing faster and wider distribution of work product   The notion that the middle class is shrinking is controversial because the economic boundaries that define the middle class vary  Households that earn between  25 000 and  75 000 represent approximately the middle half of the income distribution tables provided by the U S  Census Bureau  Over the past two decades  the number of households in those brackets decreased by 3 9   from 48 2  to 44 3   During the same time period  the number of households with incomes below  25 000 decreased 3 5   from 28 7  to 25 2   while the number of households with incomes above  75 000 increased over 7   from 23 2  to 30 4   44  A possible explanation for the increase in the higher earnings categories is that more households now have two wage earners  45  However  a closer analysis reveals all of the 7  increase can be found in households who earn over  100 000  44  The change has not always been in the same direction  Poverty rates increased early in the 1980s until late in the 1990s when they started to go back down  Since 2000  the percent of all people living in poverty has risen from 11 3  to 15 1  in 2010 This statistical measure of the poverty rate takes into account only a household s current year s income  while ignoring the actual net worth of the household   44  46  A study by Brookings Institution in June 2006 revealed that Middle income neighborhoods as a proportion of all metropolitan neighborhoods declined from 58 percent in 1970 to 41 percent in 2000  As housing costs increase  the middle class is squeezed and forced to live in less desirable areas making upward mobility more difficult  Safety  school systems  and even jobs are all linked to neighborhood types  47  The statistics used to track the share of income going to the top 1  have been criticized by Alan Reynolds  He points out that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed the way that income is defined on tax returns  which is the primary source of data utilized to compile income shares  48  Among these changes includes the fact that beginning in the 1980s  many C Corporations switched to S Corporations  which changed the way that their income is reported on income tax returns  S Corporations report all income on the individual income tax returns of the owners  while C Corporations file a separate tax return and corporate profits are not allocated to any individuals  Prior to 1986  approximately one fourth of all American corporations were S Corporations  but by 1997 this share had risen to more than half  In addition  by 2001 S Corporations were responsible for about 25  of before tax profits  49  This shift to S Corporations means that income previously not included on personal income tax returns appeared there during this change  as S Corporation investors directly pay taxes on corporate profit regardless of whether it is distributed or not  Furthermore  Reynolds points out in the same literature that tax deferred savings accounts grew substantially from the 1980s onward  so that investment income to these accounts was not included as personal income in the years which it accrued  The CBO noted that at the end of 2002   10 1 trillion was in tax deferred retirement plants  and that  9 trillion of that was taxable upon withdrawal  50  These numbers amount to potentially large amounts of investment income to middle class families that are no longer reported on tax returns each year  but were reported prior to the widespread growth of tax deferred retirement plans  Panel data that track the same individuals over time are much more informative than statistical categories that do not correspond to specific people  The Treasury did a study in 2007 that tracked the same individual taxpayers over the age of 25 from 1996 to 2005 and found differing results from what the graph above shows  51  The results showed that during those years  half of taxpayers moved to a different income quintile  with half of those in the bottom quintile moving to a higher one  About 60  of taxpayers in the top 1  in 1996 no longer stayed in that category by 2005  On an absolute scale  the lowest incomes saw the greatest gains in percentage terms and the highest incomes actually declined  Half of those in the bottom 20  in 1996 saw their income at least double during these years  and the median income of the top 1996 top 1  declined by 25 8   The reason that the results are so inconsistent with household income statistics is that household statistics do not track the same people over time  it is important to specify how many of the households in the top 1  in a given year were still there when looking at that category years later and gauging income gains   edit
