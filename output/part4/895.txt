this character that grabbed him to create the character that would be Spider Man     In 1962  with the success of the Fantastic Four  Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting about for a new superhero idea  He said that the idea for Spider Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books  and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify     1 In his autobiography  Lee cites the non superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter The Spider as a great influence     130 and in a multitude of print and video interviews  Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true  note    Looking back on the creation of Spider Man  1990s Marvel editor in chief Tom DeFalco stated he did not believe that Spider Man would have been given a chance in today s comics world  where new characters are vetted with test audiences and marketers     9 At that time  however  Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character s approval     9 In a 1986 interview  Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman s objections  note    Goodman eventually agreed to let Lee try out Spider Man in the upcoming final issue of the canceled science fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy  which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for that single issue   15  Aug  1962      95 Comics historian Greg Theakston says that Lee  after receiving Goodman s approval for the name Spider Man and the  ordinary teen  concept  approached artist Jack Kirby  Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s  in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers  Lee and Kirby  immediately sat down for a story conference  and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages  Steve Ditko would be the inker  note    When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages  Lee recalled   I hated the way he was doing it  Not that he did it badly    it just wasn t the character I wanted  it was too heroic      12 Lee turned to Ditko  who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory  Ditko recalled  One of the first things I did was to work up a costume  A vital  visual part of the character  I had to know how he looked     before I did any breakdowns  For example  A clinging power so he wouldn t have hard shoes or boots  a hidden wrist shooter versus a web gun and holster  etc      I wasn t sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character s face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face  It would also add mystery to the character        In an early recollection of the character s creation  Ditko described his and Lee s contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan  2  Summer 1965    Stan Lee thought the name up  I did costume  web gimmick on wrist  amp  spider signal      At the time  Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton  an art school classmate who  in a 1988 interview with Theakston  recalled that although his contribution to Spider Man was  almost nil   he and Ditko had  worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas  But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own    I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands      14 Kirby disputed Lee s version of the story  and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character s creation  According to Kirby  the idea for Spider Man had originated with Kirby and Joe Simon  who in the 1950s had developed a character called The Silver Spider for the Crestwood comic Black Magic  who was subsequently not used  note    Simon  in his 1990 autobiography  disputed Kirby s account  asserting that Black Magic was not a factor  and that he  Simon  devised the name  Spider Man   later changed to  The Silver Spider    while Kirby outlined the character s story and powers  Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby s character conception became the basis for Simon s Archie Comics superhero the Fly  Artist Steve Ditko stated that Lee liked the name Hawkman from DC Comics  and that  Spider Man  was an outgrowth of that interest     The hyphen was included in the character s name to avoid confusion with DC Comics  Superman     Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider Man version to Lee  who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character but disliked the results in Simon s description   Captain America with cobwebs   note    Writer Mark Evanier notes that Lee s reasoning that Kirby s character was too heroic seems unlikely Kirby still drew the covers for the first issues of Spider Man  Likewise  Kirby s given reason that he was  too busy  to also draw Spider Man in addition to his other duties seems false  as Kirby was  in Evanier s words   always busy      127 Neither Lee s nor Kirby s explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped  Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman  or one of his assistants  decided that Spider Man as drawn and envisioned by Kirby was too similar to the Fly     127 Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly  Ditko recalled that   Stan called Jack about the Fly   adding that   d ays later  Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan s synopsis   It was at this point that the nature of the strip changed   Out went the magic ring  adult Spider Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider Man story would have contained   Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers  a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as  the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series   On the issue of the initial creation  Ditko states   I still don t know whose idea was Spider Man      Kirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was Ditko who  got Spider Man to roll  and the thing caught on because of what he did       Lee  while claiming credit for the initial idea  has acknowledged Ditko s role  stating   If Steve wants to be called co creator  I think he deserves  it        Writer Al Nickerson believes  that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created the Spider Man that we are familiar with today  but that  ultimately  Spider Man came into existence  and prospered  through the efforts of not just one or two  but many  comic book creators       In 2008  an anonymous donor bequeathed the Library of Congress the original 24 pages of Ditko art of Amazing Fantasy  15  including Spider Man s debut and the stories  The Bell Ringer    Man in the Mummy Case   and  There Are Martians Among Us                Commercial success A few months after Spider Man s introduction in Amazing Fantasy  15  Aug  1962   publisher Martin Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it to have been one of the nascent Marvel s highest selling comics     97 A solo ongoing series followed  beginning with The Amazing Spider Man  1  March 1963   The title eventually became Marvel s top selling series     211 with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon  a 1965 Esquire poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons  One interviewee selected Spider Man because he was  beset by woes  money problems  and the question of existence  In short  he is one of us       223 Following Ditko s departure after issue  38  July 1966   John Romita  Sr  replaced him as penciler and would draw the series for the next several years  In 1968  Romita would also draw the character s extra length stories in the comics magazine The Spectacular Spider Man  a proto graphic novel designed to appeal to older readers but which lasted only two issues      Nonetheless  it represented the first Spider Man spin off publication  aside from the original series  summer annuals that began in 1964  An early 1970s Spider Man story led to the revision of the Comics Code  Previously  the Code forbade the depiction of the use of illegal drugs  even negatively  However  in 1970  the Nixon administration s Department of Health  Education  and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti drug message in one of Marvel s top selling titles      239 Lee chose the top selling The Amazing Spider Man  issues  96 98  May July 1971  feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use  In the story  Peter Parker s friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills  When Spider Man fights the Green Goblin  Norman Osborn  Harry s father   Spider Man defeats the Green Goblin  by revealing Harry s drug addiction  While the story had a clear anti drug message  the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval  Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority s approval or seal  The issues sold so well that the industry s self censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised      239 In 1972  a second monthly ongoing series starring Spider Man began  Marvel Team Up  in which Spider Man was paired with other superheroes and villains  In 1976  his second solo series  The Spectacular Spider Man began running parallel to the main series  A third series featuring Spider Man  Web of Spider Man  launched in 1985  replacing Marvel Team Up  The launch of a fourth monthly title in 1990  the  adjectiveless  Spider Man  with the storyline  Torment    written and drawn by popular artist Todd McFarlane  debuted with several different covers  all with the same interior content  The various versions combined sold over 3 million copies  an industry record at the time  There have generally been at least two ongoing Spider Man series at any time  Several limited series  one shots  and loosely related comics have also been published  and Spider Man makes frequent cameos and guest appearances in other comic series      279 The original Amazing Spider Man ran through issue  441  Nov  1998   Writer artist John Byrne then revamped the origin of Spider Man in the 13 issue limited series Spider Man  Chapter One  Dec  1998   Oct  1999  with an issue  0 midway through and some months containing two issues   similar to Byrne s adding details and some revisions to Superman s origin in DC Comics  The Man of Steel      Running concurrently  The Amazing Spider Man was restarted with vol  2   1  Jan  1999   With what would have been vol  2   59  Marvel reintroduced the original numbering  starting with  500  Dec  2003   By the end of 2007  Spider Man regularly appeared in The Amazing Spider Man  New Avengers  Spider Man Family  and various limited series in mainstream Marvel Comics continuity  as well as in the alternate universe series The Amazing Spider Girl  the Ultimate Universe title Ultimate Spider

Amazing Spider Man reached issue  545  Dec  2007   Marvel dropped its spin off ongoing series and instead began publishing The Amazing Spider Man three times monthly  beginning with  546 549  each Jan  2008   The three times monthly scheduling of The Amazing Spider Man lasted until November 2010 when the comic book was increased from 22 pages to 30 pages each issue and published only twice a month  beginning with  648 649  each Nov  2010            Comic book character       Spider Man spider bite jpg The spider bite that gave Peter Parker his powers  Amazing Fantasy  15  art by Steve Ditko  In Forest Hills  Queens  New York City     high school student Peter Parker is a science whiz orphan living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May  As depicted in Amazing Fantasy  15  Aug  1962   he is bitten by a radioactive spider  erroneously classified as an insect in the panel  at a science exhibit and  acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid       Along with super strength  he gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings  Through his native knack for science  he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small  wrist mounted barrels  Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities  he dons a costume and  as  Spider Man   becomes a novelty television star  However   He blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief   and  his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben       Spider Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns  in the story s next to last caption   With great power there must also come great responsibility       Despite his superpowers  Parker struggles to help his widowed aunt pay rent  is taunted by his peers particularly football star Flash Thompson and  as Spider Man  engenders the editorial wrath of newspaper publisher J  Jonah Jameson          As he battles his enemies for the first time      Parker finds juggling his personal life and costumed adventures difficult  In time  Peter graduates from high school      and enrolls at Empire State University  a fictional institution evoking the real life Columbia University and New York University        where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn and first girlfriend Gwen Stacy      and Aunt May introduces him to Mary Jane Watson              As Peter deals with Harry s drug problems  and Harry s father is revealed to be Spider Man s nemesis the Green Goblin  Peter even attempts to give up his costumed identity for a while          Gwen s Stacy s father  New York City Police detective captain George Stacy is accidentally killed during a battle between Spider Man and Doctor Octopus   90  Nov  1970       In the course of his adventures Spider Man has made a wide variety of friends and contacts within the superhero community  who often come to his aid when he faces problems that he cannot solve on his own  In issue  121  June 1973       the Green Goblin throws Gwen Stacy from a tower of either the Brooklyn Bridge  as depicted in the art  or the George Washington Bridge  as given in the text           She dies during Spider Man s rescue attempt  a note on the letters page of issue  125 states   It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey s webbing stopped her so suddenly was  in fact  what killed her       The following issue  the Goblin appears to accidentally kill himself in the ensuing battle with Spider Man      Working through his grief  Parker eventually develops tentative feelings toward Watson  and the two  become confidants rather than lovers       Parker graduates from college in issue  185      and becomes involved with the shy Debra Whitman and the extroverted  flirtatious costumed thief Felicia Hardy  the Black Cat      whom he meets in issue  194  July 1979       From 1984 to 1988  Spider Man wore a different costume than his original  Black with a white spider design  this new costume originated in the Secret Wars limited series  on an alien planet where Spider Man participates in a battle between Earth s major superheroes and villains      Not unexpectedly  the change to a longstanding character s iconic design met with controversy   with many hardcore comics fans decrying it as tantamount to sacrilege  Spider Man s traditional red and blue costume was iconic  they argued  on par with those of his D C  rivals Superman and Batman       The creators then revealed the costume was an alien symbiote which Spider Man is able to reject the symbiote after a difficult struggle      though the symbiote returns several times as Venom for revenge      Parker proposes to Watson in The Amazing Spider Man  290  July 1987   and she accepts two issues later  with the wedding taking place in The Amazing Spider Man Annual  21  1987  promoted with a real life mock wedding using actors at Shea Stadium  with Stan Lee officiating  on June 5  1987          Although David Michelinie  who scripted based on a plot by editor in chief Jim Shooter  said in 2007   I didn t think they actually should  have gotten  married      I had actually planned another version  one that wasn t used       In a controversial storyline  Goletz  Andrew  and Glenn Greenberg  Peter becomes convinced that Ben Reilly  the Scarlet Spider  a clone of Peter created by his college professor Miles Warren  is the real Peter Parker  and that he  Peter  is the clone  Peter gives up the Spider Man identity to Reilly for a time  until Reilly is killed by the returning Green Goblin and revealed to be the clone after all      In stories published in 2005 and 2006  such as  The Other    he develops additional spider like abilities including biological web shooters  toxic stingers that extend from his forearms  the ability to stick individuals to his back  enhanced Spider sense and night vision  and increased strength and speed  Peter later becomes a member of the New Avengers  and reveals his civilian identity to the world      furthering his already numerous problems  His marriage to Mary Jane and public unmasking are later erased in the storyline  One More Day  in a Faustian bargain the demon Mephisto  resulting in several adjustments to the timeline  such as the resurrection of Harry Osborn and the return of Peter s mechanical web shooters and loss of his additional spider like abilities      The controversial     storyline   One More Day   rolled back much of the fictional continuity at the behest of editor in chief Joe Quesada  who said   Peter being single is an intrinsic part of the very foundation of the world of Spider Man       It caused unusual public friction between Quesada and writer Straczynski  who  told Joe that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the  story  arc  but was talked out of doing so      At issue with Straczynski s climax to the arc  Quesada said  was    that we didn t receive the story and methodology to the resolution that we were all expecting  What made that very problematic is that we had four writers and artists well underway on  the sequel arc   Brand New Day  that were expecting and needed  One More Day  to end in the way that we had all agreed it would      The fact that we had to ask for the story to move back to its original intent understandably made Joe upset and caused some major delays and page increases in the series  Also  the science that Joe was going to apply to the retcon of the marriage would have made over 30 years of Spider Man books worthless  because they never would have had happened      I t would have reset way too many things outside of the Spider Man titles  We just couldn t go there                  Personality  People often say glibly that Marvel succeeded by blending super hero adventure stories with soap opera  What Lee and Ditko actually did in The Amazing Spider Man was to make the series an ongoing novelistic chronicle of the lead character s life  Most super heroes had problems no more complex or relevant to their readers  lives than thwarting this month s bad guys     Parker had far more serious concern in his life  coming to terms with the death of a loved one  falling in love for the first time  struggling to make a living  and undergoing crises of conscience   Comics historian Peter Sanderson     As one contemporaneous journalist observed   Spider Man has a terrible identity problem  a marked inferiority complex  and a fear of women  He is anti social  castration ridden  and accident prone      a  functioning neurotic       Agonizing over his choices  always attempting to do right  he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities  who seem unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal      Notes cultural historian Bradford W  Wright  Spider Man s plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect  In the first issue of The Amazing Spider Man  J  Jonah Jameson  publisher of the Daily Bugle  launches an editorial campaign against the  Spider Man menace   The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider Man and makes it impossible for him to earn any more money by performing  Eventually  the bad press leads the authorities to brand him an outlaw  Ironically  Peter finally lands a job as a photographer for Jameson s Daily Bugle      212 The mid 1960s stories reflected the political tensions of the time  as early 1960s Marvel stories had often dealt with the Cold War and Communism      220 223 As Wright observes  From his high school beginnings to his entry into college life  Spider Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people  Fittingly  then  his comic book also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of young people  In 1968  in the wake of actual militant student demonstrations at Columbia University  Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University      Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider Man  As a law upholding liberal  he finds himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives      234 235          Other versions                 Alternative versions of Spider Man Due to Spider Man being successfully popular in the mainstream comics of the Marvel Universe  publishers have been able to introduce different variations of Spider Man outside of mainstream comics as well as introducing reimagined stories in many other multiversed spinoffs such as Ultimate Spider Man  Spider Man 2099 and Spider Man  India  Marvel has also made its own parodies of Spider Man in comics such as Not Brand Echh  which was published in the late 1960s and featured such characters as Peter Pooper alias Spidey Man      and Peter Porker  the Spectacular Spider Ham  who appeared in the 1980s  The fictional character has also inspired a number of deratives such as a manga version of Spider Man drawn by Japanese artist Ryoichi Ikegami as well as Hideshi Hino s The Bug Boy  which has been cited as inspired by Spider Man      Also the French comic T l  Junior published strips based on popular TV series  In the late 1970s  the publisher also produced original Spider Man adventures  Artists included G rald Forton  who later moved to America and worked for Marvel               Powers and equipment                 Spider Man s powers and equipment A bite from a radioactive spider on a school field trip causes a variety of changes in the body of Peter Parker and gives him superpowers      In the original Lee Ditko stories  Spider Man has the ability to cling to walls  superhuman strength  a sixth sense   spider sense   that alerts him to danger  perfect balance and equilibrium  as well as superhuman speed and agility  Some of his comic series have him shooting webs from his wrists      Brilliant  Parker excels in applied science  chemistry  and physics  The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted  but not a genius  However  later writers have depicted the character as a genius      With his talents  he sews his own costume to conceal his identity  and constructs many devices that complement his powers  most notably mechanical web shooters      This mechanism ejects an advanced adhesive  releasing web fluid in a variety of configurations  including a single rope like strand to swing from  a net to bind enemies  a single strand for yanking opponents into objects  strands for whipping foreign objects at enemies  and a simple glob to foul machinery or blind an opponent  He can also weave the web material into simple forms like a shield  a spherical protection or hemispherical barrier  a club  or a hang glider wing  Other equipment include spider tracers  spider shaped adhesive homing beacons keyed to his own spider sense   a light beacon which can either be used as a flashlight or project a  Spider Signal  design  and a specially modified camera that can take pictures automatically           Supporting characters                 List of Spider Man supporting characters Spider Man has had a large range of supporting characters introduced in the comics that are essential in the issues and storylines that star him  After his parents died  Peter Parker was raised by his loving aunt  May Parker  and his uncle and father figure  Ben Parker  After Uncle Ben is murdered by a burglar  Aunt May is virtually Peter s only family  and she and Peter are very close      J  Jonah Jameson is depicted as the publisher of the Daily Bugle and is Peter Parker s boss and as a harsh critic of Spider Man  always saying negative things about the superhero in the newspaper  Although his publishing editor and confidant Robbie Robertson is alway depicted as a supporter of both Peter Parker and Spider Man      Eugene  Flash  Thompson is commonly depicted as Parker s high school tormentor and bully but in some comic issues as a friend as well      Meanwhile Harry Osborn  son of Norman Osborn  is most commonly recognized as Peter s best friend but has also been depicted sometimes as his rival in the comics      Peter Parker s romantic interests range between his first crush  the fellow high school student Liz Allan      to having his first date with Jameson s secretary  Betty Brant      the secretary to Daily Bugle newspaper publisher J  Jonah Jameson  After his breakup with Betty Brant  Parker eventually falls in love with his college girlfriend Gwen Stacy          daughter of New York City Police Department detective captain George Stacy  both of whom are later killed by supervillain enemies of Spider Man         Mary Jane Watson eventually became Peter s best friend and then his wife      Felicia Hardy  the Black Cat  is a reformed cat burglar who had been Spider Man s girlfriend and partner at one point               Enemies                 List of Spider Man enemies Writers and artists over many years have managed to establish an exciting and notable fictional rogues gallery of classic villains to face Spider Man  As with Spider Man  the majority of these villains  powers originate with scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology  trends include a few animal themed costumes or powers and a few of them having green costume as well  note    Early on Spider Man faced supervillains and foes such as the Chameleon  introduced in The Amazing Spider Man  1  March 1963   the Vulture   2  May 1963   Doctor Octopus   3  July 1963   the Sandman   4  Sept  1963   the Lizard   6  Nov  1963   Electro   9  Feb  1964   Mysterio   13  June 1964   the Green Goblin   14  July 1964   Kraven the Hunter   15  Aug  1964  the Scorpion   20  Jan  1965   the Rhino   41  Oct  1966  the first original Lee Romita Spider Man villain     the Shocker   46  March 1967   and the physically powerful and well connected criminal capo Wilson Fisk  also known as the Kingpin      The Clone Saga reveals a supporting character called Miles Warren turn into the villain called the Jackal  the antagonist of the storyline      After Norman Osborn was killed off  a new more mysterious villain called the Hobgoblin was developed to replace him in  238 until Norman was revised later on      After Spider Man turned away his dark costume  there revealed a new popular antagonist with Eddie Brock as Venom in issue  298  May 1988       although he was an ally to Spider Man with a much darker version of him called Carnage in issue  344      At times these enemies of Spider Man have formed groups such as the Sinister Six to oppose Spider Man      The Green Goblin  Doctor Octopus and Venom are generally described or written as one of his greatest and most ruthless enemies                       Cultural influence Spider Man sign appearing in front of The Amazing Adventures of Spider Man in Universal Studios Florida s Islands of Adventure  Comic book writer editor and historian Paul Kupperberg  in The Creation of Spider Man  calls the character s superpowers  nothing too original   what was original was that outside his secret identity  he was a  nerdy high school student       5 Going against typical superhero fare  Spider Man included  heavy doses of soap opera and elements of melodrama   Kupperberg feels that Lee and Ditko had created something new in the world of comics   the flawed superhero with everyday problems   This idea spawned a  comics revolution       6 The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel s early 1960s comic books such as The Amazing Spider Man  The Incredible Hulk  and X Men ushered in a new type of superhero  very different from the certain and all powerful superheroes before them  and changed the public s perception of them      Spider Man has become one of the most recognizable fictional characters in the world  and has been used to sell toys  games  cereal  candy  soap  and many other products      Spider Man has become Marvel s flagship character  and has often been used as the company mascot  When Marvel became the first comic book company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991  the Wall Street Journal announced  Spider Man is coming to Wall Street   the event was in turn promoted with an actor in a Spider Man costume accompanying Stan Lee to the Stock Exchange      254 Since 1962  hundreds of millions of comics featuring the character have been sold around the world      Spider Man joined the Macy s Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1987 to 1998 as one of the balloon floats      designed by John Romita Sr       one of the character s signature artists  A new  different Spider Man balloon float is scheduled to appear from at least 2009 to 2011      In 1981  skyscraper safety activist Dan Goodwin  wearing a Spider Man suit  scaled the Sears Tower in Chicago  Illinois  the Renaissance Tower in Dallas  Texas  and the John Hancock Center in Chicago  Illinois      When Marvel wanted to issue a story dealing with the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks  the company chose the December 2001 issue of The Amazing Spider Man      In 2006  Spider Man garnered major media coverage with the revelation of the character s secret identity      an event detailed in a full page story in the New York Post before the issue containing the story was even released      In 2008  Marvel announced plans to release a series of educational comics the following year in partnership with the United Nations  depicting Spider Man alongside UN Peacekeeping Forces to highlight UN peacekeeping missions      A BusinessWeek article listed Spider Man as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics      Spider Man was named Empire magazine s fifth greatest comic book character      and Fandomania com rated him as  7 on their 100 Greatest Fictional Characters list               In other media                 Spider Man in other media Spider Man has appeared in comics  cartoons  movies  coloring books  novels  records  and children s books      On television  he appeared as the main character in the animated series Spider Man  which aired from 1967 1970 on ABC      the live action series The Amazing Spider Man  1978 1979  starring Nicholas Hammond  the syndicated cartoon Spider Man  1981 1982   Spider Man and His Amazing Friends  1981 1983   Spider Man  The Animated Series  1994 1998   Spider Man Unlimited  1999 2000   Spider

Amazing Life of Stan Lee  Fireside  ISBN 0 684 87305 2   He goes further in his biography  claiming that even while pitching the concept to publisher Martin Goodman   I can t remember if that was literally true or not  but I thought it would lend a big color to my pitch       Detroit Free Press interview with Stan Lee  quoted in The Steve Ditko Reader by Greg Theakston  Pure Imagination  Brooklyn  NY  ISBN 1 56685 011 8   p  12  unnumbered    He gave me 1 000 reasons why Spider Man would never work  Nobody likes spiders  it sounds too much like Superman  and how could a teenager be a superhero  Then I told him I wanted the character to be a very human guy  someone who makes mistakes  who worries  who gets acne  has trouble with his girlfriend  things like that   Goodman replied    He s a hero  He s not an average man   I said   No  we make him an average man who happens to have super powers  that s what will make him good   He told me I was crazy     Ditko  Steve  2000   Roy Thomas  ed   Alter Ego  The Comic Book Artist Collection  TwoMorrows Publishing  ISBN 1893905063     Stan said a new Marvel hero would be introduced in  15  of what became titled Amazing Fantasy   He would be called Spider Man  Jack would do the penciling and I was to ink the character   At this point still   Stan said Spider Man would be a teenager with a magic ring which could transform him into an adult hero    Spider Man  I said it sounded like the Fly  which Joe Simon had done for Archie Comics  Stan called Jack about it but I don t know what was discussed  I never talked to Jack about Spider Man    Later  at some point  I was given the job of drawing Spider Man      Jack Kirby in  Shop Talk  Jack Kirby   Will Eisner s Spirit Magazine  39  February 1982    Spider Man was discussed between Joe Simon and myself  It was the last thing Joe and I had discussed  We had a strip called  The Silver Spider   The Silver Spider was going into a magazine called Black Magic  Black Magic folded with Crestwood  Simon  amp  Kirby s 1950s comics company  and we were left with the script  I believe I said this could become a thing called Spider Man  see  a superhero character  I had a lot of faith in the superhero character that they could be brought back    and I said Spider Man would be a fine character to start with  But Joe had already moved on  So the idea was already there when I talked to Stan     Simon  Joe  with Jim Simon  The Comic Book Makers  Crestwood II  1990  ISBN 1 887591 35 4   There were a few holes in Jack s never dependable memory  For instance  there was no Black Magic involved at all      Jack brought in the Spider Man logo that I had loaned to him before we changed the name to The Silver Spider  Kirby laid out the story to Lee about the kid who finds a ring in a spiderweb  gets his powers from the ring  and goes forth to fight crime armed with The Silver Spider s old web spinning pistol  Stan Lee said   Perfect  just what I want   After obtaining permission from publisher Martin Goodman  Lee told Kirby to pencil up an origin story  Kirby    using parts of an old rejected superhero named Night Fighter    revamped the old Silver Spider script  including revisions suggested by Lee  But when Kirby showed Lee the sample pages  it was Lee s turn to gripe  He had been expecting a skinny young kid who is transformed into a skinny young kid with spider powers  Kirby had him turn into    Captain America with cobwebs  He turned Spider Man over to Steve Ditko  who    ignored Kirby s pages  tossed the character s magic ring  web pistol and goggles    and completely redesigned Spider Man s costume and equipment  In this life  he became high school student Peter Parker  who gets his spider powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider      Lastly  the Spider Man logo was redone and a dashing hyphen added     Mondello  Salvatore  Mar 2004    Spider Man  Superhero in the Liberal Tradition   The Journal of Popular Culture X  1   232

Spider Man exclaims   The George Washington Bridge  It figures Osborn would pick something named after his favorite president  He s got the same sort of hangup for dollar bills   Saffel states   The span portrayed   is the GW s more famous cousin  the Brooklyn Bridge      To address the contradiction in future reprints of the tale  though  Spider Man s dialogue was altered so that he s referring to the Brooklyn Bridge  But the original snafu remains as one of the more visible errors in the history of comics     Sanderson  Marvel Universe  p  84  notes    W hile the script described the site of Gwen s demise as the George Washington Bridge  the art depicted the Brooklyn Bridge  and there is still no agreement as to where it actually took place     Saffel  p  65   Conway  Gerry  w   Kane
