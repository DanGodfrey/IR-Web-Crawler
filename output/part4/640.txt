Human rights in the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article has multiple issues  Please help improve it or discuss these issues on the talk page  Its introduction provides insufficient context for those unfamiliar with the subject  Tagged since May 2009  Its introduction may need to be rewritten to comply with Wikipedia s lead section guidelines  Tagged since September 2009  In 1776  Thomas Jefferson proposed a philosophy of human rights inherent to all people in the Declaration of Independence  asserting that  all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights  that among these are Life  Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness   Historian Joseph J  Ellis calls the Declaration  the most quoted statement of human rights in recorded history   1  Human rights in the United States are legally protected by the Constitution of the United States and amendments  2  3  conferred by treaty  and enacted legislatively through Congress  state legislatures  and plebiscites  state referenda   Federal courts in the United States have jurisdiction over international human rights laws as a federal question  arising under international law  which is part of the law of the United States  4  page needed  The first human rights organization in the Thirteen Colonies of British America  dedicated to the abolition of slavery  was formed by Anthony Benezet in 1775  A year later  the Declaration of Independence advocated for civil liberties based on the self evident truth  that all men are created equal  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights  that among these are Life  Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness   5  This view of human liberties postulates that fundamental rights are not granted by the government but are inalienable and inherent to each individual  anteceding government  6  Holding to these principles  the United States Constitution  adopted in 1787  created a republic that guaranteed several rights and civil liberties  Those rights and liberties were further codified in the Bill of Rights  the first ten amendments of the Constitution  and subsequently extended over time to more universal applicability through judicial rulings and law and reflecting the evolving norms of society   slavery being constitutionally abolished in 1865 and women s suffrage being established nationally in 1920  In the 20th century  the United States took a leading role in the creation of the United Nations and in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  7  Much of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was modeled in part on the U S  Bill of Rights  8  Even as such  the United States is in violation of the Declaration  in as much that  everyone has the right to leave any country  because the government may prevent the entry and exit of anyone from the United States for foreign policy  national security

According to Human Rights  The Essential Reference   the American Declaration of Independence was the first civic document that met a modern definition of human rights   10  The Constitution recognizes a number of inalienable human rights  including freedom of speech  freedom of assembly  freedom of religion  the right to keep and bear arms  freedom from cruel and unusual punishment  and the right to a fair trial by jury  11  Constitutional amendments have been enacted as the needs of the society evolved  The Ninth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment recognize that not all human rights have yet been enumerated  The Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act are examples of human rights that were enumerated by Congress well after the Constitution s writing  The scope of the legal protections of human rights afforded by the US government is defined by case law  particularly by the precedent of the Supreme Court of the United States  Within the federal government  the debate about what may or may not be an emerging human right is held in two forums  the United States Congress  which may enumerate these  and the Supreme Court  which may articulate rights that the law does not spell out  Additionally  individual states  through court action or legislation  have often protected human rights not recognized at federal level  For example  Massachusetts was the first of several states to recognize same sex marriage  12   edit  Effect of international treaties In the context of human rights and treaties that recognize or create individual rights  there are self executing and non self executing treaties  Non self executing treaties  which ascribe rights that under the Constitution may be assigned by law  require legislative action to execute the contract  treaty  before it can apply to law  13  There are also cases that explicitly require legislative approval according to the Constitution  such as cases that could commit the U S  to declare war or appropriate funds  Treaties regarding human rights  which create a duty to refrain from acting in a particular manner or confer specific rights  are generally held to be self executing  requiring no further legislative action  In cases where legislative bodies refuse to recognize otherwise self executing treaties by declaring them to be non self executing in an act of legislative non recognition  constitutional scholars argue that such acts violate the separation of powers   in cases of controversy  the judiciary  not Congress  has the authority under Article III to apply treaty law to cases before the court  This is a key provision in cases where the Congress declares a human rights treaty to be non self executing  for example  by contending it does not add anything to human rights under U S  domestic law  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is one such case  which  while ratified after more than two decades of inaction  was done so with reservations  understandings  and declarations  14   edit  Equality  edit  Racial See also  Civil Rights Act of 1964 and African American Civil Rights Movement Lyndon B  Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act of 1964  the first comprehensive legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in the workplace in a major industrialized country  Among the guests behind him is Martin Luther King  Jr  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that  the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race  color  or previous condition of servitude   15  In addition  Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the denial of a citizen of the right to vote based on that citizen s  race  color  or previous condition of servitude   The United States was the first major industrialized country to enact comprehensive legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in the workplace in the Civil Rights Act of 1964  CRA   16  while most of the world contains no such recourse for job discrimination  17  The CRA is perhaps the most prominent civil rights legislation enacted in modern times  has served as a model for subsequent anti discrimination laws and has greatly expanded civil rights protections in a wide variety of settings  18  The United States  1991 provision of recourse for victims of such discrimination for punitive damages and full back pay has virtually no parallel in the legal systems of any other nation  17  In addition to individual civil recourse  the United States possesses anti discrimination government enforcement bodies  such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  while only the United Kingdom and Ireland possess faintly analogous bureaucracies  17  Beginning in 1965  the United States also began a program of affirmative action that not only obliges employers not to discriminate  but requires them to provide preferences for groups protected under the Civil Rights Act to increase their numbers where they are judged to be underrepresented  19  Such affirmative action programs are also applied in college admissions  19  The United States also prohibits the imposition of any     voting qualification or prerequisite to voting  or standard  practice  or procedure     to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color   which prevents the use of grandfather clauses  literacy tests  poll taxes and white primaries  Abolitionist Anthony Benezet and others formed the first human rights nongovernmental organization in the U S  This image was used as a symbol for their cause  20  21  Prior to the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  slavery was legal in some states of the United States until 1865  22  Influenced by the principles of the Religious Society of Friends  Anthony Benezet formed the Pennsylvania Abolition Society in 1775  believing that all ethnic groups were considered equal and that human slavery was incompatible with Christian beliefs  Benezet extended the recognition of human rights to Native Americans and he argued for a peaceful solution to the violence between the Native and European Americans  Benjamin Franklin became the president of Benezet s abolition society in the late 18th century  In addition  the Fourteenth Amendment was interpreted to permit what was termed Separate but equal treatment of minorities until the United States Supreme Court overturned this interpretation in 1954  which consequently overturned Jim Crow laws  23  24 Native Americans did not have citizenship rights until the Dawes Act of 1887 and the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924  Following the 2008 presidential election  Barack Obama was sworn in as the first African American president of the United States on January 20  2009  25  In his Inaugural Address  President Obama stated  A man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath    So let us mark this day with remembrance  of who we are and how far we have traveled   25   edit  Gender See also  Women s suffrage in the United States U S  women suffragists demonstrating for the right to vote  February 1913 The Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the states and the federal government from denying any citizen the right to vote because of that citizen s sex  26  While this does not necessarily guarantee all women the right to vote  as suffrage qualifications are determined by individual states  it does mean that states  suffrage qualifications may not prevent women from voting due to their gender  26  The United States was the first major industrialized country to enact comprehensive CRA legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender in the workplace 16  while most of the world contains no such recourse for job discrimination  17  The United States  1991 provision of recourse for discrimination victims for punitive damages and full back pay has virtually no parallel in the legal systems of any other nation  17  In addition to individual civil recourse  the United States possesses anti discrimination government enforcement bodies  such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  while only the United Kingdom and Ireland possess faintly analogous bureaucracies  17  Beginning in 1965  the United States also began a program of affirmative action that not only obliges employers not to discriminate  but also requires them to provide preferences for groups protected under the CRA to increase their numbers where they are judged to be underrepresented  19  Such affirmative action programs are also applied in college admissions  19  The United States was also the first country to legally define sexual harassment in the workplace  27  Because sexual harassment is therefore a Civil Rights violation  individual legal rights of those harassed in the workplace are comparably stronger in the United States than in most European countries  27  28  The Selective Service System does not require women to register for a possible military draft 29  and the United States military does not permit women to serve in some front line combat units   edit  Disability See also  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 The United States was the first country in the world to adopt sweeping antidiscrimination legislation for people with disabilities  the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  ADA   30  The ADA reflected a dramatic shift toward the employment of persons with disabilities to enhance the labor force participation of qualified persons with disabilities and in reducing their dependence on government entitlement programs  31  The ADA amends the CRA and permits plaintiffs to recover punitive damages  32  The ADA has been instrumental in the evolution of disability discrimination law in many countries  and has had such an enormous impact on foreign law development that its international impact may be even larger than its domestic impact  33  Although ADA Title I was found to be unconstitutional  the Supreme Court has extended the protection to people with Acquired immune deficiency syndrome  AIDS   34  It is important to note that federal benefits such as Social Security Disability Insurance  SSDI  and Supplemental Security Income  SSI  are often administratively viewed in the United States as being primarily or near exclusively the entitlement only of impoverished U S  people with disabilities  and not applicable to those with disabilities who make significantly above poverty level income  This is proven in practice by the general fact that in the U S   a disabled person on SSI without significant employment income who is suddenly employed  with a salary or wage at or above the living wage threshold  often discovers that government benefits they were previously entitled to have ceased  because supposedly the new job  invalidates  the need for this assistance  The U S  is the only industrialized country in the world to have this particular approach to physical disability assistance programming   edit  Sexual orientation See also  LGBT rights in the United States and Same sex marriage in the United States Same sex marriage rally in Iowa The Constitution of the United States explicitly recognizes certain individual rights  The 14th Amendment recognizes that some human rights may exist but are not yet recognized within constitutional law  for example  civil rights for people of color and disability rights were long unrecognized  There may exist additional gender related civil rights that are presently not recognized by US law but it does not explicitly state any sexual orientation rights  Some states have recognized sexual orientation rights  which are discussed below  The United States Federal Government does not have any substantial body of law relating to marriage  these laws have developed separately within each state  The Full faith and credit clause of the US Constitution ordinarily guarantees the recognition of a marriage performed in one state by another  However  the Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996  35  which affirmed that no state  or other political subdivision within the United States  need recognize a marriage between persons of the same sex  even if the marriage was concluded or recognized in another state and the Federal Government may not recognize same sex or polygamous marriages for any purpose  even if concluded or recognized by one of the states  The US Constitution denies the federal government any authority to limit state recognition of sexual orientation rights or protections  This federal law only limits the interstate recognition of individual state laws and does not limit state law in any way   edit  State laws At an anti Proposition 8 rally in New York City a protester compares the discrimination blacks experienced with the state of gay rights  Wisconsin was the first state to pass a law explicitly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation  36  In 1996  Hawaii ruled same sex marriage is a Hawaiian constitutional right  Massachusetts  Connecticut  Iowa  Vermont  and New Hampshire are the only states that allow same sex marriage  Same sex marriage rights were established by the California Supreme Court in 2008  and over 18 000 same sex couples were married  In November 2008 voters passed Proposition 8  amending the state constitution to deny same sex couples marriage rights  which was upheld in a May 2009 decision that also allowed existing same sex marriages to stand  37  38   edit  Privacy Privacy is not explicitly stated in the United States Constitution  In the Griswold v  Connecticut case  the Supreme Court ruled that it is implied in the Constitution  In the Roe v  Wade case  the Supreme Court used privacy rights to overturn most laws against abortion in the United States  In the Cruzan v  Director  Missouri Department of Health case  the Supreme Court held that the patient had a right of privacy to terminate medical treatment  In Gonzales v  Oregon  the Supreme Court held that the Federal Controlled Substances Act can not prohibit physician assisted suicide allowed by the Oregon Death with Dignity Act  The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of criminalizing oral and anal sex in the Bowers v  Hardwick 478 U S  186  1986  decision  however  it overturned the decision in the Lawrence v  Texas 539 U S  558  2003  case and established the protection to sexual privacy   edit  Accused The United States maintains a presumption of innocence in legal procedures  The Fourth  Fifth  Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution deals with the rights of criminal suspects  Later the protection was extended to civil cases as well 39  In the Gideon v  Wainwright case  the Supreme Court requires that indigent criminal defendants who are unable to afford their own attorney be provided counsel at trial  Since the Miranda v  Arizona case  the United States requires police departments to inform arrested persons of their rights  which is later called Miranda warning and typically begins with  You have the right to remain silent    edit  Freedoms  edit  Freedom of religion Main article  Freedom of religion in the United States The establishment clause of the first amendment prohibits the establishment of a national religion by Congress or the preference of one religion over another  The clause was used to limit school praying  beginning with Engel v  Vitale  which ruled government led prayer unconstitutional  Wallace v  Jaffree banned moments of silence allocated for praying  The Supreme Court also ruled clergy led prayer at public high school graduations unconstitutional with Lee v  Weisman  The free exercise clause guarantees the free exercise of religion  The Supreme Court s Lemon v  Kurtzman decision established the  Lemon test  exception  which details the requirements for legislation concerning religion  The Employment Division v  Smith decision  the Supreme Court maintained a  neutral law of general applicability  can be used to limit religion exercises  In the City of Boerne v  Flores decision  the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was struck down as exceeding congressional power  however  the decision s effect is limited by the Gonzales v  O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal decision  which requires states to express compelling interest in prohibiting illegal drug use in religious practices   edit  Freedom of expression The Four Freedoms are derived from the 1941 State of the Union Address by United States President Franklin Roosevelt delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6  1941  The theme was incorporated into the Atlantic Charter  and it became part of the charter of the United Nations 40  and appears in the preamble of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights  Main articles  Freedom of speech in the United States and Censorship in the United States The United States  like other liberal democracies  is supposed to be a constitutional republic based on founding documents that restrict the power of government to preserve the liberty of the people  The freedom of expression  including speech  media  and public assembly  is an important right and is given special protection  as declared by the First amendment of the constitution  According to Supreme Court precedent  the federal and lower governments may not apply prior restraint to expression  with certain exceptions  such as national security and obscenity  41  There is no law punishing insults against the government  ethnic groups  or religious groups  Symbols of the government or its officials may be destroyed in protest  including the American flag  Legal limits on expression include  Solicitation  fraud  specific threats of violence  or disclosure of classified information Advocating the overthrow of the U S  government through speech or publication  or organizing political parties that advocate the overthrow of the U S  government  the Smith Act  42  Civil offenses involving defamation  fraud  or workplace harassment Copyright violations Federal Communications Commission rules governing the use of broadcast media Crimes involving sexual obscenity in pornography and text only erotic stories  Ordinances requiring mass demonstrations on public property to register in advance  The use of free speech zones and protest free zones  Military censorship of blogs written by military personnel claiming some include sensitive information ineligible for release  Some critics view military officials as trying to suppress dissent from troops in the field  43  44  The US Constitution specifically limits the human rights of active duty members  and this constitutional authority is used to limit speech rights by members in this and in other ways  Some laws remain controversial due to concerns that they infringe on freedom of expression  These include the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 45  and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act  46  In two high profile cases  grand juries have decided that Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper and New York Times reporter Judith Miller must reveal their sources in cases involving CIA leaks  Time magazine exhausted its legal appeals  and Mr  Cooper eventually agreed to testify  Miller was jailed for 85 days before cooperating  U S  District Chief Judge Thomas F  Hogan ruled that the First Amendment does not insulate Time magazine reporters from a requirement to testify before a criminal grand jury that s conducting the investigation into the possible illegal disclosure of classified information  Approximately 30 000 government employees and contractors are currently employed to monitor telephone calls and other communications  47   edit  Right to peaceably assemble Although Americans are supposed to enjoy the freedom to peacefully protest  protesters are sometimes mistreated  beaten  arrested  jailed or fired upon  On February 19  2011  Ray McGovern was dragged out of a speech by Hillary Clinton on Internet freedom  in which she said that people should be free to protest without fear of violence  McGovern  who was wearing a Veterans for Peace t shirt  stood up during the speech and silently turned his back on Clinton  He was then assaulted by undercover and uniformed police  roughed up  handcuffed and jailed  He suffered bruises and lacerations in the attack and required medical treatment  48  Protesters have also been arrested for protesting outside of designated  free speech zones   49  At the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City  over 1 700 protesters were arrested  50  On May 4  1970  Ohio National Guardsmen opened fire on protesting students at Kent State University  killing four students  Investigators determined that 28 Guardsmen fired 61 to 67 shots  The Justice Department concluded that the Guardsmen were not in danger and that their claim that they fired in self defense was untrue  The nearest student was almost 100 yards away at the time of the shooting  51  On March 7  1965  approximately 600 civil rights marchers were violently dispersed by state and local police near the Edmund Pettus Bridge outside of Selma  Alabama  52  In June 2009  the ACLU asked the Department of Defense to stop categorizing political protests as  low level terrorism  in their training courses  53  During the fall of 2011  large numbers of protesters taking part in the  Occupy movement  in cities around the country were arrested on various charges during protests for economic and political reforms  54   edit  Freedom of movement This section requires expansion  Further information  Freedom of movement under United States law As per   707 b  of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act  Fiscal Year 1979  55 United States passports are required to enter and exit the country  and as per the Passport Act of 1926 and Haig v  Agee  the Presidential administration may deny or revoke passports for foreign policy or national security reasons at any time  Perhaps the most notable example of enforcement of this ability was the 1948 denial of a passport to U S  Representative Leo Isacson  who sought to go to Paris to attend a conference as an observer for the American Council for a Democratic Greece  a Communist front organization  because of the group s role in opposing the Greek government in the Greek Civil War  56  57  The United States prevents U S  citizens to travel to Cuba  citing national security reasons  as part of an embargo against Cuba that has been condemned as an illegal act by the United Nations General Assembly  58  The current exception to the ban on travel to the island  permitted since April 2009  has been an easing of travel restrictions for Cuban Americans visiting their relatives  Restrictions continue to remain in place for the rest of the American populace  59  On June 30  2010  the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of ten people who are either U S  citizens or legal residents of the U S   challenging the constitutionality of the government s  no fly  list  The plaintiffs have not been told why they are on the list  Five of the plaintiffs have been stranded abroad  It is estimated that the  no fly  list contained about 8 000 names at the time of the lawsuit  60  The Secretary of State can deny a passport to anyone imprisoned  on parole  or on supervised release for a conviction for international drug trafficking or sex tourism  or to anyone who is behind on their child support payments  61  The following case precedents are typically cited in defense of unencumbered travel within the United States   The use of the highway for the purpose of travel and transportation is not a mere privilege  but a common fundamental right of which the public and individuals cannot rightfully be deprived   Chicago Motor Coach v  Chicago  337 Ill  200  169 N E  22  1929    The right of the citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon  either by carriage or by automobile  is not a mere privilege which a city may prohibit or permit at will  but a common law right which he has under the right to life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness   Thompson v  Smith  Supreme Court of Virginia  155 Va  367  154 S E  579   1930    Undoubtedly the right of locomotion  the right to move from one place to another according to inclination  is an attribute of personal liberty  and the right  ordinarily  of free transit from or through the territory of any State is a right secured by the 14th amendment and by other provisions of the Constitution   Schactman v  Dulles  225 F 2d 938  96 U S  App  D C  287  1955    The right to travel is a well established common right that does not owe its existence to the federal government  It is recognized by the courts as a natural right   Schactman v  Dulles 225 F 2d 938  96 U S  App  D C  287  1955  at 941   The right to travel is a part of the liberty of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment   Kent v  Dulles  357 US 116  125  1958    edit  Freedom of association Further information  Freedom of association Freedom of association is the right of individuals to come together in groups for political action or to pursue common interests  Freedom of association in the U S  is restricted by the Smith Act  which bans political parties that advocate the violent overthrow of the U S  government  42  Between 1956 and 1971  the FBI attempted to  expose  disrupt  misdirect  discredit  or otherwise neutralize  radical groups through the COINTELPRO program  62  In 2008  the Maryland State Police admitted that they had added the names of Iraq War protesters and death penalty opponents to a terrorist database  They also admitted that other  protest groups  were added to the terrorist database  but did not specify which groups  It was also discovered that undercover troopers used aliases to infiltrate organizational meetings  rallies and group e mail lists  Police admitted there was  no evidence whatsoever of any involvement in violent crime  by those classified as terrorists  63   edit  National security exceptions Further information  National Security Strategy of the United States The United States government has declared martial law  64  suspended  or claimed exceptions to  some rights on national security grounds  typically in wartime and conflicts such as the United States Civil War  64  65 Cold War or the War against Terror  65  70 000 Americans of Japanese ancestry were legally interned during World War II under Executive Order 9066  In some instances the federal courts have allowed these exceptions  while in others the courts have decided that the national security interest was insufficient  Presidents Lincoln  Wilson  and F D  Roosevelt ignored such judicial decisions  65   edit  Historical restrictions Sedition laws have sometimes placed restrictions on freedom of expression  The Alien and Sedition Acts  passed by President John Adams during an undeclared naval conflict with France  allowed the government to punish  false  statements about the government and to deport  dangerous  immigrants  The Federalist Party used these acts to harass supporters of the Democratic Republican Party  While Woodrow Wilson was president  another broad sedition law called the Sedition Act of 1918  was passed during World War I  It also caused the arrest and ten year sentencing of Socialist Party of America Presidential candidate Eugene V  Debs for speaking out against the atrocities of World War I  although he was later released early by President Warren G  Harding  Countless others  labeled as  subverts   especially the Wobblies   were investigated by the Woodrow Wilson Administration  Presidents have claimed the power to imprison summarily  under military jurisdiction  those suspected of being combatants for states or groups at war against the United States  Abraham Lincoln invoked this power in the American Civil War to imprison Maryland secessionists  In that case  the Supreme Court concluded that only Congress could suspend the writ of habeas corpus  and the government released the detainees  During World War II  the United States interned thousands of Japanese Americans on alleged fears that Japan might use them as saboteurs  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution forbids unreasonable search and seizure without a warrant  but some administrations have claimed exceptions to this rule to investigate alleged conspiracies against the government  During the Cold War  the Federal Bureau of Investigation established COINTELPRO to infiltrate and disrupt left wing organizations  including those that supported the rights of black Americans  National security  as well as other concerns like unemployment  has sometimes led the United States to toughen its generally liberal immigration policy  The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 all but banned Chinese immigrants  who were accused of crowding out American workers   edit  Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative The federal government has set up a data collection and storage network that keeps a wide variety of data on tens of thousands of Americans who have not been accused of committing a crime  Operated primarily under the direction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation  the program is known as the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative or SAR  Reports of suspicious behavior noticed by local law enforcement or by private citizens are forwarded to the program  and profiles are constructed of the persons under suspicion  66  see also Fusion Center   edit  Labor rights Main article  Labor rights Labor rights in the United States have been linked to basic constitutional rights  67  Comporting with the notion of creating an economy based upon highly skilled and high wage labor employed in a capital intensive dynamic growth economy  the United States enacted laws mandating the right to a safe workplace  Workers compensation  Unemployment insurance  fair labor standards  collective bargaining rights  Social Security  along with laws prohibiting child labor and guaranteeing a minimum wage  68  While U S  workers tend to work longer hours than other industrialized nations  lower taxes and more benefits give them a larger disposable income than those of most industrialized nations  however the advantage of lower taxes have been challenged  See  Disposable and discretionary income  U S  workers are among the most productive in the world  69  During the 19th and 20th centuries  safer conditions and workers  rights were gradually mandated by law  70  In 1935  the National Labor Relations Act recognized and protected  the rights of most workers in the private sector to organize labor unions  to engage in collective bargaining  and to take part in strikes and other forms of concerted activity in support of their demands   However  many states hold to the principle of at will employment  which says an employee can be fired for any or no reason  without warning and without recourse  unless violation of State or Federal civil rights laws can be proven  In 2011  11 8  of U S  workers were members of labor unions 71  with 37  of public sector  government  workers in unions while only 6 9  of private sector workers were union members  72   edit  Health care See also  Health care in the United States The Universal Declaration of Human Rights  adopted by the United Nations in 1948  states that  everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of oneself and one s family  including food  clothing  housing  and medical care   73  In addition  the Principles of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association require medical doctors to respect the human rights of the patient  including that of providing medical treatment when it is needed  74  Americans  rights in health care are regulated by the US Patients  Bill of Rights  citation needed  Unlike most other industrialized nations  the United States does not offer most of its citizens subsidized health care  The United States Medicaid program provides subsidized coverage to some categories of individuals and families with low incomes and resources  including children  pregnant women  and very low income people with disabilities  higher earning people with disabilities do not qualify for Medicaid  although they do qualify for Medicare   However  according to Medicaid s own documents   the Medicaid program does not provide health care services  even for very poor persons  unless they are in one of the designated eligibility groups   75  Nonetheless  some states offer subsidized health insurance to broader populations  Coverage is subsidized for persons age 65 and over  or who meet other special criteria through Medicare  Every person with a permanent disability  both young and old  is inherently entitled to Medicare health benefits   a fact not all disabled US citizens are aware of  However  just like every other Medicare recipient  a disabled person finds that his or her Medicare benefits only cover up to 80  of anything in the U S  medical system  and that the other 20  must be paid by other means  typically supplemental  privately held insurance plans  or cash out of the person s own pocket   Therefore  even the Medicare program is not truly national health insurance or universal health care the way most of the rest of the industrialized world understands it  The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986  an unfunded mandate  mandates that no person may ever be denied emergency services regardless of ability to pay  citizenship  or immigration status  76  The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act has been criticized by the American College of Emergency Physicians as an unfunded mandate  77  78  46 6 million residents  or 15 9 percent  were without health insurance coverage in 2005  79  This number includes about ten million non citizens  millions more who are eligible for Medicaid but never applied  and 18 million with annual household incomes above  50 000  80  According to a study led by the Johns Hopkins Children s Center  uninsured children who are hospitalized are 60  more likely to die than children who are covered by health insurance  81   edit  Justice system This section may be unbalanced towards certain viewpoints  Please improve the article by adding information on neglected viewpoints  or discuss the issue on the talk page   May 2009  The Fourth  Fifth  Sixth and Eighteenth Amendments of the Bill of Rights  along with the Fourteenth Amendment  ensure that criminal defendants have significant procedural rights that are unsurpassed by any other justice system  82  The Fourteenth Amendment s incorporation of due process rights adds these constitutional protections to the state and local levels of law enforcement  82  Similarly  the United States possesses a system of judicial review over government action more powerful than any other in the world  83   edit  Death penalty Further information  Capital punishment in the United States and Capital punishment debate Capital punishment is controversial  Death penalty opponents regard the death penalty as inhumane 84  and criticize it for its irreversibility 85  and assert that it lacks a deterrent effect  86  as have several studies 87  88  and debunking studies that claim to show a deterrent effect  89  According to Amnesty International   the death penalty is the ultimate  irreversible denial of human rights   85  The 1972 US Supreme Court case Furman v  Georgia 408 U S  238  1972  held that arbitrary imposition of the death penalty at the states  discretion constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution  In California v  Anderson 64 Cal 2d 633  414 P 2d 366  Cal  1972   the Supreme Court of California classified capital punishment as cruel and unusual and outlawed the use of capital punishment in California  until it was reinstated in 1976 after the federal supreme court rulings Gregg v  Georgia  428 U S  153  1976   Jurek v  Texas  428 U S  262  1976   and Proffitt v  Florida  428 U S  242  1976   90  As of January 25  2008  the death penalty has been abolished in the District of Columbia and fourteen states  mainly in the Northeast and Midwest  91  The UN special rapporteur recommended to a committee of the UN General Assembly that the United States be found to be in violation of Article 6 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in regards to the death penalty in 1998  and called for an immediate capital punishment moratorium  92  The recommendation of the special rapporteur is not legally binding under international law  and in this case the UN did not act upon the lawyer s recommendation  Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976 there have been 1077 executions in the United States  as of May 23  2007   93  There were 53 executions in 2006  94  Texas overwhelmingly leads the United States in executions  with 379 executions from 1976 to 2006  95  the second highest ranking state is Virginia  with 98 executions  96  A ruling on March 1  2005 by the Supreme Court in Roper v  Simmons prohibits the execution of people who committed their crimes when they were under the age of 18  97  Between 1990 and 2005  Amnesty International recorded 19 executions in the United States for crime committed by a juvenile  98  It is the official policy of the European Union and a number of non EU nations to achieve global abolition of the death penalty  For this reason the EU is vocal in its criticism of the death penalty in the US and has submitted amicus curiae briefs in a number of important US court cases related to capital punishment  99  The American Bar Association also sponsors a project aimed at abolishing the death penalty in the United States  100  stating as among the reasons for their opposition that the US continues to execute minors and the mentally retarded  and fails to protect adequately the rights of the innocent  101  Some opponents criticize the over representation of blacks on death row as evidence of the unequal racial application of the death penalty  This over representation is not limited to capital offenses  in 1992 although blacks account for 12  of the US population  about 34 percent of prison inmates were from this group  102  In McCleskey v  Kemp  it was alleged the capital sentencing process was administered in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  In 2003  Amnesty International reported those who kill whites are more likely to be executed than those who kill blacks  citing of the 845 people executed since 1977  80 percent were put to death for killing whites and 13 percent were executed for killing blacks  even though blacks and whites are murdered in almost equal numbers  103   edit  Prison system See also  Incarceration in the United States and Cutter v  Wilkinson The United States is seen by social critics  104  including international and domestic human rights groups and civil rights organizations  as a state that violates fundamental human rights  because of disproportionately heavy  in comparison with other countries  reliance on crime control  individual behavior control  civil liberties   and societal control of disadvantaged groups through a harsh police and criminal justice system  The U S  penal system is implemented on the federal  and in particular on the state and local levels  This social policy has resulted in a high rate of incarceration  which affects Americans from the lowest socioeconomic backgrounds and racial minorities the hardest  105  106  Some have criticized the United States for having an extremely large prison population  where there have been reported abuses  107  As of 2004 the United States had the highest percentage of people in prison of any nation  There were more than 2 2 million in prisons or jails  or 737 per 100 000 population  or roughly 1 out of every 136 Americans  According to The National Council on Crime and Delinquency  since 1990 the incarceration of youth in adult jails has increased 208   108  In some states youth   juvenile is defined as young as 13 years old  The researchers for this report found that Juveniles often were incarcerated to await trial for up to two years and subjected to the same treatment of mainstream inmates  The incarcerated adolescent is often subjected to a highly traumatic environment during this developmental stage  The long term effects are often irreversible and detrimental  109   Human Rights Watch believes the extraordinary rate of incarceration in the United States wreaks havoc on individuals  families and communities  and saps the strength of the nation as a whole   110  Examples of mistreatment claimed include prisoners left naked and exposed in harsh weather or cold air  111   routine  use of rubber bullets 112  and pepper spray   111  112  112 solitary confinement of violent prisoners in soundproofed cells for 23 or 24 hours a day  111  113  and a range of injuries from serious injury to fatal gunshot wounds  with force at one California prison  often vastly disproportionate to the actual need or risk that prison staff faced   112  Such behaviors are illegal  and   Professional standards clearly limit staff use of force to that which is necessary to control prisoner disorder   112  Human Rights Watch raised concerns with prisoner rape and medical care for inmates  114  In a survey of 1 788 male inmates in Midwestern prisons by Prison Journal  about 21  claimed they had been coerced or pressured into sexual activity during their incarceration and 7  claimed that they had been raped in their current facility  115  Tolerance of serious sexual abuse and rape in United States prisons are consistently reported as widespread  citation needed  It has been fought against by organizations such as Stop Prisoner Rape  The United States has been criticized for having a high amount of non violent and victim less offenders incarcerated  110  116  117  as half of all persons incarcerated under State jurisdiction are for non violent offences and 20 percent are incarcerated for drug offences  mostly for possession of cannabis  118  119  The United States is the only country in the world allowing sentencing of young adolescents to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole  There are currently 73 Americans serving such sentences for crimes they committed at the age of 13 or 14  In December 2006 the United Nations took up a resolution calling for the abolition of this kind of punishment for children and young teenagers  185 countries voted for the resolution and only the United States against  120   edit  Police brutality In a 1999 report  Amnesty International said it had  documented patterns of ill treatment across the U S   including police beatings  unjustified shootings and the use of dangerous restraint techniques   121  According to a 1998 Human Rights Watch report  incidents of police use of excessive force had occurred in cities throughout the U S   and this behavior goes largely unchecked  122  An article in USA Today reports that in 2006  96  of cases referred to the U S  Justice Department for prosecution by investigative agencies were declined  In 2005  98  were declined  123  In 2001  the New York Times reported that the U S  government is unable or unwilling to collect statistics showing the precise number of people killed by the police or the prevalence of the use of excessive force  124  Since 1999  at least 148 people have died in the United States and Canada after being shocked with Tasers by police officers  according to a 2005 ACLU report  125  In one case  a handcuffed suspect was tasered nine times by a police officer before dying  and six of those taserings occurred within less than three minutes  The officer was fired and faced the possibility of criminal charges  126   edit  War on Terrorism See also  War on Terrorism and Criticism of the War on Terrorism  edit  Inhumane treatment and torture of captured non citizens See also  Torture and the United States and CIA prison system International and U S  law prohibits torture and other ill treatment of any person in custody in all circumstances  127  However  the United States Government has categorized a large number of people as unlawful combatants  a United States classification used mainly as an excuse to bypass international law  which denies the privileges of prisoner of war  POW  designation of the Geneva Conventions  128  Certain practices of the United States military and Central Intelligence Agency have been condemned by some sources domestically and internationally as torture  129  130  A fierce debate regarding non standard interrogation techniques 131  exists within the US civilian and military intelligence community  with no general consensus as to what practices under what conditions are acceptable  Abuse of prisoners is considered a crime in the United States Uniform Code of Military Justice  According to a January 2006 Human Rights First report  there were 45 suspected or confirmed homicides while in US custody in Iraq and Afghanistan   Certainly 8  as many as 12  people were tortured to death   132   edit  Abu Ghraib prison abuse This section may be too long and overly detailed  Please consider summarizing

Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse In 2004  photos showing humiliation and abuse of prisoners were leaked from Abu Ghraib prison  causing a political and media scandal in the US  Forced humiliation of the detainees included  but is not limited to nudity  rape  human piling of nude detainees  masturbation  eating food out of toilets  crawling on hand and knees while American soldiers were sitting on their back sometimes requiring them to bark like dogs  and hooking up electrical wires to fingers  toes  and penises  133 Bertrand Ramcharan  acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that while the removal of Saddam Hussein represented  a major contribution to human rights in Iraq  and that the United States had condemned the conduct at Abu Ghraib and pledged to bring violators to justice   willful killing  torture and inhuman treatment  represented a grave breach of international law and  might be designated as war crimes by a competent tribunal   134  In addition to the acts of humiliation  there were more violent claims  such as American soldiers sodomizing detainees  including an event involving an underage boy   an incident where a phosphoric light was broken and the chemicals poured on a detainee  repeated beatings  and threats of death  133  Six military personnel were charged with prisoner abuse in the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal  The harshest sentence was handed out to Charles Graner  who received a 10 year sentence to be served in a military prison and a demotion to private  the other offenders received lesser sentences  135  In their report The Road to Abu Ghraib  Human Rights Watch describe how  The severest abuses at Abu Ghraib occurred in the immediate aftermath of a decision by Secretary Rumsfeld to step up the hunt for  actionable intelligence  among Iraqi prisoners  The officer who oversaw intelligence gathering at Guantanamo was brought in to overhaul interrogation practices in Iraq  and teams of interrogators from Guantanamo were sent to Abu Ghraib  The commanding general in Iraq issued orders to  manipulate an internee s emotions and weaknesses   Military police were ordered by military intelligence to  set physical and mental conditions for favorable interrogation of witnesses   The captain who oversaw interrogations at the Afghan detention center where two prisoners died in detention posted  Interrogation Rules of Engagement  at Abu Ghraib  authorizing coercive methods  with prior written approval of the military commander  such as the use of military guard dogs to instill fear that violate the Geneva Conventions and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman Degrading Treatment or Punishment  136   edit  Enhanced interrogation and waterboarding See also  Waterboarding and Enhanced interrogation techniques This section may be too long and overly detailed  Please consider summarizing the material while citing sources as needed  On February 6  2008  the CIA director General Michael Hayden stated that the CIA had used waterboarding on three prisoners during 2002 and 2003  namely Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  Abu Zubayda and Abd al Rahim al Nashiri  137  138  The June 21  2004 issue of Newsweek stated that the Bybee memo  a 2002 legal memorandum drafted by former OLC lawyer John Yoo that described what sort of interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists or terrorist affiliates the Bush administration would consider legal  was     prompted by CIA questions about what to do with a top Qaeda captive  Abu Zubaydah  who had turned uncooperative     and was drafted after White House meetings convened by George W  Bush s chief counsel  Alberto Gonzales  along with Defense Department general counsel William Haynes and David Addington  Vice President Dick Cheney s counsel  who discussed specific interrogation techniques   citing  a source familiar with the discussions   Amongst the methods they found acceptable was waterboarding  139  In November 2005  ABC News reported that former CIA agents claimed that the CIA engaged in a modern form of waterboarding  along with five other  enhanced interrogation techniques   against suspected members of al Qaeda  UN High Commissioner for Human Rights  Louise Arbour  stated on the subject of waterboarding  I would have no problems with describing this practice as falling under the prohibition of torture   and that violators of the UN Convention Against Torture should be prosecuted under the principle of universal jurisdiction  140  Bent S rensen  Senior Medical Consultant to the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims and former member of the United Nations Committee Against Torture has said  It s a clear cut case  Waterboarding can without any reservation be labeled as torture  It fulfils all of the four central criteria that according to the United Nations Convention Against Torture  UNCAT  defines an act of torture  First  when water is forced into your lungs in this fashion  in addition to the pain you are likely to experience an immediate and extreme fear of death  You may even suffer a heart attack from the stress or damage to the lungs and brain from inhalation of water and oxygen deprivation  In other words there is no doubt that waterboarding causes severe physical and or mental suffering   one central element in the UNCAT s definition of torture  In addition the CIA s waterboarding clearly fulfills the three additional definition criteria stated in the Convention for a deed to be labeled torture  since it is 1  done intentionally  2  for a specific purpose and 3  by a representative of a state   in this case the US  141  Lt  Gen  Michael D  Maples  the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency  concurred by stating  in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee  that he believes waterboarding violates Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions  142  The CIA director testified that waterboarding has not been used since 2003  143  In April 2009  the Obama administration released four memos in which government lawyers from the Bush administration approved tough interrogation methods used against 28 terror suspects  The rough tactics range from waterboarding  simulated drowning  to keeping suspects naked and denying them solid food  144  These memos were accompanied by the Justice Department s release of four Bush era legal opinions covering  in graphic and extensive detail  the interrogation of 14 high value terror detainees using harsh techniques beyond waterboarding  These additional techniques include keeping detainees in a painful standing position for long periods  Used often  once for 180 hours   145  using a plastic neck collar to slam detainees into walls  keeping the detainee s cell cold for long periods  beating and kicking the detainee  insects placed in a confinement box  the suspect had a fear of insects   sleep deprivation  prolonged shackling  and threats to a detainee s family  One of the memos also authorized a method for combining multiple techniques  144  146  Details from the memos also included the number of times that techniques such as waterboarding were used  A footnote said that one detainee was waterboarded 83 times in one month  while another was waterboarded 183 times in a month  147  148  This may have gone beyond even what was allowed by the CIA s own directives  which limit waterboarding to 12 times a day  148  The Fox News website carried reports from an unnamed US official who claimed that these were the number of pourings  not the number of sessions  149  Physicians for Human Rights has accused the Bush administration of conducting illegal human experiments and unethical medical research during interrogations of suspected terrorists  150  The group has suggested this activity was a violation of the standards set by the Nuremberg Trials  151   edit  Guant namo Bay The United States maintains a detention center at its military base at Guant namo Bay  Cuba where numerous enemy combatants of the war on terror are held  The detention center has been the source of various controversies regarding the legality of the center and the treatment of detainees  152  153 Amnesty International has called the situation  a human rights scandal  in a series of reports  154  775 detainees have been brought to Guant namo  Of these  many have been released without charge  As of March 2012  171 detainees remain at Guantanamo  155  The United States assumed territorial control over Guant namo Bay under the 1903 Cuban American Treaty  which granted the United States a perpetual lease of the area  156  United States  by virtue of its complete jurisdiction and control  maintains  de facto  sovereignty over this territory  while Cuba retained ultimate sovereignty over the territory  The current government of Cuba regards the U S  presence in Guant namo as illegal and insists the Cuban American Treaty was obtained by threat of force in violation of international law  157  A delegation of UN Special Rapporteurs to Guantanamo Bay claimed that interrogation techniques used in the detention center amount to degrading treatment in violation of the ICCPR and the Convention Against Torture  158  In 2005 Amnesty International expressed alarm at the erosion in civil liberties since the 9 11 attacks  According to Amnesty International  The Guant namo Bay detention camp has become a symbol of the United States administration s refusal to put human rights and the rule of law at the heart of its response to the atrocities of 11 September 2001  It has become synonymous with the United States executive s pursuit of unfettered power  and has become firmly associated with the systematic denial of human dignity and resort to cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment that has marked the USA s detentions and interrogations in the  war on terror   159  Amnesty International also condemned the Guant namo facility as     the gulag of our times   which raised heated conversation in the United States  The purported legal status of  unlawful combatants  in those nations currently holding detainees under that name has been the subject of criticism by other nations and international human rights institutions including Human Rights Watch and the International Committee of the Red Cross  The ICRC  in response to the US led military campaign in Afghanistan  published a paper on the subject  160  HRW cites two sergeants and a captain accusing U S  troops of torturing prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan  161  However  former Republican governor Mike Huckabee  for example  has stated that the conditions in Guant namo are better than most US prisons  162  The US government argues that even if detainees were entitled to POW status  they would not have the right to lawyers  access to the courts to challenge their detention  or the opportunity to be released prior to the end of hostilities and that nothing in the Third Geneva Convention provides POWs such rights  and POWs in past wars have generally not been given these rights  163  The U S  Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v  Rumsfeld on June 29  2006 that they were entitled to the minimal protections listed under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions  164  Following this  on July 7  2006  the Department of Defense issued an internal memo stating that prisoners would in the future be entitled to protection under Common Article 3  165  166  167   edit  Extraordinary rendition See also  Extraordinary rendition by the United States United States citizens and foreign nationals are occasionally captured and abducted outside of the United States and transferred to secret US administered detention facilities  sometimes being held incommunicado for periods of months or years  a process known as extraordinary rendition  According to The New Yorker   The most common destinations for rendered suspects are Egypt  Morocco  Syria  and Jordan  all of which have been cited for human rights violations by the State Department  and are known to torture suspects   168   edit  Notable cases In November 2001  Yaser Esam Hamdi  a U S  citizen  was captured by Afghan Northern Alliance forces in Konduz  Afghanistan  amongst hundreds of surrendering Taliban fighters and was transferred into U S  custody  The U S  government alleged that Hamdi was there fighting for the Taliban  while Hamdi  through his father  has claimed that he was merely there as a relief worker and was mistakenly captured  Hamdi was transferred into CIA custody and transferred to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base  but when it was discovered that he was a U S  citizen  he was transferred to naval brig in Norfolk  Virginia and then he was transferred brig in Charleston  South Carolina  The Bush Administration identified him as an unlawful combatant and denied him access to an attorney or the court system  despite his Fifth Amendment right to due process  In 2002 Hamdi s father filed a habeas corpus petition  the Judge ruled in Hamdi s favor and required he be allowed a public defender  however  on appeal the decision was reversed  In 2004  in the case of Hamdi v  Rumsfeld the U S  Supreme court reversed the dismissal of a habeas corpus petition and ruled detainees who are U S  citizens must have the ability to challenge their detention before an impartial judge  In December 2004  Khalid El Masri  a German citizen  was apprehended by Macedonian authorities when traveling to Skopje because his name was similar to Khalid al Masri  an alleged mentor to the al Qaeda Hamburg cell  After being held in a motel in Macedonia for over three weeks he was transferred to the CIA and extradited to Afghanistan  While held in Afghanistan  El Masri claims he was sodomized  beaten  and repeatedly interrorgated about alleged terrorist ties  169  After being in custody for five months  Condoleezza Rice learned of his detention and ordered his release  El Masri was released at night on a desolate road in Albania  without apology or funds to return home  He was intercepted by Albanian guards  who believed he was a terrorist due to his haggard and unkept appearance  He was subsequently reunited with his wife who had returned to her family in Lebanon with their children because she thought her husband had abandoned them  Using isotope analysis  scientists at the Bavarian archive for geology in Munich analyzed his hair and verified that he was malnourished during his disappearance  170  In 2007  U S  President Bush signed an Executive order banning the use of torture in the CIA s interrogation program  171   edit  Extrajudicial killings On 30 April 2011  United States forces  authorised by the President of the United States  carried out the extrajudicial killing of Al qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden on Pakistani territory  172  On 30 September 2011  the CIA carried out the extrajudicial killing of U S  citizen and radical cleric Anwar al Awlaki with a drone attack while the Al Qaeda member was in Yemen  173   edit  International comparison According to Canadian historian Michael Ignatieff  during and after the Cold War  the United States placed greater emphasis than other nations on human rights as part of its foreign policy  awarded foreign aid to facilitate human rights progress  and annually assessed the human rights records of other national governments  7   edit  Support The U S  Department of State publishes a yearly report  Supporting Human Rights and Democracy  The U S  Record  in compliance with a 2002 law that requires the Department to report on actions taken by the U S  Government to encourage respect for human rights  174  It also publishes a yearly  Country Reports on Human Rights Practices    175  In 2006 the United States created a  Human Rights Defenders Fund  and  Freedom Awards   176  The  Ambassadorial Roundtable Series   created in 2006  are informal discussions between newly confirmed U S  Ambassadors and human rights and democracy non governmental organizations  177  The United States also support democracy and human rights through several other tools  178  The  Human Rights and Democracy Achievement Award  recognizes the exceptional achievement of officers of foreign affairs agencies posted abroad  In 2006 the award went to Joshua Morris of the embassy in Mauritania who recognized necessary democracy and human rights improvements in Mauritania and made democracy promotion one of his primary responsibilities  He persuaded the Government of Mauritania to re open voter registration lists to an additional 85 000 citizens  which includes a significant number of Afro Mauritanian minority individuals  He also organized and managed the largest youth focused democracy project in Mauritania in 5 years  Nathaniel Jensen of the embassy in Vietnam was runner up  He successfully advanced the human rights agenda on several fronts  including organizing the resumption of a bilateral Human Rights Dialogue  pushing for the release of Vietnam s prisoners of concern  and dedicating himself to improving religion freedom in northern Vietnam  179  Under legislation by congress  the United States declared that countries utilizing child soldiers may no longer be eligible for US military assistance  in an attempt to end this practice  180   edit

 edit  International Bill of Rights See also International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights   United States The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  ICCPR  and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  ICESCR  are the legal treaties that enshrine the rights outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  Together  and along with the first and second optional protocols of the ICCPR they constitute the International bill of rights 185  186  The US has not ratified the ICESCR or either of the optional protocols of the ICCPR  The US s ratification of the ICCPR was done with five reservations   or limits   on the treaty  5 understandings and 4 declarations  Among these is the rejection of sections of the treaty that prohibit capital punishment  187  188  Included in the Senate s ratification was the declaration that  the provisions of Article 1 through 27 of the Covenant are not self executing   189  and in a Senate Executive Report stated that the declaration was meant to  clarify that the Covenant will not create a private cause of action in U S  Courts   190  This way of ratifying the treaty was criticized as incompatible with the Supremacy Clause by Louis Henkin  191  As a reservation that is  incompatible with the object and purpose  of a treaty is void as a matter of international law  Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties  art  19  1155 U N T S  331  entered into force Jan  27  1980   specifying conditions under which signatory States can offer  reservations    there is some issue as to whether the non self execution declaration is even legal under domestic law  At any rate  the United States is but a signatory in name only   edit  International Criminal Court Further information  United States and the International Criminal Court The U S  has not ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  ICC   which was drafted for prosecuting individuals above the authority of national courts in the event of accusations of genocide  crimes against humanity  war crimes  and crime of aggression  Nations that have accepted the Rome Statute can defer to the jurisdiction of the ICC or must surrender their jurisdiction when ordered  The US rejected the Rome Statute after its attempts to include the nation of origin as a party in international proceedings failed  and after certain requests were not met  including recognition of gender issues   rigorous  qualifications for judges  viable definitions of crimes  protection of national security information that might be sought by the court  and jurisdiction of the UN Security Council to halt court proceedings in special cases  192  Since the passage of the statute  the US has actively encouraged nations around the world to sign  bilateral immunity agreements  prohibiting the surrender of US personnel before the ICC 193  and actively attempted to undermine the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  194  The US Congress also passed a law  American Service Members  Protection Act  ASPA  authorizing the use of military force to free any US personnel that are brought before the court rather than its own court system  195  196  Human Rights Watch criticized the United States for removing itself from the Statute 197  Judge Richard Goldstone  the first chief prosecutor at The Hague war crimes tribunal on the former Yugoslavia  echoed these sentiments saying  I think it is a very backwards step  It is unprecedented which I think to an extent smacks of pettiness in the sense that it is not going to affect in any way the establishment of the international criminal court   The US have really isolated themselves and are putting themselves into bed with the likes of China  the Yemen and other undemocratic countries  197  While the US has maintained that it will  bring to justice those who commit genocide  crimes against humanity and war crimes   its primary objections to the Rome Statute have revolved around the issues of jurisdiction and process  A US ambassador for War Crimes Issues to the UN Security Council said to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee that because the Rome Statute requires only one nation to submit to the ICC  and that this nation can be the country in which an alleged crime was committed rather than defendant s country of origin  U S military personnel and US foreign peaceworkers in more than 100 countries could be tried in international court without the consent of the US  The ambassador states that  most atrocities are committed internally and most internal conflicts are between warring parties of the same nationality  the worst offenders of international humanitarian law can choose never to join the treaty and be fully insulated from its reach absent a Security Council referral  Yet multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the court s jurisdiction even if the country of the individual peacekeeper has not joined the treaty   192   edit  Other treaties not signed or signed but not ratified Where the signature is subject to ratification  acceptance or approval  the signature does not establish the consent to be bound  However  it is a means of authentication and expresses the willingness of the signatory state to continue the treaty making process  The signature qualifies the signatory state to proceed to ratification  acceptance or approval  It also creates an obligation to refrain  in good faith  from acts that would defeat the object and the purpose of the treaty  198  The U S  has not ratified the following international human rights treaties  182  First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  ICCPR

when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States of America  and continue to be disadvantaged under the reconstruction plans   articles 6 and 26  The State party should review its practices and policies to ensure the full implementation of its obligation to protect life and of the prohibition of discrimination  whether direct or indirect  as well as of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement  in the areas of disaster prevention and preparedness  emergency assistance and relief measures  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  it should increase its efforts to ensure that the rights of poor people and in particular African Americans  are fully taken into consideration in the reconstruction plans with regard to access to housing  education and health care  The Committee wishes to be informed about the results of the inquiries into the alleged failure to evacuate prisoners at the Parish prison  as well as the allegations that New Orleans residents were not
