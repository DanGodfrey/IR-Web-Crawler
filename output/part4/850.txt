perceived  as described by Burton  to stand  for a standard of quality     seldom reached  in early 1977  the Eagle Awards were so called  with official blessing from IPC   1  Described as  the first independent  in the UK   nationally organised comic art awards poll   from the launch  the hope was that they would  become a regular annual fandom event   1  Ultimately  the awards only became fully annual in 1986  in conjunction with the United Kingdom Comic Art Convention  UKCAC     S et up and financed by a group of dealers and fanzine editors   including Mike Conroy and Richard Burton  with the intention of including  people with    diverse interests    to make the poll as impartial as possible   the initial method of casting votes was designed to be inclusive and straightforward  1  Ballots were made available to  most dealers  shops and fanzines   with completed forms able to be returned to the same place  rather than a centralised location  An initial ballot formed a list of nominees  from which the voting ballot was created and disseminated in the same manner  1  From 1983 84  the revised Awards included separate UK and US sections  although the work of British authors often dominated both categories  Indeed  in 1986  for work released during 1985   the awards  proved to be a virtual clean sweep    by Alan Moore   who not only won  favourite writer in both the US and UK categories   but had his work win for favourite comic book  supporting character and new title in the US  and character  continuing story and  character worthy of own title  in the UK  in which last category his works held all top three spots   2  The 1986 Eagles also saw the introduction of a  free vote    rather than pre selected nominees   creating a  fairer reflection of fans  opinions  and some anomalous results especially in the Roll of Honor category   2  After going dormant in the late 1990s  the Eagle Award was briefly replaced by the National Comics Award  The Eagle returned in 2000 as an event at that year s Comic Festival  which had replaced UKCAC  Later  the Eagle was awarded during UK s Comic Expo for some years  and is now  as of 2010  awarded at the London MCM Expo
