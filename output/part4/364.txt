development has been inspired by Martin Luther King  Jr  2  Writer Scott Lobdell established Xavier s middle name to be Francis in Uncanny X Men  328  January 1996   Stan Lee has stated that the physical inspiration of Professor Xavier was from Academy Award winning actor Yul Brynner  3   edit  Character Xavier s goals are to promote the peaceful affirmation of mutant rights  to mediate the co existence of mutants and humans  to protect mutants from militant humans and to protect society from antagonistic mutants  including his old friend  the militant Magneto  To achieve these aims  he founded Xavier s School for Gifted Youngsters  later named the Xavier Institute  to teach mutants to explore and control their powers  Its first group of students were the original X Men  Xavier s students consider him a visionary and often refer to their mission as  Xavier s dream   He is highly regarded by others in the Marvel universe  respected by various governments and trusted by several other superhero teams  including the Avengers and the Fantastic Four  However  he also has a manipulative streak which has resulted in several significant fallings out with allies and students  He often acts as a public advocate for mutant rights and is the authority most of the Marvel superhero community turns to for advice on mutants  Despite this  his status as a mutant himself and leader of the X Men only became public during the 2001 story  E Is for Extinction   In the comics  history  the X Men rarely operate without Xavier  He also appears in almost all of the X Men animated series and in many video games  although usually as a non playable character because of his disability  Patrick Stewart plays him in the 2000s film series  as well as providing his voice in some of the X Men videogames  including some not connected to the film series   According to BusinessWeek  Charles Xavier is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics  4   edit  Dark Xavier The Dark side of Xavier emerging  Art by Bob Brown  amp  Dave Cockrum  In a number of comics  especially more so in recent years  Xavier is shown to have a dark side  a part of himself that he struggles to suppress  Perhaps the most notable appearance of this character element is in the Onslaught storyline  in which the crossover event s antagonist is a physical manifestation of that dark side  Also  Onslaught is created in the most violent act Xavier claims to have done  erasing the mind of Magneto  In X Men  106  August 1977   the new X Men fight images of the original team  which have been created by what Xavier says is his  evil self     who would use his powers for personal gain and conquest   which he says he is normally able to keep in check  In the 1984 four part series titled The X Men and the Micronauts  Xavier s dark desires manifest themselves as the Entity and threaten to destroy the Micronauts  universe  In other instances  Xavier is shown to be secretive and manipulative  During the Onslaught storyline  the X Men find Xavier s files  the  Xavier Protocols   which detail how to kill many of the characters  including Xavier himself  should the need ever arise  such as if they went rogue  5 Astonishing X Men vol  3   12  August 2005  reveals that when Xavier realizes that the Danger Room has become sentient  he keeps it trapped and experiments on it for years  an act that Cyclops calls  the oppression of a new life  and equates to humanity s treatment of mutants   However  X Men Legacy  220   224 reveals that Xavier did not intend for the Danger Room to become sentient  it was an accident  and Xavier sought a way to free Danger  but was unable to find a way to accomplish this without deleting her sentience as well   In X Men  Deadly Genesis  6  a de powered Xavier is forced to admit that he had sent a group of hastily trained young mutants to Krakoa to save the original X Men  resulting in their deaths  Because one of the mutants is Cyclops  brother Vulcan  Xavier erased Cyclops  memory of the event  He further manipulated the rescue team of new X Men by making them think the meaningless noises the island made were intelligible speech  evidence that the island was alive  to match the new memories he had given Cyclops  It has also been revealed that he lied to Rogue in an attempt to protect her from evil influences  and that for years he told her he could eventually help her control her abilities  when this was not the case  Xavier has multiple secrets that he hides from the X Men beyond the Krakoa and Danger incidents  Since the inception of the X Men  he has created and maintained a network of mutant espionage agents to work in dealings that are too dubious for the public eye of the X Men  even entrapping Mystique into helping him  even though she killed his dear friend  Moira MacTaggert   The mutant Sage was recruited at the same point as the original X Men  however  Xavier forced Tessa into a role as a spy within the Hellfire Club  seeing his team as heroes and Tessa s only ability  the capacity to betray   He has also been part of the secret Illuminati society responsible for shooting Bruce Banner into space  although he did not participate in the decision to do so  he later admitted that he would have agreed with the plan if he had been present  albeit only sending Bruce away until an effective  cure  could be found for his condition  volume  amp  issue needed  In the Mutant X comic book series  set outside the Marvel Universe continuity  Xavier travels the world capturing telepaths for the purpose of stealing their mental energy  Xavier takes control of S H I E L D   captures Gambit s daughter  and attempts to kill the X Men with a nuclear strike  An alternate reality version of Xavier is the enemy in the first story arc of the Exiles series  In Ultimate X Men  Xavier frequently lies to other characters  including the X Men  or even manipulates them when he feels it is necessary  Xavier tells the American president that he has killed Magneto  but instead he has blocked Magneto s memories and created a new personality and memories for him  along with a new life working with mentally challenged children  In issue  65  unbeknownst to the rest of the team  he directs Angel to become his mole in Emma Frost s Academy of Tomorrow in the guise of expelling the student  In Ultimate X Men  58  he defuses a hostage situation by hiring the mutant bank robbers for a mission in which the X Men cannot be implicated  and making the police believe they have killed them   edit  Romantic interests A brilliant student intent on undertaking graduate studies  Xavier was admitted into England s Oxford University  where he studied at Pembroke College  It was in Oxford where he met and fell in love with a young Scot named Moira Kinross with a mind that would match his own  Their passionate discussions on genetic mutation gave way to an equally

inadequate about being in a wheelchair  and the age difference and sacredness of the teacher student relationship  8  Although Xavier never again displays a romantic interest in Jean  the idea that he

of his time with the team  Xavier uses his telepathic powers to keep in constant contact with his students and provides instructions and advice when needed  In addition  he uses a special machine called Cerebro  which enhances his ability to detect mutants and to allow the team to find new students in need of the school  34  Among the obstacles Xavier faces is his old friend  Magneto  who has grown into an advocate of mutant superiority since their last encounter and who believes the only solution to mutant persecution is domination over humanity  35  When anthropologist Bolivar Trask resurfaces the  mutant problem   Xavier counters him in a televised debate  however  he appears arrogant and Trask sends his mutant hunting robot Sentinels to terrorize mutants  The X Men dispatch

Exodus confronts Magneto about Joanna Cargill s injury  Magneto was forced to shoot a laser through her eyeball in order to prevent her attempted assassination of Xavier   Exodus nearly kills Magneto  and Xavier drags Exodus onto the Astral Plane  putting Xavier s own newly restored mind at stake  Xavier defeats Exodus after a harrowing psionic battle  and Exodus reveals the reason he abducted Xavier and to restore his mind  Exodus wants Xavier to lead the Acolytes and find the mutant messiah child  now under the guardianship of Cable  in order to indoctrinate the child into their cause  Xavier refuses  Emma Frost s telepathy picks up on the psychic fight  and Emma informs Cyclops that Xavier is alive  Xavier parts company with Magneto and Karima to try to regain his lost memories by visiting people from his past  91  The first person Charles visits is Carter Ryking  who had gone insane after losing his powers  Charles reads Carter s memories and discovers that when the two were children they were used as test subjects by Nathan Milbury of the Black Womb Project  with the approval of Charles  father  Doctor Brian Xavier  Xavier makes the connection Milbury and X Men villain  Mister Sinister  who has apparently long been manipulating Charles  life in addition to other X Men  Afterwards  he discovers he s been targeted by assassins  92  Charles eventually discovers Mister Sinister had set up Charles  Sebastian Shaw  Juggernaut  and Ryking as potential new hosts for Sinister s mind  91  Bleeding slowly to death  he apparently gives in to Sinister becoming the new Mister Sinister  But in reality  Xavier is still battling Sinister for control of his body  91  As Sebastian Shaw and Gambit destroy Sinister s Cronus Machine  the device that he used to transfer his consciousness into new hosts  Xavier drives Sinister out of his body permanently  92  Xavier thanks Shaw and Gambit for their help and declares he must go and see Cyclops immediately  93  Professor X

children  Xavier attempts to have Scott give him permission to scan Scott s mind for traces of Sinister s influences  but instead Scott turns the tables on Xavier by revealing that he has secretly invited Emma Frost into their entire meeting and also into Xavier s mind  94  While in his mind  Emma forces Xavier to relive each of his morally ambiguous decisions under altruistic pretenses  As the issue continues  Charles realizes his human arrogance and that while some of his decisions were morally wrong  he must move forward with his life and deal with the consequences  Emma ends her incursion into Xavier s mind by reminding him of Moira MacTaggert s last words  As he reflects on Moira s words  Xavier gives Cyclops his blessing to lead the X Men and leaves to find his own path  95  Following his encounter with Wolverine  in the  Original Sin  Arc  Professor Xavier seeks out his step brother  the unstoppable Juggernaut in an attempt to reform him  After a conversation about the meaning of the word  Juggernaut  and a review of Juggernaut and Xavier s shared history Xavier offers Cain an empty box as a gift  Confused by Xavier s gift Cain attempts to kill the Professor bringing an entire sports bar down over their heads in the process  Later Cain battles the X Men in his full Juggernaut armor and conquers the planet  Just as everything appears to be under the Juggernaut s control Xavier reappears and informs him that everything that has just taken place except for Juggernaut destroying the bar took place in Cain s mind  A baffled Cain demands to know how Xavier managed to overcome his psychically shielded helmet to which the Professor replies that he decided to visit Cain in his sleep  Professor Xavier then informs him that he now understands Cain as a person and that he will not attempt to get in his way or reform him again  But Xavier also warns Cain that if he gets in the way of the Professor s path to redemption Xavier will stop him permanently  96  Following his encounter with Cain it has been revealed that Xavier is now searching for Rogue  97  After his bruising encounter with Cyclops and Emma Frost  Professor X is forced to revisit the biggest challenge and the biggest failure of his career  Wolverine  when the feral mutant asks for Charles  help in freeing his son from the clutches of the Hellfire Club  As the two search for Daken  Wolverine reveals that when he first joined the X Men he attempted to assassinate Xavier due to some unknown programming  In response  the Professor broke Logan s mind and rebuilt it so that any and all programming he received was forgotten  Logan also revealed that the real reason Xavier asked him to join the X Men was that Charles  needed a weapon   98  Eventually Professor Xavier and Wolverine locate Sebastian Shaw s mansion and attack his minions  just as they are about to enter a bomb explodes from within catching them both off guard  From the wreckage emerges an angry Sebastian who immobilizes Wolverine  Meanwhile  Miss Sinister knocks Daken unconscious and has him taken to the medlab in the mansion s basement  As Shaw prepares to deliver a killing blow to Xavier  Wolverine recovers and stops him telling Xavier to rescue his son  Professor Xavier locates the medlab and after a quick psychic battle with Miss Sinister enters Daken s fractured mind  While in Daken s mind Xavier discovers Romulus s psychic tampering and comments that Daken s mind is even more broken than Wolverine s was  Before Xavier can heal Daken a psychic bomb explodes causing Xavier to become comatose and Daken to wake up  Miss Sinister arrives and attempts to manipulate Daken who reveals that the psychic bomb in his head restored his memories and stabs Miss Sinister in the chest  Meanwhile Wolverine defeats Shaw and enters the mansion to find Daken standing over an unconscious Xavier preparing to kill him  99  Wolverine tells Daken that he won t let him hurt Xavier and the two fight  Overcome with guilt over what happened to Daken and Itsu  Wolverine allows himself to be beaten  Just as Daken appears to have won Xavier pulls both of them onto the astral plane revealing that the psychic bomb had little effect on him because his psyche was already shattered  Xavier then explains to Wolverine and Daken that Romulus is solely responsible for Itsu s death and that he lied to Daken about everything because he wanted Wolverine to become his weapon  As the three converse Daken returns to the physical plane and prevents Shaw from killing Xavier  With the truth revealed Wolverine and Daken decide to kill Romulus  As the two depart Wolverine tells Xavier that he forgives him for all of the dark moments in their history  Wolverine acknowledges that Professor Xavier allowed him to become a hero  Wolverine then tells the Professor that he hopes he will one day be able to forgive him for choosing to kill Romulus  100  Professor Xavier recruits Gambit to go with him to Australia to find and help Rogue who is currently staying at the X Men s old base in the outback  unaware Danger is using Rogue as a conduit for her revenge against him  97   edit  Secret Invasion Professor X was at the meeting of the Illuminati when it came to the discussion about the Skrulls planning an invasion by taking out Earth s heroes and posing as them  He claims he was unable to distinguish that Black Bolt had been replaced by a Skrull  and his powers were bested quickly by the Black Bolt Skrull  Professor X leaves after learning even he can no longer trust the others  yet appears to have severely restricted the number of people he informs of the forthcoming alien invasion  as the X Men were not prepared for the Skrulls  at least at first  101  Xavier is not seen again during the events of Secret Invasion  though his X Men in San Francisco are successful at repelling the invaders there through the use of the modified Legacy Virus   edit  Dark Reign After convincing Exodus to disband the Acolytes  a H A M M E R  helicopter arrives and from inside appears Norman Osborn  who wants to talk to him  102  During the Dark Avengers  arrival in San Francisco to enforce martial law and squelch the anti mutant riots occurring in the city  Xavier appears  back in his wheelchair  in the company of Norman Osborn and publicly denounces Cyclops  actions and urges him to turn himself in  However  this Xavier was revealed to be Mystique who Osborn recruited to impersonate Xavier in public  103  The real Xavier is shown in prison on Alcatraz and slowly being stripped of his telepathic powers while in psionic contact with Beast  who was arrested earlier for his part in the anti mutant riots  104  It was also revealed by Emma Frost that she and Professor X are both Omega Class Telepaths when she manages to detect the real Professor X  103  Professor X helps Emma Frost enter Sentry s mind  However  as Emma frees him of the Void s influence  a minute sliver of the entity itself remains in her mind  Xavier quickly tells her to remain in her diamond armor state to prevent the Void from gaining access to her psi powers  Professor X is later seen with Emma Frost where Beast is recuperating  105   edit  Nation X After the events of Utopia  Xavier has come to live on the risen Asteroid M  rechristened Utopia  along with the rest of the X Men  X Club  and mutant refugees and is also allowed to join the Utopia lead council  Cyclops  Storm  Namor  Iceman  Beast  Wolverine and Emma Frost   While he no longer continues to openly question every move that Cyclops makes  he is still concerned about some of his leadership decisions  Xavier had wanted to return to the mainland in order to clear his name  but in the aftermath of Osborn declaring Utopia as a mutant detention area  Cyclops refused to let him leave  stating that it would be a tactical advantage to have him as an ace in the hole in case the need arose  To that end  he has kept Xavier out of the field and instead relied on Emma Frost  Psylocke and the Stepford Cuckoos respectively for their own psionic talents  106  While attending the funeral of Yuriko Takiguchi  Magneto arrives at Utopia  apparently under peaceful motives  Xavier does not believe it  and attacks Magneto telepathically  causing Cyclops to force him to stand down  107  He later apologizes to Magneto for acting out of his old passions from their complicated relationship  which Magneto accepts  108   edit  Second Coming Professor Xavier is seen on Utopia delivering a eulogy at Nightcrawler s funeral  Like the other X Men he is deeply saddened by Kurt s death and anxious about the arrival of Cable and Hope  109  Xavier is seen using his powers to help his son Legion control his many personalities and battle the Nimrods  110  At the conclusion of Second Coming Professor X is seen surveying the aftermath of the battle from a helicopter  As Hope descends to the ground and cradles Cable s lifeless arm  Xavier reflects on everything that has transpired and states that  while he feels that Hope has indeed come to save mutantkind and revive his dream  she is still only a young woman and will have a long and difficult journey before she can truly achieve her potential  111   edit  Powers and abilities Cerebro  as seen in the X Men films  Professor X is a mutant who possesses vast telepathic powers  and is among the most powerful Earth born telepaths in the Marvel Universe  Professor X is able to perceive the thoughts of others or project his own thoughts within a radius of approximately 250 miles  400 km   Xavier s telepathy once covered the entire world but Magneto altered the Earth s electromagnetic field to restrict Xavier s telepathic range  112  While not on Earth  Xavier s natural telepathic abilities have reached across space to make universal mental contact with multiple alien races  113  With extreme effort  he can greatly extend the range of his telepathy  He can learn foreign languages by reading the language centers of the brain of someone adept  and alternately  teach  languages to others in the same manner  Xavier once trained a new group of mutants mentally  subjectively making them experience months of training together  while only hours passed in the real world  114  Xavier s vast psionic powers enable him to manipulate the minds of others  warp perceptions to make himself seem invisible  project mental illusions  cause loss of particular memories  and induce pain or temporary mental and or physical paralysis in others  Within close range  he can manipulate almost any number of minds for such simple feats  However  he can only take full possession of one other mind at a time  and must strictly be within that person s physical presence  He is one of the few telepaths skilled enough to communicate with animals and even share their perceptions  92  He can also telepathically take away or control people s natural bodily functions and senses  such as sight  hearing  smell  taste  or even mutant powers  A side effect of his telepathy is that he is gifted with an eidetic memory  He has displayed telepathic prowess sufficient to confront Ego the Living Planet  while aided by Cadre K 115  as well as narrowly defeat Exodus  116  However  he cannot permanently  reprogram  human minds to believe what he might want them to believe even if he wanted to do so  explaining that the mind is an organism that would always recall the steps necessary for it to reach the present and thus  rewrite  itself to its original setting if he tried to change it  117  However  his initial reprogramming of Wolverine lasted several years  despite how Wolverine s healing factor works around such a reprogramming much faster than an ordinary human mind  118  He can cause the loss of specific memories or even total amnesia  He can also project powerful mental  bolts   enabling him to stun the mind of another person into unconsciousness or even cause death  These  bolts  inflict damage only upon other minds  having a negligible effect on non mental beings  if any  The manner in which Xavier s powers function indicates that his telepathy is physical in some way  as it can be enhanced by physical means  for example  Cerebro  and can be disrupted by physical means  for example  Magneto s alteration of the Earth s magnetic field   Xavier can perceive the distinct mental presence brain waves of other superhuman mutants within a small radius of himself  To detect mutants to a wider area beyond this radius  he must amplify his powers through Cerebro and subsequently Cerebra  computer devices of his own design which are sensitive to the psychic physical energies produced by the mind  Professor X can project his astral form into a psychic dimension known as the astral plane  There  he can use his powers to create objects  control his surroundings  and even control and destroy the astral forms of others  He cannot project this form over long distances  Uncanny X Men writer Ed Brubaker has claimed that  after being de powered by the Scarlet Witch  119  120  and then re powered by the M Kraan Crystal  Charles  telepathy is more powerful than was previously known  However  the extent of this enhancement is unknown  121  Charles is a genius with multiple doctorates  He is a world renowned geneticist  an expert in mutation  possesses considerable knowledge of life sciences  and is the inventor of Cerebro  12  He is the leading authority on genetics  mutation  and psionic powers  and possesses considerable expertise in other life sciences  He possesses a Ph D  in genetics  biophysics  and psychology  He is highly talented in devising equipment for utilizing and enhancing psionic powers  During his travels in Asia  Xavier learned martial arts  acquiring  refined combat skills  according to Magneto  When these skills are coordinated in tandem with his telepathic abilities  Xavier is a dangerous unarmed combatant  capable of sensing the intentions of others and countering them with superhuman efficiency  He also has extensive knowledge of pressure points  122  Charles Xavier was also given possession of the Mind Infinity Gem  123  It allows the user to boost mental power and access the thoughts and dreams of other beings  Backed by the Power Gem  it is possible to access all minds in existence simultaneously  Like all other former Illuminati members  Xavier has sworn to never use the gem and to keep its location hidden   edit  Xavier Protocols The Xavier Protocols are a set of doomsday plans created by Professor X  The Protocols detail the best way to kill many powerful mutant characters  including the X Men and Xavier himself  should they become too large a danger  The Xavier Protocols are first mentioned during the  Onslaught  crossover and first seen in Excalibur  100 in Moira MacTaggert s lab  Charles Xavier compiled a list of the Earth s most powerful mutants and plans on how to defeat them if they become a threat to the world  124  They are first used after Onslaught grows too powerful  Only parts of the actual Protocols are ever shown  In the  Operation  Zero Tolerance  crossover Bastion obtains an encrypted copy of the Protocols  intending to use them against the X Men  125  However  Cable infiltrates the X Mansion and secures all encrypted files before Bastion has a chance to decrypt them  126  Due to the tampering of Bastion and his Sentinels  the X Mansion computer system Cerebro gains autonomy and seeks to destroy the X Men by employing its knowledge of the Xavier Protocols  In a virtual environment created by Professor X Cerebro executes the Xavier Protocols against the X Men  127  Each Protocol is activated by the presence of a different combination of X Men and were written by Xavier himself  124  Code 0 0 0  Charles Xavier   This file is both an entry on Charles Xavier  as well as an introduction to the Xavier Protocols  It contained a holographic image of Charles Xavier  reading the following message   Moira  Scott  Jean  if you three are seeing these images  then I have become a mortal threat to my X Men  In this instance  I must be stopped by any means necessary  Some years ago  I made a study of various forms of possible defense against my own psychic abilities  The image next to me is that of an anti psionic armor  The wearer should be protected from my talent  When I finish speaking  a blueprint for this armor will be downloaded    Activated by Moira MacTaggert  Cyclops  and Jean Grey  Code 0 2 1
