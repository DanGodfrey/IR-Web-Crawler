3 billion  The East Asian state covers approximately 9 6 million square kilometres  3 7 million square miles  in total area and is the world s second largest country by land area  14  and the third  or fourth largest in total area  depending on the definition of total area  15  The People s Republic of China is a single party state governed by the Communist Party of China  16  It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces  five autonomous regions  four directly controlled municipalities  Beijing  Tianjin  Shanghai  and Chongqing   and two mostly self governing 17 special administrative regions  SARs   Hong Kong and Macau  Its capital city is Beijing  18  The PRC also claims the island of Taiwan  which is controlled by the government of the Republic of China  as its 23rd province  a claim controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan and the unresolved Chinese Civil War  China s landscape is vast and diverse  with forest steppes and the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts occupying the arid north and northwest near Mongolia and Central Asia  and subtropical forests being prevalent in the wetter south near Southeast Asia  The terrain of western China is rugged and elevated  with the Himalaya  Karakoram  Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separating China from South and Central Asia  The world s apex  Mt  Everest  8 848 m   lies on the China Nepal border  while the world s second highest point  K2  8 611 m   is situated on China s border with Pakistan  The country s lowest and the world s third lowest point  Lake Ayding   154 m   is located in the Turpan

coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14 500 kilometres  9 000 mi  long  the 11th longest in the world   and is bounded by the Bohai  Yellow  East and South China Seas  The ancient Chinese civilization one of the world s earliest flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain  19  China s political system was based on hereditary monarchies  known as dynasties  beginning with the semi mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin  approx  2000 BC  and ending with the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912  Since 221 BC  when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire  the country has fractured and been reformed numerous times  The Republic of China  ROC   founded in 1912 after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty  ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949  In the 1946 1949 phase of the Chinese Civil War  the Chinese Communists defeated the Chinese Nationalists  Kuomintang  on the mainland and established the People s Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949  The Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to Taiwan  establishing its capital in Taipei  The ROC s jurisdiction is now limited to Taiwan and several outlying islands  including Penghu  Kinmen and Matsu  Since 1949  the People s Republic of China and the Republic of China  now widely known as  Taiwan   have remained in dispute over the sovereignty of China and the political status of Taiwan  mutually claiming each other s territory and competing for international diplomatic recognition  In 1971  the PRC gained admission to United Nations and took the Chinese seat as a permanent member of the U N  Security Council  China is also a member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations  including the WTO  APEC  BRICS  the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the G 20  As of September 2011  all but 23 countries have recognized the PRC as the sole legitimate government of China  Since the introduction of market based economic reforms in 1978  China has become the world s fastest growing major economy  20  As of 2012  it is the world s second largest economy  after the United States  by both nominal GDP and purchasing power parity  PPP   21  and is also the world s largest exporter and second largest importer of goods  On per capita terms  China ranked 90th by nominal GDP and 91st by GDP  PPP  in 2011  according to the IMF  China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world s largest standing army  with the second largest defense budget  In 2003  China became the third nation in the world  after the former Soviet Union and the United States  to independently launch a successful manned space mission  China has been characterized as a potential superpower by a number of academics  22  military analysts

the 13th century explorer Marco Polo  27  28  The first recorded use in English dates from 1555  29  The Persian word is  in turn  derived from the Sanskrit word C na        30  which was used as a name for China as early as AD 150  31  There are various scholarly theories regarding the origin of this word  The traditional theory  proposed in the 17th century by Martino Martini  is that  China  is derived from  Qin       the westernmost of the Chinese kingdoms during the Zhou Dynasty  or from the succeeding Qin Dynasty  221 206 BC   32  The word C na is used in two Hindu scriptures   the Mah bh rata of the 5th century BC 33  and the Laws of Manu of the 2nd century BC   to refer to a country located in the Tibetan Burman borderlands east of India  34  In China  common names for the country include Zh nggu   Chinese      literally  the Central State s    and Zh nghu   Chinese       although the country s official name has been changed numerous times by successive dynasties and modern governments  The term Zhongguo appeared in various ancient texts  such as the Classic of History of the 6th century BC  35  and in pre imperial times it was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia from the barbarians  Sometimes Zhongguo  which can be either singular or plural  referring to the group of states in the central plain  The Chinese were not unique in regarding their country as  central   since other civilizations had the same view  36  History Main articles  History of China and Timeline of Chinese history Prehistory Archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China between 250 000 and 2 24 million years ago  37  A cave in Zhoukoudian  near present day Beijing  exhibits fossils dated at between 300 000 and 780 000 BC  38  39  40  The fossils are of Peking Man  an example of Homo erectus who used fire  There are also remains of Homo sapiens dating back to 18 000 11 000 B C found at the Peking Man site  41  Early dynastic rule See also  Dynasties in Chinese history Jade deer ornament dating from the Shang Dynasty Chinese tradition names the first dynasty Xia  but it was considered mythical until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites at Erlitou in Henan Province in 1959  42  Archaeologists have since uncovered urban sites  bronze implements  and tombs in locations cited as Xia s in ancient historical texts  but it is impossible to verify that these remains are of the Xia without written records from the period  Some of the thousands of life size Terracotta Warriors of the Qin Dynasty  ca  210 BC  The Great Wall of China was built by several dynasties over two thousand years to protect the sedentary agricultural regions of the Chinese interior from incursions by nomadic pastoralists of the northern steppes  The first Chinese dynasty that left historical records  the loosely feudal Shang  Yin   settled along the Yellow River in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century BC  The oracle bone script of the Shang Dynasty represent the oldest forms of Chinese writing found and the direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters used throughout East Asia  The Shang were invaded from the west by the Zhou  who ruled from the 12th to the 5th century BC  until their centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords  Many independent states eventually emerged out of the weakened Zhou state  and continually waged war with each other in the Spring and Autumn Period  only occasionally deferring to the Zhou king  By the time of the Warring States Period  there were seven powerful sovereign states  each with its own king  ministry and army  Imperial China The first unified Chinese state was established by Qin Shi Huang of the Qin state in 221 BC  Qin Shi Huang proclaimed himself the  First Emperor         and imposed many reforms throughout China  notably the forced standardization of the Chinese language  measurements  length of cart axles  and currency  The Qin Dynasty lasted only fifteen years  falling soon after Qin Shi Huang s death  as its harsh legalist and authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion  43  44  The subsequent Han Dynasty ruled China between 206 BC and 220 AD  and created a lasting Han cultural identity among its populace that extends to the present day  43  44  The Han Dynasty expanded the empire s territory considerably with military campaigns reaching Korea  Vietnam  Mongolia and Central Asia  and also helped establish the Silk Road in Central Asia  China was for a large part of the last two millennia the world s largest economy  45  However  in the later part of the Qing Dynasty  China s economic development began to slow and Europe s rapid development during and after the Industrial Revolution enabled it to surpass China  After the collapse of Han  another period of disunion followed  including the highly chivalric period of the Three Kingdoms  46  Independent Chinese states of this period such as Wu opened diplomatic relations with Japan  47  introducing the Chinese writing system there  In 580 AD  China was reunited under the Sui  48  However  the Sui Dynasty was short lived after a failure in the Goguryeo Sui Wars  598 614  weakened it  49  50  Song Dynasty Longquan celadon porcelain pieces from Zhejiang province  10th 11th century AD  Under the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties  Chinese technology and culture reached its zenith  51  The Tang Empire was at its height of power until the middle of the 8th century  when the An Shi Rebellion destroyed the prosperity of the empire  52  The Song Dynasty was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy  53  Between the 10th and 11th centuries  the population of China doubled in size  This growth came about through expanded rice cultivation in central and southern China  and the production of abundant food surpluses  Within its borders  the Northern Song Dynasty had a population of some 100 million people  The Song Dynasty was a culturally rich period for philosophy and the arts  Landscape art and portrait painting were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity after the Tang Dynasty  and social elites gathered to view art  share their own  and trade precious artworks  Philosophers such as Cheng Yi and Chu Hsi reinvigorated Confucianism with new commentary  infused Buddhist ideals  and emphasized a new organization of classic texts that brought about the core doctrine of Neo Confucianism  Detail from Along the River During the Qingming Festival  a 12th century painting showing everyday life in the Song Dynasty s capital city  Bianjing  today s Kaifeng   In 1271  the Mongol leader and fifth Khagan of the Mongol Empire Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty  with the last remnant of the Song Dynasty falling to the Yuan in 1279  Before the Mongol invasion  Chinese dynasties reportedly had approximately 120 million inhabitants  after the conquest was completed in 1279  the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people  54  Late dynastic rule A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Yuan Dynasty in 1368 and founded the Ming Dynasty  55  Ming Dynasty thinkers such as Wang Yangming would further critique and expand Neo Confucianism with ideas of individualism and innate morality that would have tremendous impact on later Japanese thought  Chosun Korea also became a nominal vassal state of Ming China and adopted much of its Neo Confucian bureaucratic structure  Under the Ming Dynasty  China had another golden age  with one of the strongest navies in the world  a rich and prosperous economy and a flourishing of the arts and culture  It was during this period that Zheng He led explorations throughout the world  possibly reaching America  During the early Ming Dynasty China s capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing  In 1644 Beijing was sacked by a coalition of rebel forces led by Li Zicheng  a minor Ming official turned leader of the peasant revolt  The last Ming Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell  The Manchu Qing Dynasty then allied with Ming Dynasty general Wu Sangui and overthrew Li s short lived Shun Dynasty  and subsequently seized control of Beijing  which became the new capital of the Qing Dynasty  The Qing Dynasty  which lasted until 1912  was the last dynasty in China  In the 19th century the Qing Dynasty adopted a defensive posture towards European imperialism  even though it engaged in imperialistic expansion into Central Asia  At this time China awoke to the significance of the rest of the world  the West in particular  As China opened up to foreign trade and missionary activity  opium produced by British India was forced onto Qing China  Two Opium Wars with Britain weakened the Emperor s control  European imperialism proved to be disastrous for China  The Arrow War  1856 1860   2nd Opium War  saw another disastrous defeat for China  The subsequent passing of the humiliating Treaty of Tianjin in 1856 and the Beijing Conventions of 1860 opened up more of the country to foreign penetrations and more ports for their vessels  Hong Kong was ceded over to the British  Thus  the  unequal treaties system  was established  Heavy indemnities had to be paid by China  and more territory and control were taken over by the foreigners  56  A 19th century painting depicting the Taiping Rebellion of 1850 1864  The weakening of the Qing regime  and the apparent humiliation of the unequal treaties in the eyes of the Chinese people had several consequences  One consequence according to whom   was the Taiping Rebellion  a civil war which lasted from 1851 to 1862  The rebellion was led by Hong Xiuquan  who was partly influenced by an idiosyncratic interpretation of Christianity  Hong believed himself to be the son of God and the younger brother of Jesus  Although the Qing forces were eventually victorious  the civil war was one of the bloodiest in human history  costing at least 20 million lives  more than the total number of fatalities in World War I   with some estimates of up to two hundred million  Other costly rebellions followed the Taiping Rebellion  such as the Punti Hakka Clan Wars  1855 67   Nien Rebellion  1851 1868   Miao Rebellion  1854 73   Panthay Rebellion  1856 1873  and the Dungan revolt  1862 1877   57  58  A corner tower of the Forbidden City  pictured at night  These rebellions resulted in an estimated loss of several million lives each and led to disastrous results for the economy and the countryside  59  60  61  The flow of British opium hastened the empire s decline  In the 19th century  the age of colonialism was at its height and the great Chinese Diaspora began  About 35 million overseas Chinese live in Southeast Asia today  62  The famine in 1876 79 claimed between 9 and 13 million lives in northern China  63  From 108 BC to 1911 AD  China experienced 1 828 famines  64  or one per year  somewhere in the empire  65  While China was wracked by continuous war  Meiji Japan succeeded in rapidly modernizing its military and set its sights on Korea and Manchuria  At the request of the Korean emperor  the Chinese government sent troops to aid in suppressing the Tonghak Rebellion in 1894  However  Japan also sent troops to Korea  leading to the First Sino Japanese War  which resulted in Qing China s loss of influence in the Korean Peninsula as well as the cession of Taiwan  including the Pescadores  to Japan  Following this series of defeats  a reform plan for the empire to become a modern Meiji style constitutional monarchy was drafted by the Guangxu Emperor in 1898  but was opposed and stopped by the Empress Dowager Cixi  who placed Emperor Guangxu under house arrest in a coup d  tat  Further destruction followed the ill fated 1900 Boxer Rebellion against westerners in Beijing  By the early 20th century  mass civil disorder had begun  and calls for reform and revolution were heard across the country  The 38 year old Emperor Guangxu died under house arrest on 14 November 1908  suspiciously just a day before Cixi s own death  With the throne empty  he was succeeded by Cixi s handpicked heir  his two year old nephew Puyi  who became the Xuantong Emperor  Guangxu s consort became the Empress Dowager Longyu  In another coup

Nanking Massacre of 1937  when over 200 000 Chinese were killed  66  On 1 January 1912  the Republic of China was established  heralding the end of the Qing Dynasty  Sun Yat sen of the Kuomintang  the KMT or Nationalist Party  was proclaimed provisional president of the republic  However  the presidency was later given to Yuan Shikai  a former Qing general  who had ensured the defection of the entire Beiyang Army from the Qing Empire to the revolution  In 1915  Yuan proclaimed himself Emperor of China but was forced to abdicate and return the state to a republic when he realized it was an unpopular move  not only with the population but also with his own Beiyang Army and its commanders  After Yuan Shikai s death in 1916  China was politically fragmented  with an internationally recognized but virtually powerless national government seated in Beijing  Warlords in various regions exercised actual control over their respective territories  In the late 1920s  the Kuomintang  under Chiang Kai shek  was able to reunify the country under its own control with a military campaign and deft political maneuverings known as the  Northern Expedition   The Kuomintang moved the nation s capital to Nanjing and implemented  political tutelage   an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat sen s program for transforming China into a modern  democratic state  Sun had outlined this program with his  San Min Zhu Yi  Doctrine  Effectively  political tutelage meant one party rule by the Kuomintang  but the party was politically divided into competing cliques  This political division made it difficult for Chiang to battle the Communists  which the Kuomintang had been warring against since 1927 in the Chinese Civil War  This war continued successfully for the Kuomintang  especially after the Communists were forced to retreat in the Long March  until the Xi an Incident and Japanese aggression forced Chiang to confront Imperial Japan  The Second Sino Japanese War  1937 1945   part of World War II  forced an uneasy alliance between the Nationalists and the Communists as well as causing around 20 million Chinese civilian deaths  67  The Japanese  three all policy  in north China  kill all  burn all and destroy all   was one example of wartime atrocities committed on a civilian population  68  Japan unconditionally surrendered to China in 1945  Taiwan including the Pescadores was retroceded  China emerged victorious but financially drained  The continued distrust between the Nationalists and the Communists led to the resumption of the Chinese Civil War  In 1947  constitutional rule was established  but because of the ongoing Civil War many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China

China  and the Kuomintang  KMT  retreating to Taiwan  reducing the ROC s territory to only Taiwan  Hainan  and their surrounding islands  On 1 October 1949  Mao Zedong proclaimed the People s Republic of China  69   Communist China  and  Red China  were two common names for the People s Republic of China  70  In 1950  the People s Liberation Army succeeded in capturing Hainan from the Republic of China  occupying Tibet  and defeating the majority of the remaining Kuomintang forces in Yunnan and Xinjiang provinces  though some Kuomintang holdouts survived until much later  Mao Zedong proclaiming the establishment of the People s Republic of China in 1949  Mao encouraged population growth  and under his leadership the PRC s population almost doubled from around 550 million to over 900 million  71  However  the economic and social plan known as the Great Leap Forward resulted in an estimated 45 million deaths  mostly from starvation  72  In 1966  Mao and his allies launched the Cultural Revolution  which would last until Mao s death a decade later  The Cultural Revolution  motivated by power struggles within the Party and a fear of the Soviet Union  led to a major upheaval in Chinese society  In 1972  at the peak of the Sino Soviet split  Mao and Zhou Enlai met Richard Nixon in Beijing to establish relations with the United States  In the same year  the PRC was admitted to the United Nations in place of the Republic of China for China s membership of the United Nations  and permanent membership of the Security Council  After Mao s death in 1976 and the arrest of the Gang of Four  blamed for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution  Deng Xiaoping quickly wrested power from Mao s anointed successor Hua Guofeng  Although he never became the head of the party or state himself  Deng was in fact the Paramount Leader of China at that time  his influence within the Party led the country to significant economic reforms  The Communist Party subsequently loosened governmental control over citizens  personal lives and the communes were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases  which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production  This turn of events marked the PRC s transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment  a system termed by some  market socialism   73  the Communist Party of China officially describes it as  socialism with Chinese characteristics   China adopted its current constitution on 4 December 1982  The death of pro reform official Hu Yaobang helped to spark the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989  during which students and others campaigned for several months  speaking out against corruption and in favour of greater political reform  including democratic rights and freedom of speech  However  they were eventually put down on 4 June when PLA troops and vehicles entered and forcibly cleared the square  resulting in numerous casualties  This event was widely reported and brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the government  74  75  The  Tank Man  incident in particular became famous  The city of Shanghai has become a symbol of China s rapid economic expansion since the 1990s  President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji  both former mayors of Shanghai  led the nation in the 1990s  Under Jiang and Zhu s ten years of administration  China s economic performance pulled an estimated 150 million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11 2   76  77  The country formally joined the World Trade Organization in 2001  Although rapid economic growth has made the PRC economy the world s second largest  the government has begun to worry that rapid growth has negatively impacted the country s resources and environment  Another concern is that the benefits of economic development has not been distributed evenly  resulting in a wide development gap between urban and rural areas  As a result  under President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao  the PRC government initiated policies to address these issues of equitable distribution of resources  though the outcome remains to be seen  78  More than 40 million farmers have been displaced from their land  79  usually for economic development  contributing to the 87 000 demonstrations and riots across China in 2005  80  Living standards have improved significantly but political controls remain tight  81  Geography Main article  Geography of the People s Republic of China See also  Geography of Taiwan A

 9 596 961 km2  3 705 407 sq mi  according to the UN Demographic Yearbook  85  to 9 596 961 km2  3 705 407 sq mi  according to the CIA World Factbook  86  and 9 640 011 km2  3 722 029 sq mi  including Aksai Chin and the Trans Karakoram Tract  which are controlled by China and claimed by India  87  None of these figures include the 1 000 square kilometres  386 1 sq mi  of territory ceded to China by Tajikistan following the ratification of a Sino Tajik border agreement in January 2011  88  According to the Encyclop dia Britannica  the total area of the United States  at 9 522 055 km2  3 676 486 sq mi   is slightly smaller than that of China  Meanwhile  the CIA World Factbook states that China s total area was greater than that of the United States until the coastal waters of the Great Lakes was added to the United States  total area in 1996  89  China has the longest combined land border in the world  measuring 22 117 km  13 743 mi  from the mouth of the Yalu River to the Gulf of Tonkin  China borders 14 nations  more than any other country except Russia  which also borders 14  China extends across much of East Asia  bordering Vietnam  Laos  and Burma in Southeast Asia  India  Bhutan  Nepal and Pakistan 90  in South Asia  Afghanistan  Tajikistan  Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia  a small section of Russian Altai and Mongolia in Inner Asia  and the Russian Far East and North Korea in Northeast Asia  Additionally  China shares maritime boundaries with South Korea  Japan  Vietnam and the Philippines  The PRC and the Republic of China  Taiwan  make mutual claims over each other s territority and the frontier between areas under their respective control is closest near the islands of Kinmen and Matsu  off the Fujian coast  but otherwise run through the Taiwan Strait  The PRC and ROC assert identical claims over the entirety of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea  and the southern most extent of these claims reach Zengmu Ansha  James Shoal   which would form a maritime frontier with Malaysia  Landscape and climate Mount Everest  the world s highest mountain  in Tibet  The South China Sea coast at Hainan  The territory of China lies between latitudes 18  and 54  N  and longitudes 73  and 135  E  The country s vast size gives it a wide variety of landscapes  In the east  along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea  there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains  while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north  broad grasslands are visible  Southern China is dominated by hill country and low mountain ranges  while the central east hosts the deltas of China s two major rivers  the Yellow River and the Yangtze River  Other major rivers include the Xi  Mekong  Brahmaputra and Amur  To the west  major mountain ranges  most notably the Himalayas  and high plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north  such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert  China s highest point  Mt  Everest  8848m   lies on the Sino Nepalese border  The country s lowest point is the dried lake bed of Ayding Lake   154m  in the Turpan Depression  A major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts  particularly the Gobi Desert  which is currently the world s fifth largest desert  91  92  Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms  prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring  which then spread to other parts of East Asia  including Korea and Japan  According to China s environmental watchdog  Sepa  China is losing a million acres  4 000 km   per year to desertification  93  Water quality  erosion  and pollution control have become important issues in China s relations with other countries  Melting glaciers in the Himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people  94  China s climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons  which lead to a pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer  In the winter  northern winds coming from high latitude areas are cold and dry  in summer  southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist  The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country s extensive and complex topography  Biodiversity Main article  Wildlife of China A giant panda photographed in Sichuan  China is one of 17 megadiverse countries  95  lying in two of the world s major ecozones  the Palearctic and the Indomalaya  In the Palearctic zone  mammals such as the horse  camel  tapir  and jerboa can be found  Among the species found in the Indomalaya region are the Leopard Cat  bamboo rat  treeshrew  and various monkey and ape species  Some overlap exists between the two regions due to natural dispersal and migration  deer  antelope  bears  wolves  pigs  and numerous rodent species can all be found in China s diverse climatic and geological environments  The famous giant panda is found only in a limited area along the Yangtze River  China suffers from a continuing problem with trade in endangered species  although there are now laws to prohibit such activities  China also hosts a variety of forest types  Cold coniferous forests predominate in the north of the country  supporting animal species such as moose and the Asian black bear  along with over 120 bird species  Moist conifer forests can have thickets of bamboo as an understorey  replaced by rhododendrons in higher montane stands of juniper and yew  Subtropical forests  which dominate central and southern China  support as many as 146 000 species of flora  Tropical and seasonal rainforests  though confined to Yunnan and Hainan Island  contain a quarter of all the plant and animal species found in China  Environment Main article  Environment in the People s Republic of China See also  Water resources of the People s Republic of China Wind turbines in Xinjiang  The Dabancheng project is Asia s largest wind farm  In recent decades  China has suffered from severe environmental deterioration and pollution  96  While regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent  enforcement of them is poor  as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favour of rapid economic development  Environmental campaigners such as Ma Jun have warned of the danger that water pollution poses to Chinese society  97  According to the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources  roughly 300 million Chinese do not have access to safe drinking water  and 40  of China s rivers have been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste as of late 2011  98  This crisis is compounded by the perennial problem of water shortages  with 400 out of 600 surveyed Chinese cities reportedly short of drinking water  99  100  However  China is the world s leading investor in renewable energy technologies  with  34 6 billion invested in 2009 alone  101  102  China produces more wind turbines and solar panels than any other country  103  and renewable energy projects  such as solar water heating  are widely pursued at the local level  104  By 2009  over 17  of China s energy was derived from renewable sources   most notably hydroelectric power plants  of which China has a total installed capacity of 197 GW  105  In 2011  the Chinese government announced plans to invest four trillion yuan  US 618 55 billion  in water infrastructure projects over a ten year period  and to complete construction of a flood prevention and anti drought system by 2020  106  Politics Main article  Politics of the People s Republic of China See also  Politics of the Republic of China A diagram of the state organs of the People s Republic of China  The People s Republic of China  along with Vietnam  North Korea  Laos  and Cuba   is one of the five remaining Communist states in the world  107  108  but simple characterizations of China s political structure since the 1980s are no longer possible  11  The PRC government has been variously described as communist and socialist  but also as authoritarian  with heavy restrictions remaining in many areas  most notably on the Internet  the press  freedom of assembly  reproductive rights  and freedom of religion  109  Its current political economic system has been termed by its leaders as  Socialism with Chinese characteristics   Compared to its closed door policies until the mid 1970s  the liberalization of China has resulted in the administrative climate being less restrictive than before  China is far different from liberal democracy or social democracy that exists in most of Europe or North America  and the National People s Congress  highest state body  has been described as a  rubber stamp  body  110  China s incumbent President is Hu Jintao  who is also the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China  and its Premier is Wen Jiabao  who is also a senior member of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee  The Great Hall of the People in Beijing  where the National People s Congress convenes  The country is ruled by the Communist Party of China  CPC   whose power is enshrined in China s constitution  111  The political system is partly decentralized  112  with limited democratic processes internal to the party and at local village levels  although these experiments have been marred by corruption  There are other political parties in China  referred to in China as democratic parties  which participate in the National People s Congress  NPC  and the Chinese People s Political Consultative Conference  CPPCC   There have been some moves toward political liberalization  in that open contested elections are now held at the village and town levels  113  114  and that legislatures have shown some assertiveness from time to time  However  the Party retains effective control over government appointments  in the absence of meaningful opposition  the CPC wins by default most of the time  Political concerns in China include lessening the growing gap between rich and poor and fighting corruption within the government leadership  115  The level of support to the government action and the management of the nation is among the highest in the world  with 86  of people who express satisfaction with the way things are going in their country and with their nation s economy according to a 2008 Pew Research Center survey  116  Administrative divisions

of the People s Republic of China Hu Jintao with former US President George W  Bush in 2006  China has diplomatic relations with 171 countries and maintains embassies in 162  118  Its legitimacy is disputed by the Republic of China and a few other countries  it is thus the largest and wealthiest state with limited recognition  Sweden was the first western country to establish diplomatic relations with the People s Republic on 9 May 1950  119  In 1971  the PRC replaced the Republic of China as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  120  China was also a former member and leader of the Non Aligned Movement  and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries  121  Under its interpretation of the One China policy  China has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to Taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the Republic of China  Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan  122  especially in the matter of armament sales  123  Political meetings between foreign government officials and the 14th Dalai Lama are also opposed by China  as it considers Tibet to be formally part of China  124  Much of China s current foreign policy is reportedly based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence of Zhou Enlai non interference in other states  affairs  non aggression  peaceful coexistence  equality and mutual benefits  China s foreign policy is also driven by the concept of  harmony without uniformity   which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences  This policy has led China to support states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by Western nations  such as Zimbabwe  North Korea  and Iran  125  Conflicts with foreign countries have occurred at times in China s recent history  particularly with the United States  for example  the US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the Kosovo conflict in May 1999 and the US China spy plane incident in April 2001  China s foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989  although in recent years China has improved its diplomatic links with the West  126  127  Trade relations In recent decades  China has played an increasing role in calling for free trade areas and security pacts amongst its Asia Pacific neighbors  In 2004  China proposed an entirely new East Asia Summit  EAS  framework as a forum for regional security issues  pointedly excluding the United States  128  The EAS  which includes ASEAN Plus Three  India  Australia and New Zealand  held its inaugural summit in 2005  China is also a founding member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation  SCO   along with Russia and the Central Asian republics  In 2000  the U S  Congress approved  permanent normal trade relations   PNTR  with China  allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries  129  Both Bill Clinton and George W  Bush asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform  130  Bush was furthermore an advocate of China s entry into the World Trade Organization  WTO   131  China has a significant trade surplus with the United States  its most important export market  132  In the early 2010s  U S  politicians argued that the Chinese yuan was significantly undervalued  giving China an unfair trade advantage  133  Sinophobic attitudes often target Chinese minorities and nationals living outside of China  Sometimes  such anti Chinese attitudes turn violent  as occurred during the 13 May Incident in Malaysia in 1969 and the Jakarta riots of May 1998 in Indonesia  in which more than 2 000 people died  134  In recent years  a number of anti Chinese riots and incidents have also occurred in Africa and Oceania  135  136  Anti Chinese sentiment is often rooted in socio economics  137  Sino Japanese relations Main article  Sino Japanese relations The relationship between China and Japan has been strained at times by Japan s perceived refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of China  Revisionist comments made by prominent Japanese officials and some Japanese history textbooks regarding the 1937 Rape of Nanking have been a focus of particular controversy  Sino Japanese relations warmed considerably after Shinzo Abe became the Prime Minister of Japan in September 2006  and a joint historical study conducted by China and Japan released a report in 2010 which pointed toward a new consensus on the issue of World War 2 era atrocities  138  However  in the early 2010s  relations cooled once more  with Japan accusing China of withholding its reserves of valuable rare earth elements  139  Territorial disputes China has been involved in a number of international territorial disputes  mostly resulting from the legacy of unequal treaties imposed on China during the historical period of New Imperialism  Since the 1990s  China has been entering negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders  usually by offering concessions and accepting less than half of the disputed territory with each party  China s only remaining land border disputes are a disputed border with India and an undefined border with Bhutan  China is additionally involved in more minor multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the East and South China Seas  140  China and the developing world A meeting of G5 leaders in 2007  with China s Hu Jintao second from right  China is heavily engaged  both politically and economically  with numerous nations in the developing world  Most notably  they have followed a policy of engaging with African nations for trade and bilateral co operation  141  142 Xinhua  China s official news agency  states that there are no less than 750 000 Chinese nationals working or living in Africa  143  China has furthermore strengthened its ties with larger developing economies  becoming the largest trading partner of Brazil 144  and building strategic links with Argentina  145  Along with Brazil  Russia  India and South Africa  China is a member of the BRICS group of emerging major economies  and hosted the group s third official summit at Sanya in Hainan Province in April 2011  146  Emerging superpower China is regularly cited as a potential new superpower  with certain commentators pointing out that its rapid economic progress  military might  very large population  and increasing international influence could see it attain a prominent global role in the 21st century  Others  however  warn that economic bubbles and demographic imbalances could slow China s growth as the century progresses  147  148  149  150  151  Sociopolitical issues and reform See also  Human rights in the People s Republic of China  Hukou system  Social welfare in China  Elections in the People s Republic of China  and Feminism in the People s Republic of China The Chinese democracy movement  social activists  and some members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need for social and political reform  While economic and social controls have been greatly relaxed in China since the 1970s  political freedom is still tightly restricted  The Constitution of the People s Republic of China states that the  fundamental rights  of citizens include freedom of speech  freedom of the press  the right to a fair trial  freedom of religion  universal suffrage  and property rights  However  in practice  these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the State  152  153  154  As the Chinese economy expanded following Deng Xiaoping s 1978 reforms  tens of millions of rural Chinese who have moved to the cities 155  find themselves treated as second class citizens by China s hukou household registration system  which controls state benefits  156 Property rights are often poorly protected  and eminent domain land seizures have had a disproportionate effect on poorer peasants  155  In 2003  the average Chinese farmer paid three times more taxes than the average urban dweller  despite having one sixth of the annual income  156  However  a number of rural taxes have since been reduced or abolished  and additional social services provided to rural dwellers  157  158  159  Censorship of political speech and information  most notably on the Internet  160  is openly and routinely used in China to silence criticism of the government and the ruling Communist Party  161  162  In 2005  Reporters Without Borders ranked China 159th out of 167 states in its Annual World Press Freedom Index  indicating a very low level of perceived press freedom  163  The government has suppressed demonstrations by organizations that it considers a potential threat to  social stability   as was the case with the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989  The Communist Party has had mixed success in controlling information  a powerful and pervasive media control system faces equally strong market forces  an increasingly educated citizenry  and technological and cultural changes that are making China more open to the wider world  especially on environmental issues  164  165  However  attempts are still made by the Chinese government to control public access to outside information  with online searches for politically sensitive material being blocked by the so called Great Firewall  166  A number of foreign governments and NGOs routinely criticize China s human rights record  alleging widespread civil rights violations  including systematic use of lengthy detention without trial  forced confessions  torture  mistreatment of prisoners  and restrictions of freedom of speech  assembly  association  religion  the press  and labor rights  109  China executes more people than any other country  accounting for 72  of the world s total in 2009  though it is not the largest executioner per capita  167  The Chinese government has responded to foreign criticism by arguing that the notion of human rights should take into account a country s present level of economic development  and focus more on the people s rights to subsistence and development in poorer countries  168  The rise in the standard of living  literacy  and life expectancy for the average Chinese in the last three decades is seen by the government as tangible progress made in human rights  169  Efforts in the past decade to combat deadly natural disasters  such as the perennial Yangtze River floods  and work related accidents are also portrayed in China as progress in human rights for a still largely poor country  168  China s government remains divided over the issue of political reform  Some high ranking politicians have spoken out in favor reforms  while others remain more conservative  In 2010  Premier Wen Jiabao stated that China needs  to gradually improve the democratic election system so that state power will truly belong to the people and state power will be used to serve the people   Despite his status  Wen s comments were later censored by the government  170  As the social  cultural and political consequences of economic growth and reform become increasingly manifest  tensions between the conservatives and reformists in the Communist Party are sharpening  Zhou Tianyong  the vice director of research of the Central Party School  argues that gradual political reform as well as repression of those pushing for overly rapid change over the next thirty years will be essential if China is to avoid an overly turbulent transition to a democratic  middle class dominated polity  171  172  Some Chinese look back to the upheavals of the Cultural Revolution  and fear chaos if the Communist Party should lose control of the domestic situation  Military Main article  People s Liberation Army A PLAAF Chengdu J 10 fighter aircraft  With 2 3 million active troops  the People s Liberation Army  PLA  is the largest standing military force in the world  commanded by the Central Military Commission  CMC   173  The PLA consists of the People s Liberation Army Ground Force  PLAGF   the People s Liberation Army Navy  PLAN   the People s Liberation Army Air Force  PLAAF   and a strategic nuclear force  the Second Artillery Corps  The official announced budget of the PLA for 2009 was  70 billion  However  the United States government has claimed that China does not report its real level of military spending  which is allegedly much higher than the official budget  The Defense Intelligence Agency estimated that the real Chinese military budget for 2008 was between US 105 billion and US 150 billion  174  According to SIPRI  China s military expenditure in 2010 totalled US 114 3 billion  808 billion yuan   constituting the world s second largest military budget  175  As a recognised nuclear weapons state  China is considered both a major regional military power and an emerging military superpower  176  As of August 2011  China s Second Artillery Corps is believed to maintain at least 195 nuclear missiles  including 75 ICBMs  177  Nonetheless  China is the only member of the UN Security Council to have relatively limited power projection capabilities  178  To offset this  it has begun developing power projection assets  such as aircraft carriers  and has established a network of foreign military relationships that has been compared to a string of pearls  Members of a Chinese military honor guard  China has made significant progress in modernizing its military since the early 2000s  It has purchased state of the art Russian fighter jets  such as the Sukhoi Su 30s  and has also produced its own modern fighters  most notably the Chinese J 10s and the J 11s  179  China is furthermore engaged in developing an indigenous stealth aircraft  the Chengdu J 20  180  181  China s ground forces have also undergone significant modernisations  replacing its ageing Soviet derived tank inventory with numerous variants of the modern Type 99 tank  and upgrading its battlefield C3I systems to enhance its network centric warfare capabilities  182  China has furthermore acquired and improved upon the Russian S 300 surface to air missile system  which is considered to be among the most effective aircraft intercepting systems in the world  183  Russia has since produced the next generation S 400 Triumf system  with China reportedly having spent  500 million on a downgraded export version of it  184  A number of indigenous missile technologies have also been developed   in 2007  China conducted a successful test of an anti satellite missile  185  and its first indigenous land attack cruise missile  the CJ 10  entered service in 2009  In 2011  the Pentagon reported that China was believed to be testing the JL 2 missile  a new submarine launched nuclear ICBM with multiple warhead delivery capabilities  177  In recent years  much attention has been focused on enhancing the blue water capabilities of the People s Liberation Army Navy  186  In August 2011  China s first aircraft carrier  the refurbished Soviet vessel Varyag  began sea trials  187  China furthermore maintains a substantial fleet of submarines  including several nuclear powered attack and ballistic missile submarines  188  On 13 March 2011  the PLAN missile frigate Xuzhou was spotted off the coast of Libya  marking the first time in history a Chinese warship sailed into the Mediterranean  The ship s entrance into the Mediterranean was officially part of a humanitarian mission to rescue Chinese nationals from the 2011 Libyan civil war  though analysts such as Fareed Zakaria viewed the mission as also being an attempt to increase China s global military presence  189  Little information is available regarding the motivations supporting China s military modernization  A 2007 report by the US Secretary of Defense noted that  China s actions in certain areas increasingly appear inconsistent with its declaratory policies   190  For its part  China claims it maintains an army purely for defensive purposes  191  Economy Main article  Economy of the People s Republic of China The Shanghai Stock Exchange building in Shanghai s Lujiazui financial district  From its founding in 1949 until late 1978  the People s Republic of China was a Soviet style centrally planned economy  without private businesses or capitalism  To propel the country towards a modern  industrialized communist society  Mao Zedong instituted the Great Leap Forward in the early 1960s  although this had decidedly mixed economic results  192  Following Mao s death in 1976 and the consequent end of the Cultural Revolution  Deng Xiaoping and the new Chinese leadership began to reform the economy and move towards a more market oriented mixed economy under one party rule  Collectivization of the agriculture was dismantled and farmlands were privatized to increase productivity  In 1978  the PRC normalized diplomatic relations with Japan began  which became a significant foreign donor  Modern day China is mainly characterised as having a market economy based on private property ownership  193  194  and is one of the leading examples of state capitalism  195  196  Under the post Mao market reforms  a wide variety of small scale private enterprises were encouraged  while the government relaxed price controls and promoted foreign investment  Foreign trade was focused upon as a major vehicle of growth  leading to the creation of Special Economic Zones  SEZs   first in Shenzhen and then in other Chinese cities  Inefficient state owned enterprises  SOEs  were restructured by introducing western style management systems  with unprofitable ones being closed outright  resulting in massive job losses  By the latter part of 2010  China was reversing some of its economic liberalization initiatives  with state owned companies buying up independent businesses in the steel  auto and energy industries  197  In 1978  Deng Xiaoping initiated China s market oriented reforms  Since economic liberalization began in 1978  China s investment  and export led 198  economy has grown almost a hundredfold 199  and is the fastest growing major economy in the world  200  According to the IMF  China s annual average GDP growth between 2001 and 2010 was 10 5   and the Chinese economy is predicted to grow at an average annual rate of 9 5  between 2011 and 2015  Between 2007 and 2011  China s economic growth rate was equivalent to all of the G7 countries  growth combined  201  According to the Global Growth Generators index announced by Citigroup in February 2011  China has a very high 3G growth rating  202  As of 2012  China has the world s second largest nominal GDP  totalling approximately 47 2 trillion yuan  US 7 47 trillion  according to the country s National Bureau of Statistics  203  204  However  China s 2011 nominal GDP per capita of US 5 184 puts it behind around ninety countries  out of 183 countries on the IMF list  in global GDP per capita rankings  6  If PPP is taken into account in GDP figures  China is again second only to the United States   in 2011  its PPP GDP reached  11 316 trillion  corresponding to  8 394 per capita  6  In 2009  China s primary  secondary  and tertiary industries contributed 10 6   46 8   and 42 6  respectively to its total GDP  China is the third most visited country in the world  with 55 7 million inbound international visitors in 2010  205  It is a member of the WTO and is the world s second largest trading power behind the US  with a total international trade value of US 2 97 trillion 1 58 trillion in exports   1  and US 1 39 trillion in imports   2   Its foreign exchange reserves had reached US 2 85 trillion by the end of 2010  an increase of 18 7  over the previous year  making its reserves by far the world s largest  206  207  China owns an estimated  1 6 trillion of US securities  208  China  holding US 1 16 trillion in US Treasury bonds  209  is the largest foreign holder of US public debt  210  211  China is the world s third largest recipient of inward FDI  attracting US 92 4 billion in 2008 alone  212  and China increasingly invests abroad  with a total outward FDI of US 52 2 billion in 2008 making it the world s sixth largest outward investor  213  In 2010  China s inward FDI was  106 billion  marking a 16  increase over 2009  214  A graph comparing the 2011 GDPs of major economies  according to IMF data  China s success has been primarily due to manufacturing as a low cost producer  This is attributed to a combination of cheap labor  good infrastructure  relatively high productivity  favorable government policy  and a possibly undervalued exchange rate  The latter has been sometimes blamed for China s huge trade surplus  US 262 7 billion in 2007  215  and has become a major source of dispute between China and its major trading partners the US  EU  and Japan despite the yuan having been de pegged and having risen in value by 20  against the US dollar since 2005  216  China is moreover widely criticised for manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit goods   in 2005  the Asia Business Council alleged that the counterfeiting industry accounted for 8  of China s GDP at the time  217  218  The state still dominates in strategic  pillar  industries  such as energy and heavy industries   but private enterprise  composed of around 30 million private businesses  219  has expanded enormously  in 2005  it accounted for anywhere between 33  220  to 70  221  of national GDP  while the OECD estimate for that year was over 50  222  of China s national output  up from 1  in 1978  223  Its stock market in Shanghai  the SSE  has raised record amounts of IPOs and its benchmark Shanghai Composite index has doubled since 2005  SSE s market capitalization reached US 3 trillion in 2007  making it the world s fifth largest stock exchange  Foreign currency reserves and gold minus external debt  based on 2010 data from CIA Factbook  China now ranks 29th in the Global Competitiveness Index  224  although it is only ranked 135th among the 179 countries measured in the Index of Economic Freedom  225  46 Chinese companies made the list in the 2010 Fortune Global 500  Beijing alone with 30   226  Measured

world s most valuable bank   fifth ranked China Mobile  the world s most valuable telecommunications company  and seventh ranked China Construction Bank  227  Although a middle income country by Western standards  China s rapid growth has pulled hundreds of millions of its people out of poverty since 1978  Today  about 10  of the Chinese population live below the poverty line of US 1 per day  down from 64  in 1978   while life expectancy has increased to 73 years  More than 93  of the population is literate  228  compared to only 20  in 1950  229  Urban unemployment in China reportedly declined to 4  by the end of 2007  although true overall unemployment may be as high as 10   230  China s middle class population  defined as those with annual income of at least US 17 000  has reached more than 100 million as of 2011  231  while the number of super rich individuals worth more than 10 million yuan  US 1 5 million  is estimated to be 825 000  according to Hurun Report  232  Based on the Hurun rich list  the number of US dollar billionaires in China doubled from 130 in 2009 to 271 in 2010  giving China the world s second highest number of billionaires  233  China s retail market was worth RMB 8 9 trillion  US 1 302 trillion  in 2007  and is growing at 16 8  annually  234  China is also now the world s second largest consumer of luxury goods behind Japan  with 27 5  of the global share  235  Nanjing Road  a major shopping street in Shanghai  China s growth has been uneven  with some geographic regions growing faster than others  and a pronounced urban rural income gap contributing to a national Gini coefficient of 46 9   Development has been mainly concentrated in the heavily urbanised eastern coastal regions  while the remainder of the country has lagged behind  To counter this  the government has promoted development in the western  northeastern  and central regions of China  In recent years  China s rapid economic growth has contributed to severe consumer inflation  236  causing the prices of basic goods to rise steeply  Food prices in China increased by over 21  in the first four months of 2008 alone  237  To curb inflation and moderate rising property prices  the Chinese government has instituted a number of fiscal regulations and amendments  raising interest rates and imposing limits on bank loans  In September 2011  consumer prices rose by 6 1  compared to a year earlier  marking a reduction in inflation from the peak of 6 5  in July 2011  238  A side effect of increased economic regulation was a slowdown in overall growth   China s quarterly GDP growth fell to 9 1  in October 2011  down from 9 5  in the previous quarter  238  The Chinese economy is highly energy intensive and inefficient on average  industrial processes in China use 20  100  more energy than similar ones in OECD countries  239  China became the world s largest energy consumer in 2010  240  but still relies on coal to supply about 70  of its energy needs  241  Coupled with lax environmental regulations  this has led to massive water and air pollution  leaving China with 20 of the world s 30 most polluted cities  239  Consequently  the government has promised to use more renewable energy  planning to make renewables constitute 30  of China s total energy production by 2050  242  In 2010  China became the largest wind energy provider in the world  with a total installed wind power capacity of 41 8 GW  243  In January 2011  Russia began scheduled oil shipments to China  pumping 300 000 barrels of oil per day via the Eastern Siberia

Inventions Discoveries By era Han Dynasty Tang Dynasty Song Dynasty People s Republic of China Present day China This box  view talk edit Ancient Chinese inventors were responsible for pioneering a vast number of technologies  These included papermaking  woodblock printing and movable type printing  the early lodestone and needle compass  gunpowder  toilet paper  early seismological detectors  matches  pound locks  the double action piston pump  blast furnace and cast iron  the iron plough  the multi tube seed drill  the suspension bridge  245  natural gas as a fuel  the differential gear for the South Pointing Chariot  the hydraulic powered armillary sphere and trip hammer  the mechanical chain drive and belt drive  the raised relief map  the propeller  the crossbow  the cannon  and the multistage rocket  Chinese astronomers were among the first to record observations of a supernova  Chinese mathematics evolved independently of Greek mathematics and is therefore of great interest in the history of mathematics  Moreover  the Chinese were keen on documenting all of their technological achievements  such as in the Tiangong Kaiwu encyclopedia written by Song Yingxing  1587 1666   Despite its earlier sophistication  China s grasp of science and technology had fallen behind that of Europe by the 17th century  Political  social and cultural reasons have been given for Great Divergence  although recent historians focus more on economic causes  such as the high level equilibrium trap  Since the beginning of Deng Xiaoping s market reforms  China has grown increasingly connected to the global economy and information sphere  and the government has placed a heavy emphasis on the development of science and technology  After the Sino Soviet split of the 1960s and  70s  China started to develop its own nuclear weapons and delivery systems  successfully detonating its first surface nuclear test in 1964 at Lop Nur  A natural outgrowth of this was a satellite launching program  which culminated in 1970 with the launching of Dong Fang Hong I  the first Chinese satellite  This made China the fifth nation to independently launch a satellite  In 1992  the Shenzhou manned spaceflight program was authorized  246  After four unmanned tests  Shenzhou 5 was launched on 15 October 2003  using a Long March 2F launch vehicle and carrying Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei  making China the third country to put a human being into space through its own endeavors  247  In 2008  China successfully completed the Shenzhou 7 mission  making it the third country to have the capability to conduct a spacewalk  China maintains an active lunar exploration program   it successfully launched the Chang e 1 and Chang e 2 lunar survey probes in 2007 and 2011 respectively  and is planning to launch a lunar rover in 2013  as a precursor to a possible manned lunar landing in the 2020s  248  In September 2011  the first Chinese space station module  Tiangong 1  was successfully launched  marking the first step in a decade long project to construct a large manned space station  249  China is furthermore considering a manned mission to Mars  250  and made its first attempt at the robotic exploration of Mars in November 2011  251  Stem cell research and gene therapy  which some in the Western world see as controversial  face minimal regulation in China  China has an estimated 926 000 researchers  second only to the 1 3 million in the United States  252  Through domestic development and foreign partnerships  China has significantly increased the sophistication of its transport network in recent decades  becoming a world leader in high speed rail technology  253  China is also actively developing its software  semiconductor and energy industries  including renewable energies such as hydroelectric  wind and solar power  254  In an effort to reduce pollution from coal burning power plants  China has been pioneering the deployment of pebble bed nuclear reactors  which run cooler and safer than conventional nuclear reactors  and have potential applications for the development of a hydrogen economy  255  In 2010  China developed Tianhe IA  for a time the world s fastest supercomputer  at the National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin  256  China is also rapidly advancing in the field of robotics  and is predicted to have the world s fifth largest industrial robot workforce by 2014  257  Infrastructure Communications Main article  Telecommunications in the People s Republic of China China currently has the most cellphone users of any country in the world  with over 800 million users as of July 2010  258  It also has the world s largest number of internet and broadband users  259  By December 2010  China had around 457 million internet users  an increase of 19  over the previous year  and by the end of 2011 the number of internet users had exceeded 500 million  260  261  262  According to the China Internet Network Information Center  CNNIC   China s average internet connection speed is 100 9 kbit s  less than half of the global average of 212 5 kbit s  263  China Telecom and China Unicom  the country s two largest broadband providers  accounted for 20  of global broadband subscribers  whereas the world s ten largest broadband service providers combined accounted for 39  of the world s broadband customers  China Telecom alone serves 55 million broadband subscribers  while China Unicom serves more than 40 million  The massive rise in internet use in China continues to fuel rapid broadband growth  whereas the world s other major broadband ISPs operate in the mature markets of the developed world  with high levels of broadband penetration and rapidly slowing subscriber growth  264  Transport Main article  Transport

China has been prioritised by the government in recent decades  and has undergone intense state led development since the late 1990s  The national road network has been massively expanded through the creation of a network of expressways  known as the National Trunk Highway System  NTHS   By the end of 2011  China s expressways had reached a total length of 85 000 km  53 000 mi   second only to the network of the United States  265  China also possesses the world s longest high speed rail network  with over 9 676 km  6 012 mi  of service routes  Of these  3 515 km  2 184 mi  serve trains with top speeds of 300 km h  190 mph   266  In 2011  China unveiled a prototype train capable of reaching speeds of 310 mph  500 km h   the first ultra high speed train developed solely by its domestic railway industry  253  Private car ownership is growing rapidly  with China surpassing the United States as the largest automobile market in the world in 2009  with total car sales of over 13 6 million  267  Domestic air travel has also increased significantly  but remains too expensive for most  Long distance transportation is dominated by railways and charter bus systems  Railways are the vital carrier in China  they are monopolized by the state  divided into various railway bureaux in different regions  Due to huge demand  the system is regularly subject to overcrowding  particularly during holiday seasons  such as Chunyun during the Chinese New Year  Rapid transit systems are also rapidly developing in China s major cities  in the form of networks of underground or light rail systems  Hong Kong has one of the most developed transport systems in the world  while Shanghai has a high speed maglev rail line connecting the city to its main international airport  Pudong International Airport  Demographics Main article  Demographics of the People s Republic of China A population density map of the People s Republic of China  The eastern  coastal provinces are much more densely populated than the western interior  As of July 2010  the People s Republic of China has an estimated total population of 1 338 612 968  About 21  of the population  145 461 833 males  128 445 739 females  are 14 years old or younger  71   482 439 115 males  455 960 489 females  are between 15 and 64 years old  and 8   48 562 635 males  53 103 902 females  are over 65 years old  The population growth rate for 2006 was 0 6   268  By end of 2010  the proportion of mainland Chinese people aged 14 or younger was 16 60   while the number aged 60 or older grew to 13 26   giving a total proportion of 29 86  dependents  The proportion of the population of workable age was thus around 70   269  With a population of over 1 3 billion and dwindling natural resources  China is very concerned about its population growth and has attempted  with mixed results  270  to implement a strict family planning policy  The government s goal is one child per family  with exceptions for ethnic minorities and a degree of flexibility in rural areas  It is hoped that population growth in China will stabilize in the early decades of the 21st century  though some projections estimate a population of anywhere between 1 4 billion and 1 6 billion by 2025  China s family planning minister has indicated that the one child policy will be maintained until at least 2020  271  Population of China from 1949 to 2008  The one child policy is resisted  particularly in rural areas  because of the need for agricultural labour and a traditional preference for boys  who can later serve as male heirs   Families who breach the policy often lie during the census  272  Official government policy opposes forced sterilization or abortion  but allegations of coercion continue as local officials  who are faced with penalties for failing to curb population growth  may resort to forcible measures  or manipulation of census figures  citation needed  The decreasing reliability of China population statistics since family planning began in the late 1970s has made evaluating the effectiveness of the policy difficult  272  Data from the 2010 census implies that the total fertility rate may now be around 1 4  273  The government is particularly concerned with the large imbalance in the sex ratio at birth  apparently the result of a combination of traditional preference for boys and family planning pressure  which led to a ban on using ultrasound devices in an attempt to prevent sex selective abortion  According to the 2010 census  there were 118 06 boys born for every 100 girls  which is 0 53 points lower than the ratio obtained from a population sample survey carried out in 2005  274  However  the gender ratio of 118 06 is still beyond the normal range of around 105 percent  and experts warn of increased social instability should this trend continue  275  For the population born between the years 1900 and 2000  it is estimated that there could be 35 59 million fewer females than males  276  Other demographers argue that perceived gender imbalances may arise from the underreporting of female births  277  278  279  280  A recent study suggests that as many as three million Chinese babies are hidden by their parents every year  280  According to the 2010 census  males accounted for 51 27 percent of the total population  while females made up 48 73 percent of the total

population  282  The Han Chinese outnumber the minority groups in every province  municipality and autonomous region except Tibet and Xinjiang  and are descended from ancient Huaxia tribes living along the Yellow River  Ethnic minorities account for about 8 49  of the population of China  according to the 2010 census  282  Compared with the 2000 population census  the Han population increased by 66 537 177 persons  or 5 74   while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased by 7 362 627 persons  or 6 92   282  The 2010 census recorded a total of 593 832 foreign citizens living in China  The largest such groups were from South Korea  120 750   the United States  71 493  and Japan  66 159   283  Languages Main article  Languages of China The languages most spoken in China belong to the Sino Tibetan language family  There are also several major linguistic groups within the Chinese language itself  The most spoken varieties are Mandarin  spoken by over 70  of the population   Wu  includes Shanghainese   Yue  includes Cantonese and Taishanese   Min  includes Hokkien and Teochew   Xiang  Gan  and Hakka  Non Sinitic languages spoken widely by ethnic minorities include Zhuang  Mongolian  Tibetan  Uyghur  Hmong and Korean  284 Standard Mandarin  a variety of Mandarin based on the Beijing dialect  is the official national language of China and is used as a lingua franca between people of different linguistic backgrounds  Classical Chinese was the written standard in China for thousands of years  and allowed for written communication between speakers of various unintelligible languages and dialects in China  Written vernacular Chinese  or baihua  is the written standard based on the Mandarin dialect and first popularized in Ming Dynasty novels  It was adopted with significant modifications during the early 20th century as the national standard  Classical Chinese is still part of the high school curriculum and is thus intelligible to some degree to many Chinese  Since its promulgation by the government in 1956  Simplified Chinese characters have become the official standardized written script used to write the Chinese language within mainland China  supplanting the use of Traditional Chinese characters used earlier there  Urbanization See also  List of cities in the People s Republic of China  List of cities in the People s Republic of

In 1986  China set the long term goal of providing compulsory nine year basic education to every child  As of 2007  there were 396 567 primary schools  94 116 secondary schools  and 2 236 higher education institutions in China  290  In February 2006  the government advanced its basic education goal by pledging to provide completely free nine year education  including textbooks and fees  291  Free compulsory education in China consists of elementary school and middle school  which lasts for 9 years  ages 6 15   almost all children in urban areas continue with three years of high school  As of 2007 update   93 3  of the population over age 15 are literate  268  In 2000  China s literacy rate among 15 to 24 year olds was 98 9   99 2  for males and 98 5  for females   292  In March 2007  the Chinese government declared education a national  strategic priority   the central budget for national scholarships was tripled between 2007 and 2009  and 223 5 billion yuan  US 28 65 billion  of extra state funding was allocated between 2007 and 2012 to improve compulsory education in rural areas  293  In 2009  Chinese students from Shanghai achieved the world s best results in mathematics

the provincial health bureaux  oversees the health needs of the Chinese population  297  An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized health policy since the early 1950s  At that time  the Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign  which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene  as well as treating and preventing several diseases  Diseases such as cholera  typhoid and scarlet fever  which were previously rife in China  were nearly eradicated by the campaign  After Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978  the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly due to better nutrition  although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the People s Communes  Healthcare in China became mostly privatised  and experienced a significant rise in quality  The national life expectancy at birth rose from about 35 years in 1949 to 73 18 years in 2008  298  299  and infant mortality decreased from 300 per thousand in the 1950s to around 23 per thousand in 2006  40  300  Malnutrition as of 2002 update  stood at 12  of the population  according to United Nations FAO sources  301  Despite significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced Western style medical facilities  China has several emerging public health problems  such as respiratory illnesses caused by widespread air pollution 302  and hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers  303  304  a possible future HIV AIDS epidemic  and an increase in obesity among urban youths  305  306  China s large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks in recent years  such as the 2003 outbreak of SARS  although this has since been largely contained  307  Estimates of excess deaths in China from environmental pollution  apart from smoking  are placed at 760 000 people per annum from air and water pollution  including indoor air pollution   308  In 2007  China overtook the United States as the world s biggest producer of carbon dioxide  309  Some 90  of China s cities suffer from some degree of water pollution  310  and nearly 500 million people lacked access to safe drinking water in 2005  311  Reports by the World Bank and the New York Times have claimed industrial pollution  particularly of the air  312  to be a significant health hazard in China  Religion Main article  Religion in China The Temple of Heaven  a large complex of Taoist buildings in Beijing  where the Emperor was said to commune with Heaven  In mainland China  the government allows a degree of religious freedom to members of state approved religious organizations  An accurate number of religious adherents is hard to obtain because of a lack of official data  but there is general consensus that religion has been enjoying a resurgence over the past 20 years  313  A 1998 survey by Adherents com found that 59   over 700 million  314  of the population was irreligious  A later survey  conducted in 2007  found that there are 300 million believers in China  constituting 23  of the population  as distinct from an official figure of 100 million  313  Despite the surveys  varying results  most agree that China s traditional religions Buddhism  Taoism  and Chinese folk religions are the dominant faiths  According to various sources  Buddhism in China accounts for between 660 million   50  of the population  and over 1 billion   80    315  316  317  318  while Taoists number 400 million   30    319  320  However  because of the fact that one person may subscribe to two or more of these traditional beliefs simultaneously and the difficulty in clearly differentiating Buddhism  Taoism  and Chinese folk religions  the number of adherents to these religions can be overlaid  In addition  subscribing to Buddhism and Taoism is not necessarily considered religious by those who follow the philosophies in principle but stop short of believing in any kind of deity or divinity  321  322  323  Saint Sophia Cathedral in Harbin  northeast China  By 1921  Harbin had a Russian population of around 100 000  feeding the growth of Christianity in the city  324  Most Chinese Buddhists are merely nominal adherents  because only a small proportion of the population  around 8  or 100 million  325  326  may have taken the formal step of going for refuge  327  328  Even then  it is still difficult to estimate accurately the number of Buddhists because they do not have congregational memberships and often do not participate in public ceremonies  329 Mahayana      Dacheng  and its subsets Pure Land  Amidism   Tiantai and Ch n  better known in the west by its Japanese pronunciation Zen  are the most widely practiced denominations of Buddhism  Other forms  such as Theravada and Tibetan  are practiced largely by ethnic minorities along the geographic fringes of the Chinese mainland  330  Christianity was first introduced to China during the Tang Dynasty  with the arrival of Nestorian Christianity in 635 AD  This was followed by Franciscan missionaries in the 13th century  Jesuits in the 16th century  and finally Protestants in the 19th century  Of China s minority religions  Christianity is one of the fastest growing  The total number of Christians is difficult to determine  as many belong to unauthorized house churches  but estimates of their number have ranged from 40 million  3  of the total population  313  331  to 54 million  4   332  to as many as 130 million  10    333  Official government statistics put the number of Christians at 16 million  but these count only members of officially sanctioned church bodies  334  China is believed to now have the world s second largest evangelical Christian population behind only the United States and is also experiencing a surge in mainstream Christian publishing  335  336  The Masjid and Islamic Centre in Kowloon  Islam in China dates to a mission in 651  only 18 years after Muhammad s death  Muslims initially came to China for trade  becoming prominent in the trading ports of the Song Dynasty  337  338  Later  Muslims such as Zheng He  Lan Yu and Yeheidie erding became influential in government circles  and Nanjing became an important center of Islamic study  339  Accurate statistics on China s Muslim population are hard to find  and most estimates give a figure of between 20 and 30 million Muslims  1 5  to 2  of the total population   340  341  342  343  344  China also plays host to numerous minority religions  including Hinduism  Dongbaism  B n  and a number of more modern religions and sects  particularly Xiantianism   In July 1999  the Falun Gong spiritual practice was officially banned by the authorities  345  and many international organizations have criticized the government s treatment of Falun Gong that has occurred since then  346  There are no reliable estimates of the number of Falun Gong practitioners in China  347  although informal estimates have given figures as high as 70 million  348  349  Culture Main articles  Culture of the People s Republic of China and Chinese culture A traditional Beijing opera being performed  350  Beijing s Forbidden City  showing its classical Chinese architectural style  Since ancient times  Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism and conservative philosophies  For centuries  opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious Imperial examinations  which were instituted in 605 AD to help the Emperor select skilful bureaucrats  The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China  such as the belief that calligraphy and literati painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama  A number of more authoritarian and rational strains of thought were also influential  with Legalism being a prominent example  There was often conflict between the philosophies   for instance  the individualistic Song Dynasty neo Confucians believed that Legalism departed from the original spirit of Confucianism  Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today  In recent years  a number of New Confucians have claimed that modern democratic ideals and human rights are compatible with traditional Confucian values  351  The first leaders of the People s Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order  but were influenced by the May Fourth Movement and reformist ideals  They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture  such as rural land tenure  sexism  and the Confucian system of education  while preserving others  such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state  Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history  while others claim that the Communist Party s rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture  especially through political movements such as the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s  where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed  having been denounced as  regressive and harmful  or  vestiges of feudalism   Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture  such as Confucianism  Chinese art  literature  and performing arts like Peking opera  were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time  Today  the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society  With the rise of Chinese nationalism and the end of the Cultural Revolution  various forms of traditional Chinese art  literature  music  film  fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival  352  353  and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide  354  Prior to the beginning of maritime Sino European trade in the 16th century  medieval China and the European West were linked by the Silk Road  which was a key route of cultural as well as economic exchange  Artifacts from the history of the Road  as well as from the natural history of the Gobi desert  are displayed in the Silk Route Museum in Jiuquan  355  Cuisine This section requires expansion  Main article  Chinese cuisine Traditional Chinese food in Tianjin  including dumpling and dandan noodles  Chinese cuisine is highly diverse  drawing on several millennia of culinary history  The dynastic emperors of ancient China were known to host banquets with over 100 dishes served at a time  356  employing countless imperial kitchen staff and concubines to prepare the food  Such royal dishes gradually became a part of wider Chinese culture  China s staple food is rice  but the country is also well known for its meat dishes  Spices are endemic to Chinese cuisine  Numerous foreign offshoots of Chinese food  such as Hong Kong cuisine and American Chinese food  have emerged in the various nations which play host to the Chinese diaspora  Sports Main article  Sport in the People s Republic of China Dragon boat racing  a popular traditional Chinese sport  China has one of the oldest sporting cultures in the world  There is evidence that a form of association football was played in China around 1000 AD  357  Today  some of the most popular sports in the country include martial arts  basketball  football  table tennis  badminton  swimming and snooker  Board games such as go  weiqi   xiangqi  and more recently chess  are also played at a professional level  358  Physical fitness is widely emphasized in Chinese culture  Morning exercises are a common activity  with elderly citizens encouraged to practice qigong and t ai chi ch uan  Young people in China are also keen on basketball  especially in urban centers with limited space and grass areas  The American National Basketball Association has a huge following among Chinese youths  with Chinese players such as Yao Ming being held in high esteem  359  Many more traditional sports are also played in China  Dragon boat racing occurs during the annual nationwide Dragon Boat Festival  and has since gained popularity abroad  In Inner Mongolia  sports such as Mongolian style wrestling and horse racing are popular  In Tibet  archery and equestrianism are a part of traditional festivals  360  China has participated at the Olympic Games since 1932  although it has only participated as the PRC since 1952  China hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing  and received 51 gold medals   the highest number of gold medals of any participating nation that year  361  China will host the 2013 East Asian Games in Tianjin and the 2014 Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing  See also Asia portal China
