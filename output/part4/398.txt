Infinite Earths  Following that event  DC Comics rebooted their continuity and relaunched the Superman character with the miniseries  The Man of Steel   written by John Byrne  However  due to disputes with DC  Byrne left the Superman books and was replaced by Roger Stern  While the stories continued from Byrne s revamp  sales slowly dropped  In an effort to attract female readers  the Lois Lane Clark Kent Superman love triangle  in place since 1938  was changed  In a development based on events in Byrne s revamp  Lois was already falling in love with Clark Kent  rather than with Superman  In a story arc titled  Krisis of Krimson Kryptonite   Clark proposes to Lois  she accepts  Although the road was set for the marriage of Lois and Clark  an unforeseen event would change these plans  Viacom had cancelled the Superboy television series produced by Alexander Salkind  Salkind produced the first three Superman films starring Christopher Reeve  as well as the Supergirl movie   Warner Bros   the owner of DC Comics  created their own Superman television series  Lois  amp  Clark  The New Adventures of Superman  premised upon a romantic relationship between Lois Lane and Clark Kent Superman  One of the ideas that arose during production was the wedding of Lois Lane and Clark Kent Superman  Warner Bros  learned that DC Comics was planning a similar plotline in the Superman comic books  and as a result DC  Warner Bros   and the Superman writing staff came together and reached an agreement  the Lois and Clark wedding arc in the comic book would be put on hold  to resume once the Lois  amp  Clark TV show reached its wedding episode  With the original storyline set aside in the comic  an original event was needed to replace it  According to a documentary on Superman  Doomsday  the Superman writing team members were miffed at having a year s worth of story planning put aside  and flustered for ideas  At the end of one meeting  Adventures of Superman writer Jerry Ordway suggested  jokingly   Let s just kill  im   The joke became a running gag in story meetings  but eventually gained traction with Superman group editor Mike Carlin  In the documentary film Look  Up in the Sky  The Amazing Story of Superman Carlin states   the world was taking Superman for granted  so we literally said  let s show what the world would be like without Superman     edit  Storyline  edit  Doomsday Superman dies in Lois Lane s arms  On the last page of several comics prior to Superman  The Man of Steel  18  a gloved fist is shown punching a steel wall  accompanied by the caption   Doomsday is coming   In that issue  Superman fights the Underworlders while a hulking figure in a green suit rampages through a pastoral field  This marks the first of seven issues in the  Death of Superman  story proper  which would continue through all four of the Superman books at that time  and one issue of Justice League America  before culminating in Superman  vol  2   75  The Justice League International  Guy Gardner  Blue Beetle  Booster Gold  Maxima  Fire  Ice  and Bloodwynd  responds to a call from a smashed big rig outside of Bucyrus  Ohio  and follows the trail of destruction which leads them to a confrontation with the mysterious creature  2  It systematically takes the team apart  finishing by punching Booster Gold into the stratosphere  Booster Gold is caught in mid air by Superman  and declares  It s like Doomsday is here   thus providing the monster with a name  The Man of Steel arrives on the scene  having cut short a television interview with Cat Grant in Justice League America  69  He and the able bodied League members follow the threat to the home of a single mother and her two children  where their battle with  Doomsday  destroys the house  The League attacks Doomsday with all their energy projection powers  the only discernible effect is that much of his bodysuit is blasted or burned off  Doomsday again defeats the League  causes the house to explode into flames  and then leaps away  Superman follows  after saving the small family  Superman throws Doomsday into the bottom of a lake  After Doomsday escapes from the lake bed  he and Superman tear up a city street  Maxima then reenters the fray  Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are sent to cover the battle for television  while Lex Luthor  then masquerading as his non existent son  Lex Luthor II   dissuades Supergirl  Matrix  from joining the fight  The fight continues at a gas station  where Maxima rips a light post from the ground  the sparks from the wiring ignite the leaking gasoline and the station is destroyed in a huge explosion  Guardian arrives after Doomsday leaves  finding Superman and Maxima  and offers his aid  Superman then follows Doomsday s trail of destruction  waiting for an opportunity to attack  With the monster s rampage drawing closer  Lex Jr  convinces Supergirl that she s needed in Metropolis while Superman is fighting elsewhere  While demolishing an appliance store  Doomsday sees a TV commercial for a wrestling show being held in Metropolis  and after seeing a road sign for Metropolis  heads in that direction  Superman engages him and throws him in the opposite direction  where he lands on the mountain housing Project Cadmus  They brawl throughout Habitat  a living forest connected to Cadmus  bringing most of it down  When the superhero Guardian arrives  Doomsday knocks him down and leaps toward Metropolis  Doomsday is driven below ground  where he ruptures gas and electrical mains  leveling Newtown  a large section of Metropolis  Supergirl goes to Superman s aid  but a single punch from Doomsday knocks her to the ground  her form destabilized  Professor Emil Hamilton and Bibbo Bibbowski  Superman s allies fire a laser cannon at Doomsday  but it does not harm him  The local police open fire on Doomsday  but again  he is not harmed  Superman returns to the fight  Superman and Doomsday lay into each other with everything they have  They strike each other with so much force that the shockwaves from their punches shatter windows  At the struggle s culminating moment in front of the Daily Planet building  each fighter lands a massive blow upon his opponent  The two titans collapse and moments later  in the arms of a frantic Lois Lane  Superman succumbs to his wounds and seemingly dies  2  Jimmy  Ice  and Bloodwynd are also present at the end  The climactic event happened in Superman  vol  2   75  The issue only contains 22 panels  and every page was a single panel  which was a structure building on the previous issues   Adventures of Superman  497 was done entirely with four panel pages  Action Comics  684 with three  and Superman  The Man of Steel  19 with two  The entire story was immediately collected into a trade paperback and titled The Death of Superman   edit  Funeral for a Friend DC Comics  casts pays tribute to The Man of Steel  Art by Tom Grummett  The funeral that followed featured many of Superman s fellow heroes and friends  including most of the Justice League of America  and a mausoleum was built in Metropolis in honor of the Man of Steel  During this time  every hero in the DC Universe  even Guy Gardner and Green Arrow  neither of whom had ever personally gotten along with him  sported a black arm band featuring the S Shield logo  Some time later  Project Cadmus stole Superman s body from his mausoleum  which had been ironically provided by his longtime foe Lex Luthor  who said that if he couldn t kill Superman  then he at least wanted to bury him  It was hypothesized that they were attempting to clone him  The body was recovered by Lois Lane and Supergirl  The stories after the funeral often dealt with the emotions felt by the general public as well as specific characters entwined within Superman s world  including Lois Lane  Clark Kent s parents  and even a number of supervillains  Also  the  then  President of the United States  Bill Clinton and wife Hillary were included in a scene during the funeral  With Superman gone  crime rises up again and the costumed heroes of Metropolis rise to fill in as protectors  Supergirl  Gangbuster  Thorn  and even Team Luthor  a Lexcorp sponsored team  all tried but were not sufficient  Meanwhile  Jonathan Kent took the death of his adoptive son the hardest and as a result suffered a heart attack  At this point  all Superman comic titles went on a three month hiatus  The story was also collected into trade paperback form  Rather than using the banner title Funeral for a Friend  the title used for the collection was World Without a Superman   edit  Reign of the Supermen  The Man of Tomorrow  Cover to Superman  vol  2  79  Art by Dan Jurgens  The Last Son of Krypton  Panel from Action Comics  687  June 1993   Art by Jackson Guice  Following a three month hiatus on the Superman titles  all of them were relaunched  Four new heroes emerged in Superman s place  one in each title  each claiming in some way to be Superman  The story of The Adventures of Superman  500 followed Jonathan Kent into the Afterlife  In a possible hallucination  he convinced Superman s soul to come back with him to the living  The only  evidence  that this was not a hallucination was the fact that shortly after Jonathan reawoke  four individuals arrived in Metropolis claiming to be Superman  This storyline was known as Reign of the Supermen  Each of the Supermen were designed with ideas taken from some of the monikers that Superman is often associated with  The four new heroes were  The Man of Steel  John Henry Irons was an ironworker and an ex weapons designer for the military who wears a suit of armor and wields a hammer  Of the four  he is the only one who did not claim to actually be Superman  but rather that he represented the spirit of Superman and continued his legacy  Steel appeared in Superman  The Man of Steel  starting with  22  He later changed his name to just  Steel   The Man of Tomorrow  also called the Cyborg Superman  arrived with augmented Kryptonian technology  He was scientifically  proven  to be Superman  but claims amnesia in explanation to his part mechanical nature  The Cyborg Superman appeared in Superman  vol  2   starting with  78  After he was eventually revealed as former NASA astronaut Hank Henshaw  he later became a major supervillain  The Metropolis Kid  who hated being called Superboy  is a reckless teenage clone of Superman  This Superman appeared in The Adventures of Superman  starting with  501  He is the result of the brief time Cadmus attempted to clone Superman  He later had a career as Superboy  The Last Son of Krypton was a visored  energy powered alien who dealt with criminals lethally  The Last Son of Krypton appeared in Action Comics  starting with  687  He claims to have the memories of the original Superman  but his emotional distance makes Lois uncertain  He later was discovered to be the Eradicator  a reformed Superman enemy  4  The first issue for each of the new heroes featured a cardstock cover and a poster of the new hero  First appearance of Superboy  The Metropolis Kid  in Adventures of Superman  500  1993   Art by Tom Grummett  The Man of Steel  Full Page of Superman  The Man of Steel 22  Art by Jon Bogdanove  The first half of the Reign of the Supermen  story focuses on each of the Supermen  resuming  his duty as protector of Metropolis and gaining acceptance from the public  Of the four  the reader very quickly learns that neither the cloned Metropolis Kid nor the armored Man of Steel are the real Superman  The Cyborg Man of Tomorrow and the Last Son of Krypton were easily bought in by the people as the possible real Superman  since Lois questioned both of them  and both recalled memories which Clark Kent had  Cyborg was even tested by Dr  Hamilton who stated that the Cyborg appeared to be the real Superman  In actuality  the Last Son of Krypton stole Superman s body and put it in a regeneration matrix in the Fortress of Solitude  drawing on his recovering energies to power himself  as bright light blinded him  It is revealed that the Last Son is  in actuality  the Eradicator  an ancient Kryptonian weapon  and the Cyborg is the deranged consciousness of Hank Henshaw  which used Superman s birthing matrix to create a physical duplicate of his body  4  Superman  Steel  John Henry Irons   and Superboy from the  Reign of the Supermen  storyline  1993  Cover to Adventures of Superman  504 by Tom Grummett  The actual Superman returns  Portion of a page from Adventures of Superman 504 by Tom Grummett  The regeneration matrix broke open  and the original Superman emerged  greatly depowered  but alive  Meanwhile  the Cyborg helped Mongul destroy Coast City  believing he killed the Last Son in the explosion  and captured Superboy  holding him in Engine City  a towering construct erected where Coast City once stood  Superboy escaped and flew back to Metropolis to get the Man of Steel to help him fight the Cyborg  Before he could tell the whole story  however  an overbearing Kryptonian Battlesuit rose out of the harbor  and the two heroes attacked it  After suffering heavy damage  the suit opened  revealing a still weak Superman  who had used it to walk all the way back from the Fortress of Solitude  Despite his weakened state  he quickly joined the other Supermen in defending Coast City  Upon his revelation  he acknowledged himself as the real Superman  the fifth person at this point to claim that title   When asked by Lois Lane what made him any different from the other Supermen  he responded with  How about    To Kill a Mockingbird    Clark Kent s favorite movie  and something he shared with only those closest to him   Though she remained hesitant  Lois mentally acknowledged that this was something only the real Clark Kent would know  During the battle of Coast City  the Cyborg launched a devastating missile at Metropolis  with the intent of destroying it and putting a second Engine City in its place  Superboy managed to grab onto the missile as it launched  riding it all the way to Metropolis  which he narrowly saved from destruction  Green Lantern Hal Jordan had returned from space to find his hometown destroyed  He immediately attacked Engine City and fought Mongul  shattering the Man of Steel s hammer across his face  Meanwhile  the Last Son Eradicator joined the fight after recovering in the Fortress  and shielded Superman from the Cyborg s lethal Kryptonite gas  The gas interacted with the Eradicator as it passed through and into Superman  returning his powers rather than killing him  4  The Eradicator s body degenerated into a lifeless husk  and the Cyborg looked for Superman s body in the debris and Kryptonite mist  Superman blindsided him with an attack using his super strength  and he punched a hole right through the Cyborg  He destroyed his body  but his consciousness survived  Supergirl used the remnants of the black Kryptonian suit to recreate Superman s traditional costume  and the group returned to Metropolis  Later on  Superman  Supergirl and Lois collaborate to film Clark Kent s rescue  Supergirl using her shapeshifting powers to pose as Clark Kent and create the impression that Clark was trapped in an underground bunker in Doomsday s initial attack  able to sustain himself on supplies in the bunker but unable to escape until Superman returned and was able to contribute his X ray vision to the rescue effort  Again  like the previous two storylines  the collected edition of Reign of the Supermen did not use its original title  DC Comics instead chose to use The Return of Superman   edit  Aftermath  edit  Superman During the time Superman spent in stasis recovering in the Fortress of Solitude  his hair grew to shoulder length  Even after reclaiming his title as the one true Superman  he kept his hair long and this was how he was depicted for much of his appearances in the 1990s comics  Before his wedding with Lois  he cut his hair  Up until the Death of Superman event  DC Comics writers lived on a fixed set of rules when it came to how the post Crisis Superman s powers were portrayed  This was changed upon his return  The change could be traced to when the Eradicator transformed Kryptonite energy into something that would repower the revived Superman  In a battle with Lobo  Superman discovered he could survive the vacuum of space indefinitely  something the post Crisis Superman could not do before his death  He also noticed his strength had increased  Although this was part of a subplot involving Superman s powers growing out of control as he absorbed too much solar energy  the depiction of his power was not as consistent as before   edit  The Surviving Supermen The Metropolis Kid  who later accepted the name  Superboy   and The Man of Steel  whose name became simply  Steel   went on to become recurring characters in the DC Universe  each eventually getting his own monthly title  Superboy was a member of The Ravers  Young Justice  the Legion of Super Heroes  and the Teen Titans  before perishing in Infinite Crisis  He was brought back to life in Final Crisis  Legion of Three Worlds  He eventually discovered that he is a Kryptonian Human hybrid clone  created from the DNA of Superman and Lex Luthor  Steel appeared as a character in the DC animated universe  as well as his own film  and became a member of the Justice League  he also briefly became a true superhuman  no longer relying on outside sources  i e  the armor  to provide his powers  and somewhat of a scientist figure and fatherly figure for the also artificially empowered Infinitors  powerless again but able to provide counseling  technical expertise  and support  The Eradicator became leader of a new team of Outsiders for awhile and his current status is that he is allied with Markovia after Geo Force  Prince Brion  declares an agreement was signed between himself and the Eradicator to be allies during the  New Krypton War of The Supermen  storyline  resulting in Markovia being shunned by the world at large as a result of New Krypton s recent actions  and its peoples holding protests from this result  The Cyborg Superman becomes a recurring nemesis in the Superman and Green Lantern titles  leading and upgrading the former cybernetic patrol organization known as the Manhunters and joining the Sinestro Corps as a field officer  hoping to be rid of his immortality   edit  Supermen of America The character Mitch Anderson was introduced during The Death of Superman arc  Originally a huge fan of Guy Gardner  The Man of Steel saved his family during Doomsday s rampage which led the teen in favor of the Kryptonian over the ring bearer  He also befriended Jimmy Olsen and Bo  Bibbo  Bibbowski during Superman s funeral  After Superman s return  Anderson gathered survivors of Doomsday s rampage at the site where the creature first emerged to share their experiences through the internet  which Superman also responded  The Man of Steel answered Mitch and other survivors of his experiences with the murderous creature along the details of Doomsday s origins to them  Mitch later developed a metahuman power of magnetokinesis and became the superhero Outburst  Desired to follow Superman s example as a way to return the favor to the Man of Steel  Anderson formed a superhero team Supermen of America  although the fate of the team hasn t been revealed after they were attacked by OMACs during Infinite Crisis   edit  Death in comics Superman s death like manner set into motion a series of resurrections in the DC Universe  Green Arrow  Barry Allen  Jason Todd  Donna Troy  Elongated Man  Hal Jordan  Metamorpho  Batman  and others have experienced comic book deaths and resurrections  These events have been attributed to the door between life and death being kept open since Superman died  As a Kryptonian  Superman s alien genetic material enables him to absorb sunlight and perform superhuman feats  Superman survived his death by entering into a hibernation like state  and the Eradicator s use of him as a  conduit  by which he could absorb solar energy  restarted  Superman s body  Although sources such as Professor Hamilton and Batman have noted that available evidence suggests that the remaining solar energy reserves in Superman s body when he died would have actually  run down  before the Eradicator took his body  suggesting that other factors may have contributed to his resurrection   A later encounter with a villainous sentient sun from the future known as  Solaris  would reveal a future where Superman is still alive approximately 83 000 years in the future  leading him to speculate that death may never come for him  Jonathan Kent himself  during his near death experience  explained to Clark s soul how being a Kryptonian he could never die  or at least  die only after much more grievous injuries than a  simple  beating  he merely accepted his death because his human upbringing instilled in him a strong sense of human mortality  and conformed to it accepting his fate  Once he accepted and embraced his alien makeup  he was able to refuse death and lead his father back in the land of the living   edit  Emerald Twilight The consequences of the destruction of Coast City in  Reign of the Supermen  would in turn lead to DC Comics revamping Green Lantern  After an issue that established the fact that several key members of Hal Jordan s supporting cast had survived the destruction of Coast City  due to them being out of town helping Carol Ferris save her estranged mother   DC moved directly into the controversial storyline  Emerald Twilight   Emerald Twilight saw Hal Jordan have a complete mental breakdown after his attempt to rebuild Coast City with his power ring resulted in him being ordered to return to Oa for punishment for breaking the rule of using his power ring for personal gain  In response  Jordan would destroy the Green Lantern Corps and absorb the power of the Corps  Main Power Battery into himself  becoming  Parallax   This in turn would lead to the introduction of Kyle Rayner  as Hal s replacement as Green Lantern and Zero Hour  Crisis in Time   which featured Jordan as the main villain   edit  The Wedding Even after Superman had returned to life  plans for Lois and Clark s wedding took some time to develop  The relationship between the two became rocky  and for a time they separated  Finally in 1996  tying into the wedding of Lois Lane  and Clark in the Lois  amp  Clark  The New Adventures of Superman television program  Lois returns to Metropolis and rekindles her romance with Clark  The two set into motion their plans for a wedding and are married in Superman  The Wedding Album   edit  Superman Doomsday  Hunter Prey In the three issue miniseries Superman Doomsday  Hunter Prey  1994   Superman journeys to Apokolips and Calaton to find Doomsday s body  Assisted by Waverider  he confronts Darkseid and Hank Henshaw  finds that his killer is still alive  and discovers the details of Doomsday s origin as a genetically engineered life form created by the Kryptonians of the distant past  inspiring the planet s interest in genetic engineering  In Superman  The Doomsday War  1998   Doomsday s mind is under the influence of Brainiac  forcing Superman to fight two of his most powerful enemies at once in order to rescue Lana Lang s newborn child  Doomsday easily defeating the current Justice League before Superman is able to force Brainiac s mind out of Doomsday and trap him in four teleporters locked in a perpetual loop to prevent him being integrated

hero  He ultimately comes face to face with the Man of Steel himself and reveals to Superman that his father committed suicide because of losses suffered connected with the battle with Doomsday  Duffy reproaches Superman  telling him that thousands have died due to his battle with Doomsday but people rarely ever acknowledge their deaths as they  prefer  to focus on Superman s revival  feeling that Superman s resurrection cheapened awareness of the others who died in Doomsday s rampage and the holocaust of Coast City  Although Superman disagrees  he carries considerable guilt over the deaths  On his way home  Duffy is kidnapped by Remnant  who wishes to show the world that Superman is evil  He intends to stage terrorist acts at the locations where Doomsday rampaged  including The Daily Planet  by planting a bomb within a van parked on the exact spot where the battle ended  Superman rescues Duffy  along with Perry White  who was also captured by the villain  and the building  Despite the victory  flyers announce that Superman is not a messiah  but rather the devil incarnate  the villain disappears  Superman approaches Duffy  and challenges him to not back off from the tough questions  The Man of Steel tells Duffy he will be waiting for the conclusion of his article  and also asks him another one  if Superman wasn t around  would there be fewer Doomsdays  monsters seeking to

devised a measure made after The Man of Steel recovered from his first battle with Doomsday  that  when the Justice League or any other superhero groups encounter a Doomsday Level Threat  a group of heroes  authorities  and military forces would contain it within a proximity after clearing all civilians within it  If Superman and the rest falls  the Doomsday Protocol  which is a dimensional projecting bomb  will commence by sending the threat to the Phantom Zone after detonating it  5  Despite Doomsday and other powerful individuals such as Superboy Prime s recurring appearances  Batman s measure has yet to be used   edit  Infinite Crisis During Infinite Crisis  Batman told Superman that the last time he inspired anyone was when he died  6  Later  the Golden Age Earth 2 Superman  Kal L  fought and defeated Doomsday alongside the modern Superman during the Battle of Metropolis  7   edit  Legion of 3 Worlds In Final Crisis  Legion of 3 Worlds  Superboy  who had been killed battling

resurrected individuals  Because of Superman s previous status as a deceased  it allows Nekron s black power ring to transform Kal EL into an undead Black Lantern under the demon s commands  Superboy  Kon El   who also has a previous status as a deceased resulted from his battle with Superboy Prime  also becomes a Black Lantern with Kal EL  8  Superman and Superboy are eventually freed subsequently by the white light   edit  The Tomorrow Memory In 2010  Dan Jurgens revisited The Death of Superman saga once more on a Booster Gold storyline  involving Booster Gold attempts to thwart a time traveling assassin  Sondra Crain  of murdering Hank Henshaw before he becomes the villain he s destined to be  Even though the hero successfully saved Henshaw  Booster also questions himself if he should have left him to die in order to save the lives he would eventually murder  Elsewhere  Booster s sister  Michelle  is in Coast City at a point in the past before Henshaw s future self s city

mistrust for the metahuman community into full blown hatred after witnessing firsthand the fallout of the Death of Superman  It s strongly implied by Maxwell s dialogue that the high body count left during Doomsday s march on Metropolis  the utter destruction of Coast City  and there  Maxwell Lord s mother s death  have bolstered his need to keep the metahumans in check  and his strong belief that whenever metahuman fight  common people have to suffer  10  That being the case  the entire villainous career of Maxwell Lord is indirectly shaped by the Coast City disaster   edit  Reign of Doomsday In the 2011 Reign of Doomsday crossover  Doomsday returns and attempts to hunt down and capture the four Supermen who were created in the aftermath of Superman s demise  Prior to facing off against Superman  Doomsday battles Supergirl and the Justice League  a situation that editor Eddie Berganza noted resembled the initial The Death of Superman issue where Doomsday fought the League before his confrontation with Superman  11   edit  Audience and media response The Death and Return of Superman storyline brought in millions of readers to DC Comics  despite the entirety of the story being intertwined through numerous different comic series  including Action Comics  Superman  Superman  The Man of Steel  and Adventures of Superman  among others  Superman s creator  Jerry Siegel himself  who in 1961 had predicted the Man of Steel s death in an  imaginary story   met with then Superman editor Mike Carlin to tell him that he was very impressed by his version of it  12  The cover of Superman  vol  2   75  shown above in infobox  became an iconic image  Superman s tattered cape wrapped around a pole  marking the spot where Superman died   Certain prints of Superman  75 contained a black armband with the familiar  S  symbol adorning it   DC shipped between 2 5 and 3 million copies of Superman  75  with most stores selling out of the issue on the day of its release  13  The Death of Superman took place months before the breaking of Batman s back in the  Knightfall  storyline  Some critics praised DC for boldly and innovatively drawing in more readers  However  others were critical  citing the two concurrent storylines as publicity stunts  since it was unlikely that DC would ever eliminate its most popular characters  Some years later  Chuck Rozanski  owner of retailer Mile High Comics  would pen a controversial essay in the Comics Buyer s Guide which blamed the Death of Superman promotion for playing a significant role in the collapse of the comic book industry in the late 1990s  14   edit  In other media  edit  Television The Bruce Timm animated series Justice League has an episode entitled  A Better World   in which the Justice League was tricked and captured by the Justice Lords  who took their place  At the same time  Doomsday arrives from outer space in a meteor  In one scene  both the Justice Lord Superman and Doomsday punched each other out at the same time  resulting in a shockwave which destroyed several buildings  However  this did no damage to Doomsday and only nearly knocked out the alternate Superman  In the end  alternate Superman used his heat vision to lobotomize him  parodying the Death of Superman storyline much like the  Bane  episode of Batman  The Animated Series had done with Knightfall  15  In the episodes  Hereafter  Parts 1 and 2    written by Dwayne McDuffie and directed by Butch Lukic   Superman is sent into the future by a device of Toyman s  only to wake up to a red sunned Earth populated by giant bugs  mutant wolves  and Vandal Savage  16  This was  in all intents  an adaptation of the comic story  Under the Red Sun   one of Timm s favorites   However  since Toyman s device looks like it disintegrates Superman into nothingness  the first half of the two part episode deals with Superman s funeral  and it takes some direct elements from the Death of Superman storyline  such as the memorial statue  Batman watching Superman s funeral procession from the rooftops  and the wearing of black armbands by other members of the Justice League   edit  Film By the time The Death of Superman hit the newsstands  Warner Bros  had gained the rights to produce a fifth Superman film from Alexander Salkind  The studio selected Superman s death as the storyline for the film  and Jon Peters came in as producer  following the success of the Batman franchise  which he had also produced  From 1994 to 1998  projected film adaptations of The Death of Superman storyline faced numerous problems with the script process  Writers proposed major changes to the character  including the absence of the Superman costume  and the lack of the power of flight  One of the writers  Kevin Smith  said   The thing that bothered me about  writer  Greg Poirier s draft  they were trying to give Superman angst  They had Clark Kent going to a psychiatrist at one point  Superman s angst is not that he doesn t want to be Superman  If he has any  angst   it s that he can t do it all  he can t do enough and save everyone   Batman is about angst  Superman is about hope   Superman Reborn  retitled Superman Lives  was slated for release on July 4  1998  directed by Tim Burton and with Nicolas Cage to portray Superman  However  following the box office disappointment of Batman  amp  Robin  the project was scrapped  Main article  Superman  Doomsday At Comic Con  06 Bruce Timm announced that he would produce the Death of Superman story as a Direct To DVD  or DTV  project  which was titled Superman  Doomsday  with Adam Baldwin as The Man of Steel  with Anne Heche as Lois Lane  and James Marsters as Lex Luthor  During an interview with Newsarama com  Timm explained that the story would cover the entire trilogy of The Death of Superman  World Without a Superman   amp  Reign of the Supermen  However  it was necessarily simplified since the film runs only 75 minutes  A trailer released in June 2007 showed a slightly altered animation style from that of the DC animated universe  Lois and Superman have a relationship  but The Man of Steel hasn t revealed his identity to Lois until the end of the film  even though she already knows  Changes and differences include the absence of Lex Luthor II and Supergirl in the film  the presence of a similar Lex Luthor to that of the post Crisis version   the corrupt tycoon of LexCorp  the fight between Superman and Doomsday occurring at night  instead of during the day  as it did in the comics   and fewer Supermen  The film was screened twice at the San Diego Comic Con  07 as a special sneak preview on Thursday  July 26  Both reactions and reviews were well received  The DTV film was released on September 18  2007  It made its U S  broadcast premiere on the Cartoon Network Saturday July 12  2008 at 9 00 pm EST  While not present directly in The DTV film Superman Batman  Public Enemies  it is alluded to at one point  where Batman tells Superman  It s your funeral   and Superman says he already had one   edit  Video games A scrolling beat  em up video game called The Death and Return of Superman was released by Blizzard Entertainment and Sunsoft for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Mega Drive   edit  Merchandise In 1994  Kenner released an action figure series based on the Death of Superman era  This featured the first action figures of characters such as the long haired Superman  Superboy  Steel  Doomsday  Conduit  and the ToyFare exclusive Eradicator  It also corresponded with the Legends of Batman collection  which was largely based on Batman Elseworlds and the Knightfall saga   edit  Music In a tribute to the hero  Crash Test Dummies wrote  Superman s Song  eulogizing the hero and lamenting that  the world will never see another man like him   The song was released in 1991 before Superman had died   edit  Novels Roger Stern adapted the Death of Superman storyline into a novel  entitled The Death and Life of Superman  in the summer of 1993  It was released in hardcover form and then in paperback a year later   Hardcover ISBN 0 553 09582 X  Paperback ISBN 0 553 56930 9  A

the style of a funeral  Attendees of the funeral were Jimmy Olsen  Lois Lane  Perry White  Lex Luthor  Batman  amp  Robin  Flash  Aquaman  Green Lantern  Hawkman  amp  Hawkgirl  Penguin  Catwoman  characters from Marvel Comics  Mister Fantastic  Hulk  Spider Man  and Storm  and an assortment of unfamiliar characters  When Green Lantern asks why Lex Luthor is at the funeral  Lex Luthor states that Superman was a worthy adversary even though he is glad that Superman is gone  Batman  amp  Robin  Perry White  and Hulk  alongside Mister Fantastic and Spider Man  were the speakers at the funeral  Black Lightning  portrayed by Sinbad  tries to enter the funeral  but no one knows him even though he claimed to have taught Superman how to fly  After the characters from Marvel Comics were done speaking  Jimmy Olsen takes the stand stating that he had heard from the Chief of Police that the Legion of Doom was attacking Metropolis Civic Arena and thinks that this would ve been a job for Superman  Batman states that they will have to try to carry on without him as he leads those who can fly  those who have super strength  and anyone who can rotate the Earth on its axis into battle to do it for Superman  As the heroes leave  Black Lightning is seen pillaging some of Aquaman s shrimp as Lois wonders where Clark Kent is  A short comedic film by Max Landis has the writer director telling the history and the comic book with exaggerated re enactments in between his narration  Elijah Wood and Mandy Moore  who are friends of Landis  appear in the film   edit  Awards The trade
