Johnstown  Pennsylvania  the son of first generation Americans of Slovak 3  descent  Stephen Ditko  an artistically talented master carpenter at a steel mill  and Anna  a homemaker  The second eldest child in a working class family  he was preceded by sister Anna Marie 3  and followed in uncertain order by sister Betty and brother Patrick  1  Inspired by his father s love of newspaper comic strips  particularly Hal Foster s Prince Valiant  Ditko found his interest in comics accelerated by the introduction of superhero Batman in 1940  and by Will Eisner s The Spirit  which appeared in a tabloid sized comic book insert in Sunday newspapers  4  Self portrait of Steve Ditko  from The Amazing Spider Man Annual  1  1964  Good with his hands  Ditko in junior high school was part of a group of students who crafted wooden models of German airplanes to aid civilian World War II aircraft spotters  4  Upon graduating from Johnstown High School in 1945  4  he enlisted in the U S  Army on October 26  1945  3  and did military service in postwar Germany  where he drew comics for an Army newspaper  4  Following his discharge  Ditko learned that his idol  Batman artist Jerry Robinson  was teaching at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School  later the School of Visual Arts  in New York City  Moving there in 1950  he enrolled in the art school under the G I  Bill  5  Robinson found the young student  a very hard worker who really focused on his drawing  6  and someone who  could work well with other writers as well as write his own stories and create his own characters   6  and he helped Ditko acquire a scholarship for the following year  7   He was in my class for two years  four or five days a week  five hours a night  It was very intense   8  Robinson  who invited artists and editors to speak with his class  once brought in Stan Lee  then editor of Marvel Comics  1950s precursor  Atlas Comics  and   I think that was when Stan first saw Steve s work   8   edit  Career Ditko began professionally illustrating comic books in early 1953  drawing writer Bruce Hamilton s science fiction story  Stretching Things  for the Key Publications imprint Stanmor Publications  which sold the story to Ajax Farrell  where it finally found publication in Fantastic Fears  5  cover dated Feb  1954   9  10  Ditko s first published work was his second professional story  the six page  Paper Romance  in Daring Love  1  Oct  1953   9  published by the Key imprint Gillmor Magazines  11  Shortly afterward  Ditko found work at the studio of celebrated writer artists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby  who had created Captain America and other characters and had instituted numerous industry innovations  Beginning as an inker on backgrounds  Ditko was soon working with and learning from Mort Meskin  an artist whose work he had long admired   Meskin was fabulous   Ditko once recalled   I couldn t believe the ease with which he drew  strong compositions  loose pencils  yet complete  detail without clutter  I loved his stuff   12  Ditko s known assistant work includes aiding inker Meskin on the Jack Kirby pencil work of Harvey Comics  Captain 3 D  1  Dec  1953   13  For his own third published story  Ditko penciled and inked the six page  A Hole in His Head  in Black Magic vol  4   3  Dec  1953   published by Simon  amp  Kirby s Crestwood Publications imprint Prize Comics  14  Ditko then began a long association with the Derby  Connecticut publisher Charlton Comics  a low budget division of a company best known for song lyric magazines  Beginning with the cover of The Thing  12  Feb  1954  and the eight page vampire story  Cinderella  in that issue  Ditko would continue to work intermittently for Charlton until the company s demise in 1986  producing science fiction  horror and mystery stories  as well as co creating Captain Atom  with writer Joe Gill  in Space Adventures  33  March 1960   15  He first went on hiatus from the company  and comics altogether  in mid 1954  when he contracted tuberculosis and returned to his parents  home in Johnstown to recuperate  16   edit  Marvel Comics The Amazing Spider Man Annual  1  1964   Cover art by Ditko  featuring a rogue s gallery of supervillains he co created After he recovered and moved back to New York City in late 1955  16  Ditko began drawing for Atlas Comics  the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics  beginning with the four page  There ll Be Some Changes Made  in Journey into Mystery  33  April 1956   this debut tale would be reprinted in Marvel s Curse of the Weird  4  March 1994   Ditko would go on to contribute a large number of stories  many considered classic  to Atlas Marvel s Strange Tales and the newly launched Amazing Adventures  Strange Worlds  Tales of Suspense and Tales to Astonish  issues of which would typically open with a Kirby drawn monster story  followed by one or two twist ending thrillers or sci fi tales drawn by Don Heck  Paul Reinman  or Joe Sinnott  all capped by an often surreal  sometimes self reflexive short by Ditko and writer editor Stan Lee  These bagatelles proved so popular that Amazing Adventures was reformatted to feature such stories exclusively beginning with issue  7  Dec  1961   when the comic was rechristened Amazing Adult Fantasy   a name intended to reflect its more  sophisticated  nature  as likewise the new tagline  The magazine that respects your intelligence   Lee in 2009 described these  short  five page filler strips that Steve and I did together   originally  placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill   as  odd fantasy tales that I d dream up with O  Henry type endings   Giving an early example of what would later be known as the  Marvel Method  of writer artist collaboration  Lee said   All I had to do was give Steve a one line description of the plot and he d be off and running  He d take those skeleton outlines I had given him and turn them into classic little works of art that ended up being far cooler than I had any right to expect   17   edit  Creation of Spider Man After Marvel Comics editor in chief Stan Lee obtained permission from publisher Martin Goodman to create a new  ordinary teen  superhero named  Spider Man   18  Lee originally approached his leading artist  Jack Kirby  Kirby told Lee about his own 1950s character conception  variously called the Silver Spider and Spiderman  in which an orphaned boy finds a magic ring that gives him superpowers  Comics historian Greg Theakston says Lee and Kirby  immediately sat down for a story conference  and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages   A day or two later   Kirby showed Lee the first six pages  and  as Lee recalled   I hated the way he was doing it  Not that he did it badly   it just wasn t the character I wanted  it was too heroic   19  Lee turned to Ditko  who developed a visual motif Lee found satisfactory  although Lee would later replace Ditko s original cover with one penciled by Kirby  Ditko said   The Spider Man pages Stan showed me were nothing like the  eventually  published character  In fact  the only drawings of Spider Man were on the splash  i e   page 1  and at the end  where  Kirby had the guy leaping at you with a web gun    Anyway  the first five pages took place in the home  and the kid finds a ring and turns into Spider Man   20  Ditko also recalled that   One of the first things I did was to work up a costume  A vital  visual part of the character  I had to know how he looked     before I did any breakdowns  For example  A clinging power so he wouldn t have hard shoes or boots  a hidden wrist shooter versus a web gun and holster  etc      I wasn t sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character s face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face  It would also add mystery to the character      21  Much earlier  in a rare contemporaneous account  Ditko described his and Lee s contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan  2  Summer 1965    Stan Lee thought the name up  I did costume  web gimmick on wrist  amp  spider signal   He added he would continue drawing Spider Man   i f nothing better comes along   22  That same year  he expressed to the fanzine Voice of Comicdom  regarding a poll of  Best Liked  fan created comics   It seems a shame  since comics themselves have so little variety of stories and styles that you would deliberately restrict your own creative efforts to professional comics shallow range  What is  Best Liked  by most readers is what they are most familiar in seeing and any policy based on readers likes has to end up with a lot of look a like strips  You have a great opportunity to show everyone a whole new range of ideas  unlimited types of stories and styles   why FLUB it   23  From 1958 to either 1966 or 1968  accounts differ   citation needed  Ditko shared a Manhattan studio at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton  an art school classmate  When either artist was under deadline pressure  it was not uncommon for them to pitch in and help the other with his assignment  24  25  and the introduction to one book of Stanton s work says   Eric Stanton drew his pictures in India ink  and they were then hand coloured by Ditko   26  In a 1988 interview with Theakston  Stanton recalled that although his contribution to Spider Man was  almost nil   he and Ditko had  worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas  But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own    I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands   27  Spider Man debuted in Amazing Fantasy  15  Aug  1962   the final issue of that science fiction fantasy anthology series  When the issue proved to be a top seller  Spider Man was given his own series  The Amazing Spider Man  28   edit  Doctor Strange and other characters Dormammu attacks Eternity in a Ditko  Dr  Strange  panel from Strange Tales  146  July 1966   After drawing the final issue of The Incredible Hulk   6  March 1963   Ditko co created with Lee the supernatural hero Doctor Strange  in Strange Tales  110  July 1963   Ditko and Lee shortly thereafter relaunched a Hulk series as a short feature in the anthology Tales to Astonish  beginning with issue  60  Oct  1964   Ditko  inked by George Roussos  penciled the feature through  67  May 1965   Ditko designed the Hulk s primary antagonist  the Leader  in  62  Dec  1964   Ditko also penciled the Iron Man feature in Tales of Suspense  47 49  Nov  1963   Jan  1964   with various inkers  The first of these debuted the initial version of Iron Man s modern red and golden armor  though whether Ditko or cover penciler and principal character designer Jack Kirby designed the costume is uncertain  Though often overshadowed by his Amazing Spider Man work  Ditko s  Doctor Strange  stories have been equally acclaimed  for their surrealistic mystical landscapes and increasingly psychedelic visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students   People who read  Doctor Strange  thought people at Marvel must be heads  e g  drug users    recalled then associate editor and former Doctor Strange writer Roy Thomas in 1971   because they had had similar experiences high on mushrooms  But     I don t use hallucinogens  nor do I think any artists do   29  Eventually  as co plotter and later sole plotter  in the  Marvel Method   Ditko would take Strange into ever more abstract realms  In an epic 17 issue story arc in Strange Tales  130 146  July 1965   July 1966   Ditko introduced the cosmic character Eternity  who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos  30  As historian Bradford W  Wright describes  Steve Ditko contributed some of his most surrealistic work to the comic book and gave it a disorienting  hallucinogenic quality  Dr  Strange s adventures take place in bizarre worlds and twisting dimensions that resembled Salvador Dal  paintings      Inspired by the pulp fiction magicians of Stan Lee s childhood as well as by contemporary Beat culture  Dr  Strange remarkably predicted the youth counterculture s fascination with Eastern mysticism and psychedelia  Never among Marvel s more popular or accessible characters  Dr  Strange still found a niche among an audience seeking a challenging alternative to more conventional superhero fare  31  The cartoonist and fine artist Seth in 2003 described Ditko s style as  oddball for mainstream comics  Whereas Kirby s stuff clearly appealed to a boy s sensibility because there was so much raw power  Ditko s work was really delicate and cartoony  There was a sense of design to it  You can always recognize anything that Ditko designed because it s always flowery  There is a lot of embroidered detail in the art  which is almost psychedelic   32  Whichever feature he drew  Ditko s idiosyncratic  cleanly detailed  instantly recognizable art style  emphasizing mood and anxiety  found great favor with readers  The character of Spider Man and his troubled personal life meshed well with Ditko s own interests  which Lee eventually acknowledged by giving the artist plotting credits on the latter part of their 38 issue run  But after four years on the title  Ditko left Marvel  he and Lee had not been on speaking terms for some time  with art and editorial changes handled through intermediaries  33  The details of the rift remain uncertain  even to Lee  who confessed in 2003   I never really knew Steve on a personal level   33  Ditko later claimed it was Lee who broke off contact and disputed the long held belief 34  that the disagreement was over the true identity of the Green Goblin   Stan never knew what he was getting in my Spider Man stories and covers until after  production manager  Sol Brodsky took the material from me     so there couldn t have been any disagreement or agreement  no exchanges     no problems between us concerning the Green Goblin or anything else from before issue  25 to my final issues   35  Spider Man successor artist John Romita  in a 2010 deposition  recalled that Lee and Ditko  ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything  cultural  social  historically  everything  they disagreed on characters      36  Regardless  said Lee in 2007   Quite a few years ago I met him up at the Marvel offices when I was last in New York  And we spoke  he s a hell of a nice guy and it was very pleasant      I haven t heard from him since that meeting   37  Comics historian Greg Theakston  who visited Ditko on occasion  theorized Ditko saw The Amazing Spider Man as semi autobiographical   Spider Man was the culmination of everything Ditko was up until that moment  Ditko had personal ties to the character  When people started to  manipulate him  into bringing in more romance into the strip and changing the direction  Ditko felt slighted  crushed     they were telling him how to do it  He wouldn t be told   35  Writer and then future Marvel editor Roy Thomas said of that time   I ll never forget the day I walked into one Marvel office not long after Ditko quit  and here s John Romita  Sr   drawing Amazing Spider Man and Larry  Lieber  drawing the Spider Man Annual and Marie Severin drawing  Dr  Strange   and I joked   This is the Steve Ditko Room  it takes three of you to do what Steve Ditko used to do    38   edit  Charlton and DC Comics Back at Charlton   where the page rate was low but creators were allowed greater freedom   Ditko worked on such characters as Blue Beetle  1967 1968   39  the Question  1967 1968   Captain Atom  1965 1967   returning to the character he d co created in 1960  In addition  in 1966 1967  he drew 16 stories  most of them written by Archie Goodwin for Warren Publishing s horror comic magazines Creepy and Eerie  most of which were done using ink wash  40  In 1967  Ditko gave his conservative ideas ultimate expression in the form of Mr  A  published in Wally Wood s independent title witzend   3  Ditko s hard line against criminals was controversial citation

Ditko created the quirky team Hawk and Dove in Showcase  75  June 1968   with writer Steve Skeates  42  Around this time  he penciled the lead story  written and inked by Wally Wood  in Wood s early mature audience  independent comics publication Heroes  Inc  Presents Cannon  1969   43  Ditko s stay at DC was short   he would work on all six issues of the Creeper s own title  Beware the Creeper  June 1968 April 1969   though leaving midway through the final one   and the reasons for his departure uncertain  But while at DC  Ditko recommended Charlton staffer Dick Giordano to the company  44  who would go on to become a top DC penciller  inker  editor  and ultimately  in 1981  the managing editor  From this time up through the mid 1970s  Ditko worked exclusively for Charlton and various small press independent publishers  Frank McLaughlin  Charlton s art director during this period  describes Ditko as living  in a local hotel in Derby for a while  He was a very happy go lucky guy with a great sense of humor at that time  and always supplied the  female  color separators with candy and other little gifts   45  For Charlton in 1974 he did Liberty Belle backup stories in E Man and conceived Killjoy  Ditko produced much work for Charlton s science fiction and horror titles  as well as for former Marvel publisher Martin Goodman s start up line Atlas Seaboard Comics  where he co created the superhero the Destructor with writer Archie Goodwin  and penciled all four issues of the namesake series  Feb  Aug  1975   the first two of which were inked by fellow comics legend

created the four issue sword and sorcery series Stalker  1975 1976   47  48  Ditko and writer Gerry Conway produced the first issue of a short lived Man Bat series  49  He also revived the Creeper and did such various other jobs as a short Demon backup series in 1979  work on Legion of Superheroes in 1980 1981  and stories in DC s horror and science fiction anthologies  He also drew the Prince Gavyn version of Starman in Adventure Comics  467 478  1980   43  50  He then decamped to do work for a variety of publishers  briefly contributing to DC again in the mid 1980s  with four pinups of

assessed in 2008 that   By the  70s he was regarded as a slightly old fashioned odd ball  by the  80s he was a commercial has been  picking up wretched work for hire gigs     following the example of  Ayn  Rand s John Galt  Ditko hacked out money making work  saving his care for the crabbed Objectivist screeds he published with tiny presses  And boy  could Ditko hack  seeing samples of his Transformers coloring book and his Big Boy comic is like hearing Orson Welles sell frozen peas   54  Ditko retired from mainstream comics in 1998  55  His later work for Marvel and DC included
