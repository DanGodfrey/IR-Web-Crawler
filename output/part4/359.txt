appeared as an X Men villain over the years  She frequently appeared in Uncanny X Men and the original volume of the New Mutants alongside her Hellions  In March 1986  Tom DeFalco  Mary Wilshire  and Steve Leialoha were the creative team for the four issue Firestar miniseries  where Emma predominantly appeared alongside her Hellions  This series showcased Frost as the main villain as she attempted to turn Angelica Jones into her own personal weapon  After recovering from a coma and aiming to redeem herself upon the knowledge that her Hellions had been slaughtered  Frost played a pivotal role in the Phalanx Covenant  which saw her team up with Banshee  Jubilee  and Sabretooth in an attempt to save the next generation of mutants  This led to her becoming a main character of the spin off series Generation X which began in November 1994 under the creative eyes of Scott Lobdell  Chris Bachalo  and Mark Buckingham  The series ended after over 75 issues  and several one shots and miniseries  with Brian Wood  Ron Lim  Sandu Florea  and Randy Elliott ending the series  The series offered glimpses into her past before her days in the Hellfire Club  as well as introducing her sisters Adrienne and Cordelia  After the series ended and all the X Titles were revamped  in 2001 Frost appeared in New X Men as a teacher for the mutant population of Genosha  which was then controlled by Magneto  After a Sentinel strike leveled the island nation  the X Men found Frost amidst the rubble with a  secondary mutation  which hardened her skin to a diamond like density  Using Frost as a character was suggested to writer Grant Morrison on his website by a fan  While Morrison initially had no plans to use her  the death of the character Colossus left Morrison with an opening  5  He created Emma s secondary mutation   a super strong diamond form   as a replacement for Colossus  powers and added her to the cast  6  Subsequently  Frost joined the X Men  This would lead to her instigating an affair with fellow X Man Cyclops  who was having marital difficulties with Jean Grey  This series also provided further glimpses into her past  introducing her father Winston Frost and her brother

brought into focus as Emma abandoned the team during a fight to confer with a shadowy figure  revealed to be one of a group of four individuals watching from the shadows  The group contained Sebastian Shaw  Cassandra Nova  Negasonic Teenage Warhead  and a cloaked figure called Perfection  who discussed among themselves Emma s impending betrayal of the team  45  Emma s survival of the destruction of Genosha was due to Cassandra Nova creating Emma s secondary mutation as part of a scheme to infiltrate the X Men as a sleeper agent  Nova having erased the memory of their encounter and only restoring

First  she began using her telepathy on Cyclops to appear as Jean Phoenix  trying to reveal the lack of control he had over his optic blasts  Perfection noted that Emma s feelings for Summers were genuine  however  Emma s telepathy discovers that when Scott fell out of a plane with his younger brother Havok  Scott placed a deep mental block in his mind which prevents the controlled use of his powers  Encouraged by Emma  Scott revisited that moment in his life and reversed the decision  It is further revealed that Ellie  Shaw  and Perfection were actually psionic projections created by Emma under Cassandra s influence  Cassandra Nova had placed a portion of her mind in Emma s before being trapped in the body of Stuff  47  With Cyclops out of the way  Frost Nova and the physical manifestations calling themselves the  Hellfire Club  assault the X Mansion  incapacitating every X Man except Shadowcat  Kitty manages to elude capture  and  fulfilling the role Emma asked her to in the beginning of the series  manages to capture the former White Queen  However  Kitty was eventually tricked by Nova Emma  Perfection  into helping Nova Emma  Perfection  retrieve the  Stuff  body containing the rest of Nova  A depowered Cyclops  with the help of Blindfold and Hisako Ichiki  was able to defeat the  Hellfire Club  by figuring out they were fake  while Emma herself tried to get Kitty to shoot her in order to block Cassandra s escape  but was stopped by Cyclops  Undeterred  Nova then attempted to transfer her mind into Hisako  The ending was interrupted as everyone present was teleported away by S W O R D  and onto their ship which was headed towards the Breakworld  Emma  along with Cyclops  Colossus  Wolverine  Beast  Shadowcat  Hisako  Ord  and Danger  were taken to deep space by S W O R D  and Agent Brand  The psychics on the S W O R D  ship did not detect Cassandra Nova in Emma s shattered psyche  effectively proving Emma s loyalty to the X Men by her refusal to allow Nova into Hisako  Though emotionally wounded  Emma recovered fast enough to be present for the team s departure to the Breakworld  Separated  Emma  Scott  Beast  and Agent Brand discover the temple of Attur Hei   The Palace of the Corpse    Joined by teammates Wolverine and Hisako  who adopted the code name  Armor    Emma conceded to Agent Brand s plan of separation  She and Scott left Attur Hei on a single S W O R D  armed jet to rendezvous with the rest of the S W O R D  operatives on the Breakworld  While flying  several Breakworld fighter jets approach  attempting to knock Emma and Scott out of the air  The couple successfully repel the Breakworld onslaught  exchanging heated words in the process  Amidst Emma s protestations that Scott was  acting as though  he knew  what  she s  been through   he finally professed his true love for Emma  Stunned  Emma could barely speak  except to utter an apology  Before her reasons behind apologizing were discussed  Scott noticed a blip on their radar  Danger appeared  utterly destroying the S W O R D  cruiser  Switching to diamond form in the nick of time  Emma is spared while Scott is mortally injured  Cradling an injured Scott in her arms  Emma sheds a tear  As the Danger Room entity approached  Emma makes a request of the machine  She asks that Danger kill her  and that  she  do so quickly  However  this turns out to be another one of Emma s  lessons  this time aimed at Danger  who in truth seems incapable of killing the X Men due to her core programming  Emma offers Danger a deal in exchange for her help with the X Men s mission  As X Men proceed with their planned attack on Breakworld weapon s installation  they are surrounded by Breakworld ships and Scott is forced to take a single battle cruiser to draw attention from the main team  being shot down and apparently dying in the process  with Emma feeling Scott s life flash before his eyes   Scott is resurrected by their enemies  just as Colossus had been  It turns out Cyclops  sacrifice was all part of a master plan by the team undetected by way of Frost s telepathy in order to distract their opponents so the rest of the team can carry out their own duties without as much difficulty  The arc concludes with Kitty trapped in the bullet and the team trying to find various ways to save the Earth and save Kitty  As the bullet heads toward Earth  Emma keeps in telepathic contact with Kitty  trying to reassure her  even offering to psionically sedate her  though Kitty becomes more and more certain that she will not make it out unharmed or alive  As it becomes clear that all other options have run out  Emma states that she never wanted something like this to happen and she and Kitty come to an understanding  Emma calls Kitty  astonishing  before Kitty sacrifices herself  phasing the bullet through Earth  In the aftermath  the X Men are uncertain of Kitty s fate  believing her to either be dead or at least phased into part of the

85  The exact level of her telepathic power has varied depending on writers and has ranged from weaker than other prominent telepaths 14  42  86  87  88  89  90  to rivaling the abilities of Charles

body to shatter  11  Though the exact location of the flaw in her diamond body has not been stated outright  clues point to it being located in between her eyes  100  Frost s full range of abilities between her diamond state and regular form have been inconsistent  95  101  however  later occurrences 102  103  depict that Frost cannot access her psychic powers in diamond form  explained by different writers as either a distinct genetic flaw 34  or suppression by her diamond form s adamantine luster  104  Depictions have also stated that Emma has a degree of telepathic immunity while in diamond form  though the extent of this immunity has been portrayed inconsistently as well  ranging from total shielding from psychic invasion to vulnerability to psychic attack  97  105  Her diamond form is also stated to emit low level ultraviolet light  causing it to glow in darkness  104   edit  Innate traits and expertise Frost has a gifted intellect with college degrees in multiple fields

 edit  Telekinetic potential On occasion  it has been hinted that Frost is also a latent telekinetic  Jean Grey s displaced psyche was able to use Frost s brain to generate a telekinetic force field and fly  while it inhabited the White Queen s body  volume  amp  issue needed  However  Xavier clearly states that Jean s transference was so complete that she was able to also transfer her telekinesis which is why he was in awe of the feat Jean accomplished  27  During the Onslaught Saga  Frost unwittingly levitated several kitchen utensils while having a bad dream  109  During this time Onslaught and Nate Grey caused separate and massive damage to the astral plane causing many psi talents to act unpredictably  volume  amp  issue needed  When the mutant Synch  synched  with Frost
