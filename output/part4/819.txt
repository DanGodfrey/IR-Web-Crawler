that appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics  The character first appeared in Captain America Comics  1  cover dated March 1941   from Marvel Comics  1940s predecessor  Timely Comics  1  and was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby  As of 2007  an estimated 210 million copies of  Captain America  comic books had been sold in 75 countries  2  For nearly all of the character s publication history  Captain America was the alter ego of Steve Rogers  a frail young man who was enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum in order to aid the United States war effort  Captain America wears a costume that bears an American flag motif  and is armed with an indestructible shield that can be thrown as a weapon  3  An intentionally patriotic creation who was often depicted fighting the Axis powers of World War II  Captain America was Timely Comics  most popular character during the wartime period  After the war ended  the character s popularity waned and he disappeared by the 1950s aside from an ill fated revival in 1953  Captain America was reintroduced during the Silver Age of comics when he was revived from suspended animation by the superhero team the Avengers in The Avengers  4  March 1964   Since then  Captain America has often led the team  as well as starring in his own series  Steve Rogers was purportedly assassinated in Captain America vol  5   25  March 2007   although he was later revealed to be alive  The comic book series Captain America continued to be published  4  with Rogers  former sidekick  James  Bucky  Barnes  having taken up the mantle  and keeping it at the insistence of Rogers  who upon his return began operating as an intelligence agent in the Secret Avengers title  and in the limited series Steve Rogers  Super Soldier  before resuming the identity after Bucky was killed in the line of duty  Captain America was the first Marvel Comics character adapted into another medium with the release of the 1944 movie serial Captain America  Since then  the character has been featured in several other films and television series  including Captain America  The First Avenger  released on July 22  2011  Captain

Super American  at the bottom of the page   Simon said in his autobiography   No  it didn t work  There were too many  Supers  around   Captain America  had a good sound to it  There weren t a lot of captains in comics  It was as easy as that  The boy companion was simply named Bucky  after my friend Bucky Pierson  a star on our high school basketball team   6  Simon recalled in his autobiography that Timely Comics publisher Martin Goodman gave him the go ahead and directed that a Captain America solo comic book series be published as soon as possible  Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character s stories  Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner  artist Jack Kirby  could handle the workload alone  I didn t have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue     There were two young artists from Connecticut that had made a strong impression on me  Al Avison and Al Gabriele often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other  Actually  their work was not too far from  that of  Kirby s  If they worked on it  and if one inker tied the three styles together  I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform  The two Als were eager to join in on the new Captain America book  but Jack Kirby was visibly upset   You re still number one  Jack   I assured him   It s just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue    I ll make the deadline   Jack promised   I ll pencil it  all  myself and make the deadline   I hadn t expected this kind of reaction     but I acceded to Kirby s wishes and  it turned out  was lucky that I did  There might have been two Als  but there was only one Jack Kirby  I wrote the first Captain America book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards  with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds  Kirby did his thing  building the muscular anatomy  adding ideas and pepping up the action as only he could  Then he tightened up the penciled drawings  adding detailed backgrounds  faces and figures  6  1974 Comic Art Convention program featuring Simon s original sketch of Captain America  Al Liederman would ink that first issue  which was lettered by Simon and Kirby s regular letterer  Howard Ferguson  7  Simon said Captain America was a consciously political creation  he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of Nazi Germany in the years leading up to the United States  involvement in World War II and felt war was inevitable   The opponents to the war were all quite well organized  We wanted to have our say too   8  Captain America Comics  1   cover dated March 1941 and on sale in December 1940  a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor  but a full year into World War II   showed the protagonist punching Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in the jaw  it sold nearly one million copies  9  While most readers responded favorably to the comic  some took objection  Simon noted   When the first issue came out we got a lot of    threatening letters and hate mail  Some people really opposed what Cap stood for   8  Though preceded as a  patriotically themed superhero  by MLJ s The Shield  Captain America immediately became the most prominent and enduring of that wave of superheroes introduced in American comic books prior to and during World War II citation needed   With his sidekick Bucky  Captain America faced Nazis  Japanese  and other threats to wartime America and the Allies  Stanley Lieber  now better known by his pen name Stan Lee  contributed to the character in issue  3 in the filler text story  Captain America Foils the Traitor s Revenge   which introduced the character s use of his shield as a returning throwing weapon  10  Captain America soon became Timely s most popular character and even had a fan club called the  Sentinels of Liberty   8  Circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue  which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines like Time during the period  11  After the Simon and Kirby team moved to DC in late 1941  having produced Captain America Comics through issue  10  January 1942   Al Avison and Syd Shores became regular pencillers of the celebrated title  with one generally inking over the other  The character was also featured in All Winners Comics  1 19  Summer 1941   Fall 1946   Marvel Mystery

and wounded in a 1948 Captain America story  he was succeeded by Captain America s girlfriend  Betsy Ross  who became the superheroine Golden Girl  Captain America Comics ended with issue  75  Feb  1950   by which time the series had been titled Captain America s Weird Tales for two issues  with the finale being a horror suspense anthology issue with no superheroes  Atlas Comics attempted to revive its superhero titles when it reintroduced Captain America  along with the original Human Torch and the Sub Mariner  in Young Men  24  Dec  1953   Billed as  Captain America  Commie Smasher   Captain America appeared during the next year in Young Men  24 28 and Men s Adventures  27 28  as well as in issues  76 78 of an eponymous title  Atlas  attempted superhero revival was a commercial failure  12  and the character s title was canceled with Captain America  78  Sept  1954    edit  Silver Age revival In the Human Torch story titled  Captain America  in Marvel Comics  Strange Tales

it was actually the villain the Acrobat  a former circus performer the Torch had defeated in Strange Tales  106  who broke two thieves out of jail  hoping to draw the police away while trying to rob the local bank  Afterward  Storm digs out an old comic book in which Captain America is shown to be Steve Rogers  A caption in the final panel says this story was a test to see if readers would like Captain America to return  Captain America was then formally reintroduced in The Avengers  4  March 1964   which explained that in the final days of WWII  he had fallen from an experimental drone plane into the North Atlantic Ocean and spent decades frozen in a block of ice in a state of suspended animation  The hero found a new generation of readers as leader of that superhero team  Following the success of other Marvel characters introduced during the 1960s  Captain America was recast as a hero  haunted by past memories  and trying to adapt to 1960s society   14  After then guest starring

unnecessary details and making it more concise   March 2011   edit  1940s Captain America Comics  1  March 1941   Cover art by Joe Simon  inks and pencils  and Jack Kirby  pencils   Steve Rogers was born July 4  1917  in the Lower East Side of Manhattan  New York City  to Irish immigrants Sarah and Joseph Rogers  30  Joseph Rogers died when Steve was only a child and his mother  Sarah  died of pneumonia while Steve was a teen  By early 1940  before America s entry into World War II  Rogers is a tall but scrawny fine arts student specializing in illustration  Disturbed by the rise of the Third Reich  Rogers attempts to enlist  only to be rejected due to being in poor shape  U S  Army General Chester Phillips  looking for test subjects  offers Rogers the chance to serve his country by taking part in a top secret defense project   Operation  Rebirth  which seeks to develop a means of creating physically superior soldiers  Rogers volunteers for the research and  after a rigorous selection process  is chosen as the first human test subject for the Super Soldier serum developed by the scientist  Dr  Josef Reinstein   31  32  later retroactively changed to a code name for the scientist Abraham Erskine  33  That night  Operation  Rebirth is implemented and Rogers receives injections and oral doses of the Super Soldier Serum  He is then exposed to a controlled burst of  Vita Rays  that activate and stabilize the chemicals in his system  Although the process is arduous physically  it successfully alters his physiology almost instantly from its relatively frail form to the maximum of human efficiency  greatly enhancing his musculature  reflexes  agility  stamina and intelligence  Erskine declares Rogers to be the first of a new breed of man  a  nearly perfect human being   32  The process he underwent has varied from account to account  In the original 1941 story  he was injected with the formula  When the origin was retold in Tales of Suspense  63  the Comics Code Authority and its prohibitions on demonstrations of drug use were in force  and the injection was replaced with drinking a formula  34  In Captain America  109  the Vita Rays were first introduced  although a dialogue comment preserved continuity by mentioning that he had also drunk the formula beforehand  The retelling of the story in Captain America  255  however  stated that all three were used in combination  In addition  the limited series  The Adventures of Captain America reveals that Rogers also underwent rigorous physical training in combat prior to his enhancement  After the physical transformation  Nazi spy Heinz Kruger reveals himself and shoots Erskine  Because the scientist had committed crucial portions of the Super Soldier formula to memory  duplicating it perfectly would be unlikely  The spy dies  killed either while running away to escape Rogers or because Rogers threw him into live machinery  In the 1941 origin story and the Tales of Suspense  63 version  he dies when running into the machinery but is not killed by Rogers  in the Captain America  109 and  255 revision  however  Rogers causes the spy s death by punching him into the machinery  32  The United States government  making the most of its one super soldier and to hide all information about Operation  Rebirth and its failure  re imagines him as a superhero who serves as both a counter intelligence agent and a propaganda symbol to counter Nazi Germany s head of terrorist operations  the Red Skull  To that end  Rogers is given a uniform modeled after the American flag  based on Rogers  own sketches 30   a bulletproof shield  a personal side arm  and the codename Captain America  He is also given a cover identity as a clumsy infantry private at Camp Lehigh in Virginia  Barely out of his teens himself  Rogers makes friends with the camp s teenage mascot  James Buchanan  Bucky  Barnes  31  Barnes accidentally learns of Rogers  dual identity and offers to keep the secret if he can become Captain America s sidekick  Rogers agrees and trains Barnes  Rogers meets President Franklin D  Roosevelt  who presents him with a new shield  forged from an alloy of steel and vibranium  fused by an unknown catalyst  The alloy is indestructible  yet the shield is light enough to use as a discus like weapon that can be angled to return to him  It proves so effective that Captain America forgoes the sidearm  33  Throughout World War II  Captain America and Bucky fight the Nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team the Invaders  as seen in the 1970s comic of the same name   35  Captain America also battles a number of criminal menaces on American soil  including a wide variety of costumed villains  the Wax Man  36  the Hangman  37  the Fang  37  the Black Talon  38  and the White Death  38  among many others  In late April 1945  during the closing days of World War II  Captain America and Bucky try to stop the villainous Baron Zemo from destroying an experimental drone plane  Zemo launches the plane with an armed explosive on it  with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit  They reach the plane just before it takes off  but when Bucky tries to defuse the bomb  it explodes in mid air  The young man is believed killed  and Rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic  Neither body is found  and both are presumed dead  It is later revealed that neither character actually died  39   edit  Late 1940s to 1950s Captain America continued to appear in comics for the next few years changing from World War II era hero fighting against the Nazis to trying to defeat the United States  newest enemy  Communism  The revival of the character in the mid 1950s is short lived  and events during that time period are later retconned to show that multiple people operated using the code name in order to explain the changes in the character  These Post World War II successors are listed as William Naslund and Jeffrey Mace  The last of these other official Captains was a man who was so devoted to emulating Captain America that he had had his appearance surgically altered to resemble Rogers  His tenure and distinctive modified costume would result in him being later formally addressed as the  1950s Captain America   40  Furthermore  he also treated himself and a protege to an acquired Nazi copy of the Super Soldier serum to become the new Captain America and Bucky  but were unaware of the necessary Vita Ray component  As a result  the raw chemicals administered began to have serious detrimental effects on the pair s minds  rendering them both violently paranoid and regarding even innocent people as communist sympathizers during the height of the Red Scare of the 1950s  After it became evident that the two were insane  they were captured and placed in indefinite cryogenic storage by the US Government until they could be cured of their mental illness  41  The 1950s Bucky would be cured  42  and go on to be the original Cap partner for a time under the Nomad identity   edit  1960s to 1970s Captain America  180  Dec  1974   Captain America becomes  Nomad   Cover art by Gil Kane and Frank Giacoia  Years later  39  the superhero team the Avengers discovers Steve Rogers  body in the North Atlantic  the Captain s uniform under his soldier s fatigues and still carrying his shield  After he revives  they piece together that Rogers had been preserved in a block of ice since 1945  surviving in such a state only because of his enhancements from Operation  Rebirth  The block had begun to melt after the Sub Mariner  enraged that an Arctic Inuit tribe is worshiping the frozen figure  throws it into the ocean  Rogers accepts membership in the Avengers  and although long out of his time  his considerable combat experience makes him a valuable asset to the team  He quickly assumes leadership  43  and has typically returned to that position throughout the team s history  Captain America is plagued by guilt for having been unable to prevent Bucky s death a feeling that does not ease for some time  Although he takes the young Rick Jones  who closely resembles Bucky  under his tutelage  he refuses for some time to allow Jones to take up the Bucky identity  not wishing to be responsible for another youth s death  Insisting that his hero finally move on from that loss  Jones eventually convinces Rogers to let him don the Bucky costume  44  but this partnership lasts only a short time  a disguised Red Skull  impersonating Rogers with the help of the Cosmic Cube  drives Jones away  Rogers also reunites with his old war comrade Nick Fury  who is similarly well preserved due to the  Infinity Formula   As a result  Rogers regularly undertakes missions for the security agency S H I E L D  for which Fury is public director  45  Through Fury  Rogers befriends Sharon Carter  a S H I E L D  agent  46  with whom he eventually begins a romantic relationship  Rogers later meets and trains Sam Wilson  who becomes the superhero the Falcon  47  the first African American superhero in mainstream comic books  48  The characters established an enduring friendship and adventuring partnership  sharing the series title for some time as Captain America and the Falcon  49  The two later encounter the revived but still insane 1950s Captain America  50  Although Rogers and the Falcon defeat the faux Rogers and Jack Monroe  Rogers becomes deeply disturbed that he could have suffered his counterpart s fate  The series also dealt with the Marvel Universe s version of the Watergate scandal  making Rogers so uncertain about his role that he abandons his Captain America identity in favor of one called Nomad  emphasizing the word s meaning as  man without a country   During this time  several men unsuccessfully assume the Captain America identity  51  Rogers eventually re assumes it after coming to consider that the identity could be a symbol of American ideals and not its government  it s a personal conviction epitomized when he later confronted a corrupt Army officer attempting to manipulate him by appealing to his loyalty   I m loyal to nothing  General    except the  American  Dream   Jack Monroe  cured of his mental instability  later takes up the Nomad alias  52  During this period  Rogers also temporarily gains super strength  53  Immediately after witnessing Number One s suicide  he is summoned to the future to participate in the Destiny War between Kang the Conqueror and Immortus  it is revealed over the course of the story that Rogers was selected from this time frame as  had he been taken from any other time period  his strong personality  shaken at this point by the events he had just witnessed  would have dominated the team and deprived them of the flexibility required to succeed in their mission  although his presence alone still brought cohesion to the group   54  He also learns of the apparent death of Sharon Carter  55   edit  1980s to 1990s Captain America  350  Feb  1989   Rogers as  the Captain  vs  John Walker as Captain America  Cover art by Kieron Dwyer and Al Milgrom  The early 1980s included runs from such creators as Roger Stern  John Byrne  and J  M  DeMatteis  Stern had Steve Rogers consider a run for President of the United States in Captain America  250  June 1980   and introduced a new love interest  law student Bernie Rosenthal  in Captain America  248  Aug  1980   Stern also revisited and expanded Captain America s origin story  DeMatteis revealed the true face and full origin of the Red Skull in Captain America  298 300  and had Captain America take on Jack Monroe  Nomad  as a partner for a time  52  It is also around this time that the heroes gathered by the Beyonder elect Rogers as leader during their stay on Battleworld in the 1984 miniseries Secret Wars Also during the 1980s  Mark Gruenwald wrote 137 issues of the book for 10 consecutive years from 1985 to 1995  the most issues by any single author in the character s history  Gruenwald created several new foes  including Crossbones and the Serpent Society  Other Gruenwald characters included new love interest Diamondback   56  Super Patriot  who would go on to become a replacement Captain America in a two year story arc  57  and became USAgent at that arc s conclusion   and some short lived new partners that included Demolition Man  58  Gruenwald explores numerous political and social themes as well  such as extreme idealism when Captain America fights the anti nationalist terrorist Flag Smasher  59  and vigilantism when he hunts the murderous Scourge of the Underworld  60 Homophobia was also dealt with as Steve Rogers runs into a childhood friend named Arnold Roth who is gay  61  62  Rogers receives a large back pay reimbursement dating back to his disappearance at the end of World War II  and a government commission orders him to work directly for the U S  government  Already troubled by the corruption he had encountered with the Nuke incident in New York City  63  Rogers chooses instead to resign his identity  64  and then takes the alias of  the Captain   65  A replacement Captain America  John Walker  struggles to emulate Rogers  ideals until pressure from hidden enemies helps to drive Walker insane  Rogers returns to the Captain America identity 66  while a recovered Walker becomes the U S  Agent  67  Sometime afterward  Rogers avoids the explosion of a methamphetamine lab  but the drug triggers a chemical reaction in the Super Soldier serum in his system  To combat the reaction  Rogers has the serum removed from his body  and trains constantly to maintain his physical condition  68  A retcon later establishes that the serum was not a drug per se  which would have metabolized out of his system  but in fact a virus like organism that effected a biochemical and genetic change  This additionally explained how arch nemesis Red Skull  who at the time inhabited a body cloned from Rogers  cells  also has the formula in his body  Because of his altered biochemistry  Rogers  body begins to deteriorate  and for a time he must wear a powered exoskeleton and is eventually placed again in suspended animation  During this time  he is given a transfusion of blood from the Red Skull  which cures his condition and stabilizes the Super Soldier virus in his system  Captain America returns both to crime fighting and the Avengers  69  Following Gruenwald s departure on the book  Mark Waid took over and resurrected Sharon Carter as Cap s love interest  The book was then relaunched under Rob Liefeld as Cap became part of the Heroes Reborn universe for 13 issues before another relaunch restored Waid to the title in an arc that saw Cap lose his shield for a time using an energy based shield as a temporary replacement  Following Waid s run  Dan Jurgens took over and introduced new foe Protocide  a failed recipient of the Super Soldier serum prior to the experiment that successfully created Rogers   edit  2000s In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks  Rogers reveals his identity to the world and establishes a residence in the Red Hook

shield and asks his former sidekick to continue as Captain America  The American President grants Rogers a full pardon for his anti registration actions   edit  2010s Following the company wide  Dark Reign  and  Siege  story arcs  the Steve Rogers character became part of the  Heroic Age  arc  70  The U S  president appoints Rogers  in his civilian identity  as head of the nation s security  replacing Norman Osborn  The Superhuman Registration Act is repealed and Rogers reestablishes the superhero team the Avengers  In the miniseries Steve Rogers  Super Soldier  he encounters Jacob Erskine  the grandson of Professor Abraham Erskine and the son of Tyler Paxton  one of Rogers  fellow volunteers in the Super Soldier program  Shortly afterward  Rogers becomes leader of the Secret Avengers  a black ops superhero team  During the Fear Itself storyline  Steve Rogers is present when the threat of the Serpent is known  71  Following the death of Bucky at the hands of Sin  in the form of Skadi   Steve Rogers ends up changing into his Captain America outfit  72  When the Avengers and the New Avengers are fighting Skadi  the Serpent ends up joining the battle and uses his fists to break Captain America s shield 73  Captain America and the Avengers teams end up forming a militia for a last stand against the forces of the Serpent  74  When it comes to the final battle  Captain America uses Thor s hammer to fight Skadi until Thor manages to kill the Serpent  In the aftermath of the battle  Iron Man presents Captain with his reforged shield now stronger for its uru infused enhancements despite the scar it bears  75  It is then revealed that Captain America  Nick Fury  and Black Widow are the only ones who know that Bucky actually survived the fight with Skadi as Bucky resumes his identity as Winter Soldier  76   edit  Powers and abilities Steve Rogers  physical transformation  from a reprint of Captain America Comics  1  May 1941   Art by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby  Captain America has no superhuman powers  although as a result of the Super Soldier Serum and  Vita Ray  treatment  he is transformed from a frail young man into a  perfect  specimen of human development and conditioning  77  Captain America s strength  endurance  agility  speed  reflexes  durability  and healing are at the zenith of natural human potential  Rogers  body regularly replenishes the super soldier serum  it does not wear off  78  The formula enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build up of fatigue poisons in his muscles  giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being  This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats  including bench pressing 1200 pounds  545 kg  and running a mile  1 6 km  in 73 seconds  49 mph 78 kph   79  Furthermore  his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades  Rogers cannot become intoxicated by alcohol  drugs  or impurities in the air and is immune to terrestrial diseases  citation needed  He is also highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus  80  The secrets of creating a super soldier were lost with the death of its creator  Dr  Abraham Erskine  81  However  in the ensuing decades there have been numerous secret attempts to recreate Erskine s treatment  only to have them predominantly all end in failure  Even worse  the attempts have instead often created psychopathic supervillains of which Captain America s 1950s imitator and Nuke are the most notorious examples  Rogers  battle experience and training make him an expert tactician and an excellent field commander  with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle  Rogers  reflexes and senses are also extraordinarily keen  He has blended judo  western boxing  kickboxing  and gymnastics into his own unique fighting style and is a master of multiple martial arts  Years of practice with his indestructible shield make him able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy  His skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or even cause a boomerang like return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind  In canon  he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best hand to hand combatants in the Marvel Universe  82  83  Although the super soldier serum is an important part of his strength  Rogers has shown himself still sufficiently capable against stronger opponents  even when the serum has been deactivated reverting him to his pre Captain America physique  84  Rogers has vast U S  military knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing  classified Defense Department operations  He is an expert in combat strategy  survival  acrobatics  military strategy  piloting  and demolitions  Despite his high profile as one of the world s most popular and recognizable superheroes  Rogers also has a broad understanding of the espionage community  largely through his ongoing relationship with S H I E L D  He occasionally makes forays into relatively mundane career fields  including commercial arts  comic book artistry  education  high school history   and law enforcement  Although he lacks superhuman strength  Captain America is one of the few mortal beings who has been deemed worthy enough to wield Thor s hammer  85   edit  Weapons and equipment Further information  Captain America s shield Captain America uses several shields throughout his history  the most prevalent of which is a nigh indestructible disc shaped shield made from an experimental alloy of steel and the fictional vibranium  86  The shield was cast by American metallurgist Dr  Myron MacLain  who was contracted by the U S  government  from orders of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II  citation needed  This alloy was created by accident and never duplicated  although efforts to reverse engineer it resulted in the discovery of adamantium  citation needed  Captain America often uses his shield as an offensive throwing weapon  The first instance of Captain America s trademark ricocheting shield toss occurs in Stan Lee s first comics writing  the two page text story  Captain America Foils the Traitor s Revenge  in Captain America Comics  3  May 1941   87  The legacy of the shield among other comics characters includes the time traveling mutant superhero Cable telling Captain America that his shield still exists in one of the possible futures  Cable carries it into battle and brandishes it as a symbol  88  When without his trademark shield  Captain America sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel  volume  amp  issue needed  or even a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix  volume  amp  issue needed  Rogers  having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes  carried a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm  and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease  89  Much like his vibranium shield  the energy shield can also be thrown  including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand  90  Captain America s uniform is made of a fire retardant material  and he wears a lightweight  bulletproof  duralumin  scale armor beneath his uniform for added protection  33  Originally  Rogers  mask was a separate piece of material  but an early engagement had it dislodged  thus almost exposing his identity  To prevent a recurrence of the situation  Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform  an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck  As a member of the Avengers  Rogers has an Avengers priority card  which serves as a communications device  Captain America has also used a custom specialized motorcycle  modified by the S H I E L D  weapons laboratory  as well as a custom built battle van  constructed by the Wakanda Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes  red  white and blue   and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it   edit  Enemies Main article  List of Captain America enemies Captain America has faced numerous foes in over 60 years of published adventures  Many of his recurring foes embody ideals contrary to the American values Captain America is shown to strive for and believe  Some examples of these opposing values are Nazism  Red Skull  Baron Zemo   Neo Nazism  Crossbones  Doctor Faustus   technocratic fascism  AIM  Arnim Zola   Communism  Aleksander Lukin   anarchism  Flag Smasher and Viper   and international and domestic terrorism  HYDRA    edit  Other versions Main article  Alternative versions of Captain America  edit  In other
