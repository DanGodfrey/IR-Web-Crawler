characters Main article  List of Disney s Aladdin characters Scott Weinger as Aladdin  A poor but kind hearted Agrabah thief  Weinger sent in a homemade audition tape with his mother playing the Genie  2  and after several call backs he found six months later that he had the part  3  The character s singing voice was provided by Brad Kane  who would also perform the speaking voice before Weinger was cast  4  Robin Williams as The Genie The Narrator  A comedic genie  with nigh omnipotent power that can only be exercised when his master wishes it  Clements and Musker wrote the part of the Genie for Williams  and when met with resistance created a reel of Williams  standup to animation of the Genie  When Williams watched the video  he  laughed his ass off  and agreed to do the project  5  Jonathan Freeman as Jafar  The power hungry Grand Vizier of Agrabah  Jafar was originally envisioned as an irritable character  but the directors decided that a calm villain would be scarier  6  Freeman was the first actor cast  and spent one year and nine months recording his dialogue  He later readjusted his voice after Weinger and Larkin were cast as he felt  Jafar had to be seen as a real threat to Aladdin and Jasmine   7  Animator Andreas Deja tried to incorporate Freeman s facial expressions and gesturing into the character  8  Linda Larkin as Princess Jasmine  The princess of Agrabah  who is tired of life in the royal palace  Larkin was chosen nine months after her audition  and had to adjust her pitch to reach the voice the filmmakers were looking for the character  6 Lea Salonga  who was performing Miss Saigon on Broadway at the time  supplies the character s singing voice  9  Frank Welker as Abu  Aladdin s kleptomaniac pet monkey with a high pitched voice  The animators filmed monkeys at the San Francisco Zoo to study the movements Abu would have  6  In the three years it took to record the film  Welker did not meet Weinger or Williams  10  Welker also voiced Jasmine s tiger Rajah  and the Cave of Wonders  11  Gilbert Gottfried as Iago  Jafar s sarcastic  foul mouthed pet parrot sidekick  Iago s animator Will Finn tried to incorporate some aspects of Gottfried s appearance into Iago s design  specially his semi closed eyes and the always appearing teeth  6  Douglas Seale as The Sultan  The pompous but kind ruler of Agrabah  who desperately tries to find a suitor for his daughter Jasmine  Some aspects of the character were inspired in the Wizard of Oz  to create a bumbling authority figure  6  Jim Cummings as Razoul  The Captain of the Guard  He was named after layout supervisor Rasoul Azadani  6  The Magic Carpet is a sentient carpet who is able to fly  Animator Randy Cartwright described working on the Carpet as challenging  since it is just a square shape  who expresses himself through pantomime    It s sort of like acting by origami   12  Cartwright kept folding a piece of cloth while animating to see how to position the Carpet  12  After the character animation was done  the carpet s surface design was applied digitally  8  Production Script and development In 1988  lyricist Howard Ashman pitched to Disney the idea of an animated musical adaptation of Aladdin  After Ashman wrote some songs with partner Alan Menken and a film treatment  13  a screenplay was written by Linda Woolverton  who had worked on Beauty and the Beast  14  Then directors John Musker and Ron Clements joined the production  picking Aladdin out of three projects offered  which also included an adaptation of Swan Lake and King of the Jungle   that eventually became The Lion King  15  Musker and Clements wrote a draft of the screenplay  and delivered it to studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg in 1991  Katzenberg thought the script  didn t engage   and only approved it after the screenwriting duo Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio rewrote it  13  Among the changes  the character of Aladdin s mother was removed  Princess Jasmine was made into a stronger character  Aladdin s personality was rewritten to be  a little rougher  like a young Harrison Ford   13  16  and the parrot Iago  originally conceived as a  British  calm and serious character  was reworked into a comic role after the filmmakers saw Gilbert Gottfried in Beverly Hills Cop II  Gottfried was cast to provide Iago s voice  17  Several characters and plot elements are also based on the 1940 version of The Thief of Bagdad  18  19  and many aspects of the traditional story were changed for the film   for instance  the setting is changed from  China  to a fictional Arabian city  Agrabah  20  Design and animation Style guide depicting the main characters  The animators designed each one based on a different geometrical shape  21  One of the first issues that the animators faced during production of Aladdin was the depiction of Aladdin himself  22  Director and producer John Musker explains    In early screenings  we played with him being a little bit younger  and he had a mother in the story        In design he became more athletic looking  more filled out  more of a young leading man  more of a teen hunk version than before  22    He was initially going to be as young as 13  but that eventually changed to eighteen  22  Aladdin was designed by a team led by supervising animator Glen Keane  and was originally made to resemble actor Michael J  Fox  During production  it was decided that the design was too boyish and wasn t  appealing enough   so the character was redesigned to add elements derived from actor Tom Cruise and Calvin Klein models  5  The design for most characters was based on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld  8  which production designer Richard Vander Wende also considered appropriate to the theme  due to similarities to the swooping lines of Persian miniatures and Arabic calligraphy  12  Jafar s design was not based on Hirschfeld s work because Jafar s supervising animator  Andreas Deja  wanted the character to be contrasting  23  Each character was animated alone  with the animators consulting each other to make scenes with interrelating characters  Since Aladdin s animator Glen Keane was working in the California branch of Walt Disney Feature Animation  and Jasmine s animator Mark Henn was in the Florida one at Disney MGM Studios  they had to frequently phone  fax or send designs and discs to each other  12  For the scenery design  layout supervisor Rasoul Azadani took many pictures of his hometown of Isfahan  Iran for guidance  6  Other inspirations for design were Disney s animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad  12  The coloring was done with the computerized CAPS process  and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality   the protagonists use light colors such as blue  the antagonists darker ones such as red and black  and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow  6  8 Computer animation was used for some elements of the film  such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave  8  Musker and Clements created the Genie with Robin Williams in mind  even though Katzenberg suggested actors such as John Candy  Steve Martin  and Eddie Murphy  Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role  Williams came for voice recording sessions during breaks in the shooting of two other films he was starring in at the time  Hook and Toys  Unusually for an animated film  much of Williams  dialogue was ad libbed  for some scenes  Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions  but allowed to improvise his lines  8  It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters  24 Eric Goldberg  the supervising animator for the Genie  then reviewed Williams  recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match  8  The producers added many in jokes and references to Disney s previous works in the film  such as a  cameo appearance  from directors Clements and Musker and drawing some characters based on Disney workers  11 Beast  Sebastian from The Little Mermaid  and Pinocchio make brief appearances  6  and the wardrobe of the Genie at the end of the film Goofy hat  Hawaiian shirt  and sandals are a reference to a short film that Robin Williams did for the Disney MGM Studios tour in the late 80s  11  Robin Williams  conflicts with the studio In gratitude for his success with the Disney Touchstone film Good Morning  Vietnam  Robin Williams voiced the Genie for SAG scale pay   75 000   on condition that his name or image not be used for marketing  and his  supporting  character not take more than 25  of space on advertising artwork  since Toys was scheduled for release one month after Aladdin s debut  For financial reasons  the studio went back on the deal on both counts  especially in poster art by having the Genie in 25  of the image  but having other major and supporting characters portrayed considerably smaller  The Disney Hyperion book Aladdin  The Making Of An Animated Film  listed both of Williams  characters  The Peddler  and  The Genie  ahead of main characters  but was forced to refer to him only as  the actor signed to play the Genie   5  Williams and Disney had a bitter falling out  and as a result  Dan Castellaneta voiced the Genie in The Return of Jafar  the Aladdin animated television series  and had recorded his voice for Aladdin and the King of Thieves  When Jeffrey Katzenberg was fired from Disney and replaced by former 20th Century Fox production head Joe Roth  whose last act for Fox was greenlighting Williams  film Mrs  Doubtfire   Roth arranged for a public apology to Williams by Disney  Williams agreed to perform in Hollywood Pictures  Jack  directed by Francis Ford Coppola  and even agreed to voice the Genie again for the King Of Thieves sequel  for considerably more than scale   replacing all of Castellaneta s dialogue  25  Music Main article  Aladdin  soundtrack  Composer Alan Menken and songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice were praised for creating a soundtrack that is  consistently good  rivaling the best of Disney s other animated musicals from the  90s   26  Menken and Ashman began work on the film together  with Rice taking over as lyricist after Ashman died of AIDS related complications in early 1991  27  Although fourteen songs were written for Aladdin  only six are featured in the movie  three by each lyricist  28  The DVD Special Edition released in 2004 includes four songs in early animations tests  and a music video of one   Proud of Your Boy   performed by Clay Aiken  29  which also appears on the album DisneyMania 3  30  Themes  The original story was sort of a winning the lottery kind of thing  When we got into it  particularly coming in at the end of 1980s  it seemed like an Eighties  greed is good  movie        Like having anything you could wish for would be the greatest thing in the world and having it taken away from you is bad  but having it back is great  We didn t really want that to be the message of the movie  Ron Clements 12  The filmmakers thought the moral message of the original tale was not appropriate  and decided to  put a spin on it   by making the fulfillment of wishes seem like a great thing  but eventually becoming a problem  12  Another major theme was not trying to be what the person is not   both Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble faking to be different people  6  and the Prince Ali persona fails to impress Jasmine  who only falls for Aladdin when she finds out who he truly is  31  Being  imprisoned  is also discussed  a fate that occurs to most of the characters   Aladdin and Jasmine are stuck to their lifestyles  Genie is attached to his lamp and Jafar  to the Sultan   and is represented visually by the prison like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace  and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine later frees  6  Jasmine is also depicted as a different Disney Princess  being rebellious to the royal life and the social structure  32  and trying to make her own way  unlike the princesses who just wait for rescue  12  Release and reception Theatrical run A large promotion campaign preceded Aladdin s debut in theaters  with the film s trailer being attached to most Disney VHS releases  and numerous tie ins and licensees being released  33  After a limited release on November 13  1992  34 Aladdin debuted in 1 131 theaters on November 25  1992  grossing  19 2 million in its opening weekend   number two at the box office  behind Home Alone 2  Lost in New York  35  It took eight weeks for the film to reach number one at the US box office  breaking the record for the week between Christmas and New Year s Eve with  32 2 million  36  The film held the top spot five times during its 22 week run  37 Aladdin was the most successful film of 1992 grossing  217 million in the United States and over  504 million worldwide  1  It was the biggest gross for an animated film until The Lion King two years later  38  As of 2010  it is the eighteenth highest grossing animated film and the third highest grossing traditionally animated feature worldwide  behind The Lion King and The Simpsons Movie  39  Critical reception Aladdin was well received by critics  The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 92  of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of 49 reviews  with an average score of 7 9 10  40  Among the  Top Critics   it has a 100  positive review rating from eight critics  41  Most critics  praise went to Robin Williams  performance as Genie  40  with Janet Maslin of The New York Times declaring that children  needn t know precisely what Mr  Williams is evoking to understand how funny he is   42 Warner Bros  animator Chuck Jones even called the film  the funniest feature ever made   13 James Berardinelli gave it 3 5 out of 4 stars  praising the  crisp visuals and wonderful song and dance numbers   43 Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said the comedy made the film accessible to both children and adults  44  a vision shared with Desson Howe of The Washington Post  who also said  kids are still going to be entranced by the magic and adventure   45  Brian Lowry of Variety praised the cast of characters  describing the expressive magic carpet as  its most remarkable accomplishment  and considered that  Aladdin overcomes most story flaws thanks to sheer technical virtuosity   46  Some aspects of the film were widely criticized  Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wrote a negative review  describing the film as racist  ridiculous  and a  narcissistic circus act  for Robin Williams  47 IGN s review considered that besides the Genie and the cave in scene  Aladdin was  totally by the numbers        You know how it will all turn out  it contains no surprises  and for that matter  very little that s truly special   and described the cast  particularly the protagonists  as  cookie cutter characters   29 Roger Ebert  who generally praised the film in his review  considered the music inferior to its predecessors The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast  and claimed Aladdin and Jasmine were  pale and routine   48  Awards Aladdin also received many award nominations  mostly for its music  It won two Academy Awards  Best Music  Original Score and Best Music  Original Song for  A Whole New World  and receiving nominations for Best Song   Friend Like Me    Best Sound Editing  and Best Sound  Terry Porter

A Whole New World    Nominated Song 58  AFI s 10 Top 10   Nominated Animated Film 59  AFI s Greatest Movie Musicals   Nominated Musical 60  Home media The film was first released in VHS on October 1  1993  as part of the  Walt Disney Classics  line  In its first week of availability  Aladdin sold over 10 8 million copies  61  and went on to sell over 25 million in total  a record only broken by the later release of The Lion King   62  It entered moratorium on April 30  1994  63  On October 5  2004  Aladdin was released on DVD  as part of Disney s Platinum Edition line  The DVD release featured retouched and cleaned up animation  prepared for Aladdin s planned but ultimately cancelled IMAX reissue in 2003  64  and a second disc with bonus features  Accompanied by a  19 million marketing campaign  65  the DVD sold about 3 million units in its first month  but it was less than the number of copies  sold in that amount of time  by any other Platinum Edition released before it  66  The film s soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5 1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix  29  The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008  along with its sequels  67  According to an insert in the Lady and the Tramp Diamond Edition release  Aladdin will be released on Blu ray as a Diamond Edition in Spring 2013  68  Controversies One of the verses of the opening song  Arabian Nights  was altered following protests from the American Arab Anti Discrimination Committee  ADC   The lyrics were changed in July 1993 from  Where they cut off your ear if they don t like your face   in the original release to  Where it s flat and immense and the heat is intense   The change first appeared on the 1993 video release  69  The original lyric was intact on the initial CD soundtrack release  but the re release uses the edited lyric  The rerecording has the original voice on all other lines and then a noticeably deeper voice says the edited line  Entertainment Weekly ranked Aladdin in a list of the most controversial films in history  due to this incident  70  The ADC also complained about the portrayal of the lead characters Aladdin and Jasmine  They criticized the characters  Anglicized features and Anglo American accents  in contrast to the other characters in the film  which are dark skinned  have foreign accents and grotesque facial features  and appear villainous or greedy  69  Protests were also raised to another scene  When Aladdin is attacked by the tiger Rajah on the palace balcony  Aladdin quietly says  Good kitty  take off and go     and the word  kitty  is overlapped by Rajah s snarl  Some people reported hearing  Good teenagers  take off your clothes   71  which they considered a subliminal reference to promiscuity  Because of the controversy  Disney replaced the phrase with  Down  kitty  on the DVD release  72  Animation enthusiasts have noticed similarities between Aladdin and Richard Williams s unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler  also known as Arabian Knight under Miramax Films and The Princess and the Cobbler under Majestic Films International   These similarities include a similar plot  similar characters  scenes and background designs  and the antagonist Zig Zag s resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar  73  74  Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler  The Thief and the Cobbler was started much earlier in the 1960s  its production being mired in difficulties including financial problems  copyright issues  and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work  75  The late release coupled with Miramax  a Disney owned studio  purchasing and re editing the film  has sometimes resulted in The Thief and the Cobbler being labeled a copy of Aladdin  74  Legacy Sequels and spin offs Aladdin was followed by Disney s first direct to video sequel  The Return of Jafar in 1994  The film saw the debut of a new character  Abis Mal  voiced by Jason Alexander  and all of the original cast  except for Robin Williams  replaced by Dan Castellaneta  and Douglas Seale  replaced by Val Bettin  The plot mainly focused on Jafar seeking revenge on Aladdin  However  this time  with Iago on Aladdin s side  Abis Mal becomes Jafar s new henchman  76  Shortly after The Return of Jafar  the Aladdin TV series was aired on television  The episodes focused on Aladdin s adventures after the events of the second film  77  In 1996  the final sequel to Aladdin  Aladdin and the King of Thieves was released on video  The story concludes as Aladdin and Jasmine are about to be married and Aladdin discovers that his father is still alive  but is the king of all thieves in Agrabah  76  The Aladdin characters later made a crossover with Hercules  The Animated Series  78  and were featured as guests in the television series House of Mouse and related works to those series Jafar was the leader of the villains in Mickey s House of Villains  79  The film also inspired a Disney On Ice presentation  80  and two attractions in Disney s theme parks   The Magic Carpets of Aladdin   a Dumbo the Flying Elephant like ride at both Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World Resort and Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Resort Paris  81  82  and the show Disney s Aladdin  A Musical Spectacular at Disney California Adventure Park  83  Video games Main article  Disney s Aladdin  video game  Along with the film release  three different video games based on Aladdin were released  A coproduction between Virgin Games and Walt Disney Feature Animation for the Sega Genesis was released in late 1993 and later ported to Nintendo Entertainment System  PC  Game

Vivendi Universal released Disney s Aladdin Chess Adventures  a chess computer game with the Aladdin license  89  The Kingdom Hearts series features a playable Aladdin world known as Agrabah  90  In
