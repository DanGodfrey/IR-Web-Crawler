telescope to the heavens  the planets of the Solar System were not recognized as worlds  or places where a person could potentially set foot  they were visible to observers merely as bright points of light  distinguishable from stars only by their motion  In the system of Claudius Ptolemy  fl  c  150   the Alexandrian astronomer whose works were the basis of all European astronomy throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance  the planets were lights set into a series of transparent spheres turning around the Earth  which was the center of the one and only universe  2 Dante  1265 1321   in his Paradiso  3  describes the ascent of his narrator through the spheres of the Moon  the planets from Mercury to Saturn  and thence to the sphere of the fixed stars and the heavens of the angels  Dante implies that the light of the planets is a combination of light imparted by Divine will and the radiance of the blessed souls that inhabit the spheres  These planets are  however  entirely ethereal  they have light but no physical form and no geography  Ludovico Ariosto  in his epic Orlando Furioso  1513   4  jestingly sent his hero to a Moon where everything lost on Earth eventually turns up  but it was not until Galileo discovered  1609 1610  that the Moon had surface features  and that the other planets could  at least  be resolved into disks  5  that the concept that the planets were real physical bodies came to be taken seriously  In 1543  Nicolaus Copernicus had already posited that the planets orbited the Sun as the Earth does  combined  these two concepts led to the thought that the planets might be  worlds  similar to the Earth  6  Public expression of such concepts could be dangerous  however  Giordano Bruno was martyred in 1600 for  among other things  imagining an infinite number of other worlds  and claiming that  Innumerable suns exist  innumerable Earths revolve about these suns     Living beings inhabit these worlds  in De l infinito universo e mondi   Concerning the Infinite Universe and Worlds   1584   7  At the time  such speculation was of a rather rarefied sort  and was limited to astronomers like Christiaan Huygens who wrote a book  Cosmotheoros  1698  8  considering the possibility of life on other planets  or to philosophers like Campanella  who wrote in defense of Galileo  The concept of life on distant planets was not  however  much utilized in fiction  The most popular target of 17th century  science fiction  was the Moon   visited  in fiction by Kepler  9 Godwin  10 Cyrano  11  and Defoe   12  Oddly  none of these fictions made use of the lunar maps contemporaneously created by Hevelius  Riccioli and others  It was quite some time before such  extraordinary voyages  went beyond the lunar sphere  Eberhard Kindermann sent an airship to the planets in 1744 in Die Geschwinde Reise auf dem Lufft schiff nach der obern Welt   The Airship s Speedy Journey to the Upper World    13  while a traveller from the star Sirius passes inward through the Solar System  stopping at various planets in Voltaire s Microm gas  1752   14  followed by another outward voyage in Marie Anne de Roumier Robert s Voyage de Milord C ton dans les Sept Plan tes   Lord Seton s Voyage Among the Seven Planets   1765   15  These stories were generally unscientific and tended towards the satirical rather than the purely entertaining  their subject matter was probably inspired by the popular writings of Fontenelle  notably his Entretiens sur la pluralit  des mondes   Conversations on the Multiplicity of Worlds   1686   16  With the rapid developments in the magnifying and resolving power of telescopes in the course of the 19th century  it finally became possible to distinguish surface features on other planets and even to draw maps of some of them  notably Mars  In 1877  Asaph Hall reported two moons of Mars and Giovanni Schiaparelli found the surface of Mars to be adorned with continents  seas  and channels  and a very suitable habitat for life  From the beginning of the 1880s  fictions   some more  some less scientific   involving travels to and from Mars began to be produced in great quantities  even though the observations of Percival Lowell required reassessment of Mars as a more marginal desert planet  17  Mars remained a favored destination for fictional travellers down to the early 1960s  see Mars in fiction   Since probes revealed the absence of any indications of intelligent life on Mars  the science fictional Mars has changed to a possible future home for the human race  e g  through terraforming  Venus was never quite so popular as Mars  probably because it obdurately refused to display any surface features  it is covered with sulfuric acid clouds only dimly translucent to visible light   making any statement about its nature disturbingly speculative  In 1918  chemist Svante Arrhenius  deciding that Venus  cloud cover was necessarily water  decreed in The Destinies of the Stars that  A very great part of the surface of Venus is no doubt covered with swamps  and compared Venus  humidity to the tropical rain forests of the Congo  18  Venus thus became  until the early 1960s  a place for science fiction writers to place all manner of unusual life forms  from quasi dinosaurs to intelligent carnivorous plants  and where hostile interactions with Venusian natives were reminiscent of European colonial projects in Africa and Asia  see Venus in fiction   In fact Venus s surface is hot enough to melt lead  and it is extremely hostile to life  Various other planets of the Solar System were used as settings for science fiction stories in the first half of the 20th century  but dissatisfaction with the limits imposed by science led many writers early on to forsake the Solar System for fictional planets around distant stars  As increasing knowledge of the Solar System made the prospects of life in the vicinity of Earth marginal at best  the extrasolar planet has become almost the only venue for contemporary science fiction  In many works of science fiction  planets are only described casually  as points of origin and departure  or as interchangeable backdrops for space battles  This is particularly true of space opera  In other works  the planet takes center stage as the primary scene of events  and particular attention is paid to its environment and any culture that may exist on it  Adventure stories that stick to a single  well described planet are sometimes called planetary romances  some of these planets are not very realistic and are effectively fantasy worlds  Planets may be treated in different ways depending both on the interests of the author and the genre he or she is writing in  In some stories  a planet is mainly considered as an object in space  the interest of the fiction depends upon its astronomical characteristics  such as its mass  its geological composition  its atmosphere  how many moons it has and what size they are  how close it is to its sun  or suns  and how hot they are  Such considerations are found prominently though not exclusively in the hard science fiction genre  In other stories  a planet is considered as a world or setting  Such a planet will be described from the point of view of a person dwelling on it  rather than from the point of view of an outside observer  the fiction may describe its geography  its history  and the social and cultural characteristics of its civilizations  Since authors usually adopt human protagonists  such planets are typically described as very hospitable to human life and  other than in geography  nearly indistinguishable from Earth  Brian Stableford calls such planets  Earth Clones   19  Conversely some fictional worlds are never more than marginally habitable  which has a profound effect on societies that developed or moved there  Numerous examples of this are to be found in the Known Space stories of Larry Niven  While some authors choose to treat a planet in depth  considering it to have a wide diversity of geography  climate  politics and culture  others prefer to characterize their planets by some single global characteristic  Many of these uniform settings have become stereotypes  used in a variety of science fictional works  Such stereotypes include  the planet covered by a single city  the planet whose surface is entirely desert  the planet covered by ocean  with no landmasses  the planet on which it is perpetually winter  the planet that is self aware  and the planet which has been artificially constructed  Other planets appear in humorous or comical settings  sometimes spoofing more conventional science fiction  Such planets are often described with no pretense to scientific accuracy  their strange characteristics are primarily intended to amuse  For the Star Trek universe  a detailed planetary classification system has been devised  it is not actually used by scientists   edit  Planet lists For planets from
