nutshell  There is no practical limit to the amount of information on Wikipedia  However  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia  and does not contain all data or expression found elsewhere on the Internet  Although anyone can be an editor  there are community processes and standards that make Wikipedia neither an anarchy  democracy  nor bureaucracy  The Five Pillars Core content policies Neutral point

Policy shortcuts  WP NOTPAPER WP PAPER Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia  but a digital encyclopedia project  Other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page  there is no practical limit to the number of topics Wikipedia can cover  or the total amount of content  However  there is an important distinction between what can be done  and what should be done  which is covered in the Content section below  Consequently  this policy is not a free pass for inclusion  articles must abide by the appropriate content policies  particularly those covered in the five pillars  Keeping articles to a reasonable size is important for Wikipedia s accessibility  especially for dial up and mobile browser readers  since it directly affects page download time  see Wikipedia Article size   Splitting long articles and leaving adequate summaries is a natural part of growth for a topic  see Wikipedia Summary style   Some topics are covered by print encyclopedias only in short  static articles  but we can include more information  provide more external links  and update more quickly  For some of the other ways in which Wikipedia differs from a paper publication  see the Wikipedia Manual of Style   edit  Content In any encyclopedia  information cannot be included solely for being true or useful  Although there are debates about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries  consensus is that the following are good examples of what Wikipedia is not  The examples under each section are not intended to be exhaustive   edit  Wikipedia is not a dictionary Policy shortcuts  WP NOT DICDEF WP NOT DICT WP NOT DICTIONARY Main page  Wikipedia Wikipedia is not a dictionary Wikipedia is not a dictionary  or a usage or jargon guide  Wikipedia articles are not  Definitions  Articles should begin with a good definition or description  but articles that contain nothing more than a definition should be expanded with additional encyclopedic content  If they can not  Wikipedia is not the place for them  look to Wiktionary instead  Dictionary entries  Encyclopedia articles are about a person  or a group  a concept  a place  a thing  an event  etc  In some cases  a word or phrase itself may be an encyclopedic subject  such as Macedonia  terminology  or truthiness  However  articles rarely  if ever  contain more than one distinct definition or usage of the article s title  Articles about the cultural or mathematical significance of individual numbers are also acceptable  For a wiki that is a dictionary  visit our sister

not use Wikipedia for any of the following  Primary  original  research  such as proposing theories and solutions  original ideas  defining terms  coining new words  etc  If you have completed primary research on a topic  your results should be published in other venues  such as peer reviewed journals  other printed forms  open research  or respected online publications  Wikipedia can report about your work after it is published and becomes part of accepted knowledge  however  citations of such reliable sources are needed to demonstrate that material is verifiable  and not merely the editor s opinion  Personal inventions  If you or a friend invented the word frindle  a drinking game  or a new type of dance move  it is not notable enough to be an article until multiple  independent  and reliable secondary sources report on it  Wikipedia is not for things made up one day  Personal essays that state your particular feelings about a topic  rather than the opinion of experts   Although Wikipedia is supposed to compile human knowledge  it is not a vehicle to make personal opinions become part of such knowledge  In the unusual situation where the opinions of an individual are important enough to discuss  it is preferable to let other people write about them  Personal essays on topics relating to Wikipedia are welcome in your user namespace or on the Meta wiki  There is a Wikipedia fork at Wikinfo that encourages personal opinions in articles  Discussion forums  Please try to stay on the task of creating an encyclopedia  You can chat with people about Wikipedia related topics on their user talk pages  and should resolve problems with articles on the relevant talk pages  but please do not take discussion into articles  In addition  bear in mind that talk pages exist for the purpose of discussing how to improve articles  Talk pages are not mere general discussion pages about the subject of the article  nor are they a helpdesk for obtaining instructions or technical assistance  If you wish to ask a specific question on a topic  Wikipedia has a Reference desk  and questions should be asked there rather than on talk pages  Wikipedians who wish to hold casual discussions with fellow Wikipedians can use the IRC channels  such as  wikipedia  Note that this is an IRC channel  not a message board  There are also a number of early stage projects that attempt to use a wiki for discussion and debate  Material unsuitable for talk pages may be subject to removal per the talk page guidelines   edit  Wikipedia is not a soapbox or means of promotion

WikiProject  see Wikipedia WikiProject Soap Operas  Wikipedia is not a soapbox  a battleground  or a vehicle for propaganda  advertising and showcasing  This applies to articles  categories  templates  talk page discussions  and user pages  Therefore  content hosted in Wikipedia is not for  Advocacy  propaganda  or recruitment of any kind  commercial  political  religious  sports related  or otherwise  An article can report objectively about such things  as long as an attempt is made to describe the topic from a neutral point of view  You might wish to start a blog or visit a forum if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views  1  Opinion pieces  Although some topics  particularly those concerning current affairs and politics  may stir passions and tempt people to  climb soapboxes   for example  passionately advocate their pet point of view   Wikipedia is not the medium for this  Articles must be balanced to put entries  especially for current events  in a reasonable perspective  and represent a neutral point of view  Furthermore  Wikipedia authors should strive to write articles that will not quickly become obsolete  However  Wikipedia s sister project Wikinews allows commentaries on its articles  Scandal mongering  promoting things  heard through the grapevine  or gossiping  Articles and content about living people are required to meet an especially high standard  as they may otherwise be libellous or infringe the subjects  right to privacy  Articles should not be written purely to attack the reputation of another person  Self promotion  It can be tempting to write about yourself or projects in which you have a strong personal involvement  However  do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other  This includes the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view  which can be difficult when writing about yourself or about projects close to you  Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical sources is unacceptable  See Wikipedia Autobiography  Wikipedia Notability and Wikipedia Conflict of interest  Advertising  All information about companies and products are written in an objective and unbiased style  All article topics must be verifiable with independent  third party sources  so articles about very small  garage  or local companies are

runs affiliate programs  See also Wikipedia Notability  organizations and companies  for guidelines on corporate notability  Those promoting causes or events  or issuing public service announcements

articles about topics with many fansites  for example  including a link to one major fansite may be appropriate  See Wikipedia External links for some guidelines  Mere collections of internal links

rather providing a foundation for effective collaboration  Humorous pages that refer to Wikipedia in some way may be created in an appropriate namespace  however  File storage areas  Please upload only files that are used  or will be used  in encyclopedia articles or project pages  anything else will be deleted  If you have extra relevant images  consider uploading them to the Wikimedia Commons

orientation are unacceptable  However  you very well may make new friendships as you go about improving the encyclopedia  Memorials  Subjects of encyclopedia articles must satisfy Wikipedia s notability requirements  Wikipedia is not the place to memorialize deceased friends  relatives  acquaintances  or others who do not meet such requirements  Note that this policy does not apply outside of the main article space  While using user space to create a memorial is generally not acceptable  limited exemption applies to the user space of established Wikipedians who have died  At a minimum it is expected that they were regular contributors  and that more than one tenured Wikipedian will have used the deceased user s page  or an appropriate sub page  to add comments in the event  and after verification  of their death  If you are interested in using the wiki technology for a collaborative effort on something else  even if it is just a single page  there are many free and commercial sites that provide wiki hosting  You can also install wiki software on your server  See the installation guide at MediaWiki org for information on doing this  Scratchpad Wiki Labs also

NOTYELLOW WP NOTEVERYTHING WP NOTCHANGELOG Wikipedia encompasses many lists of links to articles within Wikipedia that are used for internal organization or to describe a notable subject  In that sense  Wikipedia functions as an index or directory of its own content  However  Wikipedia is not a directory of everything that exists in the world or has existed  Please see Wikipedia Alternative outlets for alternatives  Wikipedia articles are not  Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as  but not limited to  quotations  aphorisms  or persons  real or fictional   If you want to enter lists of quotations  put them into our sister project Wikiquote  Of course  there is nothing wrong with having lists if their entries are famous because they are associated with or significantly contribute to the list topic  Wikipedia also includes reference tables and tabular information for quick reference  Merged groups of small articles based on a core topic are certainly permitted   See Wikipedia Stand alone lists Appropriate topics for lists for clarification   Genealogical entries  Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame  achievement  or perhaps notoriety  One measure of these is whether someone has been featured in several external sources  on or off line   Less well known people may be mentioned within other articles  e g  Ronald Gay in History of violence against LGBT people in the United States   The White or Yellow Pages  Contact information such as phone numbers  fax numbers and email addresses are not encyclopedic  Directories  directory entries  electronic program guide  or a resource for conducting business  For example  an article on a radio station should not list upcoming events  current promotions  current schedules  et cetera  although mention of major events  promotions or historically significant programme lists and schedules may be acceptable  Likewise an article on a business should not contain a list of all the company s patent filings  Furthermore  the Talk pages associated with an article are for talking about the article  not for conducting the business of the topic of the article  Sales catalogs  Product prices should not be quoted in an article unless they can be sourced and there is a justified reason for their mention  In general  if mainstream media sources  not just product reviews  provide commentary on the price of an object instead of just passing mention  this is an indication that its price may have encyclopedic significance  Prices listed by individual vendors  on the other hand  can vary widely from place to place and over time  Wikipedia is not a price comparison service to be used to compare the prices of competing products  or the prices of a single product from different vendors  Changelogs or release notes  An article about a product should include a history of its development and major improvements  creating a list of all changes to software or hardware between each minor version violates other precepts of this policy  Non encyclopedic cross categorizations  such as  People from ethnic cultural religious group X employed by organization Y  or  Restaurants specializing in food type X in city Y   Cross categories like these are not considered sufficient basis to create an article  unless the intersection of those categories is in some way a culturally significant phenomenon  See also Wikipedia Overcategorization for this issue in categories  A complete exposition of all possible details  Rather  an article is a summary of accepted knowledge regarding its subject  3  Treat verifiable and sourced statements with appropriate weight   edit  Wikipedia is not a manual  guidebook  textbook  or scientific journal Policy shortcuts  WP

instruction manual  guidebook  or textbook  Wikipedia articles should not read like  Instruction manuals  While Wikipedia has descriptions of people  places and things  an article should not read like a  how to  style owners manual  advice column  legal  medical or otherwise  or suggestion box  This includes tutorials  walk throughs  instruction manuals  game guides  and recipes  4  If you are interested in a  how to  type of manual  you may want to look at wikiHow  How to Wiki or our sister project  Wikibooks  Travel guides  An article on Paris should mention landmarks  such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre  but not the telephone number or street address of your favorite hotel  nor the current price of a caf  au lait on the Champs  lys es  Wikipedia is not the place to recreate content more suited to entries in hotel or culinary guides  travelogues  and the like  Notable locations may meet the inclusion criteria  but the resulting articles need not include every tourist attraction  restaurant  hotel or venue  etc  Such details may be welcome at Wikitravel or Wikia travel instead  Video game guides  An article about a computer game or video game should summarize the main actions the player does to win the game  But avoid lists of gameplay weapons  items  or concepts  unless these are notable in their own right  such as the BFG9000 from the Doom series   Detailed coverage of specific point values  achievements  time limits  levels  types of enemies  character moves  character weight classes  and so on is also considered inappropriate  A concise summary is appropriate if it is essential to understanding the game or its significance in the industry  See WP VGSCOPE  Internet guides  Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature  appearance or services a website offers  but should also describe the site in an encyclopedic manner  offering detail on a website s achievements  impact or historical significance  which can be kept significantly more up to date than most reference sources  since editors can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known  See the Current events portal for examples  FAQs  Wikipedia articles should not list frequently asked questions  FAQs   Instead  format the information provided as neutral prose within the appropriate article s   Textbooks and annotated texts  Wikipedia is an encyclopedic reference  not a textbook  The purpose of Wikipedia is to present facts  not to teach subject matter  It is not appropriate to create or edit articles that read as textbooks  with leading questions and systematic problem solutions as examples  These belong on our sister projects  such as Wikibooks  Wikisource  and Wikiversity  Some kinds of examples  specifically those intended to inform rather than to instruct  may be appropriate for inclusion in a Wikipedia article  Scientific journals and research papers  A Wikipedia article should not be presented on the assumption that the reader is well versed in the topic s field  Introductory language in the lead and initial sections of the article should be written in plain terms and concepts that can be understood by any literate reader of Wikipedia without any knowledge in the given field before advancing to more detailed explanations of the topic  While wikilinks should be provided for advanced terms and concepts in that field  articles should be written on the assumption that the reader will not or cannot follow these links  instead attempting to infer their meaning from the text  Academic language  Texts should be written for everyday readers  not for academics  Article titles should reflect common usage  not academic terminology  whenever possible  Case studies  Many topics are based on the relationship of factor X to factor Y  resulting in one or more full articles  For example  this could refer to situation X in location Y  or version X of item Y  This is perfectly acceptable when the two variables put together represent some culturally significant phenomenon or some otherwise notable interest  Often  separate articles are needed for a subject within a range of different countries  due to substantial differences across international borders  articles such as  Slate industry in Wales  and  Island Fox  are fitting examples  Writing about  Oak trees in North Carolina  or a  Blue truck   however  would likely constitute a POV fork or original research  and would certainly not result in an encyclopedic article   edit  Wikipedia is not a crystal ball Policy shortcuts  WP BALL WP CBALL WP CRYSTAL WP FUTURE WP NOTCRYSTAL WP NOTCRYSTALBALL WP SPECULATION Wikipedia is not a collection of unverifiable speculation  All articles about anticipated events must be verifiable  and the subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred  It is appropriate to report discussion and arguments about the prospects for success of future proposals and projects or whether some development will occur  if discussion is properly referenced  It is not appropriate for editors to insert their own opinions or analyses  Predictions  speculation  forecasts and theories stated by reliable  expert sources or recognized entities in a field may be included  though editors should be aware of creating undue bias to any specific point of view  In forward looking articles about unreleased products  such as films and games  take special care to avoid advertising and unverified claims  for films  see WP NFF   In particular  Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place  Dates are not definite until the event actually takes place  If preparation for the event is not already in progress  speculation about it must be well documented  Examples of appropriate topics include the 2012 U S  presidential election and 2020 Summer Olympics  By comparison  the 2028 U S  presidential election and 2036 Summer Olympics are not appropriate article topics if nothing can be said about them that is verifiable and not original research  Avoid predicted sports team line ups  which are inherently unverifiable and speculative  A schedule of future events may be appropriate if it can be verified  As an exception  even highly speculative articles about events that may or may not occur far in the future might be appropriate  where coverage in reliable sources is sufficient  For example  Ultimate fate of the universe is an acceptable topic  Individual items from a predetermined list or a systematic pattern of names  pre assigned to future events or discoveries  are not suitable article topics  if only generic information is known about the item  Lists of tropical cyclone names is encyclopedic   Tropical Storm Alberto  2014   is not  even though it is virtually certain that a storm of that name will occur in the North Atlantic and will turn counterclockwise  Similarly  articles about words formed on a predictable numeric system  such as  septenquinquagintillion   are not encyclopedic unless they are defined on good authority  or genuinely in use  Certain scientific extrapolations are considered to be encyclopedic  such as chemical elements documented by IUPAC before isolation in the laboratory  Articles that present original research in the form of extrapolation  speculation  and  future history  are inappropriate  While scientific and cultural norms continually evolve  we must wait for this evolution to happen  rather than try to predict it  Of course  we do and should have articles about notable artistic works  essays  or credible research that embody predictions  An article on Weapons of Star Trek is appropriate  an article on  Weapons to be used in World War III  is not  While currently accepted scientific paradigms may later be rejected  and hypotheses previously held to be controversial or incorrect sometimes become accepted by the scientific community  it is not the place of Wikipedia to venture such projections  Wikipedia is not a collection of product announcements and rumors  While Wikipedia includes up to date knowledge about newly revealed products  short articles that consist only of product announcement information are not appropriate  Until such time that more encyclopedic knowledge about the product can be verified  product announcements should be merged to a larger topic  such as an article about the creator s   a series of products  or a previous product  if applicable  Speculation and rumor  even from reliable sources  are not appropriate encyclopedic content   edit  Wikipedia is not a newspaper Policy shortcuts  WP NOT NEWS WP NOTNEWSPAPER WP NOT NEWSPAPER WP NOT

Wikinews do exactly that  and are intended to be primary sources  Wikipedia does have many encyclopedia articles on topics of historical significance that are currently in the news  and can be updated with recently verified information  Wikipedia is also not written in news style  News reports  Wikipedia considers the enduring notability of persons and events  While news coverage can be useful source material for encyclopedic topics  most newsworthy events do not qualify for inclusion  For example  routine news reporting on things like announcements  sports  or celebrities is not a sufficient basis for inclusion in the encyclopedia  While including information on recent developments is sometimes appropriate  breaking news should not be emphasized or otherwise treated differently from other information  Timely news subjects not suitable for Wikipedia may be suitable for our sister project Wikinews  See also  Wikipedia Notability  events  Who s who  Even when an event is notable  individuals involved in it may not be  Unless news coverage of an individual goes beyond the context of a single event  our coverage of that individual should be limited to the article about that event  in proportion to their importance to the overall topic   See Wikipedia Biographies of living persons for more details   A diary  Even when an individual is notable  not all events he is involved in are  For example  news reporting about celebrities and sports figures can be very frequent and cover a lot of trivia  but using all these sources would lead to overdetailed articles that look like a diary  Not every match played  goal scored or hand shaken is notable enough to be included in the biography of a person   edit  Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information

Style  writing about fiction  Plot summaries  Similarly  articles on works of non fiction  including documentaries  research books and papers  religious texts  and the like  should contain more than a recap or summary of the works  contents  Lyrics databases  An article about a song should provide information about authorship  date of publication  social impact  and so on  Quotations from a song should be kept to a reasonable length relative to the rest of the article  and used to facilitate discussion  or to illustrate the style  the full text can be put on Wikisource and linked to from the article  Most song lyrics published after 1922 are protected by copyright  and any quotation of them must be kept to a minimum  and used for the purpose of direct commentary or to illustrate some aspect of the style  Never link to the lyrics of copyrighted songs unless the site linked to clearly has the right to distribute the work  See Wikipedia Do not include the full text of lengthy primary sources for full discussion  Excessive listings of statistics  Long and sprawling lists of statistics may be confusing to readers and reduce the readability and neatness of our articles  In addition  articles should contain sufficient explanatory text to put statistics within the article in their proper context for a general reader  In cases where this may be necessary   e g  Nationwide opinion polling for the United States presidential election  2008   consider using tables to enhance the readability of lengthy data lists  Where it is not necessary  as in the main article United States

readers consider objectionable or offensive  even exceedingly so  see Wikipedia Content disclaimer   Wikipedia cannot guarantee that articles or images will always be acceptable to all readers  or that they will adhere to general social or religious norms  Since anyone can edit an article and most changes made are displayed immediately  inappropriate material may appear before it can be removed  Content which is obviously inappropriate  such as an irrelevant link to a shock site  or clear vandalism  is usually removed quickly  Content that is judged to violate Wikipedia s biographies of living persons policy  or that violates other Wikipedia policies  especially neutral point of view  or the laws of the U S  state of Florida where Wikipedia s main servers are hosted  will also be removed  However  some articles may include text  images  or links which some people may find objectionable  when these materials are relevant to the content  Discussion of potentially objectionable content should not focus on its offensiveness but on whether it is appropriate to include in a given article  Beyond that   being objectionable  is generally not sufficient grounds for removal or inclusion of content  Wikipedia will not remove content because of the internal bylaws of some organizations that forbid information about the organization to be displayed online  Any rules that forbid members of a given organization  fraternity  or religion to show a name or image do not apply to Wikipedia because Wikipedia is not a member of those organizations   edit  Community The above

access level  see WP CRAT  While Wikipedia has many elements of a bureaucracy  5  it is not governed by statute  it is not a moot court  and rules are not the purpose of the community  Written rules do not themselves set accepted practice  Rather  they document already existing community consensus regarding what should be accepted and what should be rejected  When instruction creep is found to have occurred  it should be removed  While Wikipedia s written policies and guidelines should be taken seriously  they can be misused  Do not follow an overly strict interpretation of the letter of policy without consideration for the principles of policies  If the rules truly prevent you from improving the encyclopedia  ignore them  Disagreements are resolved through consensus based discussion

also  Wikipedia Wikipedia is not about winning Wikipedia is not a place to hold grudges  import personal conflicts  carry on ideological battles  or nurture prejudice  hatred  or fear  Making personal battles out of Wikipedia discussions goes directly against our policies and goals  In addition to avoiding battles in discussions  do not make changes to content or policies just to prove a point to someone with whom you disagree  Every user is expected to interact with others civilly  calmly  and in a spirit of cooperation  Do not insult  harass  or intimidate those with whom you have a disagreement  Rather  approach the matter intelligently and engage in polite discussion  If another user behaves in an uncivil  uncooperative  or insulting manner  or even tries to harass or intimidate you  this does not give you an excuse to respond in kind  Address only the factual points brought forward  ignoring the inappropriate comments  or disregard that user entirely  If necessary  point out gently that you think the comments might be considered uncivil  and make it clear that you want to move on and focus on the content issue  If a conflict continues to bother you  take advantage of Wikipedia s dispute resolution process  There are always users willing to mediate and arbitrate disputes between others  In large disputes  resist the urge to turn Wikipedia into a battleground between factions  Assume good faith that every editor and group is here to improve Wikipedia especially if they hold a point of view with which you disagree  Work with whomever you like  but do not organize a faction with the main goal of disrupting Wikipedia s fundamental decision making process  which is based on building a consensus  Editors in large disputes should work in good faith to find broad principles of agreement between different viewpoints  Do not use Wikipedia to make legal or other threats against Wikipedia  Wikipedians  or the Wikimedia Foundation other means already exist to communicate legal problems  6  Threats are not tolerated and may result in a ban   edit  Wikipedia is not compulsory Policy shortcuts  WP CHOICE WP NOTCOMPULSORY WP REQUIRED Wikipedia is a volunteer community  and does not require the Wikipedians to give any more time and effort than they wish  Focus on improving the encyclopedia itself  rather than demanding more from other

reason that the idea is terrible   edit  When you wonder what to do Policy shortcut  WP WHATISTOBEDONE When you wonder what should or should not be in an article  ask yourself what a reader would
