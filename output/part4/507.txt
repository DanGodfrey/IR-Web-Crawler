purpose of engaging in illegal activity  most commonly for monetary profit  Some criminal organizations  such as terrorist organizations  are politically motivated  Sometimes criminal organizations force people to do business with them  as when a gang extorts money from shopkeepers for  protection   1 Gangs may become  disciplined  enough to be considered  organized   An organized gang or criminal set can also be referred to as a mob  2  Mafia is a term used to describe a number of criminal organizations around the world  The first organization to bear the label was the Sicilian Mafia based in Sicily  known to its members as Cosa Nostra  In the United States   the Mafia  generally refers to the Italian American Mafia  Other high level organized crime groups such as the American prison gang the Mexican Mafia use the term  Mafia  to describe their group  Latin American drug cartels are often considered Hispanic or Latino Mafias  Other international organizations described as mafias include the Russian Mafia  the Albanian Mafia  the Irish Mob  the Chinese Triads  the Japanese Yakuza  the Neapolitan Camorra  Calabrian  Ndrangheta  and the Apulian Sacra Corona Unita  There are also a number of localized mafia organizations around the world bearing no link to any specific ethnic background  citation needed  In the United States the Organized Crime Control Act  1970  defines organized crime as  The unlawful activities of       a highly organized  disciplined association         3  Criminal activity as a structured group is referred to as racketeering and such crime is commonly referred to as the work of the Mob  In the UK  police estimate organized crime involves up to 38 000 people operating in 6 000 various groups  4  In addition  due to the escalating violence of Mexico s drug war  the Mexican drug cartels are considered the  greatest organized crime threat to the United States   according to a report issued by the United States Department of Justice  5  Contents 1 Models of organized crime 1 1 Causal 1 2 Organisational 1 2 1 Patron client networks 1 2 2 Bureaucratic corporate operations 1 2 3 Youth and street gangs 1 3 Individual

See also 8 Footnotes 9 External links  edit  Models of organized crime  edit  Causal The demand for illegal goods and services nurtures the emergence of ever more centralized and powerful criminal syndicates  who may ultimately succeed in undermining public morals  neutralizing law enforcement through corruption and infiltrating the legal economy unless appropriate countermeasures are taken  This theoretical proposition can be depicted in a model comprising four elements  government  society  illegal markets and organized crime  6  While interrelations are acknowledged in both directions between the model elements  in the last instance the purpose is to explain variations in the power and reach of organized crime in the sense of an ultimately unified organizational entity  7  8   edit  Organisational  edit  Patron client networks Patron client networks are defined by the fluid criminal interactions they produce  Organised crime groups operate as smaller units within the overall network  and as such tend towards valuing significant others  familiarity of social and economic environments  or tradition  These networks are usually composed of  Hierarchies based on  naturally  forming family  social and cultural traditions   Tight knit  locus of activity labour  Fraternal or nepotistic value systems  Personalised activity  including family rivalries  territorial disputes  recruitment and training of family members  etc   Entrenched belief systems  reliance of tradition  including religion  family values  cultural expectations  class politics  gender roles  etc    and  Communication and rule enforcement mechanisms dependent on organisational structure  social etiquette  history of criminal involvement  and collective decision making  9  10  11  12  13  Perhaps the best known patron client networks are the Sicilian and Italian American Cosa Nostra  most commonly known as the Sicilian Mafia  The Neopolitan Camorra  the Calabrian and Italian Canadian  Ndrangheta  and the Apulian Sacra Corona Unita are similar Italian organized crime groups  Other organized enterprises include the Russian mafia  Irish mob  Chinese Triads  and the Japanese Yakuza   edit  Bureaucratic corporate operations Bureaucratic corporate organised crime groups are defined by the general rigidity of their internal structures  Focusing more on how the operations works  succeeds  sustains itself or avoids retribution  they are generally typified by  A complex authority structure  An extensive division of labour between classes within the organisation  Meritocratic  as opposed to cultural or social attributes   Responsibilities carried out in an impersonal manner  Extensive written rules regulations  as opposed to cultural praxis dictating action   and   Top down  communication and rule enforcement mechanisms  However  this model of operation has some flaws  The  top down  communication strategy is susceptible to interception  more so further down the hierarchy being communicated to  Maintaining written records jeopardises the security of the organisation and relies on increased security measures  Infiltration at lower levels in the hierarchy can jeopardise the entire organisation  a  house of cards  effect   and  Death  injury  incarceration or internal power struggles dramatically heighten the insecurity of operations  Whilst bureaucratic operations emphasis business processes and strongly authoritarian hierarchies  these are based on enforcing power relationships rather than an overlying aim of protectionism  sustainability or growth  14  15  16  17   edit  Youth and street gangs Main article  Gang A distinctive gang culture underpins many  but not all  organised groups  18  19  this may develop through recruiting strategies  social learning processes in the corrective system experienced by youth  family or peer involvement in crime  and the coercive actions of criminal authority figures  The term  street gang  is commonly used interchangeably with  youth gang   referring to neighborhood or street based youth groups that meet  gang  criteria  Miller  1992  defines a street gang as  a self formed association of peers  united by mutual interests  with identifiable leadership and internal organization  who act collectively or as individuals to achieve specific purposes  including the conduct of illegal activity and control of a particular territory  facility  or enterprise   20   Zones of transition  refer to deteriorating neighbourhoods with shifting populations 21  22    conflict between groups  fighting   turf wars   and theft promotes solidarity and cohesion  23  Cohen  1955   working class teenagers joined gangs due to frustration of inability to achieve status and goals of the middle class  Cloward and Ohlin  1960   blocked opportunity  but unequal distribution of opportunities lead to creating different types of gangs  that is  some focused on robbery and property theft  some on fighting and conflict and some were retreatists focusing on drug taking   Spergel  1966  was one of the first criminologists to focus on  evidence based practice  rather than intuition into gang life and culture  Klein  1971  like Spergel studied the effects on members of social workers  interventions  More interventions actually lead to greater gang participation and solidarity and bonds between members  Downes and Rock  1988  on Parker s analysis  strain theory applies  labelling theory  from experience with police and courts   control theory  involvement in trouble from early childhood and the eventual decision that the costs outweigh the benefits  and conflict theories  No ethnic group is more disposed to gang involvement than another  rather it is the status of being marginalised  alienated or rejected that makes some groups more vulnerable to gang formation  24  25  26  and this would also be accounted for in the effect of social exclusion  27  28  especially in terms of recruitment and retention  These may also be defined by age  typically youth  or peer group influences  29  and the permanence or consistency of their criminal activity  These groups also form their own symbolic identity or public representation which are recognisable by the community at large  include colours  symbols  patches  flags and tattoos   Research has focused on whether the gangs have formal structures  clear hierarchies and leadership in comparison with adult groups  and whether they are rational in pursuit of their goals  though positions on structures  hierarchies and defined roles are conflicting  Some studied street gangs involved in drug dealing   finding that their structure and behaviour had a degree of organisational rationality  30  Members saw themselves as organised criminals  gangs were formal rational organisations  31  32  33  Strong organisational structures  well defined roles and rules that guided members  behaviour  Also a specified and regular means of income  i e  drugs   Padilla  1992  agreed with the two above  However some have found these to be loose rather than well defined and lacking persistent focus  there was relatively low cohesion   few shared goals and little organisational structure  25  Shared norms  value and loyalties were low  structures  chaotic   little role differentiation or clear distribution of labour  Similarly  the use of violence does not conform to the principles behind protection rackets  political intimidation and drug trafficking activities employed by those adult groups  In many cases gang members graduate from youth gangs to highly developed OC groups  with some already in contact with such syndicates and through this we see a greater propensity for imitation  Gangs and traditional criminal organisations cannot be universally linked  Decker  1998   34  35  however there there are clear benefits to both the adult and youth organisation through their association  In terms of structure  no single crime group is archetypal  though in most cases there are well defined patterns of vertical integration  where criminal groups attempt to control the supply and demand   as is the case in arms  sex and drug trafficking   edit  Individual difference  edit  Entrepreneurial The entrepreneurial model looks at either the individual criminal  or a smaller group of organised criminals  that capitalise off the more fluid  group association  of contemporary organised crime  36  This model conforms to social learning theory or differential association in that there are clear associations and interaction between criminals where knowledge may be shared  or values enforced  however it is argued that rational choice is not represented in this  The choice to commit a certain act  or associate with other organised crime groups  may be seen as much more of an entrepreneurial decision   contributing to the continuation of a criminal enterprise  by maximising those aspects that protect or support their own individual gain  In this context  the role of risk is also easily understandable  37  38  however it is debatable whether the underlying motivation should be seen as true entrepreneurship 39  or entrepreneurship as a product of some social disadvantage  The criminal organisation  much in the same way as assessing pleasure or pain  weighs up factors like legal  social and economic risk to determine potential profit and loss from certain criminal activities  This decision making process is constructed from the entrepreneurial nature of its members  their motivations and the environments they work within  Opportunism is also a key factor   the organised criminal or criminal group is likely to fluidly change the criminal associates they have  the types of crime they perpetrates  and how they functions in the public  recruitment  reputation  etc   in order to ensure efficiency  capitalisation or protection of their interests  40   edit  Multimodel approach Culture and ethnicity provide an environment where trust and communication between criminals can be efficient and secure  This may ultimately lead to a competitive advantage for some groups  however it is inaccurate to adopt this as the only determinant of classification in organised crime  This categorisation includes the Sicilian Mafia  Jamaican posses  Colombian drug trafficking groups  Nigerian organised crime groups  Japanese Yakuza  or Boryokudan   Korean criminal groups and ethnic Chinese criminal groups  Under this perspective  organised crime is not a modern phenomenon   the construction of 17th and 18th century crime gangs fulfil all the present day criteria of criminal organisations  in clear opposition to the Alien Conspiracy Theory   These roamed the rural borderlands of central Europe embarking on many of the same illegal activities associated with today s crime organisations  with the exception of money laundering  When the French revolution created strong nation states  the criminal gangs moved to other poorly controlled regions like the Balkans and Southern Italy  where the seeds were sown for the Sicilian Mafia   the lynchpin of organised crime in the New World  41

extortion or theft and fraud activities like hijacking cargo trucks  robbing goods  committing bankruptcy fraud  also known as  bust out    insurance fraud or stock fraud  inside trading   Organized crime groups also victimize individuals by car theft  either for dismantling at  chop shops  or for export   art theft  bank robbery  burglary  jewelry theft  computer hacking  credit card fraud  economic espionage  embezzlement  identity theft  and securities fraud   pump and dump  scam   Some organized crime groups defraud national  state  or local governments by bid rigging public projects  counterfeiting money  smuggling or manufacturing untaxed alcohol  bootlegging  or cigarettes  buttlegging   and providing immigrant workers to avoid taxes  Organized crime groups seek out corrupt public officials in executive  law enforcement  and judicial roles so that their activities can avoid  or at least receive early warnings about  investigation and prosecution  Organized crime groups also provide a range of illegal services and goods  such as loansharking of money at very high interest rates  assassination  blackmailing  bombings  bookmaking and illegal gambling  confidence tricks  copyright infringement  counterfeiting of intellectual property  kidnapping  prostitution  drug trafficking  arms trafficking  oil smuggling  organ trafficking  contract killing  identity document forgery  illegal dumping of toxic waste  illegal trading of nuclear materials  military equipment smuggling  nuclear weapons smuggling  passport fraud  providing illegal immigration and cheap labor  people smuggling  trading in endangered species  and trafficking in human beings  Organized crime groups also do a range of business and labour racketeering activities  such as skimming casinos  insider trading  setting up monopolies in industries such as garbage collecting  construction and cement pouring  bid rigging  getting  no show  and  no work  jobs  money laundering  political corruption and bullying   edit  Violence  edit  Assault The commission of violent crime may form part of a criminal organisations  tools  used to achieve criminogenic goals  for example  its threatening  authoritative  coercive  terror inducing  or rebellious role   due to psychosocial factors  cultural conflict  aggression  rebellion against authority  access to illicit substances  counter cultural dynamic   or may  in and of itself  be crime rationally chosen by individual criminals and the groups they form  Assaults are used for coercive measures  to  rough up  debtors  competition or recruits  in the commission of robberies  in connection to other property offences  and as an expression of counter cultural authority  42  violence is normalised within criminal organisations  in direct opposition to mainstream society  and the locations they control  43  Whilst the intensity of violence is dependent on the types of crime the organisation is involved in  as well as their organisational structure or cultural tradition  aggressive acts range on a spectrum from low grade physical assaults to murder  Bodily harm and grievous bodily harm  within the context of organised crime  must be understood as indicators of intense social and cultural conflict  motivations contrary to the security of the public  and other psychosocial factors  44   edit  Murder Murder has evolved from the honour and vengeance killings of the Yakuza or Sicilian mafia 45  46  47  48  which placed large physical and symbolic importance on the act of murder  its purposes and consequences  49  50  to a much less discriminate form of expressing power  enforcing criminal authority  achieving retribution or eliminating competition  The role of the hitman has been generally consistent throughout the history of organised crime  whether that be due to the efficiency or expediency of hiring a professional assassin or the need to distance oneself from the commission of murderous acts  making it harder to prove liability   This may include the assassination of notable figures  public  private or criminal   once again dependent on authority  retribution or competition  Revenge killings  armed robberies  violent disputes over controlled territories and offences against members of the public must also be considered when looking at the dynamic between different criminal organisations and their  at times  conflicting needs   edit  Ideological crime Main article  Terrorism In addition to what is considered traditional organized crime involving direct crimes of fraud swindles  scams  racketeering and other Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  RICO  predicate acts motivated for the accumulation of monetary gain  there is also non traditional organized crime which is engaged in for political or ideological gain or acceptance  Such crime groups are often labeled terrorist organizations There is no universally agreed  legally binding  criminal law definition of terrorism  51  52  Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts which are intended to create fear  terror   are perpetrated for a religious  political or ideological goal  deliberately target or disregard the safety of non combatants  civilians   and are committed by non government agencies  citation needed  Some definitions also include acts of unlawful violence and war  especially crimes against humanity  See The Nuremberg Trials   The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group  Notable groups include Al Qaeda  Animal Liberation Front  Army of God  Black Liberation Army  The Covenant  The Sword  and the Arm of the Lord  Earth Liberation Front  Hamas  Hezbollah  Kurdistan Workers  Party  Lashkar e Toiba  May 19th Communist Organization  The Order

This is of little use to them unless they can disguise it and convert it into funds that are available for investment into legitimate enterprise  The methods they use for converting its  dirty  money into  clean  assets encourages corruption  OC groups need to hide the money s illegal origin  It allows for the expansion of OC groups  as the  laundry  or  wash cycle  operates to cover the money trail and convert proceeds of crime into usable assets  ML is bad for international and domestic trade  banking reputations and for effective governments and rule of law  Estimated figures of money laundering were between  200    600 billion per year throughout the 1990s  US Congress Office 1995  Robinson 1996   In 2002 this was estimated between  500 billion to  1 trillion per year  UN 2002   This would make organised crime the third largest business in world after foreign exchange and oil  Robinson 1996   The rapid growth of money laundering is due to  the scale of OC precluding it from being a cash business   groups have little option but to convert its proceeds into legitimate funds and do so by investment  by developing legitimate businesses and purchasing property  globalisation of communications and commerce   technology has made rapid transfer of funds across international borders much easier  with groups continuously changing techniques to avoid investigation  and  a lack of effective financial regulation in parts of the global economy  Money Laundering is a three stage process  Placement   also called immersion  groups  smurf  small amounts at a time to avoid suspicion  physical disposal of money by moving crime funds into the legitimate financial system  may involve bank complicity  mixing licit and illicit funds  cash purchases and smuggling currency to safe havens  Layering  disguises the trail to foil pursuit  Also called  heavy soaping   It involves creating false paper trails  converting cash into assets by cash purchases  Integration   also called  spin dry   Making it into clean taxable income by real estate transactions  sham loans  foreign bank complicy and false import and export transactions  Means of money laundering  Money transmitters  black money markets purchasing goods  gambling  increasing the complexity of the money trail  Underground banking  flying money   involves clandestine  bankers  around the world  It often involves otherwise legitimate banks and professionals  The policy aim in this area is to make the financial markets transparent  and minimise the circulation of criminal money and its cost upon legitimate markets  53  54  Remittance services 55  In addition to ordinary banking  however  money and other forms of value can be transferred through the use of so called  remittance services  which have operated for hundreds of years in non Western societies  Originating in southeast Asia and India  users of these systems transfer funds through the use of agents who enter into agreements with each other to receive money from people in one country  such as overseas workers  and to pay money to specified relatives or friends in other countries without having to rely on conventional banking arrangements  Funds can be moved quickly  cheaply and securely between locations that often don t have established banking networks or modern forms of electronic funds transfers available  Because such systems operate outside conventional banking systems  they are known as  alternative remittance    underground  or  parallel banking  systems  They are invariably legitimate and legal in many countries  although concerns have arisen in recent years that they could be used to circumvent anti money laundering and counter terrorism financing controls that now operate across the global financial services sector  Particular risks arise from the irregular forms of record keeping which are often employed and the possibility that the laws of those countries in which they operate may not be fully complied with   Alternative remittance  is only one of a number of terms used to describe the practice of transferring value  including money  from one country to another  It is generally used where value is sent through  informal  channels  as distinct from conventional banks  Terms used in other jurisdictions include hundi  hawala  poe kuan  informal funds transfer  underground banking  parallel banking  informal funds transfer and money value transfer  The remittance system pre dates modern banking and arose in various locations including China  southeast Asia and the Middle East where there was a need to move value without taking the risk of physically moving money itself  At its most basic  a remittance service involves a sender  a beneficiary and two intermediaries  The sender wishes to send a remittance to the beneficiary  often in the country of origin where the sender previously resided   edit  Counterfeiting Main article  Counterfeiting In 2007  the OECD reported the scope of counterfeit products to include food  pharmaceuticals  pesticides  electrical components  tobacco and even household cleaning products in addition to the usual films  music  literature  games and other electrical appliances  software and fashion  56  A number of qualitative changes in the trade of counterfeit products  a large increase in fake goods which are dangerous to health and safety  most products repossessed by authorities are now household items rather than luxury goods  a growing number of technological products  and  production is now operated on an industrial scale  57   edit  Tax evasion Main article  Tax evasion The economic effects of organised crime have been approached from a number of both theoretical and empirical positions  however the nature of such activity allows for misrepresentation  58  59  60  61  62  63  The level of taxation taken by a nation state  rates of unemployment  mean household incomes and level of satisfaction with government and other economic factors all contribute to the likelihood of criminals to participate in tax evasion  59  As most organised crime is perpetrated in the liminal state between legitimate and illegitimate markets  these economic factors must adjusted to ensure the optimal amount of taxation without promoting the practice of tax evasion  64  As with any other crime  technological advancements have made the commission of tax evasion easier  faster and more globalised  The ability for organised criminals to operate fraudulent financial accounts  utilise illicit offshore bank accounts  access tax havens or tax shelters  65  and operating goods smuggling synidactes to evade importation taxes help ensure financial sustainability  security from law enforcement  general anonymity and the continuation of their operations   edit  Cybercrime Main article  Cybercrime  edit  Internet fraud Main articles  Identity theft and internet fraud Identity theft is a form of fraud or cheating of another person s identity in which someone pretends to be someone else by assuming that person s identity  typically in order to access resources or obtain credit and other benefits in that person s name  Victims of identity theft  those whose identity has been assumed by the identity thief  can suffer adverse consequences if held accountable for the perpetrator s actions  as can organizations and individuals who are defrauded by the identity thief  and to that extent are also victims  Internet fraud refers to the actual use of Internet services to present fraudulent solicitations to prospective victims  to conduct fraudulent transactions  or to transmit the proceeds of fraud to financial institutions or to others connected with the scheme  In the context of organised crime  both may serve as means through which other criminal activity may be successfully perpetrated or as the primary goal themselves  Email fraud  advance fee fraud  romance scams  employment scams  and other phishing scams are the most common and most widely used forms of identity theft  66  though with the advent of social networking fake websites  accounts and other fraudulent or deceitful activity has become commonplace   edit  Copyright infringement Main article  Copyright infringement Copyright infringement is the unauthorized or prohibited use of works under copyright  infringing the copyright holder s exclusive rights  such as the right to reproduce or perform the copyrighted work  or to make derivative works  Whilst almost universally considered under civil procedure  the impact and intent of organised criminal operations in this area of crime has been the subject of much debate  Article 61 of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPs  requires that signatory countries establish criminal procedures and penalties in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale  More recently copyright holders have demanded that states provide criminal sanctions for all types of copyright infringement  67  Organised criminal groups capitalise on consumer complicity  advancements in security and anonymity technology  emerging markets and new methods of product transmission  and the consistent nature of these provides a stable financial basis for other areas of organised crime   edit  Cyberwarfare Main article  Cyberwarfare Further information  Titan Rain and Moonlight Maze Cyberwarfare refers to politically motivated hacking to conduct sabotage and espionage  It is a form of information warfare sometimes seen as analogous to conventional warfare 68  although this analogy is controversial for both its accuracy and its political motivation  It has been defined as activities by a nation state to penetrate another nation s computers or networks with the intention of causing civil damage or disruption  69  Moreover it acts as the  fifth domain of warfare   70  and William J  Lynn  U S  Deputy Secretary of Defense  states that  as a doctrinal matter  the Pentagon has formally recognized cyberspace as a new domain in warfare        which  has become just as critical to military operations as land  sea  air  and space   71  Cyber espionage is the practice of obtaining confidential  sensitive  proprietary or classified information from individuals  competitors  groups  or governments using illegal exploitation methods on internet  networks  software and or computers  There is also a clear military  political  or economic motivation  Unsecured information may be intercepted and modified  making espionage possible internationally  The recently established Cyber Command is currently debating whether such activities as commercial espionage or theft of intellectual property are criminal activities or actual  breaches of national security   72  Furtermore  military activities that use computers and satellites for coordination are at risk of equipment disruption  Orders and communications can be intercepted or replaced  Power  water  fuel  communications  and transportation infrastructure all may be vulnerable to sabotage  According to Clarke  the civilian realm is also at risk  noting that the security breaches have already gone beyond stolen credit card numbers  and that potential targets can also include the electric power grid  trains  or the stock market  72   edit  Computer viruses Main articles  Computer virus and denial of service attack Further information  Stuxnet The term  computer virus  may be used as an overarching phrase to include all types of true viruses  malware  including computer worms  Trojan horses  most rootkits  spyware  dishonest adware and other malicious and unwanted software  though all are technically unique   73  and proves to be quite financially lucrative for criminal organisations  74  offering greater opportunities for fraud and extortion whilst increasing security  secrecy and anonymity  75  Worms may be utilised by organised crime groups to exploit security vulnerabilities  duplicating itself automatically across other computers a given network   76  while a Trojan horse is a program that appears harmless but hides malicious functions  such as retrieval of stored confidential data  corruption of information  or interception of transmissions   Worms and Trojan horses  like viruses  may harm a computer system s data or performance  Applying the Internet model of organised crime  the proliferation of computer viruses and other malicious software promotes a sense of detachment between the perpetrator  whether that be the criminal organisation or another individual  and the victim  this may help to explain vast increases in cyber crime such as these for the purpose of ideological crime or terrorism  77  In mid July 2010  security experts discovered a malicious software program that had infiltrated factory computers and had spread to plants around the world  It is considered  the first attack on critical industrial infrastructure that sits at the foundation of modern economies   notes the New York Times  78   edit  White collar crime and corruption This article needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   June 2011  Main articles  White collar crime and corruption  edit  Political corruption Main article  Political corruption Political corruption is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain  Misuse of government power for other purposes  such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality  is not considered political corruption  Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government  An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties  Forms of corruption vary  but include bribery  extortion  cronyism  nepotism  patronage  graft  and embezzlement  While corruption may facilitate criminal enterprise such as drug trafficking  money laundering  and human trafficking  it is not restricted to these activities  The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction  For instance  certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another  In some cases  government officials have broad or poorly defined powers  which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions  Worldwide  bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually  79  A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a kleptocracy  literally meaning  rule by thieves    edit  Corporate crime Main article  Corporate crime Corporate crime refers to crimes committed either by a corporation  i e   a business entity having a separate legal personality from the natural persons that manage its activities   or by individuals that may be identified with a corporation or other business entity  see vicarious liability and corporate liability   Note that some forms of corporate corruption may not actually be criminal if they are not specifically illegal under a given system of laws  For example  some jurisdictions allow insider trading   edit  Drug trafficking Heroin  Source countries   production  three major regions known as the golden triangle  Burma  Laos  Thailand   golden crescent  Afghanistan  and Central and South America  There are suggestions that due to the continuing decline in opium production in South East Asia  traffickers may begin to look to Afghanistan as a source of heroin   80   edit  Human trafficking  edit  Sex trafficking Human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is a major cause of contemporary sexual slavery and is primarily for prostituting women and children into sex industries  81  Sexual slavery encompasses most  if not all  forms of forced prostitution  82  The terms  forced prostitution  or  enforced prostitution  appear in international and humanitarian conventions but have been insufficiently understood and inconsistently applied   Forced prostitution  generally refers to conditions of control over a person who is coerced by another to engage in sexual activity  83  Official numbers of individuals in sexual slavery worldwide vary  In 2001 International Organization for Migration estimated 400 000  the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimated 700 000 and UNICEF estimated 1 75 million  84  The most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are Thailand  Japan  Israel  Belgium  the Netherlands  Germany  Italy  Turkey and the United States  according to a report by UNODC  85   edit  Illegal Immigration and People smuggling   Migrant Trafficking   See Snakehead  gang   Coyotaje People smuggling is defined as  the facilitation  transportation  attempted transportation or illegal entry of a person or persons across an international border  in violation of one or more countries laws  either clandestinely or through deception  such as the use of fraudulent documents   86  The term is understood as and often used interchangeably with migrant smuggling  which is defined by the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime as     the procurement  in order to obtain  directly or indirectly  a financial or other material benefit  of the illegal entry of a person into a state party of which the person is not a national   87  This practice has increased over the past few decades and today now accounts for a significant portion of illegal immigration in countries around the world  People smuggling generally takes place with the consent of the person or persons being smuggled  and common reasons for individuals seeking to be smuggled include employment and economic opportunity  personal and or familial betterment  and escape from persecution or conflict   edit  Contemporary slavery and unfree labour   Labour Racketeering   The number of slaves today remains as high as 12 million 88  to 27 million  89  90  91  though this is probably the smallest proportion of the world s population in history  92  Most are debt slaves  largely in South Asia  who are under debt bondage incurred by lenders  sometimes even for generations  93  It is the fastest growing criminal industry and is predicted to eventually outgrow drug trafficking  81  94  Labour racketeering has developed since the 1930s  effecting national and international construction  mining  energy production and transportation 95  sectors immensely  96  Activity has focused on the importation of cheap or unfree labour  involvement with union and public officials  political corruption   and counterfeiting  97   edit  Historical origins  edit  Pre Nineteenth Century Today  crime is sometimes thought of as an urban phenomenon  but for most of human history it was the rural interfaces that encountered the majority of crime   Keep in mind  for most of human history  rural areas were the vast majority of inhabited places   For the most part within a village members kept crime at very low rates  however outsiders  such as Pirates  highwaymen and bandits attacked trade routes and roads  at times severely disrupting commerce  raising costs  insurance rates and prices to the consumer  According to criminologist Paul Lunde   Piracy and banditry were to the pre industrial world what organized crime is to modern society   98     If we take a global rather than strictly domestic view  it becomes evident even crime of the organized kind has a long if not necessarily noble heritage  The word  thug  dates to early 13th century India  when Thugs  or gangs of criminals  roamed from town to town  looting and pillaging  Smuggling and drug trafficking rings are as old as the hills in Asia and Africa  and extant criminal organizations in Italy and Japan trace their histories back several centuries     99    As Lunde states   Barbarian conquerors  whether Vandals  Goths  Norsemen  Turks or Mongols are not normally thought of as organized crime groups  yet they share many features associated with thriving criminal organizations  They were for the most part non ideological  predominantly ethnically based  used violence and intimidation  and adhered to their own codes of law   98  Terrorism is linked to organized crime  but has political aims rather than solely financial ones  so there is overlap but separation between terrorism and organized crime   edit  Twentieth Century Cressey s Cosa Nostra model studied Mafia families exclusively and this limits his broader findings  Structures are formal and rational with allocated tasks  limits on entrance  and influence the rules established for organisational maintenance and sustainability  7  8  In this context there is a difference between organised and professional crime  there is well defined hierarchy of roles for leaders and members  underlying rules and specific goals that determine their behavior  and these are formed as a social system  one that was rationally designed to maximize profits and to provide forbidden goods  Albini saw organised criminal behaviour as consisting of networks of patrons and clients  rather than rational hierarchies or secret societies  9  10  11  The networks are characterised by a loose system of power relations  Each participant is interested in furthering his own welfare  Criminal entrepreneurs are the patrons and they exchange information with their clients in order to obtain their support  Clients include members of gangs  local and national politicians  government officials and people engaged in legitimate business  People in the network may not directly be part of the core criminal organization  Furthering the approach of both Cressey and Albini  Ianni and Ianni studied Italian American crime syndicates in New York and other cities  100  101  Kinship is seen as the basis of organised crime rather than the structures Cressey had identified  this includes fictive godparental and affinitive ties as well as those based on blood relations  and it is the impersonal actions  not the status or affiliations of their members  that define the group  Rules of conduct and behavioural aspects of power and networks and roles include the following  family operates as a social unit  with social and business functions merged  leadership positions down to middle management are kinship based  the higher the position  the closer the kinship relationship  group assigns leadership positions to a central group of family members  including fictive godparental relationship reinforcement  the leadership group are assigned to legal or illegal enterprises  but not both  and  transfer of money  from legal and illegal business  and back to illegal business is by individuals  not companies  Strong family ties are derived from the traditions of southern Italy  where family rather than the church or state is the basis of social order and morality   edit  The  disorganized crime  and choice theses One of the most important trends to emerge in criminological thinking about OC in recent years is the suggestion that it is not  in a formal sense   organized  at all  Evidence includes  lack of centralized control  absence of formal lines of communication  fragmented organizational structure  It is distinctively disorganized  For example  Seattle s crime network in the 1970s and 80s consisted of groups of businessmen  politicians and of law enforcement officers  They all had links to a national network via Meyer Lansky  who was powerful  but there was no evidence that Lansky or anyone else exercised centralized control over them  102  While some crime involved well known criminal hierarchies in the city  criminal activity was not subject to central management by these hierarchies nor by other controlling groups  nor were activities limited to a finite number of objectives  The networks of criminals involved with the crimes did not exhibit organizational cohesion  Too much emphasis had been placed on the Mafia as controlling OC  The Mafia were certainly powerful but they  were part of a heterogeneous underworld  a network characterized by complex webs of relationships   OC groups were violent and aimed at making money but because of the lack of structure and fragmentation of objectives  they were  disorganised   103  104  Further studies showed neither bureaucracy nor kinship groups are the primary structure of organized crime  rather they were in partnerships or a series of joint business ventures  105  106  Despite these conclusions  all researchers observed a degree of managerial activities among the groups they studied  All observed networks and a degree of persistence  and there may be utility in focusing on the identification of orgainising roles of people and events rather than the group s structure  107  108  There may be three main approaches to understand the organisations in terms of their roles as social systems  109  organisations as rational systems  Highly formalized structures in terms of bureaucracy s and hierarchy  with formal systems of rules regarding authority and highly specific goals  organisations as natural systems  Participants may regard the organization as an end in itself  not merely a means to some other end  Promoting group values to maintain solidarity is high on the agenda  They do not rely on profit maximization  Their perversity and violence in respect of relationships is often remarkable  but they are characterized by their focus on the connections between their members  their associates and their victims  and  organisations open systems  High levels of interdependence between themselves and the environment in which they operate  There is no one way in which they are organized or how they operate  They are adaptable and change to meet the demands of their changing environments and circumstances  Organised crime groups may be a combination of all three   edit  International governance approach International consensus on defining organized crime has become important since the 1970s due its increased prevalence and impact  e g  UN in 1976 and EU 1998  OC is   the large scale and complex criminal activity carried on by groups of persons  however loosely or tightly organized for the enrichment of those participating at the expense of the community and its members  It is frequently accomplished through ruthless disregard of any law  including offences against the person and frequently in connexion with political corruption    UN   A criminal organization shall mean a lasting  structured association of two or more persons  acting in concert with a view to committing crimes or other offences which are punishable by deprivation of liberty or a detention order of a maximum of at least four years or a more serious penalty  whether such crimes or offences are an end in themselves or a means of obtaining material benefits and  if necessary  of improperly influencing the operation of public authorities    UE  Not all groups exhibit the same characteristics of structure  However  violence and corruption and the pursuit of multiple enterprises and continuity serve to form the essence of OC activity  110  111  There are eleven characteristics from the European Commission and Europol pertinent to a working definition of organized crime  Six of those must be satisfied and the four in italics are mandatory  Summarised they are  more than two people  their own appointed tasks  activity over a prolonged or indefinite period of time  the use discipline or control  perpetration of serious criminal offences  operations on an international or transnational level  the use violence or other intimidation  the use of commercial or businesslike structures  engagement in money laundering  exertion of influence on politics  media  public administration  judicial authorities or the economy  and  motivated by the pursuit of profit and or power  with the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime  the Palermo Convention  having a similar definition  organised criminal  structured group  three or more people  one or more serious crimes  in order to obtain financial or other material benefit  serious crime  offence punishable by at least four years in prison  and  structured group  Not randomly formed and doesn t need formal structure  Others stress the importance of power  profit and perpetuity  defining organised criminal behaviour as  nonideological  i e  profit driven  hierarchical  few elites and many operatives  limited or exclusive membership  maintain secrecy and loyalty of members  perpetuating itself  Recruitment process and policy  willing to use illegal violence and bribery  specialised division of labour  to achieve organization goal  monopolistic  Market control to maximize profits  and  has explicit rules and regulations  Codes of honour  112  Definitions need to bring together its legal and social elements  OC has widespread social  political and economic effects  It uses violence and corruption to achieve its ends   OC when group primarily focused on illegal profits systematically commit crimes that adversely affect society and are capable of successfully shielding their activities  in particular by being willing to use physical violence or eliminate individuals by way of corruption   113  114  It is a mistake in using the term  OC  as though it denotes a clear and well defined phenomenon  The evidence regarding OC  shows a less well organised  very diversified landscape of organizing criminals the economic activities of these orgainsing criminals can be better described from the viewpoint of  crime enterprises  than from a conceptually unclear frameworks such as  OC    Many of the definitions emphasise the  group nature  of OC  the  organisation  of its members  its use of violence or corruption to achieve its goals  and its extra jurisdictional character  OC may appear in many forms at different times and in different places  Due to the variety of definitions  there is  evident danger  in asking  what is OC   and expecting a simple answer  115   edit  The locus of power and organized crime Some espouse that all organized crime operates at an international level  though there is currently no international court capable of trying offences resulting from such activities  the International Criminal Court s remit extends only to dealing with people accused of offences against humanity  e g  genocide   If a network operates primarily from one jurisdiction and carries out its illicit operations there and in some other jurisdictions it is  international   though it may be appropriate to use the term  transnational  only to label the activities of a major crime group that is centred in no one jurisdiction but operating in many  The understanding of organized crime has therefore progressed to combined internationalisation and an understanding of social conflict into one of power  control  efficiency risk and utility  all within the context of organisational theory  The accumulation of social  economic and political power 116  have sustained themselves as a core concerns of all criminal organizations  social  criminal groups seek to develop social control in relation to particular communities  economic  seek to exert influence by means of corruption and by coercion of legitimate and illegitimate praxis  and  political  criminal groups use corruption and violence to attain power and status  117  Contemporary organized crime may be very different from traditional Mafia style  particularly in terms of the distribution and centralization of power  authority structures and the concept of  control  over one s territory and organization  There is a tendency away from centralization of power and reliance upon family ties towards a fragmentation of structures and informality of relationships in crime groups  Organized crime most typically flourishes when a central government and civil society is disorganized  weak  absent or untrusted  This may occur in a society facing periods of political  economic or social turmoil or transition  such as a change of government or a period of rapid economic development  particularly if the society lacks strong and established institutions and the rule of law  The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe that saw the downfall of the Communist Bloc created a breeding ground for organized criminal organizations  The newest growth sectors for organized crime are identity theft and online extortion  These activities are troubling because they discourage consumers from using the Internet for e commerce  E commerce was supposed to level the playing ground between small and large businesses  but the growth of online organized crime is leading to the opposite effect  large businesses are able to afford more bandwidth  to resist denial of service attacks  and superior security  Furthermore  organized crime using the Internet is much harder to trace down for the police  even though they increasingly deploy cybercops  since most police forces and law enforcement agencies operate within a local or national jurisdiction while the Internet makes it easier for criminal organizations to operate across such boundaries without detection  In the past criminal organizations have naturally limited themselves by their need to expand  putting them in competition with each other  This competition  often leading to violence  uses valuable resources such as manpower  either killed or sent to prison   equipment and finances  In the United States  the Irish Mob boss of the Winter Hill Gang  in the 1980s  turned informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   He used this position to eliminate competition and consolidate power within the city of Boston which led to the imprisonment of several senior organized crime figures including Gennaro Angiulo  underboss of the Patriarca crime family  Infighting sometimes occurs within an organization  such as the Castellamarese war of 1930 31 and the Boston Irish Mob Wars of the 1960s and 1970s  Mugshot of Charles Luciano in 1936  Sicilian mobster  Today criminal organizations are increasingly working together  realizing that it is better to work in cooperation rather than in competition with each other  once again  consolidating power   This has led to the rise of global criminal organizations such as Mara Salvatrucha and the 18th Street gang  The American Mafia in the U S  have had links with organized crime groups in Italy such as the Camorra  the  Ndrangheta  Sacra Corona Unita  and Sicilian Mafia  The Cosa Nostra has also been known to work with the Irish Mob  John Gotti of the Gambino family and James Coonan of the Westies are known to have worked together  with the Westies operating as a contract hitman for the Gambino family after they helped Coonan come to power   the Japanese Yakuza and the Russian Mafia  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that organized crime groups held  322 billion in assets in 2005  118  This rise in cooperation between criminal organizations has meant that law enforcement agencies are increasingly having to work together  The FBI operates an organized crime section from its headquarters in Washington  D C  and is known to work with other national  e g   Polizia di Stato  Russian Federal Security Service  FSB   and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police   federal  e g

Special Operations Division  law enforcement agencies   edit  Theoretical background  edit  Criminal psychology Main article  Criminal psychology  edit  Rational choice Main article  Rational choice theory  criminology  Based on the now outdated notion that regardless of the reason for committing crime  the decision to do so is a rational choice made after weighing up the benefits versus consequences of the crime  this theory treats all individuals as rational operators  committing criminal acts after consideration of all associated risks  detection and punishment  compared with the rewards of crimes  personal  financial etc    119  Little emphasis is placed on the offenders  backgrounds or circumstances surrounding the crimes or offenders  The role of criminal organisations in lowering the perceptions of risk and increasing the likelihood of personal benefit is prioritised by this approach  with the organisations structure  purpose  and activity being indicative of the rational choices made by criminals and their organisers  120  It ignores that in addition to financial gains  people commit crimes for the need of acceptance  respect and trust by other members of the organisation   edit  Deterrence Main article  Deterrence  psychology  This theory sees criminal behaviour as reflective of an individual  internal calculation 121  by the criminal that the benefits associated with offending  whether financial or otherwise  outweigh the perceived risks  122  123  The perceived strength  importance or infallibility of the criminal organisation is directly proportional to the types of crime committed  their intensity and arguably the level of community response  The benefits of participating in organised crime  higher financial rewards  greater socioeconomic control and influence  protection of the family or significant others  perceived freedoms from  oppressive  laws or norms  contribute greatly to the psychology behind highly organised group offending   edit  Social learning Main article  Social learning theory Criminals learn through associations with one another  The success of organised crime groups if therefore dependent upon the strength of their communication and the enforcement of their value systems  the recruitment and training processes employed to sustain  build or fill gaps in criminal operations  124  An understanding of this theory sees close associations between criminals  imitation of superiors  and understanding of value systems  processes and authority as the main drivers behind organised crime  Interpersonal relationships define the motivations the individual developes  with the effect of family or peer criminal activity being a strong predictor of inter generational offending  125  This theory also developed to include the strengths and weaknesses of reinforcement  which in the context of continuing criminal enterprises may be used to help understand propensities for certain crimes or victims  level of integration into the mainstream culture and likelihood of recidivism   success in rehabilitation  124  126  127   edit  Enterprise Main article  Enterprise theory  crime  Under this theory  organised crime exists because legitimate markets leave many customers and potential customers unsatisfied  36  High demand for a particular good or service  e g  drugs  prostitution  arms  slaves   low levels of risk detection and high profits lead to a conducive environment for entrepreneurial criminal groups to enter the market and profit by supplying those goods and services  128  For success  there must be  an identified market  and  a certain rate of consumption  demand  to maintain profit and outweigh perceived risks  37  38  Under these conditions competition is discouraged  ensuring criminal monopolies sustain profits  Legal substitution of goods or services may  by increasing competition  force the dynamic of organised criminal operations to adjust  as will deterrence measures  reducing demand   and the restriction of resources  controlling the ability to supply or produce to supply   129   edit  Differential association Main article  Differential association Sutherland goes further to say that deviancy is contingent on conflicting groups within society  and that such groups struggle over the means to define what is criminal or deviant within society  Criminal organisations therefore gravitate around illegal avenues of production  profit making  protectionism or social control and attempt  by increasing their operations or membership  to make these acceptable  124  130  131  This also explains the propensity of criminal organisations to develop protection rackets  to coerce through the use of violence  aggression and threatening behaviour  at times termed  terrorism    132  133  134  135  Preoccupation with methods of accumulating profit highlight the lack of legitimate means to achieve economic or social advantage  as does the organisation of white collar crime or political corruption  though it is debatable whether these are based on wealth  power or both   The ability to effect social norms and practices through political and economic influence  and the enforcement or normalisation of criminogenic needs  may be defined by differential association theory   edit  Critical criminology and sociology  edit  Social disorganization Main article  Social disorganization theory Social disorganisation theory is intended to be applied to neighbourhood level street crime  136  thus the context of gang activity  loosely formed criminal associations or networks  socioeconomic demographic impacts  legitimate access to public resources  employment or education  and mobility give it relevance to organised crime  Where the upper  and lower classes live in close proximity this can result in feelings of anger  hostility  social injustice and frustration  137  Criminals experience poverty  and witness affluence they are deprived of and which is virtually impossible for them to attain through conventional means  138  The concept of neighbourhood is central to this theory  as it defines the social learning  locus of control  cultural influences and access to social opportunity experienced by criminals and the groups they form  139  Fear of or lack of trust in mainstream authority may also be a key contributor to social disorganisation  organised crime groups replicate such figures and thus ensure control over the counter culture  140  This theory has tended to view violent or anti social behaviour by gangs as reflective of their social disorganisation rather than as a product or tool of their organisation  141   edit  Anomie Main article  Anomie Sociologist Robert K  Merton believed deviance depended on society s definition of success  142  and the desires of individuals to achieve success through socially defined avenues  Criminality becomes attractive when expectations of being able to fulfil goals  therefore achieving success  by legitimate means cannot be fulfilled  143  Criminal organisations capitalise on states of normlessness by imposing criminogenic needs and illicit avenues to achieve them  This has been used as the basis for numerous meta theories of organised crime through its integration of social learning  cultural deviance  and criminogenic motivations  144  If crime is seen as a function of anomie  145  organised behaviour produces stability  increases protection or security  and may be directly proportional to market forces as expressed by entrepreneurship  or risk based approaches  It is the inadequate supply of legitimate opportunities that constrains the ability for the individual to pursue valued societal goals and reduces the likelihood that using legitimate opportunities will enable them to satisfy such goals  due to their position in society   146   edit  Cultural deviance Criminals violate the law because they belong to a unique subculture   the counter culture   their values and norms conflicting with those of the working   middle  or upper classes upon which criminal laws are based  This subculture shares an alternative lifestyle  language and culture  and is generally typified by being tough  taking care of their own affairs and rejecting government authority  Role models include drug dealers  thieves and pimps  as they have achieved success and wealth not otherwise available through socially provided opportunities  It is through modeling organized crime as a counter cultural avenue to success that such organizations are sustained  124  147  148   edit  Alien conspiracy queer ladder of mobility Main article  Jewish American organized crime The alien conspiracy theory and queer ladder of mobility theories state that ethnicity and  outsider  status  immigrants  or those not within the dominant ethno centric groups  and their influences are thought to dictate the prevalence of organise crime in society  149  The alien theory posits that the contemporary structures of organised crime gained prominence during the 1860s in Sicily and that elements of the Sicilian population are responsible for the foundation of most European and North American organised crime  150  made up of Italian dominated crime families  Bell s theory of the  queer ladder of mobility  hypothesised that  ethnic succession   the attainment of power and control by one more marginalised ethnic group over other less marginalised groups  occurs by promoting the perpetration of criminal activities within a disenfranchised or oppressed demographic  Whilst early organised crime was dominated by the Sicilian Mafia they have been relatively substituted by the Irish Mob  early 1900s   the Aryan Brotherhood  1960s onwards   Colombian Medellin cartel and Cali cartel  mid 1970s   1990s   and more recently the Mexican Tijuana Cartel  late 1980s onwards   the Russian Mafia  1988 onwards   Al Qaeda  1988 onwards  and the Taliban  1994 onwards   Many argue this misinterprets and overstates the role of ethnicity in organised crime  151  A contradiction of this theory is that syndicates had developed long before large scale Sicilian immigration in 1860s  with these immigrants merely joining a widespread phenomena of crime and corruption  152  153  154   edit  Legislative frameworks and policing measures
