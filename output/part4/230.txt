Kentucky to the southwest  Ohio to the northwest  Pennsylvania to the northeast and Maryland to the east  West Virginia is the 41st most extensive and the 37th most populous of the 50 United States  The capital and largest city is Charleston  West Virginia became a state following the Wheeling Conventions  breaking away from Virginia during the American Civil War  The new state was admitted to the Union on June 20  1863  and was a key Civil War border state  West Virginia was the only state to form by seceding from a Confederate state  and was one of only two states formed during the American Civil War  the other one being Nevada  which separated from Utah Territory  The Census Bureau and the Association of American Geographers 6  consider West Virginia part of the South  The northern panhandle extends adjacent to Pennsylvania and Ohio with the West Virginia cities of Wheeling and Weirton being just across the border from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area  while Bluefield is less than 70 miles  110 km  from North Carolina  Huntington in the southwest is close to the states of Ohio and Kentucky  while Martinsburg and Harper s Ferry in the Eastern Panhandle region are considered to be a part of the Washington metropolitan area  in between the states of Maryland and Virginia  The unique position of West Virginia means that it is often included in several geographical regions  including the Mid Atlantic  the Upland South  and the Southeastern United States  Notably  it is the only state which entirely lies within the area served by the Appalachian Regional Commission  which is a common definition of  Appalachia   7  The state is noted for its mountains and diverse topography  its historically significant logging and coal mining industries  and its political and labor history  It is one of the most densely karstic areas in the world  making it a choice area for recreational caving and scientific research  The karst lands contribute to much of the state s cool trout waters  It is also known for a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities  including skiing  whitewater rafting  fishing  hiking  mountain biking and hunting  Contents

mountainous  giving reason to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi   Mountaineers are always free    About 75  of the state is within the Cumberland Plateau and Allegheny Plateau regions  Though the relief is not high  the plateau region is extremely rugged in most areas  The average elevation of West Virginia is approximately 1 500 feet  460 m  above sea level  which is the highest of any US state east of the Mississippi River  On the eastern state line with Virginia  high peaks in the Monongahela National Forest region give rise to an island of colder climate and ecosystems similar to those of northern New England and eastern Canada  The highest point in the state is atop Spruce Knob  at 4 863 ft  1 482 m   10  and is covered in a boreal forest of dense spruce trees at altitudes above 4 000 feet  1 200 m   Spruce Knob lies within the Monongahela National Forest and is a part of the Spruce Knob Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area  11  A total of six wilderness areas can also be found within the forest  Outside the forest to the south  the New River Gorge is a 1 000 feet  300 m  deep canyon carved by the New River  The National Park Service manages a portion of the gorge and river that has been designated as the New River Gorge National River  one of only 15 rivers in the U S  with this level of protection  Other areas under protection and management include  Appalachian National Scenic Trail Bluestone National Scenic River Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park Gauley River National Recreation Area George Washington National Forest Harpers Ferry National Historical Park Ohio River Islands National Wildlife Refuge Map of West Virginia counties Most of West Virginia lies within the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion  while the higher elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie within the Appalachian Blue Ridge forests  The native vegetation for most of the state was originally mixed hardwood forest of oak  chestnut  maple  beech  and white pine  with willow and American sycamore along the state s waterways  Many of the areas are rich in biodiversity and scenic beauty  a fact that is appreciated by native West Virginians  who refer to their home as Almost Heaven  from the song   Take Me Home  Country Roads   by John Denver  Before the song  it was known as  The Cog State   Coal  Oil  and Gas  or  The Mountain State   The underlying rock strata are sandstone  shale  bituminous coal beds  and limestone laid down in a near shore environment from sediments derived from mountains to the east  in a shallow inland sea on the west  Some beds illustrate a coastal swamp environment  some river delta  some shallow water  Sea level rose and fell many times during the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian eras  giving a variety of rock strata  The Appalachian Mountains are some of the oldest on earth  having formed over 300

subtropical climate  Koppen climate classification Cfa  in some of the lower elevations  primarily in the southwestern portion of the state  including Huntington and Charleston   along with parts of the Eastern Panhandle east of the Appalachians with hot  humid summers and milder winters  The rest of the state generally has a humid continental climate  Koppen climate classification Dfa  except Dfb at the higher elevations  with warm to hot  humid summers and cool to cold winters  increasing in severity with elevation  Some southern highland areas also have a mountain temperate climate  Koppen Cfb  where winter temperatures are more moderate and summer temperatures are somewhat cooler  However  the weather is subject in all parts of the state to change  The hardiness zones range from zone 5b in the central Appalachian mountains to zone 7a in the warmest parts of the lowest elevations  13  In the Eastern Panhandle and the Ohio River Valley  temperatures are warm enough to see and grow subtropical plants such as Southern magnolia  Magnolia grandiflora   Crepe Myrtle  Albizia julibrissin  American Sweetgum and even the occasional needle palm and sabal minor  These plants do not thrive as well in other parts of the state  The Eastern prickly pear grows well in many portions of the state  Average January temperatures range from around 26  F   4  C  near the Cheat River to 41  F  5  C  along sections of the border with Kentucky  July averages range from 67  F  19  C  along the North Branch Potomac River to 76  F  24  C  in the western part of the state  It is cooler in the mountains than in the lower sections of the state  14  The highest recorded temperature in the state is 112  F  44  C  at Martinsburg on July 10  1936 and the lowest recorded temperature in the state is  37  F   38  C  at Lewisburg on December 30  1917  Annual precipitation ranges from less than 32 inches  81 cm  in the lower eastern section to more than 56 inches  140 cm  in higher parts of the Allegheny Front  Slightly more than half the rainfall occurs from April to September  Dense fogs are common in many valleys of the Kanawha section  especially the Tygart Valley  West Virginia is also one of the cloudiest states in the nation  with the cities of Elkins and Beckley ranking 9th and 10th in the U S  respectively for the number of cloudy days per year  over 210   In addition to persistent cloudy skies caused by the damming of moisture by the Alleghenies  West Virginia also experiences some of the most frequent precipitation in the nation  with Snowshoe averaging nearly 200 days a year with either rain or snow  Snow usually lasts only a few days in the lower sections but may persist for weeks in the higher mountain areas  An average of 34 inches  86 cm  of snow falls annually in Charleston  although during the winter of 1995 1996 more than three times that amount fell as several cities in the state established new records for snowfall  Average snowfall in the Allegheny Highlands can range up to 180 inches  460 cm  per year  Severe weather is somewhat less prevalent in West Virginia than in most other eastern states  and it ranks among the least tornado prone states east of the Rockies   edit  History Main article  History of West Virginia The area was a favorite hunting ground of numerous Native American peoples before the arrival of European settlers  Many ancient man made earthen mounds from various mound builder cultures survive  especially in the areas of Moundsville  South Charleston  and Romney  The artifacts uncovered in these give evidence of a village society having a tribal trade system culture that practiced limited cold worked copper  In more recent history the area now occupied by West Virginia was contested territory  mainly by Pennsylvania and Virginia  Some speculative land companies  such as the Vandalia Company  15  and later the Ohio Company and Indiana Company  tried to legitimize their claims to land in parts of West Virginia and Kentucky  but failed  With the settlement of the Pennsylvania and Virginia border dispute which resulted in the creation of Kentucky  Kentuckians  were satisfied        and the inhabitants of a large part of West Virginia were grateful   16  West Virginia was originally part of the British Virginia Colony  from 1607 to 1776  and the western part of the state of Virginia  from 1776 to 1863   whose population became sharply divided over the issue of secession from the Union and in the separation from Virginia  formalized by admittance to the Union as a new state in 1863  West Virginia s history has been profoundly affected by its mountainous terrain  numerous and vast river valleys  and rich natural resources  These were all factors driving its economy and the lifestyles of residents  and remain so today   edit  Prehistory For more details on this topic  see Prehistory of West Virginia  Further information  Protohistory of West Virginia A 2010 analysis of a

were often made of clay and rather plain    Nothing is known about Paleo Indian and Archaic houses in the Kanawha Valley  but archeologists have found evidence of Woodland and Fort Ancient houses    Woodland Indians lived in wigwams     The Woodland Indians grew sunflowers  gourds  squash and several seeds such as lambsquarter  may grass  sumpweed  smartweed and little barley    Fort Ancient Indians lived in much larger square or rectangular houses     The Fort Ancient Indians can be considered true farmers  They cultivated large agricultural fields around their villages  They no longer grew such a variety of seeds but concentrated on growing corn  beans  sunflowers  gourds  and many types of squash including the pumpkin  They also grew domestic turkeys and kept dogs as pets   As of 2009  over 12 500 archaeological sites have been documented in West Virginia  Bryan Ward 2009 10   18   edit  European exploration and settlement Further information  Vandalia  colony  and

the northern portion in 1725  The same year  German settlers from Pennsylvania founded New Mecklenburg  the present Shepherdstown  on the Potomac River  and others followed  King Charles II of England  in 1661  granted to a company of gentlemen the land between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers  known as the Northern Neck  The grant finally came into the possession of Thomas Fairfax  6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron  and in 1746  a stone was erected at the source of the North Branch Potomac River to mark the western limit of the grant  A considerable part of this land was surveyed by George Washington between 1748 and 1751  The diary kept by the surveyor indicates that there were already many squatters  largely of German origin  along the South Branch Potomac River  Christopher Gist  a surveyor in the employ of the first Ohio Company  which was composed chiefly of Virginians  explored the country along the Ohio River north of the mouth of the Kanawha River between 1751 and 1752  The company sought to have a fourteenth colony established with the name  Vandalia   Many settlers crossed the mountains after 1750  though they were hindered by Native American resistance  Few Native Americans lived permanently within the present limits of the state  but the region was a common hunting ground  crossed by many trails  During the French and Indian War the scattered British settlements were almost destroyed  In 1774  the Crown Governor of Virginia John Murray  4th Earl of Dunmore  led a force over the mountains  and a body of militia under then Colonel Andrew Lewis dealt the Shawnee Indians  under Hokoleskwa  or  Cornstalk    a crushing blow during the Battle of Point Pleasant at the junction of the Kanawha and the Ohio rivers  Native American attacks continued until after the American Revolutionary War  During the war  the settlers in western Virginia were generally active Whigs and many served in the Continental Army  However  Claypool s Rebellion of 1780 1781  in which a group of men refused to pay Colonial taxes showed war weariness in West Virginia   edit  Trans Allegheny Virginia For more details on this topic  see Virginia  Social conditions in western Virginia were entirely unlike those in the eastern portion of the state  The population was not homogeneous  as a considerable part of the immigration came by way of Pennsylvania and included Germans  Protestant Ulster Scots  and settlers from the states farther north  Counties in the east and south were settled mostly by east Virginians  During the American Revolution  the movement to create a state beyond the Alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of  Westsylvania  was presented to Congress  on the grounds that the mountains made an almost impassable barrier on the east  The rugged nature of the country made slavery unprofitable  and time only increased the social  political  economic and cultural differences  see Tuckahoe Cohee  between the two sections of Virginia  The convention that met in 1829 to form a new constitution for Virginia  against the protest of the counties beyond the mountains  required a property qualification for suffrage and gave the slave holding counties the benefit of three fifths of their slave population in apportioning the state s representation in the U S  House of Representatives  As a result  every county beyond the Alleghenies except one voted to reject the constitution  which nevertheless passed because of eastern support  The Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850 51  the Reform Convention  addressed a number of issues important to western Virginians  The vote was extended to all white males of 21 years of age plus  The governor  lieutenant governor  the judiciary  sheriffs and other county officers were to be elected by public vote  The composition of the General Assembly was changed  representation in the house of delegates was apportioned on the white basis of the census of 1850  but the Senate was fixed arbitrarily  the west receiving twenty  and the east thirty  senators  This was made acceptable to the west by a provision that required the General Assembly to reapportion representation on the white basis in 1865  or else put the matter to a public referendum  But the east also gave itself a tax advantage in requiring a property tax at true and actual value  except for slaves  Slaves under the age of 12 years were not taxed  and slaves over that age were taxed at only  300  a fraction of their true value  Small farmers  however  had all their assets  animals and land  taxed at full value  Despite this tax and the lack of internal improvements in the west  the vote was 75 748 for and 11 063 against the new Constitution  most of the latter being from eastern counties  which did not like the compromises made for the west  19   edit  Separation from Virginia See also  West Virginia in the American Civil War and History of slavery in West Virginia Francis H  Pierpont  a leader during the Second Wheeling Convention On October 24  1861  voters from 41 counties voted to form a new state  voter turnout was 34   The name was subsequently changed from Kanawha to West Virginia  20  West Virginia was the only state in the Union to secede from a Confederate state  Virginia  during the American Civil War  21  In Richmond on April 17  1861  the 49 delegates from the future state of West Virginia voted 17 in favor of the Ordinance of Secession  of Virginia from the United States   30 against 22  and 2 abstentions  23  Almost immediately after the vote to proceed with secession from the Union prevailed in the Virginia General Assembly  a mass meeting at Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in Wheeling on May 13  1861  When this First Wheeling Convention met  425 delegates from 25 counties were present  though more than one third of the delegates were from the northern panhandle area  24  but soon there was a division of sentiment  Some delegates favored the immediate formation of a new state  while others argued that  as Virginia s secession had not yet been passed by the required referendum  such action would constitute revolution against the United States  25  It was decided that if the ordinance were adopted  of which there was little doubt   another convention including the members elect of the legislature should meet at Wheeling in June  At the election on May 23  1861  secession was ratified by a large majority in the state as a whole  but in the western counties 34 677 voted against and 19 121 voted for the Ordinance  26  The Second Wheeling Convention met as agreed on June 11 and declared that  since the Secession Convention had been called without the consent of the people  all its acts were void  and that all who adhered to it had vacated their offices  The Wheeling Conventions  and the delegates themselves  were never actually elected by public ballot to act on behalf of western Virginia  27  An act for the reorganization of the government was passed on June 19  The next day Francis H  Pierpont was chosen by other delegates at the convention to be governor of Virginia  other officers were elected and the convention adjourned  The legislature was composed of 103 members  33 of whom had been elected to the Virginia General Assembly 28  on May 23  This number included some hold over Senators from 1859  and as such had vacated their offices to convene in Wheeling  The other members  were chosen even more irregularly  some in mass meetings  others by county committee  and still others were seemingly self appointed  29  This irregular assembly met on June 20 and appointed Unionists to hold the remainder of the state offices  organized a rival state government and elected two United States senators who were promptly recognized by the federal government in Washington  D C  Thus  there were two state governments in Virginia  one pledging allegiance to the United States and one to the Confederacy  The Wheeling Convention  which had taken a recess until August 6  reassembled on August 20  and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new state and for a convention to frame a constitution if the vote should be favorable  At the October 24  1861 election  18 408 votes were cast for the new state and only 781 against  The honesty of these election results has been questioned  since the Union army then occupied the area and Union troops were stationed at many of the polls to prevent Confederate sympathizers from voting  30  Most of the affirmative votes came from 16 counties around the Northern panhandle  31  Over 50 000 votes had been cast on the Ordinance of Secession  yet the vote on statehood gathered little more than 19 000  Statehood vote of Oct  24  1861 In Ohio County  home to Wheeling  only about one quarter of the registered voters cast votes  32  At the Constitutional Convention in November 1861  Mr  Lamb of Ohio County and Mr  Carskadon said that in Hampshire County  out of 195 votes only 39 were cast by citizens of the state  the rest were cast illegally by Union soldiers  33  In most of what would become West Virginia  there was no vote at all as two thirds of the territory of West Virginia had voted for secession and county officers were still loyal to Richmond  34  Votes recorded from pro secession counties were mostly cast elsewhere by Unionist refugees from these counties  35  The convention began on November 26  1861  and finished its work on February 18  1862  the instrument was ratified  18 162 for and 514 against  on April 11  1862  Harpers Ferry  as it appeared in 2005  changed hands a dozen times during the American Civil War and was annexed by West Virginia  On May 13 the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state  An application for admission to the Union was made to Congress  and on December 31  1862  an enabling act was approved by Pres  Abraham Lincoln admitting West Virginia  on the condition that a provision for the gradual abolition of slavery be inserted in its constitution  While many felt that West Virginia s admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional  Lincoln issued his Opinion on the Admission of West Virginia finding that  the body which consents to the admission of West Virginia  is the Legislature of Virginia   and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and expedient  36  The convention was reconvened on February 12  1863  and the demand was met  The revised constitution was adopted on March 26  1863  and on April 20  1863  Pres  Lincoln issued a proclamation admitting the state at the end of 60 days  June 20  1863   Meanwhile  officers for the new state were chosen and Gov  Pierpont moved his capital to Union occupied Alexandria  where he asserted jurisdiction over all of the Virginia counties within the federal lines  The question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new state was brought before the Supreme Court of the United States in the following manner  Berkeley and Jefferson counties lying on the Potomac east of the mountains  in 1863  with the consent of the reorganized government of Virginia voted in favor of annexation to West Virginia  Many voters of the strongly pro secessionist counties were absent in the Confederate Army when the vote was taken and refused to acknowledge the transfer upon their return  The Virginia General Assembly repealed the act of secession and in 1866 brought suit against West Virginia  asking the court to declare the counties a part of Virginia which would have declared West Virginia s admission as a state unconstitutional  Meanwhile  on March 10  1866  Congress passed a joint resolution recognizing the transfer  The Supreme Court  in 1870  decided in favor of West Virginia  37  During the American Civil War  West Virginia suffered comparatively little  Union General George B  McClellan s forces gained possession of the greater part of the territory in the summer of 1861  culminating at the Battle of Rich Mountain  and Union control was never again seriously threatened  despite an attempt by Robert E  Lee in the same year  In 1863  General John D  Imboden  with 5 000 Confederates  overran a considerable portion of the state  Bands of guerrillas burned and plundered in some sections  and were not entirely suppressed until after the war ended  The Eastern Panhandle counties were more affected by the war  with military control of the area repeatedly changing hands  The area which became West Virginia actually furnished about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and Confederate armies  38  approximately 22 000 25 000 each  The Wheeling government found it necessary in 1865 to strip voting rights from returning Confederates in order to retain control  James Ferguson  who proposed the law  said that if it was not enacted he would lose election by 500 votes  39  The property of Confederates might also be confiscated  and in 1866 a constitutional amendment disfranchising all who had given aid and comfort to the Confederacy was adopted  The addition of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution caused a reaction  The Democratic party secured control in 1870  and in 1871  the constitutional amendment of 1866 was abrogated  The first steps toward this change had been taken  however  by the Republicans in 1870  On August 22  1872  an entirely new constitution was adopted  Beginning in Reconstruction  and for several decades thereafter  the two states disputed the new state s share of the pre war Virginia government s debts  which had mostly been incurred to finance public infrastructure improvements  such as canals  roads  and railroads under the Virginia Board of Public Works  Virginians  led by former Confederate General William Mahone  formed a political coalition which was based upon this  the Readjuster Party  Although West Virginia s first constitution provided for the assumption of a part of the Virginia debt  negotiations opened by Virginia in 1870 were fruitless  and in 1871  Virginia funded two thirds of the debt and arbitrarily assigned the remainder to West Virginia  The issue was finally settled in 1915  when the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia  12 393 929 50  The final installment of this sum was paid in 1939   edit  Natural Resources This section needs additional citations for

from the development of its mineral resources more than any other single economic activity  Saltpeter caves had been employed throughout Appalachia for munitions  the border between West Virginia and Virginia includes the  Saltpeter Trail   a string of limestone caverns containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate that were rendered and sold to the government  The trail stretched from Pendleton County to the western terminus of the route in the town of Union  Monroe County  Nearly half of these caves are on the West Virginia side  including Organ Cave and Haynes Cave  In the late 18th century  saltpeter miners in Haynes Cave found large animal bones in the deposits  These were sent by a local historian and frontier soldier Colonel John Stuart to Thomas Jefferson  The bones were named Megalonyx jeffersonii or great claw and became known as Jefferson s Three toed Sloth  It was declared the official state fossil of West Virginia in 2008  The West Virginia official state rock is bituminous coal  40  and the official state gemstone is silicified Mississippian fossil Lithostrotionella coral  41  The limestone also produced a useful quarry industry  usually small  and softer  high calcium seams were burned to produce industrial lime  This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes  for many years a specific portion of the C  amp  O Railroad carried limestone rock to Clifton Forge  Virginia as an industrial flux  Salt mining had been underway since the 18th century  though it had largely played out by the time of the American Civil War  when the red salt of Kanawha County was a valued commodity of first Confederate  and later Union forces  Later  more sophisticated mining methods would restore West Virginia s role as a major producer of salt  However  in the second half of the 19th century  there was an even greater treasure not yet developed  bituminous coal  It would fuel much of the Industrial Revolution in the U S  and the steamships of many of the world s navies  The residents  both Native Americans and early European settlers  had long known of the underlying coal  and that it could be used for heating and fuel  However  for a long time  very small  personal  mines were the only practical development  After the War  with the new railroads came a practical method to transport large quantities of coal to expanding U S  and export markets  As the anthracite mines of northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to play out during this same time period  investors and industrialists focused new interest in West Virginia  Geologists such as Dr  David T  Ansted surveyed potential coal fields and invested in land and early mining projects  The completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway  C amp O  across the state to the new city of Huntington on the Ohio River in 1872 opened access to the New River Coal Field  Soon  the C amp O was building its huge coal pier at Newport News  Virginia on the large harbor of Hampton Roads  In 1881  the new Philadelphia based owners of the former Atlantic  Mississippi and Ohio Railroad  AM amp O   which stretched across Virginia s southern tier from Norfolk  had sights clearly set on the Mountain State  where the owners had large land holdings  Their railroad was renamed Norfolk and Western  N amp W   and a new railroad city was developed at Roanoke to handle planned expansion  After its new president Frederick J  Kimball and a small party journeyed by horseback and saw firsthand the rich bituminous coal seam which his wife named  Pocahontas   the N amp W redirected its planned westward expansion to reach it  Soon  the N amp W was also shipping from new coal piers at Hampton Roads  Family of coal miner in West Virginia ca  1935 In 1889  in the southern part of the state  along the Norfolk and Western rail lines  the important coal center of Bluefield  West Virginia was founded  The  capital  of the Pocahontas coalfield  this city would remain the largest city in the southern portion of the state for several decades  It shares a sister city with the same name  Bluefield  in Virginia  In the northern portion of the state and elsewhere  the older Baltimore and Ohio Railroad  B amp O  and other lines also expanded to take advantage of coal opportunities  The B amp O developed coal piers in Baltimore and at several points on the Great Lakes  Other significant rail carriers of coal were the Western Maryland Railway  WM   Southern Railway  SOU   and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad  L amp N   Particularly notable was a latecomer  the Virginian Railway  VGN   By 1900  only a large area of the most rugged terrain of southern West Virginia was any distance from the existing railroads and mining activity  Within this area west of the New River Coalfield in Raleigh and Wyoming counties lay the Winding Gulf Coalfield  later promoted as the  Billion Dollar Coalfield   A protege of Dr  Ansted was William Nelson Page  1854 1932   a civil engineer and mining manager in Fayette County  Former West Virginia Governor William A  MacCorkle described him as a man who knew the land  as a farmer knows a field   Beginning in 1898  Page teamed with northern and European based investors to take advantage of the undeveloped area  They acquired large tracts of land in the area  and Page began the Deepwater Railway  a short line railroad which was chartered to stretch between the C amp O at its line along the Kanawha River and the N amp W at Matoaka  a distance of about 80 miles  130 km   Saturday afternoon street scene  Welch  McDowell County  1946 Although the Deepwater plan should have provided a competitive shipping market via either railroad  leaders of the two large railroads did not appreciate the scheme  In secret collusion  each declined to negotiate favorable rates with Page  nor did they offer to purchase his railroad  as they had many other short lines  However  if the C amp O and N amp W presidents thought they could thus kill the Page project  they were to be proved mistaken  One of the silent partner investors Page had enlisted was millionaire industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers  a principal in John D  Rockefeller s Standard Oil Trust and an old hand at developing natural resources  transportation  A master at competitive  warfare   Henry Rogers did not like to lose in his endeavors and also had  deep pockets   Instead of giving up  Page  and Rogers  quietly planned and then built their tracks all the way east across Virginia  using Rogers  private fortune to finance the  40 million cost  When the renamed Virginian Railway  VGN  was completed in 1909  no fewer than three railroads were shipping ever increasing volumes of coal to export from Hampton Roads  West Virginia coal was also under high demand at Great Lakes ports  The VGN and the N amp W ultimately became parts of the modern Norfolk Southern system  and the VGN s well engineered 21st century tracks continue to offer a favorable gradient to Hampton Roads  As coal mining and related work became major employment activities in the state  there was considerable labor strife as working conditions  safety issues and economic concerns arose  Even in the 21st century  mining safety and ecological concerns is still challenging to the state whose coal continues to power electrical generating plants in many other states  Coal is not the only valuable mineral found in West Virginia  as the state was the site of the 1928 discovery of the 34 48 carat  6 896 g  Jones Diamond   edit  Demographics West Virginia population

according to 2009 International Monetary Fund projections  48  The state has a projected nominal GSP of  63 34 billion in 2009 according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis report of November 2010  and a real GSP of  55 04 billion  The real GDP growth of the state in 2009 of  7  was the 7th best in the country  49  West Virginia was only one of ten states in 2009 which grew economically  50  While per capita income fell 2 6  nationally in 2009  West Virginia s grew at 1 8   51  Through the first half of 2010  exports from West Virginia topped  3 billion  growing 39 5  over the same period from the previous year and ahead of the national average by 15 7   51  Morgantown was ranked by Forbes as the  10 best small city in the nation to conduct business in 2010  52  The city is also home to West Virginia University  the 95th best public university according to U S  News  amp  World Report in 2011  53  The proportion of West Virginia s adult population with a bachelor s degree is the lowest in the U S  at 17 3   54  The net corporate income tax rate is 8 5   scheduled for reduction to 6 5  by 2014  while business costs are 13  below the national average  55  56  In 2008  West Virginia was one of only four U S  states to have a surplus state budget  The state s unemployment rate was 8 2  as of October 2011  57   edit  Resources One of the major resources in West Virginia s economy is coal  According to the Energy Information Administration  West Virginia is a top coal producer in the United States  second only to Wyoming  West Virginia also produces minimal oil and natural gas  Nearly all of the electricity generated in West Virginia is from coal fired power plants  West Virginia produces a surplus of electricity and leads the Nation in net interstate electricity exports  58  Farming is also practiced in West Virginia  but on a limited basis because of the mountainous terrain over much of the state  Bituminous coal seam in southwestern West Virginia  edit  Taxes West Virginia personal income tax is based on federal adjusted gross income  not taxable income   as modified by specific items in West Virginia law  Citizens are taxed within five income brackets  which range from 3 0 percent to 6 5 percent  The state s consumer sales tax is levied at 6 percent  Effective January 1  2004  calculation of WV consumer sales tax has been converted to a calculated figure from the bracket system  and remains at 6 percent for most goods  food goods are now taxable at 3 percent   The computation of tax is carried out to the third decimal place and rounded up when the third decimal place is five   005  or higher  and similarly rounded down if the third place is four   004  or lower  By virtue of this method  sales totaling  0 08 and below would not have a sales tax associated with them  59  West Virginia counties administer and collect property taxes  although property tax rates reflect levies for state government  county governments  county boards of education and municipalities  Counties may also impose a hotel occupancy tax on lodging places not located within the city limits of any municipality that levies such a tax  Municipalities may levy license and gross receipts taxes on businesses located within the city limits and a hotel occupancy tax on lodging places in the city  Although the Department of Tax and Revenue plays a major role in the administration of this tax  less than one half of 1 percent of the property tax collected goes to state government  The primary beneficiaries of the property tax are county boards of education  Property taxes are paid to the sheriff of each of the state s 55 counties  Each county and municipality can impose its own rates of property taxation within the limits set by the West Virginia Constitution  The West Virginia legislature sets the rate of tax of county boards of education  This rate is used by all county boards of education statewide  However  the total tax rate for county boards of education may differ from county to county because of excess levies  The Department of Tax and Revenue supervises and otherwise assists counties and municipalities in their work of assessment and tax rate determination  The total tax rate is a combination of the tax levies from four state taxing authorities  state  county  schools and municipal  This total tax rate varies for each of the four classes of property  which consists of personal  real and intangible properties  Property is assessed according to its use  location and value as of July 1  All property is reappraised every three years  annual adjustments are made to assessments for property with a change of value  West Virginia does not impose an inheritance tax  Because of the phase out of the federal estate tax credit  West Virginia s estate tax is not imposed on estates of persons who died on or after January 1  2005  60   edit  Largest private employers The largest private employers in West

citizen s legislature  meaning that legislative office is not a full time occupation  but rather a part time position  Consequently  the legislators often hold a full time job in their community of residence  Typically  the legislature is in session for 60 days between January and early April  The final day of the regular session ends in a bewildering fury of last minute legislation in order to meet a constitutionally imposed deadline of midnight  During the remainder of the year  monthly interim sessions are held in preparation for the regular session  Legislators also gather periodically for  special  sessions when called by the governor  The title of Lieutenant Governor is assigned by statute to the Senate President   edit  Executive branch Further information  List of Governors of

Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia West Virginia is one of thirteen states that do not have a death penalty  and it is the only state in the southeastern United States to have abolished it  For the purpose of courts of general jurisdiction  the state is divided into 31 judicial circuits  Each circuit is made up of one or more counties  Circuit judges are elected in partisan elections to serve eight year terms  West Virginia s highest court is the Supreme Court of Appeals  The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is the busiest appellate court of its type in the United States

Virginia and Political party strength in West Virginia At the state level  West Virginia s politics are largely dominated by the Democratic Party  with Democrats currently holding the governorship  both senate seats and both houses of the state legislature  Republicans  however  hold two of the state s three House seats  West Virginia also has a very strong tradition of union membership  Robert C  Byrd  a Democrat  represented the state of West Virginia in Congress for over 57 years  as a Member of the House from the now defunct 6th District from 1953 1959  and as a United States Senator from 1959 2010  He served as Democratic Senate Leader from 1977 1989  In 2006 he became the longest serving Senator in history  and in 2009 the longest serving member of Congress in history  Senator Byrd died of pneumonia on June 28  2010  aged 92  Governor Manchin appointed Carte Goodwin to fill the seat until a special election was held in November 2010  Manchin was elected to the seat to fulfill the remainder of Byrd s term  Evangelical Christians comprised 52 percent of the state s voters in 2008  62  A poll in 2005 showed that 53 percent of West Virginia voters are pro life  the seventh highest in the country  63  In 2006  16 percent favored gay marriage  64  In 2008  58 percent favored troop withdrawal from Iraq while just 32 percent wanted troops to remain  65  On fiscal policy in 2008  52 percent said raising taxes on the wealthier individuals would benefit the economy  while 45 percent disagreed  66  Democratic politicians are typically more conservative than the national party  The late Senator Robert Byrd opposed affirmative action and same sex marriage  Junior Senator and former Governor Joe Manchin and Congressmen Alan Mollohan and Nick Rahall are pro life on the issue of abortion  In the Republican landslide of 1988  it was one of only ten states  and the only southern state  as defined by the US Census   to give its electoral votes to Michael Dukakis  it was one of only six states to support Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan in 1980  and it supported Bill Clinton by large margins in both 1992 and 1996  The state has trended increasingly Republican in presidential elections  despite the earlier Democratic wins in presidential match ups  it narrowly elected George W  Bush over Al Gore in 2000  then re elected Bush by a much larger margin in 2004 and voted for John McCain in 2008 by a similar margin to 2004  The most consistent support for Democrats is found in the coal fields of southern West Virginia  especially McDowell  Mingo  Logan  Wyoming  and Boone Counties   while Republicans are most numerous to the east of the Allegheny Mountains  especially in the state s Eastern Panhandle and Potomac Highlands  The Northern Panhandle and North Central West Virginia regions usually split right down the middle in terms of being Republican or Democratic  Since 1996  coal interests have contributed more than  4 million to candidates for governor  the state Supreme Court and the West Virginia Legislature  The 2004 election was a record setter for the coal industry  Gov  Joe Manchin received  571 214 from coal interests for his campaign and  174 500 for his inaugural  West Virginians for Coal  the West Virginia Coal Association s political action committee  contributed more money than any other coal industry donor  67   edit

Railroad  73  and the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad   74  West Virginia is crossed by six interstate highways  I 64 enters the state near White Sulphur Springs in the mountainous east  and exits for Kentucky in the west  near Huntington  I 77 enters from Virginia in the south  near Bluefield  It runs north past Parkersburg before it crosses into Ohio  I 64 and I 77 are merged in a stretch of toll road known as the West Virginia Turnpike  on which construction began in 1952  It runs from just east of Charleston south to the exit for Princeton  I 68 s western terminus is in Morgantown  From there it runs east into Maryland  At the I 68 terminus in Morgantown  it meets I 79  which enters from Pennsylvania and runs through the state to its southern terminus in Charleston  I 70 briefly runs through West Virginia  crossing the northern panhandle through Wheeling  I 81 also briefly runs in West Virginia through the Eastern Panhandle where it goes through Martinsburg  An interstate quality road is currently being built that will eventually stretch from I 79 near Weston  WV to at least Wardensville  WV  The western stretch is complete to Kerens  West Virginia but is incomplete from there to Moorefield  WV  It is not certain whether the highway will eventually continue east past Wardensville to the Virginia state line and ultimately connect to I 81 just south of Winchester  VA  Rail lines in the state used to be more prevalent  but many lines have been discontinued because of increased automobile traffic  Many old tracks have been converted to rail trails for recreational use  and the state is still served by a few commercial lines for hauling coal and by Amtrak  In 2006 Norfolk Southern along with the West Virginia and U S  Government approved a plan to modify many of the rail tunnels in West Virginia  especially in the southern half of the state  to allow for double stacked cars  see inter modal freight   This is expected to also help bring economic growth to the southern half of the state  Because of the mountainous nature of the entire state  West Virginia has several notable tunnels and bridges  The most famous of these is the New River Gorge Bridge  which was at a time the longest steel single arch bridge in the world with a 3 031 foot  924 m  span  The bridge is also pictured on the West Virginia state quarter  The Fort Steuben Bridge  Weirton Steubenville Bridge  was at its time of construction one of only three cable stayed steel girder trusses in the United States   The Veterans Memorial Bridge was designed to handle traffic from the Fort Steuben Bridge as well as its own traffic load   to quote the Wierton Daily Times news paper  75  The 80 year old Fort Steuben Bridge  Weirton Steubenville Bridge  was permanently closed on January 8  2009  The Wheeling Suspension Bridge was the first bridge built across the Ohio River in 1849 and for a time was the longest suspension bridge in the world  It is still the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the United States still in use   edit  State capitals Originally  the state capital was in Wheeling  1863 to 1870   It was then moved to Charleston  a more central city  1870 to
