1564  died 23 April 1616  nb 1  was an English poet and playwright  widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world s pre eminent dramatist  1  He is often called England s national poet and the  Bard of Avon   2  nb 2  His surviving works  including some collaborations  consist of about 38 plays  nb 3  154 sonnets  two long narrative poems  and several other poems  His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright  3  Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford upon Avon  At the age of 18  he married Anne Hathaway  with whom he had three children  Susanna  and twins Hamnet and Judith  Between 1585 and 1592  he began a successful career in London as an actor  writer  and part owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain s Men  later known as the King s Men  He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 at age 49  where he died three years later  Few records of Shakespeare s private life survive  and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance  sexuality  religious beliefs  and whether the works attributed to him were written by others  4  Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613  5  nb 4  His early plays were mainly comedies and histories  genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the 16th century  He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608  including Hamlet  King Lear  Othello  and Macbeth  considered some of the finest works in the English language  In his last phase  he wrote tragicomedies  also known as romances  and collaborated with other playwrights  Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime  In 1623  two of his former theatrical colleagues published the First Folio  a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare s  Shakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day  but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the 19th century  The Romantics  in particular  acclaimed Shakespeare s genius  and the Victorians worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard Shaw called  bardolatry   6  In the 20th century  his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance  His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied  performed  and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts

glover originally from Snitterfield  and Mary Arden  the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer  7  He was born in Stratford upon Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564  His actual birthdate remains unknown  but is traditionally observed on 23 April  St George s Day  8  This date  which can be traced back to an 18th century scholar s mistake  has proved appealing to biographers  since Shakespeare died 23 April 1616  9  He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son  10  Although no attendance records for the period survive  most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King s New School in Stratford  11  a free school chartered in 1553  12  about a quarter mile from his home  Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era  but the grammar curriculum was standardised by royal decree throughout England  13  and the school would have provided an intensive education in Latin grammar based upon Latin classical authors  14  John Shakespeare s house  believed to be Shakespeare s birthplace  in Stratford upon Avon  At the age of 18  Shakespeare married the 26 year old Anne Hathaway  The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence 27 November 1582  The next day two of Hathaway s neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage  15  The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste  since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times  16  and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter  Susanna  baptised 26 May 1583  17  Twins  son Hamnet and daughter Judith  followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585  18  Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596  19  After the birth of the twins  Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592  and scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare s  lost years   20  Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories  Nicholas Rowe  Shakespeare s first biographer  recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy  Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him  21  Another 18th century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London  22 John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster  23  Some 20th century scholars have suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire  a Catholic landowner who named a certain  William Shakeshafte  in his will  24  No evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death  and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area  25  London and theatrical career  All the world s a stage  and all the men and women merely players  they have their exits and their entrances  and one man in his time plays many parts      As You Like It  Act II  Scene 7  139 42 26  It is not known exactly when Shakespeare began writing  but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592  27  He was well enough known in London by then to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats Worth of Wit     there is an upstart Crow  beautified with our feathers  that with his Tiger s heart wrapped in a Player s hide  supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you  and being an absolute Johannes factotum  is in his own conceit the only Shake scene in a country  28  Scholars differ on the exact meaning of these words  29  but most agree that Greene is accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match university educated writers such as Christopher Marlowe  Thomas Nashe and Greene himself  the  university wits    30  The italicised phrase parodying the line  Oh  tiger s heart wrapped in a woman s hide  from Shakespeare s Henry VI  Part 3  along with the pun  Shake scene   identifies Shakespeare as Greene s target  Here Johannes Factotum  Jack of all trades   means a second rate tinkerer with the work of others  rather than the more common  universal genius   29  31  Greene s attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare s career in the theatre  Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid 1580s to just before Greene s remarks  32  From 1594  Shakespeare s plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain s Men  a company owned by a group of players  including Shakespeare  that soon became the leading playing company in London  33  After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603  the company was awarded a royal patent by the new king  James I  and changed its name to the King s Men  34  In 1599  a partnership of company members built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames  which they called the Globe  In 1608  the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre  Records of Shakespeare s property purchases and investments indicate that the company made him a wealthy man  35  In 1597  he bought the second largest house in Stratford  New Place  and in 1605  he invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford  36  Some of Shakespeare s plays were published in quarto editions from 1594  By 1598  his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages  37  Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright  The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson s Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour  1598  and Sejanus His Fall  1603   38  The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson s Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end  39  The First Folio of 1623  however  lists Shakespeare as one of  the Principal Actors in all these Plays   some of which were first staged after Volpone  although we cannot know for certain which roles he played  40  In 1610  John Davies of Hereford wrote that  good Will  played  kingly  roles  41  In 1709  Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet s father  42  Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It and the Chorus in Henry V  43  though scholars doubt the sources of the information  44  Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford during his career  In 1596  the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford  Shakespeare was living in the parish of St  Helen s  Bishopsgate  north of the River Thames  45  He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599  the year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there  46  By 1604  he had moved north of the river again  to an area north of St Paul s Cathedral with many fine houses  There he rented rooms from a French Huguenot called Christopher Mountjoy  a maker of ladies  wigs and other headgear  47  Later years and death Rowe was the first biographer to pass down the tradition that Shakespeare retired to Stratford some years before his death  48  but retirement from all work was uncommon at that time  49  and Shakespeare continued to visit London  48  In 1612 he was called as a witness in a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy s daughter  Mary  50  In March 1613 he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory  51  and from November 1614 he was in London for several weeks with his son in law  John Hall  52  Shakespeare s funerary monument in Stratford upon Avon  After 1606 1607  Shakespeare wrote fewer plays  and none are attributed to him after 1613  53  His last three plays were collaborations  probably with John Fletcher  54  who succeeded him as the house playwright for the King s Men  55  Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 56  and was survived by his wife and two daughters  Susanna had married a physician  John Hall  in 1607  57  and Judith had married Thomas Quiney  a vintner  two months before Shakespeare s death  58  In his will  Shakespeare left the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna  59  The terms instructed that she pass it down intact to  the first son of her body   60  The Quineys had three children  all of whom died without marrying  61  The Halls had one child  Elizabeth  who married twice but died without children in 1670  ending Shakespeare s direct line  62  Shakespeare s will scarcely mentions his wife  Anne  who was probably entitled to one third of his estate automatically  63  He did make a point  however  of leaving her  my second best bed   a bequest that has led to much speculation  64  Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne  whereas others believe that the second best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance  65  Shakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death  66  The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones  which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008  67  Shakespeare s grave  Good frend for Iesvs sake forbeare To digg the dvst encloased heare Bleste be ye man yt spares thes stones And cvrst be he yt moves my bones  68   Modern spelling  Good friend  for Jesus  sake forbear    To dig the dust enclosed here    Blessed be the man that spares these stones    And cursed be he that moves my bones   Sometime before 1623  a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall  with a half effigy of him in the act of writing  Its plaque compares him to Nestor  Socrates  and Virgil  69  In 1623  in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio  the Droeshout engraving was published  70  Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world  including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets  Corner in Westminster Abbey  Plays Main articles  Shakespeare s plays and Shakespeare s collaborations Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point  and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same  mostly early and late in his career  71  Some attributions  such as Titus Andronicus and the early history plays  remain controversial  while The Two Noble Kinsmen and the lost Cardenio have well attested contemporary documentation  Textual evidence also supports the view that several of the plays were revised by other writers after their original composition  The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI  written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama  Shakespeare s plays are difficult to date  however  72  and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus  The Comedy of Errors  The Taming of the Shrew and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare s earliest period  73  His first histories  which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed s Chronicles of England  Scotland  and Ireland  74  dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty  75  The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists  especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe  by the traditions of medieval drama  and by the plays of Seneca  76 The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models  but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found  though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story  77  Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona  in which two friends appear to approve of rape  78  the Shrew s story of the taming of a woman s independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics and directors  79  Oberon  Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing  By William Blake  c  1786  Tate Britain  Shakespeare s early classical and Italianate comedies  containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences  give way in the mid 1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies  80 A Midsummer Night s Dream is a witty mixture of romance  fairy magic  and comic lowlife scenes  81  Shakespeare s next comedy  the equally romantic Merchant of Venice  contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock  which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences  82  The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing  83  the charming rural setting of As You Like It  and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare s sequence of great comedies  84  After the lyrical Richard II  written almost entirely in verse  Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s  Henry IV  parts 1 and 2  and Henry V  His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes  prose and poetry  and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work  85  This period begins and ends with two tragedies  Romeo and Juliet  the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence  love  and death  86  and Julius Caesar based on Sir Thomas North s 1579 translation of Plutarch s Parallel Lives which introduced a new kind of drama  87  According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro  in Julius Caesar  the various strands of politics  character  inwardness  contemporary events  even Shakespeare s own reflections on the act of writing  began to infuse each other   88  Hamlet  Horatio  Marcellus  and the Ghost of Hamlet s Father  Henry Fuseli  1780 5  Kunsthaus Z rich  In the early 17th century  Shakespeare wrote the so called  problem plays  Measure for Measure  Troilus and Cressida  and All s Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies  89  Many critics believe that Shakespeare s greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art  The titular hero of one of Shakespeare s most famous tragedies  Hamlet  has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character  especially for his famous soliloquy  To be or not to be  that is the question   90  Unlike the introverted Hamlet  whose fatal flaw is hesitation  the heroes of the tragedies that followed  Othello and King Lear  are undone by hasty errors of judgement  91  The plots of Shakespeare s tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws  which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves  92  In Othello  the villain Iago stokes Othello s sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him  93  In King Lear  the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers  initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear s youngest daughter Cordelia  According to the critic Frank Kermode   the play offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty   94  In Macbeth  the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare s tragedies  95  uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife  Lady Macbeth  to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne  until their own guilt destroys them in turn  96  In this play  Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure  His last major tragedies  Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus  contain some of Shakespeare s finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T  S  Eliot  97  In his final period  Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays  Cymbeline  The Winter s Tale and The Tempest  as well as the collaboration  Pericles  Prince of Tyre  Less bleak than the tragedies  these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s  but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors  98  Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare s part  but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day  99  Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays  Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen  probably with John Fletcher  100  Performances Main article  Shakespeare in performance It is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays  The title page of the 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes  101  After the plagues of 1592 3  Shakespeare s plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch  north of the Thames  102  Londoners flocked there to see the first part of Henry IV  Leonard Digges recording   Let but Falstaff come  Hal  Poins  the rest   and you scarce shall have a room   103  When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord  they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre  the first playhouse built by actors for actors  on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark  104  The Globe opened in autumn 1599  with Julius Caesar one of the first plays staged  Most of Shakespeare s greatest post 1599 plays were written for the Globe  including Hamlet  Othello and King Lear  105  The reconstructed Globe Theatre  London  After the Lord Chamberlain s Men were renamed the King s Men in 1603  they entered a special relationship with the new King James  Although the performance records are patchy  the King s Men performed seven of Shakespeare s plays at court between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605  including two performances of The Merchant of Venice  106  After 1608  they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer  107  The indoor setting  combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques  allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices  In Cymbeline  for example  Jupiter descends  in thunder and lightning  sitting upon an eagle  he throws a thunderbolt  The ghosts fall on their knees   108  The actors in Shakespeare s company included the famous Richard Burbage  William Kempe  Henry Condell and John Heminges  Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare s plays  including Richard III  Hamlet  Othello  and King Lear  109  The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in Romeo and Juliet and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing  among other characters  110  He was replaced around the turn of the 16th century by Robert Armin  who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear  111  In 1613  Sir Henry Wotton recorded that Henry VIII  was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony   112  On 29 June  however  a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground  an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision  112  Textual sources Title page of the First Folio  1623  Copper engraving of Shakespeare by Martin Droeshout  In 1623  John Heminges and Henry Condell  two of Shakespeare s friends from the King s Men  published the First Folio  a collected edition of Shakespeare s plays  It contained 36 texts  including 18 printed for the first time  113  Many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versions flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves  114  No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions  which the First Folio describes as  stol n and surreptitious copies   115 Alfred Pollard termed some of them  bad quartos  because of their adapted  paraphrased or garbled texts  which may in places have been reconstructed from memory  116  Where several versions of a play survive  each differs from the other  The differences may stem from copying or printing errors  from notes by actors or audience members  or from Shakespeare s own papers  117  In some cases  for example Hamlet  Troilus and Cressida and Othello  Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions  In the case of King Lear  however  while most modern additions do conflate them  the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto  that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both  arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion  118  Poems In 1593 and 1594  when the theatres were closed because of plague  Shakespeare published two narrative poems on erotic themes  Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece  He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley  Earl of Southampton  In Venus and Adonis  an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus  while in The Rape of Lucrece  the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin  119  Influenced by Ovid s Metamorphoses  120  the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust  121  Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare s lifetime  A third narrative poem  A Lover s Complaint  in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor  was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609  Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover s Complaint  Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects  122 The Phoenix and the Turtle  printed in Robert Chester s 1601 Love s Martyr  mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover  the faithful turtle dove  In 1599  two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim  published under Shakespeare s name but without his permission  123  Sonnets Main article  Shakespeare s sonnets Title page from 1609 edition of Shake Speares Sonnets  Published in 1609  the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeare s non dramatic works to be printed  Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed  but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership  124  Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599  Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare s  sugred Sonnets among his private friends   125  Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare s intended sequence  126  He seems to have planned two contrasting series  one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion  the  dark lady    and one about conflicted love for a fair young man  the  fair youth    It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals  or if the authorial  I  who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself  though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets  Shakespeare unlocked his heart   127   Shall I compare thee to a summer s day  Thou art more lovely and more temperate      Lines from Shakespeare s Sonnet 18  128  The 1609 edition was dedicated to a  Mr  W H    credited as  the only begetter  of the poems  It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher  Thomas Thorpe  whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page  nor is it known who Mr  W H  was  despite numerous theories  or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication  129  Critics praise the Sonnets as a profound meditation on the nature of love  sexual passion  procreation  death  and time  130  Style Main article  Shakespeare s style Shakespeare s first plays were written in the conventional style of the day  He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama  131  The poetry depends on extended  sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits  and the language is often rhetorical written for actors to declaim rather than speak  The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus  in the view of some critics  often hold up the action  for example  and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted  132  Soon  however  Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes  The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self declaration of Vice in medieval drama  At the same time  Richard s vivid self awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare s mature plays  133  No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style  Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career  with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles  134  By the time of Romeo and Juliet  Richard II  and A Midsummer Night s Dream in the mid 1590s  Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry  He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself  Pity by William Blake  1795  Tate Britain  is an illustration of two similes in Macbeth   And pity  like a naked new born babe    Striding the blast  or heaven s cherubim  hors d   Upon the sightless couriers of the air   Shakespeare s standard poetic form was blank verse  composed in iambic pentameter  In practice  this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line  spoken with a stress on every second syllable  The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones  It is often beautiful  but its sentences tend to start  pause  and finish at the end of lines  with the risk of monotony  135  Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse  he began to interrupt and vary its flow  This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet  Shakespeare uses it  for example  to convey the turmoil in Hamlet s mind  136  Sir  in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep  Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes  Rashly  And prais d be rashness for it let us know Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well    Hamlet  Act 5  Scene 2  4 8 136  After Hamlet  Shakespeare varied his poetic style further  particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies  The literary critic A  C  Bradley described this style as  more concentrated  rapid  varied  and  in construction  less regular  not seldom twisted or elliptical   137  In the last phase of his career  Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects  These included run on lines  irregular pauses and stops  and extreme variations in sentence structure and length  138  In Macbeth  for example  the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another   was the hope drunk  Wherein you dressed yourself    1 7 35 38       pity  like a naked new born babe  Striding the blast  or heaven s cherubim  hors d  Upon the sightless couriers of the air      1 7 21 25   The listener is challenged to complete the sense  138  The late romances  with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot  inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another  clauses are piled up  subject and object are reversed  and words are omitted  creating an effect of spontaneity  139  Shakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre  140  Like all playwrights of the time  he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed  141  He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible  This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation  cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama  142  As Shakespeare s mastery grew  he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech  He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays  however  In Shakespeare s late romances  he deliberately returned to a more artificial style  which emphasised the illusion of theatre  143  Influence Main article  Shakespeare s influence Macbeth Consulting the Vision of the Armed Head  By Henry Fuseli  1793 94  Folger Shakespeare Library  Washington  Shakespeare s work has made a lasting impression on later theatre and literature  In particular  he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation  plot  language  and genre  144  Until Romeo and Juliet  for example  romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy  145  Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events  but Shakespeare used them to explore characters  minds  146  His work heavily influenced later poetry  The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama  though with little success  Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as  feeble variations on Shakespearean themes   147  Shakespeare influenced novelists such as Thomas Hardy  William Faulkner  and Charles Dickens  The American novelist Herman Melville s soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare  his Captain Ahab in Moby Dick is a classic tragic hero  inspired by King Lear  148  Scholars have identified 20 000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare s works  These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi  Otello and Falstaff  whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays  149  Shakespeare has also inspired many painters  including the Romantics and the Pre Raphaelites  The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli  a friend of William Blake  even translated Macbeth into German  150  The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology  in particular that of Hamlet  for his theories of human nature  151  In Shakespeare s day  English grammar  spelling and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now  152  and his use of language helped shape modern English  153 Samuel Johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his A Dictionary of the English Language  the first serious work of its type  154  Expressions such as  with bated breath   Merchant of Venice  and  a foregone conclusion   Othello  have found their way into everyday English speech  155  Critical reputation Main articles  Shakespeare s reputation and Timeline of Shakespeare criticism  He was not of an age  but for all time    Ben Jonson 156  Shakespeare was not revered in his lifetime  but he received his share of praise  157  In 1598  the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English writers as  the most excellent  in both comedy and tragedy  158  And the authors of the Parnassus plays at St John s College  Cambridge  numbered him with Chaucer  Gower and Spenser  159  In the First Folio  Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the  Soul of the age  the applause  delight  the wonder of our stage   though he had remarked elsewhere that  Shakespeare wanted art   A recently garlanded statue of William Shakespeare in Lincoln Park  Chicago  typical of many created in the 19th and early 20th century  Between the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century  classical ideas were in vogue  As a result  critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson  160 Thomas Rymer  for example  condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic  Nevertheless  poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly  saying of Jonson   I admire him  but I love Shakespeare   161  For several decades  Rymer s view held sway  but during the 18th century  critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius  A series of scholarly editions of his work  notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790  added to his growing reputation  162  By 1800  he was firmly enshrined as the national poet  163  In the 18th and 19th centuries  his reputation also spread abroad  Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire  Goethe  Stendhal and Victor Hugo  164  During the Romantic era  Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge  and the critic August Wilhelm Schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of German Romanticism  165  In the 19th century  critical admiration for Shakespeare s genius often bordered on adulation  166   That King Shakespeare   the essayist Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1840   does not he shine  in crowned sovereignty  over us all  as the noblest  gentlest  yet strongest of rallying signs  indestructible   167  The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale  168  The playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as  bardolatry   He claimed that the new naturalism of Ibsen s plays had made Shakespeare obsolete  169  The modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century  far from discarding Shakespeare  eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant garde  The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays  Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare  The poet and critic T  S  Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeare s  primitiveness  in fact made him truly modern  170  Eliot  along with G  Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism  led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeare s imagery  In the 1950s  a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for  post modern  studies of Shakespeare  171  By the eighties  Shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism  feminism  New Historicism  African American studies  and queer studies  172  173  Speculation about Shakespeare Authorship Main article  Shakespeare authorship question Around 150 years after Shakespeare s death  doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him  174  Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon  Christopher Marlowe  and Edward de Vere  17th Earl of Oxford  175  Several  group theories  have also been proposed  176  Only a small minority of academics believe there is reason to question the traditional attribution  177  but interest in the subject  particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship  continues into the 21st century  178  Religion Main article  William Shakespeare s religion Some scholars claim that members of Shakespeare s family were Catholics  at a time when Catholic practice was against the law  179  Shakespeare s mother  Mary Arden  certainly came from a pious Catholic family  The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by John Shakespeare  found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street  The document is now lost  however  and scholars differ as to its authenticity  180  In 1591 the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church  for fear of process for debt   a common Catholic excuse  181  In 1606 the name of William s daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford  181  Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare s Catholicism in his plays  but the truth may be impossible to prove either way  182  Sexuality Main article  Sexuality of William Shakespeare Few details of Shakespeare s sexuality are known  At 18  he married the 26 year old Anne Hathaway  who was pregnant  Susanna  the first of their three children  was born six months later on 26 May 1583  Over the centuries some readers have posited that Shakespeare s sonnets are autobiographical  183  and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man  Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than sexual love  184  The 26 so called  Dark Lady  sonnets  addressed to a married woman  are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons  185  Portraiture Main article  Portraits of William Shakespeare There is no written description of Shakespeare s physical appearance and no evidence that he ever commissioned a portrait  so the Droeshout engraving  which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness  186  and his Stratford monument provide the best evidence of his appearance  From the 18th century  the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare  That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits  as well as misattributions  repaintings and relabelling of portraits of other people  187  List of works Further information  William Shakespeare bibliography and Chronology of Shakespeare s plays Classification of the plays The Plays of William Shakespeare  By Sir John Gilbert  1849  Shakespeare s works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623  listed below according to their folio classification as comedies  histories and tragedies  188  Two plays not included in the First Folio  The Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles  Prince of Tyre  are now accepted as part of the canon  with scholars agreed that Shakespeare made a major contribution to their composition  189  No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio  In the late 19th century  Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances  and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies  his term is often used  190  These plays and the associated Two Noble Kinsmen are marked with an asterisk     below  In 1896  Frederick S  Boas coined the term  problem plays  to describe four plays  All s Well That Ends Well  Measure for Measure  Troilus and Cressida and Hamlet  191   Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies   he wrote   We may therefore borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare s problem plays   192  The term  much debated and sometimes applied to other plays  remains in use  though Hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy  193  The other problem plays are marked below with a double dagger      Plays thought to be only partly written by Shakespeare are marked with a dagger     below  Other works occasionally attributed to him are listed as apocrypha
