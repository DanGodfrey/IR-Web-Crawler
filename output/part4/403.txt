published as a broadsheet on 15 September 1964   with a logo featuring a glowing orange disc  8  9  It was launched by owners IPC  International Publishing Corporation  to replace the failing Daily Herald  The new paper was intended to add a readership of  social radicals  to the Herald s  political radicals   10  According to The Times  the brash new paper  burst forth with tremendous energy   11  Launching with a readership of 3 5m  the large initial print run was pinned down to  curiosity  and the  advantage of novelty   11  However  the paper did not live up to IPC s expectations and its circulation continued to decline  By 1969  The Sun was losing even more money than the Herald had previously and IPC decided to sell  The tycoon Robert Maxwell  eager to buy a British newspaper  offered to take it off their hands and retain its commitment to the Labour party  but admitted there would be redundancies  especially among the printers  Rupert Murdoch had bought the News of the World  a sensationalist Sunday newspaper  the previous year  but the presses in the basement of his building in London s Bouverie Street sat idle six days a week  12  Seizing the opportunity to increase his presence on Fleet Street  he made an agreement with the print unions  promising fewer redundancies if he acquired the newspaper  He assured IPC that he would publish a  straightforward  honest newspaper  which would continue to support Labour  IPC  under pressure from the unions  rejected Maxwell s offer  and Murdoch bought the paper for  800 000  to be paid in instalments  12  He would later remark   I am constantly amazed at the ease with which I entered British newspapers   13  The Daily Herald had been printed in Manchester since 1930  as was the Sun after its launch in 1964  but Murdoch stopped printing in Manchester in 1969 which put the ageing Bouverie Street presses under extreme pressure as circulation grew   edit  The early Murdoch years Murdoch appointed Larry Lamb as his first editor  Lamb was scathing in his opinion of the Mirror  where he had recently been employed as a senior sub editor  He shared Murdoch s view that the measure of a paper s quality was best measured by its sales  and he regarded the Mirror as overstaffed  and primarily aimed at an ageing readership  Lamb hastily recruited a staff of about 125 reporters  who were mostly selected for their availability rather than their ability  14  This was about a quarter of what the Mirror then employed  and Murdoch had to draft in staff on loan from his Australian papers  Murdoch immediately relaunched The Sun as a tabloid  and ran it as a sister paper to the News of the World  13 The Sun used the same printing presses  and the two papers were now managed together at senior executive levels  The tabloid Sun first published on 17 November 1969  with a front page headlined  HORSE DOPE SENSATION    an  exclusive  in which a racing trainer admitted he was doping his horses  The paper copied its rival The Daily Mirror in several ways  It was the same size and its masthead had the title in white on a red rectangle of the same colour as the Daily Mirror  The Mirror s  Lively Letters  was matched by  Liveliest Letters   and the comic strip  Garth  by a comic strip  Scarth  featuring a frequently naked woman  Later strips included Striker  set in the world of football  Axa  about a barbarian woman in a post apocalyptic world  H gar the Horrible  the comic adventures of a home loving Viking warrior  and George and Lynne  a domestic gag a day strip about a couple and their friends and neighbours  George and Lynne were normally pictured naked but discreetly covered  Sex was used as an important element in marketing the paper from the start  While the Daily Mirror frequently featured a pin up photograph of a young woman in bikini or lingerie  ostensibly as a fashion item  The Sun dispensed with the excuses  it featured what were openly glamour photographs of women  wearing fewer clothes than their Mirror counterparts  When the first topless Page Three girl appeared on 17 November 1970  German born Stephanie Rahn  little offence was caused as she was presented as a one off  Birthday Suit Girl  to mark the first anniversary of the relaunched Sun  15  Controversy was only ignited over the next four years when the topless Page Three girl gradually became a regular fixture  and with increasingly risqu  poses  Both feminists and many cultural conservatives saw the pictures as pornographic and misogynistic  A public library in Sowerby Bridge  West Yorkshire  banned the paper because of its  excessive sexual content   15  The Labour MP Alex Lyon waved a copy of The Sun in the House of Commons and suggested the paper could be prosecuted for indecency  Sexually related features such as  Do Men Still Want To Marry A Virgin   and  The Way into a Woman s Bed  began to appear  Serialisations of erotic books were frequent  the publication of extracts from The Sensuous Woman  at a time when copies of the book were being seized by Customs  produced a scandal and a gratifying amount of free publicity  15  Politically  The Sun in the early Murdoch years  remained nominally Labour  It supported the Labour Party led by Harold Wilson in the 1970 General Election  16  with the headline  Why It Must Be Labour  17  but by February 1974 it was calling for a vote for the Conservative Party while suggesting that it might support a Labour Party led by James Callaghan or Roy Jenkins  16  In the October election an editorial asserted   ALL our instincts are left rather than right and we would vote for any able politician who would describe himself as a Social Democrat   16  The editor  Larry Lamb  was originally from a Labour background  with a socialist upbringing while his temporary replacement Bernard Shrimsley  1972 75  was a middle class uncommitted Conservative  An extensive advertising campaign on the ITV network in this period  voiced by actor Christopher Timothy  18  may have helped The Sun to overtake the Daily Mirror s circulation in 1978  19  Despite the industrial relations of the 1970s   the so called  Spanish practices  of the print unions   The Sun was very profitable  enabling Murdoch to expand his operations to the United States from 1973  In 1979 the paper endorsed Margaret Thatcher in the year s general election  at the end of a process which had been underway for some time  though The Sun had not initially been enthusiastic for Mrs Thatcher  On 3 May 1979  it ran the unequivocal front page headline   VOTE TORY THIS TIME   20   edit  The 1980s The Sun s sales grew during the 1980s and the paper was  more outrageous  opinionated and irreverent than anything ever produced in Britain  21  under the editorship of Kelvin MacKenzie  Bingo  introduced in 1981  was a key driver of the circulation rise  The torpedoing of the Belgrano was celebrated on the front page of the British tabloid newspaper The Sun  The Sun became an ardent supporter of Margaret Thatcher and Conservative Party policies and actions  including the Falklands War  The coverage  captured the zeitgeist   according to Roy Greenslade  Assistant Editor at the time though privately an opponent of the war  but was also  xenophobic  bloody minded  ruthless  often reckless  black humoured and ultimately triumphalist   22  One of the paper s best known front pages  published on 4 May 1982  appeared to celebrate the news of the torpedoing of the Argentine ship the General Belgrano during the Falklands War by running the story under the headline  GOTCHA   23  The headline was changed for later editions when the extent of Argentine casualties became known  24 Sunday Times reporter John Shirley witnessed copies of this edition of The Sun being thrown overboard by sailors and marines on HMS Fearless  25  These years were marked by  spectacularly malicious coverage  26  of the Labour Party by The Sun and other newspapers  During the general election of 1983 The Sun ran a front page featuring an unflattering photograph of Michael Foot  then aged almost 70  claiming he was unfit to be Prime Minister on grounds of his age  appearance and policies  alongside the headline  Do You Really Want This Old Fool To Run Britain   27  A year later  in 1984  The Sun made clear its enthusiastic support for the re election of Ronald Reagan as president in the USA  Reagan was two weeks off his 74th birthday when he started his second term  in January 1985  On 1 March 1984 the newspaper extensively quoted a respected American psychiatrist claiming that British left wing politician Tony Benn was  insane   with the psychiatrist discussing various aspects of Benn s supposed pathology  28  The story  which appeared on the day of the Chesterfield byelection in which Benn was standing  was discredited when the psychiatrist quoted by The Sun publicly denounced the article and described the false quotes attributed to him as  absurd   The Sun having apparently fabricated the entire piece  The newspaper made frequent scathing attacks on what the paper called the  loony left  element within the Labour Party 29  and on institutions supposedly controlled by it  Ken Livingstone  the leader of the left wing Greater London Council was described as  the most odious man in Britain  30  in October 1981  31  The Sun  during the Miners  strike of 1984 85  supported the police and the Thatcher government against the striking NUM miners  and in particular the union s president  Arthur Scargill  On 23 May 1984  The Sun prepared a front page with the headline  Mine F hrer  and a photograph of Scargill with his arm in the air  a pose which made him look as though he was giving a Nazi salute  The print workers at The Sun  seeing the cheap smear  refused to print it  32 The Sun strongly supported the April 1986 bombing of Libya by the US  which was launched from British bases  Several civilians were killed during the bombing  Their leader was  Right Ron  Right Maggie   33  In January 1986 Murdoch shut down the Bouverie Street premises of The Sun and News of the World  and moved operations to the new Wapping complex in East London  substituting the electrician s union for the print unions as his production staff s representatives and greatly reducing the number of staff employed to print the papers  a year long picket by sacked workers was eventually defeated  see Wapping dispute   That year  Clare Short attempted in vain to persuade Parliament to outlaw the pictures on Page Three and gained opprobrium from the newspaper for her stand  During the 1987 general election  the Sun ran a mock editorial entitled  Why I m Backing Kinnock  by Stalin   34   edit  Other stories in the 1980s During this period  The Sun gained a reputation for running stories based on few facts  The most blatant example gave the paper one of its best remembered on 13 March 1986   FREDDIE STARR ATE MY HAMSTER   The story alleged that British comedian Freddie Starr had been staying at the home of Vince McCaffrey and his 23 year old girlfriend Lea La Salle in Birchwood  Cheshire  when  after returning from a performance at a nightclub in the early hours he demanded La Salle make him a sandwich  When she refused  he went into the kitchen  put her pet hamster Supersonic between two slices of bread and proceeded to eat it  Starr  in his 2001 autobiography Unwrapped  said he only stayed at McCaffrey s house once  in 1979  and that the incident was a complete fabrication  He wrote   I have never eaten or even nibbled a live hamster  gerbil  guinea pig  mouse  shrew  vole or any other small mammal   35  When the man behind the story  British publicist Max Clifford  was asked about it on television years later  he admitted to making it up and justified the lie as it boosted Starr s career enormously  In 1987  The Sun falsely accused homosexual pop musician Elton John of having sexual relationships with rent boys  In another story it accused him of removing the voice boxes of his guard dogs because their barking kept him awake  Elton sued over both stories and won  1 million in libel damages  then the largest payout in British history  The Sun ran a front page apology on 12 December 1988  under the banner headline  SORRY  ELTON   Gay Church of England clergymen were described in one headline in November 1987 as  Pulpit poofs   Stories frequently speculated on the sexual orientation of famous people  and pop stars in particular  Television personality Piers Morgan  a former editor of the Daily Mirror and of The Sun s Bizarre pop column  has said that during the late 1980s  at Kelvin MacKenzie s behest  he was ordered to speculate on the sexuality of male pop stars for a feature headlined  The Poofs of Pop   He also recalls MacKenzie headlining a January 1989 story about the first homosexual kiss on BBC television soap opera EastEnders  EastBenders   36  describing the kiss between Colin Russell and Guido Smith as a  a homosexual love scene between yuppie poofs     when millions of children were watching   citation needed  On 17 November 1989  The Sun headlined a page 2 news story titled  STRAIGHT SEX CANNOT GIVE YOU AIDS   OFFICIAL   The Sun favourably cited the opinions of Lord Kilbracken  a member of the All Parliamentary Group on AIDS  Lord Kilbracken said that only one person out of the 2 372 AIDS infected individuals mentioned in a specific Department of Health report was not a member of a  high risk group   such as homosexuals and recreational drug users  The Sun also ran an editorial further arguing that  At last the truth can be told    the risk of catching AIDS if you are heterosexual is  statistically invisible   In other words impossible  So now we know   everything else is homosexual propaganda   Although many other British press services covered Lord Kilbracken s public comments  none of them made the argument that the Sun did in its editorial and none of them presented Lord Kilbracken s ideas without context or criticism  37  Critics stated that both The Sun and Lord Kilbracken cherry picked the results from one specific study while ignoring other data reports on HIV infection and not just AIDS infection  which the critics viewed as unethical politicisation of a medical issue  Lord Kilbracken himself criticised The Sun s editorial and the headline of its news story  he stated that while he thought that gay people were more at risk of developing AIDS it was still wrong to imply that no one else could catch the disease  The Press Council condemned the Sun for committing what it called a  gross distortion   The Sun later ran an apology  which they ran on Page 28  Journalist David Randall argued in the textbook The Universal Journalist that the Sun s story was one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent history  putting its own readers in harm s way  37  38   edit  The Hillsborough disaster and its aftermath Further information  Hillsborough disaster The Sun newspaper The Sun  19 April 1989 At the end of the decade  The Sun s coverage of the Hillsborough football stadium disaster in Sheffield on 15 April 1989  in which 96 people died as a result of their injuries  proved to be  as the paper later admitted  the  most terrible  blunder in its history  39  Under a front page headline  The Truth   the paper claimed that some fans picked the pockets of crushed victims  that others urinated on members of the emergency services as they tried to help and that some even assaulted a Police Constable  whilst he was administering the kiss of life to a patient   40  Despite the headline  written by Kelvin MacKenzie  the story was based on allegations either by unnamed and unattributable sources  or hearsay accounts of what named individuals had said   a fact made clear to MacKenzie by Harry Arnold  the reporter who wrote the story  41  Although the disaster occurred in front of TV cameras and a mass of sports reporters  no evidence was produced to substantiate The Sun s allegations  The front page caused outrage in Liverpool  where the paper lost more than three quarters of its estimated 55 000 daily sales and still sells poorly more than twenty years later  around 12 000   41  It is unavailable in many parts of the city  as many newsagents refuse to stock it  42  43  It was revealed in a documentary called Alexei Sayle s Liverpool  aired in September 2008  that many Liverpudlians will not even take the newspaper for free  and those who do may simply burn or tear it up  even though this was almost 20 years after the incident  44  On 7 July 2004  in response to verbal attacks in Liverpool on Wayne Rooney  just before his transfer from Everton to Manchester United  who had sold his life story to The Sun  the paper devoted a full page editorial to an apology for the  awful error  of its Hillsborough coverage and argued that Rooney  who was still only three years old at the time of Hillsborough  should not be punished for its  past sins   In January 2005  The Sun s managing editor Graham Dudman admitting the Hillsborough coverage was  the worst mistake in our history   added   What we did was a terrible mistake  It was a terrible  insensitive  horrible article  with a dreadful headline  but what we d also say is  we have apologised for it  and the entire senior team here now is completely different from the team that put the paper out in 1989   45  In May 2006  Kelvin MacKenzie  Sun editor at the time of the Hillsborough disaster  returned to the paper as a columnist  Furthermore  on 11 January 2007  MacKenzie stated  while a panellist on BBC1 s Question Time  that the apology he made about the coverage was a hollow one  forced upon him by Rupert Murdoch  MacKenzie further claimed he was not sorry  for telling the truth  but he admitted that he did not know whether some Liverpool fans urinated on the police  or robbed victims  46   edit  The 1990s This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   June 2011  The Sun remained loyal to Thatcher right up to her resignation in November 1990  47  despite the party s fall in popularity over the previous year following the introduction of the Community Charge  popularly known as the poll tax   This change to the way local government is funded was vociferously supported by the newspaper  despite widespread opposition   some from Conservative MPs   which is seen as having contributed to Thatcher s own downfall  The tax was quickly repealed by her successor John Major  whom The Sun initially supported enthusiastically  48  believing he was a radical Thatcherite   despite the economy having entered recession at this time  The Sun labelled those attending public protests opposing the tax as  thugs   citation needed  On the day of the general election of 9 April 1992  its front page headline  encapsulating its antipathy towards the Labour leader Neil Kinnock  read  If Kinnock wins today  will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights   Two days later The Sun was so convinced its front page had swung a close election for the Conservatives it declared  It s The Sun Wot Won It   The Sun led with a headline  Now we ve all been screwed by the cabinet  with a reference to Black Wednesday on 17 September 1992  as well as the recent revelations about MP David Mellor being involved in a sex scandal  49  A month later  on 14 October  it attacked Michael Heseltine for the mass coal mine closures  Despite its initial opposition to the closures  until 1997  the newspaper repeatedly called for the implementation of further Thatcherite policies  such as Royal Mail privatisation  50  verification needed  and social security cutbacks  with leaders such as  Peter Lilley is right  we can t carry on like this   51  verification needed  It showed its hostility to the EU  and its approval of public spending cuts  tax cuts  and promotion of right wing ministers to the cabinet  with leaders such as  More of the Redwood  not Deadwood   52  The Sun attacked Labour leader John Smith in February 1994  for saying that more British troops should be sent to Bosnia  The Sun s comment was that  The only serious radicals in British politics these days are the likes of Redwood  Lilley and Portillo   53  verification needed  It also gradually expressed its bitter disillusionment with John Major as Prime Minister  with leaders such as  What fools we were to back John Major   54  Between 1994 and 1996  The Sun s circulation peaked  Its highest average sale was in the week ending 16 July 1994  when the daily figure was 4 305 957  The highest ever one day sale was on 18 November 1995  4 889 118   although the cover price had been cut to 10p  The highest ever one day sale at full price was on 30 March 1996  4 783 359   55  On 22 January 1997  The Sun accused the shadow chancellor Gordon Brown of stealing the Conservatives  ideas by declaring   If all he is offering is Conservative financial restraint  why not vote for the real thing   56  and called the planned windfall tax  which was later imposed by the Labour government   wrongheaded   57  In February 1997 it told Sir Edward Heath  still an MP  to stand down for supporting a National Minimum wage  58   edit  Support for  New Labour  The Sun switched support to Labour on 18 March 1997  six weeks before the General Election victory which saw Labour leader Tony Blair become Prime Minister with a large parliamentary majority  despite the paper having attacked Blair and New Labour up to a month earlier  Its front page headline read THE SUN BACKS BLAIR and its front page editorial made clear that while it still opposed some New Labour policies  such as the Minimum Wage and Devolution  it believed Blair to be  the breath of fresh air this great country needs   59  John Major s Conservatives  it said  were  tired  divided and rudderless   59  Blair  who had radically altered his party s image and policies  noting the influence the paper could have over its readers  political thinking  had courted it  and Murdoch  for some time by granting exclusive interviews and writing columns  In exchange for Rupert Murdoch s support  Blair agreed not to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism   which John Major had withdrawn the country from in September 1992 after barely two years  60  Cabinet Minister Peter Mandelson was  outed  by Matthew Parris  a former Sun columnist  on BBC TV s Newsnight in November 1998  Misjudging public response  The Sun s editor David Yelland demanded to know in a front page editorial whether Britain was governed by a  gay mafia  of a  closed world of men with a mutual self interest   Three days later the paper apologised in another editorial which said The Sun would never again reveal a person s sexuality unless it could be defended on the grounds of  overwhelming public interest   In 2003 the paper was accused of racism by the Government over its criticisms of what it perceived as the  open door  policy on immigration  The attacks came from the Prime Minister s press spokesman Alastair Campbell and the Home Secretary David Blunkett  later a Sun columnist   The paper rebutted the claim  believing that it was not racist to suggest that a  tide  of unchecked illegal immigrants was increasing the risk of terrorist attacks and infectious diseases  It did not help its argument by publishing a front page story on 4 July 2003  under the headline  Swan Bake   which claimed that asylum seekers were slaughtering and eating swans  It later proved to have no basis in fact  Subsequently The Sun published a follow up headlined  Now they re after our fish    Following a Press Complaints Commission adjudication a  clarification  was eventually printed  on page 41  61  Despite being a persistent critic of some of the government s policies  the paper supported Labour in both subsequent elections the party won  It was argued that The Sun backed New Labour at the 1997 General Election because it knew that the Conservatives had no chance of winning  opinion polls had shown a wide Labour lead since late 1992   and if it had urged its readers to vote Conservative  afterwards it would have been seen as having backed a loser  For the 2005 general election  The Sun backed Blair and Labour for a third consecutive election win and vowed to give him  one last chance  to fulfil his promises  despite berating him for several weaknesses including a failure to control immigration  However  it did speak of its hope that the Tories  led by Michael Howard  would one day be fit for a return to government  27  This election  Blair had declared it would be his last as prime minister  resulted in Labour s third successive win but with a much reduced majority  62  The Sun s coverage of Britain s military interventions has been supportive and the  War on Terror  more generally  On 18 December 2008  an editorial piece  The Sun Says  titled  Job well done  declared  Britain is leaving Iraq with its head held very high  as well as  Through the commitment of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown to Iraq  we have shown that Britain DOES still have a major role to play in the world   63   edit  Editorial and production issues in the 2000s Although the anger generated by Page 3 had waned in a generally more permissive society  when Rebekah Wade  now Brooks  became editor in 2003  it was thought it might be dropped  Wade had tried to persuade David Yelland  her immediate predecessors in the job  to scrap the feature  but a model who shared her first name was used on her first day in the post  In 2005 a college in Lewisham  South East London  banned The Sun from the campus because it felt its Page 3 pictures were degrading to women  64  On 22 September 2003 the newspaper appeared to misjudge the public mood surrounding mental health  as well as its affection for former world heavyweight champion boxer Frank Bruno  who had been admitted to hospital  when the headline  Bonkers Bruno Locked Up  appeared on the front page of early editions  The adverse reaction  once the paper had hit the streets on the evening of 21 September  led to the headline being changed for the paper s second edition to the more sympathetic  Sad Bruno In Mental Home   65  The Sun has been openly antagonistic towards other European nations  particularly the French and Germans  During the 1980s and 1990s  the nationalities were routinely described in copy and headlines as  frogs    krauts  or  hun   As the paper is opposed to the EU it has referred to foreign leaders who it deemed hostile to the UK in unflattering terms  Former President Jacques Chirac of France  for instance  was branded  le Worm   An unflattering picture of German chancellor Angela Merkel  taken from the rear  bore the headline  I m Big in the Bumdestag   17 April 2006   Although The Sun was outspoken against the allegations of racism directed at Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty on television reality show Celebrity Big Brother during 2007  the paper captioned a picture on its website  from a Bollywood themed pop video by Hilary Duff   Hilary PoppaDuff   66  a very similar insult to that directed at Shetty  On 7 January 2009  The Sun ran an exclusive front page story claiming that participants in a discussion on Ummah com  a British Muslim internet forum  had made a  hate hit list  of British Jews to be targeted by extremists over the Gaza War  It was claimed that  Those listed  on the forum  should treat it very seriously  Expect a hate campaign and intimidation by 20 or 30 thugs   The UK magazine Private Eye claimed that Glen Jenvey  a man quoted by The Sun as a terrorism expert  who had been posting to the forum under the pseudonym  Abuislam   was the only forum member promoting a hate campaign while other members promoted peaceful advocacy  such as writing  polite letters   The story has since been removed from The Sun s website following complaints to the UK s Press Complaints Commission  67  On 9 December 2010  The Sun published a front page story claiming that terrorist group Al Qaeda had threatened a terrorist attack on Granada Television in Manchester to disrupt the episode of the soap opera Coronation Street to be transmitted live that evening  The paper cited unnamed sources  claiming  cops are throwing a ring of steel around tonight s live episode of Coronation Street over fears it has been targeted by Al Qaeda   68  Later that morning  however  Greater Manchester Police categorically denied having  been made aware of any threat from Al Qaeda or any other proscribed organisation   69 The Sun published a small correction on 28 December  admitting  that while cast and crew were subject to full body searches  there was no specific threat from Al Qaeda as we reported   70  The apology had been negotiated by the Press Complaints Commission  71  For the day following the 2011 Norway attacks The Sun produced an early edition blaming the massacre on al Qaeda  Later the perpetrator was revealed to be Anders Behring Breivik  a Norwegian nationalist  In May 2008 the Wapping presses rolled for the last time and London printing was transferred to Broxbourne in Hertfordshire  on the outskirts of London  where News International had built what is claimed to be the largest printing centre in Europe with 12 presses  Broxbourne also produces the Times and Sunday Times  Daily and Sunday Telegraph  Wall Street Journal Europe  also now a Murdoch newspaper   London s Evening Standard and local papers  Northern printing had earlier been switched to a new plant at Knowsley on Merseyside and the Scottish Sun to another new plant at Motherwell near Glasgow  The three print centres represent a  600 million investment by NI and allowed all the titles to be produced with every page in full colour from 2008 The Broxbourne plant is capable of producing one million copies an hour of a 120 page tabloid newspaper  In early 2011 the company vacated the Wapping building  which in November 2011 was put on the market for a reputed  200 million   edit  2009  The Sun returns to the Conservatives Politically  the paper s stance was less clear under Prime Minister Gordon Brown who had succeeded Blair in June 2007  Its editorials were critical of many of Brown s policies and often more supportive of those of Conservative leader David Cameron  Rupert Murdoch  head of The Sun s parent company News Corporation  speaking at a 2007 meeting with the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications  which was investigating media ownership and the news  said that he acts as a  traditional proprietor   This means he exercises editorial control on major issues such as which political party to back in a general election or which policy to adopt on Europe  72  Further information  Political activities of Rupert Murdoch With  Broken Britain  controversies on issues like crime  immigration and public service failures in the news  on 30 September 2009  following Brown s speech at the Labour Party Conference  The Sun  under the banner  Labour s Lost It  announced that it no longer supported the Labour Party  73   The Sun believes   and prays   that the Conservative leadership can put the great back into Great Britain   though the Scottish Sun was more equivocal in its editorial  74  75  That day at the Labour Party Conference  Union Leader Tony Woodley responded by ripping up a copy of that edition of The Sun remarking as he did so in reference to the newspaper s Hillsborough Disaster controversy   In Liverpool we learnt a long time ago what to do   76  The magazine Private Eye noted that the switch came shortly after a number of Conservative announcements that echoed James Murdoch s anti BBC stance that had been the core of his MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the 2009 Edinburgh International Television Festival  citation needed  One attack on Gordon Brown backfired at around this time  After criticising him for mis spelling a dead soldier s mother s name  77 The Sun was then forced to apologise for mis spelling the same name on their website  78  The Scottish Sun did not back either Labour or the Conservatives  with its editorial stating it was  yet to be convinced  by the Conservative opposition  and editor David Dinsmore asking in an interview  what is David Cameron going to do for Scotland    79  80  Dinsmore also stated that the paper supported the Union  and was unlikely to back the Scottish National Party  During the campaign for the United Kingdom general election  2010  The Independent ran ads declaring that  Rupert Murdoch won t decide this election   you will   In response James Murdoch and Rebekah Wade  appeared unannounced and uninvited on the editorial floor  of the Independent  and had an energetic conversation with its editor Simon Kelner  81  Several days later the Independent reported The Sun s failure to report its own YouGov poll result which said that  if people thought Mr Clegg s party had a significant chance of winning the election  the Liberal Democrats would win 49  of the vote  and with it a landslide majority  82  On election day  6 May 2010   The Sun urged its readers to vote for David Cameron s  modern and positive  Conservatives in order to save Britain from  disaster  which the paper thought the country would face if the Labour government was re elected  83  The election ended in the first hung parliament for 34 years  with the Tories having the most seats and votes but being 20 seats short of an overall majority  They finally came to power on 11 May when Gordon Brown stepped down as prime minister  paving the way for David Cameron to become prime minister by forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats  84   edit  Fallout from the News of the World scandal Following the News of the World phone hacking affair that led to the closure of that paper on 10 July 2011  there was speculation that News International would launch a Sunday edition of The Sun to replace the News of the World  85  The internet URLs sunonsunday co uk  thesunonsunday co uk and thesunonsunday com were registered on 5 July 2011 by News International Newspapers Limited  86  A similar URL sunonsunday com is not affiliated  having been registered in Italy on 24 September 2007  On 18 July 2011  the LulzSecurity group hacked The Sun s website  where they posted a fake news story of Rupert Murdoch s death before redirecting the website to their Twitter page  The group also targeted the website of The Times  87  On 28 January 2012  police arrested four current and former staff members of The Sun  as part of a probe in which journalists paid police officers for information  a police officer was also arrested in the probe  The Sun staffers arrested were crime editor Mike Sullivan  head of news Chris Pharo  former deputy editor Fergus Shanahan  and former managing editor Graham Dudman  who since became a columnist and media writer  All five arrested were held on suspicion of corruption  Police also searched the offices of News International  the publishers of The Sun  as part of a continuing investigation into the News of the World scandal  88  89  On 11 February 2012  five senior journalists at The Sun were arrested  including the deputy editor  as part of Operation Elveden  the investigation into payments to UK public servants   90  Coinciding with a visit to The Sun newsroom on 17 February 2012  Murdoch announced via an email that the arrested journalists  who had been suspended  would return to work as nothing had been proved against them  5  He also told staff in the email that The Sun on Sunday would be launched  very shortly   5  it was launched on 26 February 2012  91  On 27 February 2012  the day after the debut of The Sun on Sunday  Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers told the Leveson Inquiry that police were investigating a  network of corrupt officials  as part of their inquiries into phone hacking and police corruption  She said evidence suggested a  culture of illegal payments  at The Sun

the paper sells for 30p  The Scottish Sun is often referred to as  a downmarket  English based tabloid  by the Daily Record  It duplicates much of the content of the England and Wales edition but with additional coverage of Scottish news and sport  The launch editor was Jack Irvine who had been recruited from The Daily Record  Irvine went on to become Managing Director of News International Scotland before launching his own communications company  Media House International  in 1991 In the early 1990s  the Scottish edition became notable as the first major newspaper to declare support for the pro independence Scottish National Party  At the time the paper elsewhere continued to support the Conservatives  who were then becoming an increasingly marginalised force in Scotland  This stance  however  became somewhat problematic following The Sun s adoption of support for Labour elsewhere in Britain  given that the SNP were seen as Labour s main challengers and fiercest rivals in Scotland  The Scottish edition was forced to employ some convoluted logic to justify its eventual withdrawal of support for the SNP in favour of pro union Labour  However  the Scottish Sun had performed a major U turn by the time of the 2007 Scottish election  in which its front page featured a hangman s noose in the shape of an SNP logo  stating  Vote SNP today and you put Scotland s head in the noose   The Scottish Sun has now voiced its support for the SNP in the 2011 election  103  In football the newspaper got banned from Heart of Midlothian s football ground Tynecastle for stirring up issues at the Edinburgh club involving their owner Vladimir Romanov  Two years later they were stirring up life for the Edinburgh outfit again as they made a back page report that manager Csaba Laszlo was on the verge of leaving the club after a meeting with the owner Vladimir Romanov over transfer fees for the following season  It turned out that the pair did not even meet until the day after The Sun made this false report  As of May 2010  daily circulation is approximately 340 000  104  On 19 April 2011  the Scottish Sun once again came out in support for the SNP at the 2011 Holyrood elections  stating  Play it again  Salm     He is ambitious for this country and has the drive  the personality and the policies to lead us through these troubled times   in reference to SNP leader Alex Salmond s pitch for a second term of office  105   edit  The Irish Sun There is also an Irish edition  based in Dublin with a regional edition for Northern Ireland  known as the Irish Sun  It shares some content   namely glamour and showbiz   with the British edition  but has mainly Irish news and editorial content  as well as sport and advertising  It often views stories in a very different light to those being reported in the British editions  One notable example is how the release of the film The Wind That Shakes the Barley was covered  with the British editions describing it as  designed to drag the reputation of our nation through the mud  and  the most pro IRA ever   106  whereas the Irish edition praised the film describing it as giving  the Brits a tanning   107  It uses a slightly bigger sheet size than the British version  and costs  1   edit  Polish edition Main article  Polski Sun In June 2008  The Sun became the first national newspaper dubious   discuss  to produce a Polish language version 108   Polski Sun   Six editions were produced for Poland s group matches in the Euro 2008 football tournament   edit  Earlier and other newspapers with  Sun  in the title Main article  Sun  disambiguation  Newspapers and media groups The first newspaper to carry The Sun masthead was published  by John Heriot  in 1792 by the Pitt government to counter the pro revolutionary press at that time  Publication ceased in 1806 The first modern use of the word Sun as a British newspaper title was the Student Newspaper of The Birmingham College of Advanced Technology  which became Aston University in 1966   The Birmingham Sun   SUN stood for Student Union Newspaper and was founded in 1951 In South Africa  two newspapers take their inspiration from The Sun  including the name  The Daily Sun  Johannesburg  is the country s biggest selling daily newspaper  and by far the most sensationalist  Die Kaapse Son  Cape Town  started out as a weekly newspaper  but became so successful that it eventually became a daily  Two regional  weekly  editions  respectively in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein  were less successful  and have folded  edit  See also London portal
