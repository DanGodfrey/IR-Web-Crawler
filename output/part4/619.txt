subject of study by scholars and institutions  Inequality between male and female workers in the US has decreased considerably over the last several decades 1   inequality between black and white Americans has stagnated during that time  2  although not among other races   but data from a number of sources  3  indicate that income inequality over all has grown significantly since the late 1970s   4  5  6  7  8  after several decades of stability 9  10   While inequality has risen among most developed countries  and especially English speaking ones  it is highest in the United States  11  12  13  While post 1970s increase in inequality  sometimes called the Great Divergence  has not been caused by a widening gap between the poor and middle class 14   but between the middle class and top earners  with disparity becoming more extreme the further one goes up in the income distribution  15  A 2011 study by the CBO found that the top earning 1  of households gained about 275  after federal taxes and income transfers over a period between 1979 and 2007   although this number has decreased somewhat since 2007 as a result of the Great Recession 16    From 1992 to 2007 the top 400 earners in the U S  saw their income increase 392  and their average tax rate reduced by 37   17  The share of total income in America going to the lower earning 80  of American households  also after federal taxes and income transfers  has dropped to less than 1 2 in 2007  18  Scholars and others differ as the causes  solutions  and the significance of the trend  19  20  which in 2011 helped ignite the  Occupy  protest movement  While education and increased demand for skilled labor is often cited as a cause  21   some emphasize public policy  others believe its causes are not well understood  22  Inequality has been described both as irrelevant in the face of economic opportunity  or social mobility  in America and as a cause of the decline in that opportunity  23  24  Contents

History Share of pre tax household income received by the top 1   top 0 1  and top 0 01   between 1917 and 2005  25  26  The level of concentration of income in America has not been constant throughout its history  Going back to the early 20th Century  when income statistics started to become available  there has been a  great economic arc  from high inequality  to relative equality and back again   in the words of Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman 27   In 1915  an era in which the Rockefellers and Carnegies dominated American industry  the richest 1  of Americans earned roughly 18  of all income  By 2007  the top 1  account for 24  of all income  28  In between  their share fell below 10   The first era of inequality lasted roughly from the post civil war era   the Gilded Age   to sometime around 1937  But from about 1937 to 1947    a period that has been dubbed the  Great Compression  29     income inequality in America fell dramatically  Highly progressive New Deal taxation  the strengthening of unions  and regulation of the National War Labor Board during World War II raised the income of the poor and working class and lowered that of top earners  30  This  middle class society  of relatively low level of inequality remained fairly steady for about three decades ending in late 1970s 9  29  31   the product of relatively high wages for the US working class and political support for income leveling government policies  Wages remained relatively high because of lack of foreign competition for American manufacturing  lack of low skilled immigrant workers 32   competition for US workers in general  and   arguably most important   strong trade unions  By 1947 more than a third of non farm workers were union members  33  and unions both raised average wages for their membership  and indirectly and to a lesser extent  raised wages for workers in similar occupations not represented by unions  34  Scholars believe political support for equalizing government policies was provided by high voter turnout from union voting drives  the support of the otherwise conservative South for the New Deal  and prestige that the massive mobilization and victory of World War II had given the government  35  The return to high inequality    or what Krugman and journalist Timothy Noah have referred as the  Great Divergence  28     began in the late 1970s  During this time income grew more unequal almost continuously except during the economic recessions in 1990 91  2001  Dot com bubble   and 2007 sub prime bust  36  The Great Divergence differs in some ways from the pre Depression era inequality  Before 1937 a larger share of top earners income came from capital  interest  dividends  income from rent  capital gains   Post 1970  income of high income taxpayers comes predominantly from  labor   i e  employment compensation  37  Until 2011  the Great Divergence had not been a major political issue in America  though stagnation of middle class income was  In 2009 the Barack Obama administration White House Middle Class Working Families Task Force convened to focus on economic issues specifically affecting middle income Americans  In 2011  the Occupy movement drew considerable attention to income inequality in the country   edit  Measurement  edit  Indicators Inflation adjusted increase in after tax household income between 1979 and 2005 for the top 1  and the four of the five quintiles  38  This graph shows the income of the given percentiles from 1947 to 2010 in 2010 dollars  The 2 columns of numbers in the right margin are the cumulative growth 1970 2008 and the annual growth rate over that period  The vertical scale is logarithmic  which makes constant percentage growth appear as a straight line  From 1947 to 1970  all percentiles grew at essentially the same rate  the light  straight lines for the different percentiles for those years all have the same slope  Since then  there has been substantial divergence  with different percentiles of the income distribution growing at different rates  This plot was created by combining data from the US Census Bureau 39  and the US Internal Revenue Service 40   There are systematic differences between these two sources  but the differences are small relative to the scale of this plot  41  A number of studies by the US Department of Commerce  Congressional Budget Office  CBO   and Internal Revenue Service  have found that the distribution of income in the United States   most commonly measured by household or individual   has become increasingly unequal since the 1970s  ONe of the most recent and comprehensive studies on the change in income inequality in America was a 2011 study by the Congressional Budget Office  CBO      Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007    It chose the two years because they both preceded an economic recession and so both were periods of  similar overall economic activity  42    The report found that real household income after federal taxes and including government transfers  payments from Social Security  unemployment insurance  etc  43  44   grew by 62   However  income of households in the top 1 percent of earners grew by 275   compared to 65  for the next 19 percent  just under 40  for the next 60 percent  18  for the bottom fifth of households   As a result of that uneven income growth   the report noted   the share of total after tax income received by the 1 percent of the population in households with the highest income more than doubled between 1979 and 2007  whereas the share received by low  and middle income households declined   The share of income received by the top 1 percent grew from about 8  in 1979 to over 17  in 2007  The share received by other 19  of households in the highest income quintile  one fifth of the population as divided by income  was fairly flat over the same period  edging up from 35  to 36     45  Looking at the issue of how frequently workers or households move into higher or lower quintiles as their income rises or falls over the years 46   the CBO found income distribution over a multi year period  modestly  more equal than annual income  47  The CBO study confirms earlier studies  38  Emmanuel Saez  a Berkeley economist from France  has been called the single most influential economist in demonstrating the growth in inequality  15  A 2006 analysis of IRS income data by Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty at the Paris School of Economics showed that the share of income held by the top 1  was as large in 2005 as in 1928  The data revealed that reported income increased by 9  in 2005  with the mean for the top 1  increasing by 14  and that for the bottom 90  dropping slightly by 0 6   7  Other sources that have noted the increased inequality included economist Janet Yellen who stated   the growth  in real income  was heavily concentrated at the very tip of the top  that is  the top 1 percent   48  Economist Timothy Smeeding summed up the current trend of rising inequality on the pages of the Social Science Quarterly  49  Americans have the highest income inequality in the rich world and over the past 20 30 years Americans have also experienced the greatest increase in income inequality among rich nations  The more detailed the data we can use to observe this change  the more skewed the change appears to be     the majority of large gains are indeed at the top of the distribution  United States Census Bureau studies on inequality of income measure both households 50  and individuals  51  In 2010  a census study showed the top 20  of Americans earned 49 4  of the nation s income  compared with the 3 4  earned by Americans living below the poverty line  roughly 15  of the population   This earnings ratio of 14 5 to 1 was an increase from the 13 6 to 1 ratio just two years earlier  and a significant rise from the historic low of 7 69 to 1 in 1968  52  The Census Bureau has shown lower levels of inequality 53  but do not include data for the highest income households where most of change in income distribution has occurred  19  54  Data Total gain Percent gain 2003 2000 1997 1994

percentile where most people have college or advanced degrees rose by 30 percent or more    among this top 10 percent  the growth was heavily concentrated at the very tip of the top  that is  the top

CEOs  In contrast  at the 50th percentile and below where many people have at most a high school diploma real wages rose by only 5 to 10 percent    48     edit  Consumption Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute argues that  the weight of the evidence shows that the run up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality   and consumption is more important than income  56  However since consumption in excess of income usually means debt  Timothy Noah argues that  the thought that the have nots are compensating for their lower incomes by putting themselves  and the country  in economically ruinous hock is not reassuring   57  The CBO agrees that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income but finds the data do not  adequately capture consumption by high income households  as it does their income  58   edit  Gini index Further information  Gini coefficient Further information  List of U S  states by income equality The Gini coefficient summarizes income inequality in a single number and is one of the most commonly used measures of income inequality  It uses a scale from 0 to 1    where 0 represents perfect equality  everyone having exactly the same income   and 1 represents perfect inequality  one person having all income   Index scores are commonly multiplied by 100 to make them easier to understand  59  Gini index ratings can be used to compare inequality within  by race  gender  employment  and between them  Different sources will often give different gini values for the same country or population measured   edit  International comparisons Between 1981 and 2008  income inequality rose significantly in two thirds of OECD countries  mostly because of rising incomes in the top percentiles and stagnating incomes at the bottom half of the income distribution  1  The UN  CIA World Factbook  60  and OECD have used the gini index to compare inequality between countries  and as of 2006  the United States had one of the highest levels of income inequality among similar developed or high income countries  as measured by the index  11  While inequality has increased somewhat since the mid 1980s 61   most developed countries are in the lower  more equal  end of the spectrum  with a Gini coefficient in the high twenties to mid thirties  62  The gini rating of the United States is sufficiently high  however  to put it among less developed countries  The US ranks above  more unequal than  South American countries such Guyana  Nicaragua  and Venezuela  and roughly on par with Uruguay  Nicaragua  and Venezuela  according to the CIA  63   although some developed countries have higher gini ratings before taxes and transfers  12   Between 1985 and 2008 the OECD 24 countries with the fastest rising Gini coefficients were Sweden  New Zealand  Finland  Israel  Germany  and Luxembourg  64  Organization US gini rating International range US

However some developed countries  such as the Netherlands and Greece  have less inequality simply because incomes are more equal than in the US even before taxes  69  Some have argued that inequality is higher in other countries than official statistics indicate because of unreported income  European countries have higher amounts of wealth in offshore holdings  70  71  72  73   edit  Careers of

teachers  76  In the top 10   female incomes rose twice as fast as male incomes between 1981 and 2005  1  Furthermore  the United States has a high level of assortative mating  which means that highly educated males marry highly educated females rather than lowly educated ones  1  People in the top 1  are three times more likely to work more than 50 hours a week  they are more likely to be self employed  and they earn a fifth of their income as capital income  74  The people in the 1  change every year because of temporarily surge in salary or once off income from selling assets  The

general Expertise  productiveness and work experience  inheritance  gender  and race have had a strong influence on distribution of personal income 78  79  in the United States as in other countries   edit  Race and gender disparities Further information  Male female income disparity in the United States Income levels vary by gender and race with median income levels considerably below the national median for females compared to men with certain racial demographics  80  Median personal income by gender and race in 2005  Asian Americans are far more likely to be in the highest earning 5  than the rest of Americans  81  When it comes to couples  Asian husband  Asian wife  and Asian couple are the highest earning combinations in the United States  82  Despite considerable progress in pursuing gender and racial equality  some social scientists attribute these discrepancies in income to continued discrimination  83  Others argue that the majority of the wage gap is due to women s choices and preferences  Women are more likely to consider factors other than salary when looking for employment  On average  women are less willing to travel or relocate  take more hours off and work fewer hours  and choose college majors that lead to lower paying jobs  Women are also more likely to work for governments or non profits  that pay less than the private sector  84  85  According to this perspective certain ethnic minorities and women receive fewer promotions and opportunities for occupation and economic advancement than others  In the case of women this concept is referred to as the glass ceiling keeping women from climbing the occupational ladder  In terms of race  studies have shown that African Americans are less likely to be hired than European Americans with the same qualifications  86  The continued prevalence of traditional gender roles and ethnic stereotypes may partially account for current levels of discrimination  83  In 2005  median income levels were highest among Asian and White males and lowest among females of all races  especially those identifying as African American or Hispanic  Despite closing gender and racial gaps  considerable discrepancies remain among racial and gender demographics  even at the same level of educational attainment  87  The success of Asian Americans may come from how parents and children spend much longer hours on education than their peers  Asian American have significantly higher college graduation rates than their peers  are much more likely to enter high status occupations  and succeed at it even with significantly lower IQ  88  89  Since 1953 the income gap between male and female workers has decreased considerably but remains relatively large  90  Women currently earn significantly more Associate s  Bachelor s  and Master s degrees than men and almost as many Doctorates  91  Women are projected to have passed men in Doctorates earned in 2006 2007  and to earn nearly two thirds of Associate s  Bachelor s  and Master s degrees by 2016  92  Despite this  some who   still argue that male workers still hold higher educational attainment  as the success of women in academia is a relatively new phenomenon  78  Though it is important to note that income inequality between sexes remained stark at all levels of educational attainment  80  Between 1953 and 2005 median earnings as well as educational attainment increased  at a far greater pace for women than for men  Median income for female earners male earners increased 157 2  versus 36 2  for men  over four times as fast  Today the median male worker earns roughly 68 36  more than their female counterparts  compared to 176 25  in 1953  The median income of men in 2005 was 2  higher than in 1973 compared to a 74 6  increase for female earners  90  Racial differences remained stark as well  with the highest earning sex gender demographic of workers aged 25 or older  Asian males  who were roughly tied with white males  earning slightly more than twice as much as the lowest earning demographic  Hispanic females  93  94  As mentioned above  inequality between races and gender persisted at similar education levels  94  95  Racial differences were overall more pronounced among male than among female income earners  During the early 1920s  median earnings decreased for both sexes  not increasing substantially until the late 1990s  Since 1974 the median income for workers of both sexes increased by 31 7  from  18 474 to  24 325  reaching its high point in 2000  96  Demographic Median personal

income levels and gains for different percentiles in 2003 dollars  110  Main article  Household income in the United States Conservatives commonly focused on the flaws of household income as a measure for standard of living in order to refute claims that income inequality is growing  becoming excessive or posing a problem for society  111  According to sociologist Dennis Gilbert  growing inequality can be explained in part by growing participation of women in the workforce  High earning households are more likely to be dual earner households  9  Thus gross annual household income does not always accurately reflect standard of living as it does not consider household size  112  Inequality can also be explained by failure to adjust for size of household  A 2004 analysis of income quintile data by the Heritage Foundation stated that the aggregate share of income held by the upper quintile  the top earning 20   decreases by 20 3  when figures are adjusted to reflect household size  113  However  the 2011 CBO study  Trends in the Distribution of Household Income  mentioned in this article adjusts for household size so that its quintiles contain an equal number of people  not an equal number of households  114  Main article  Personal Income in the United States Personal income represents the earnings of individuals and  therefore  directly reflects occupational status  achievement and educational attainment  Trends in personal income are more indicative of the job market and the economy than household income    While many income earners  though not the majority  reside in households with more than one income earner   edit  Changes in income calculation One observer who denies that household income has become more unequal is Alan Reynolds  senior fellow with the Cato Institute  Reyonlds has declared that income inequality is a statistical illusion brought about by technical changes in the tax law that alter what income gets reported to the Internal Revenue Service and what income does not  115  111  This claim has been criticized as  a mountain of hard to follow  often irrelevant  and sometimes entirely erroneous statistical quibbles  or  116   intellectual

States Income differences between the varying levels of educational attainment  usually measured by the highest degree of education an individual has completed  have increased  Expertise and skill certified through an academic degree translates into increased scarcity of an individual s occupational qualification which in turn leads to greater economic rewards  119  As the United States has developed into a post industrial society more and more employers require expertise that they did not a generation ago  while the manufacturing sector which employed many of those lacking a post secondary education is decreasing in size  120  In the resulting economic job market the income discrepancy between the working class and the professional with the higher academic degrees  78  who possess scarce amounts of certified expertise  may be growing  Average earnings in 2002 for the population 18 years and over were higher at each progressively higher level of education    This relationship holds true not only for the entire population but also across most subgroups  Within each specific educational level  earnings differed by sex and race  This variation may result from a

Martin Ford  the replacement by automation not only of routine  lower skill employment but jobs at high skill levels should have an effect on income inequality of shifting it not to more educated workers but to owners of capital  122  123  For example  the introduction of electronic discovery software has largely automated the legal discovery process  eliminating many highly paid positions for lawyers and paralegals  124  When advanced technologies eliminate well paying jobs  or de skill the jobs so that the work can be performed by lower wage labor   the benefits flow to top corporate executives and shareholders  According to Timothy Noah  as of 2010  computer technology has hurt  moderately skilled middle class  occupations but not those with high skill levels  63   edit  Incentives Percent of households with 2  income earners  and full time workers by income  125  In the context of concern over income inequality a number of economists  such as Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernake  have talked about the importance of incentives       without the possibility of unequal outcomes tied to differences in effort and skill  the economic incentive for productive behavior would be eliminated  and our market based economy     would function far less effectively   119  126  Yale economist Arthur Okun argues there is a trade off between economic growth and economic redistribution  127  128  Since abundant supply decreases market value  the possession of scarce skills considerably increases income  78  Among the American lower class  the most common source of income was not occupation  but government welfare  129  As expected  households in the upper quintiles are generally home to more  better educated and employed working income earners  than those in lower quintiles  113  Among those in the upper quintile  62  of householders were college graduates  80  worked full time and 76  of households had two or more income earners  compared to the national percentages of 27   58  and 42   respectively  78  79  125 Upper most sphere US Census Bureau data indicated that occupational achievement and the possession of scarce skills correlates with higher income  125   edit  Taxation Main article  Tax policy and economic inequality in the United States Another factor in income inequality equality is the effective rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system  A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases  130  131  132  133  134  The more progressive the tax system the more lower income household persons will benefit compared to the higher income  Overall income tax rates in the United States are below the OECD average  135   edit  Post 1980 rise in inequality Most current discussion of income inequality in America centers on its rise since the mid to late 1970s  the so called  Great Divergence    edit  Broad breakdown Breaking down how much of the increase in income inequality between 1979 and 2007 came from distribution of pre tax income and how much from taxes and  government transfers   the CBO data shows that the 33  increase in inequality 136  came from a 23  increase in inequality from changes in distribution of  market income  to households  top earners received a larger share of salaries  interest  dividends  capital gains  business income  etc    a 6  increase from changes in  government transfers   social security  unemployment  the end of AFDC welfare  etc    and a 4  increase from changes in federal taxation  overall decline in the average federal tax rate and shift in federal revenues from income taxes to less progressive payroll taxes  etc    137  138  Of the 23  increase in inequality from changes in pre tax  market  income  most of that  79   came from a shift to top earners in different types of income across the board  A smaller amount of inequality increase  21   came from a shift to more concentrated income sources   i e  a shift toward interest  dividends  business income and especially capital gains  which are more concentrated toward top earners than income from salaries wages   139   edit  Explanations According to the CBO and others   the precise reasons for the  recent  rapid growth in income at the top are not well understood   37  63  but  in all likelihood   an  interaction of multiple factors  was involved  140   Researchers have offered several potential rationales   37  48  Some of these rationales conflict  some overlap  141  They include  the globalization hypothesis low skilled American workers have been losing ground in the face of competition from low wage workers in Asia and other  emerging  economies 142   skill biased technological change   the rapid pace of progress in information technology has increased the demand for the highly skilled and educated so that income distribution favored brains rather than brawn 142   the superstar hypothesis modern technologies of communication often turn competition into a tournament in which the winner is richly rewarded  while the runners up get far less than in the past 142  143   immigration of less educated workers   relatively high levels of immigration of low skilled workers since 1965 may have reduced wages for American born high school dropouts 144   policy and politics   soaring executive compensation  stagnating middle income pay and more regressive taxation resulting from political decisions  not market forces  Decision such as not intervening to stop executive capture of corporate boards  the crushing of labor unions  etc  Analyzing the top three hypotheses  economist Paul Krugman found them to be  increasingly inadequate  as more evidence accumulated  Globalization can explain part of the relative decline in blue collar wages  but it can t explain the 2 500 percent rise in C E O  incomes  Technology may explain why the salary premium associated with a college education has risen  but it s hard to match up with the huge increase in inequality among the college educated  with little progress for many but gigantic gains at the top  The superstar theory works for Jay Leno  but not for the thousands of people who have become awesomely rich without going on TV  142  Immigration was also found wanting as an explanation  145  Other scholars  146  questioning the explanation of educational attainment and workplace skills point out that other countries with similar education levels and economies have not gone the way of the US  and that concentration of income in the US hasn t followed a pattern of  the 29  of Americans with college degrees pulling away  from those who have less education  49  147  148  149  150  11   edit  Skill biased technological change As of the mid  to late  decade of the 2000s  the most common explanation for income inequality in America was  skill biased technological change  151     a shift in the production technology that favors skilled over unskilled labor by increasing its relative productivity and  therefore  its relative demand   152  For example  one scholarly colloquium on the subject that included many prominent labor economists estimated that technological change was responsible for over 40  of the increase in inequality  Other factors like international trade  decline in real minimum wage  decline in unionization and rising immigration  were each responsible for 10 15  of the increase  153  154  Numbers show the strength of education s influence on income distribution  155  In 2005  roughly 55  of income earners with doctorate degrees   the most educated 1 4    were among the top 15  earners  Among those with Masters degrees   the most educated 10    roughly half had incomes among the top 20  of earners  109  Only among households in the top quintile were householders with college degrees in the majority  79  But while the higher education commonly translates into higher income  155  and the highly educated are disproportionately represented in upper quintile households  differences in educational attainment fail to explain income discrepancies between the top 1  and the rest of the population  Large percentages of individuals lacking a college degree are present in all income demographics  including 33  of those with heading households with six figure incomes  79  From 2000 to 2010  the 1 5  of Americans with an M D   J D   or M B A  and the 1 5  with a PhD saw median income gains of approximately 5   Among those with a college or master s degree  about 25  of the American workforce  average wages dropped by about 7 percent   though this was less than the decline in wages for those who had not completed college   156  Approaching the issue from occupations that have been replaced or downgraded since the late 1970s  one scholar found that jobs that  require some thinking but not a lot    or moderately skilled middle class occupations such as cashiers  typists  welders  farmers  appliance repairmen   declined the furthest in wage rates and or numbers  Employment requiring either more skill or less has been less affected  157  However the timing of the great technological change of the era    internet use by business starting in the late 1990s    does not match that of the growth of income inequality  starting in the late 1970s but slackening somewhat in the 1990s   Nor does the introduction of technologies that increase the demand for more skilled workers seem to be generally associated with a divergence in household income among the population  Inventions of the 20th century such as AC electric power  the automobile  airplane  radio  television  the washing machine  Xerox machine  each had an economic impact the equal of computers microprocessors internet but did not coincide with greater inequality  157   edit  Education Another explanation is that the combination of the introduction of technologies that increase the demand for skilled workers  and the failure of the American education system to provide a sufficient increase in those skilled workers has bid up those workers  salaries  An example of the slowdown in education growth in America  that began about the same time as the Great Divergence began  is the fact that the average person born in 1945 received two more years of schooling than his parents  while the average person born in 1975 received only half a year more of schooling  158  Author Timothy Noah s  back of the envelope  estimation based on  composite of my discussions with and reading of the various economists and political scientists  is that the  various failures  in America s education system are  responsible for 30   of the post 1978 increase in inequality  158   edit  Globalization The idea that the growing amount of imports from low wage countries has hurt incomes of skilled American workers is intuitive  China is the world s biggest exporter and maker of manufactured products but had a per capita income in 2007 one seventh that of the United States  But while economists who have studied globalization agree imports have had an effect  here again the timing of import growth does not match that of inequality growth  By 1995 imports of manufactured goods from low wage countries totaled less than 3  of US gross domestic product  159  It wasn t until 2006 that the US imported more manufactured goods from low wage  developing  countries than from high wage  advanced  economies  160  And inequality increased during the 2000 2010 decade not because of stagnating wages for less skilled workers  but because of accelerating incomes of the top 0 1   159  Author Timothy Noah estimates that  trade   increases in imports are responsible for just 10  of the  Great Divergence  in income distribution  158   edit  Immigration The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 increased immigration to America  especially of non Europeans   63  From 1970 to 2007  the foreign born proportion of America s population grew from 5  to 11   most of whom had lower education levels and incomes than native born Americans  But the contribution of this increase in supply of low skill labor seem to have been relatively modest  One estimate stated that immigration reduced the average annual income of native born  high school dropouts    who roughly correspond to the poorest tenth of the workforce   by 7 4  from 1980 to 2000  The decline in income of better educated workers was much less  63  Author Timothy Noah estimates that  immigration  is responsible for just 5  of the  Great Divergence  in income distribution  158   edit  Political  normative  institutional Critics of technological change as an explanation for the  Great Divergence  of income levels in America 21  point to public policy and party politics  or  stuff the government did  or didn t do  161   They argue these have led to a trend of declining labor union membership rates and resulting diminishing political clout  decreased expenditure on social services  and less government redistribution   edit  Political parties and presidents Political scientist Larry Bartels has found a strong correlation between the party of the president and income inequality in America since 1948   see below  149  162  Examining average annual pre tax income growth from 1948 to 2005  163  Bartel shows that under Democratic presidents  from Harry Truman forward   the greatest income gains have been at the bottom of the income scale and tapered off as income rose  Under Republican presidents  in contrast  gains were much less but what growth there was concentrated towards the top  tapering off as you went down the income scale  138  164  Summarizing Bartels s findings  journalist Timothy Noah referred to the administrations of Democratic presidents as  Democrat world   and GOP administrations as  Republican world   In Democrat world  pre tax income increased 2 64  annually for the poor and lower middle class and 2 12  annually for the upper middle class and rich  There was no Great Divergence  Instead  the Great Compression the egalitarian income trend that prevailed through the 1940s  1950s  and 1960s continued to the present  albeit with incomes converging less rapidly than before  In Republican world  meanwhile  pre tax income increased 0 43 percent annually for the poor and lower middle class and 1 90 percent for the upper middle class and rich  Not only did the Great Divergence occur  it was more greatly divergent  Also of note  In Democrat world pre tax income increased faster than in the real world not just for the 20th percentile but also for the 40th  60th  and 80th  We were all richer and more equal  But in Republican world  pre tax income increased slower than in the real world not just for the 20th percentile but also for the 40th  60th  and 80th  We were all poorer and less equal  Democrats also produced marginally faster income growth than Republicans at the 95th percentile  but the difference wasn t statistically significant  161  The pattern of distribution of growth appears to be the result of a whole host of policies  including not only the distribution of taxes and benefits but also the government s stance toward unions  whether the minimum wage rises  the extent to which the government frets about inflation versus too high interest rates  etc   etc  138  Noah admits the evidence of this correlation is  circumstantial rather than direct   but so is  the evidence that smoking is a leading cause of lung cancer   161   edit  Non party political action According to political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson writing in the book Winner Take All Politics  the important policy shifts were brought on not by the Republican Party but by the development of a modern  efficient political system  especially lobbying  by top earners   and particularly corporate executives and the financial services industry  165  the end of the 1970s saw a transformation of American politics away from a focus on the middle class  with new  much more effective  aggressive and well financed lobbyists and pressure groups acting on behalf of upper income groups  Executives successfully eliminated any countervailing power or oversight of corporate managers  from private litigation  boards of directors and shareholders  the Securities and Exchange Commission or labor unions   166  The financial industry s success came from successfully pushing for deregulation of financial markets  allowing much more lucrative but much more risky investments from which it privatized the gains while socializing the losses with government bailouts  167   the two groups formed about 60  of the top 0 1  of earners   All top earners were helped by deep cuts in estate and capital gains taxes  and tax rates on high levels of income  Arguing against the proposition that the explosion in pay for corporate executives   which grew from 35X average worker pay in 1978 to over 250X average pay before the 2007 recession 168    is driven by an increased demand for scarce talent and set according to performance  Krugman points out that multiple factors outside of executives  control govern corporate profitability  particularly in short term when the head of a company like Enron may look like a great success  Further  corporate boards follow other companies in setting pay even if the directors themselves disagree with lavish pay  partly to attract executives whom they consider adequate  partly because the financial market will be suspicious of a company whose CEO isn t lavishly paid   Finally  corporate boards  largely selected by the CEO  hire compensation experts  almost always chosen by the CEO  who naturally want to please their employers  169  Lucian Arye Bebchuk  Jesse M  Fried  the authors of Pay Without Performance  critique of executive pay  argue that executive capture of corporate governance is so complete that only public relations  i e  public  outrage   constrains their pay  170  This in turn has been reduced as traditional critics of excessive pay such as politicians  where need for campaign contributions from the richest outweighs populist indignation   media  lauding business genius   unions  crushed     are now silent  171  In addition to politics  Krugman postulated change in norms of corporate culture have played a factor  In the 1950s and 60s  corporate executives had  or could develop  the ability to pay themselves very high compensation through control of corporate boards of directors  they restrained themselves  But by the end of the 1990s  the average real annual compensation of the top 100 C E O  s skyrocketed from  1 3 million 39 times the pay of an average worker to  37 5 million  more than 1 000 times the pay of ordinary workers from 1982 to 2002  142  Journalist George Packer also sees the dramatic increase in inequality in America as a product of the change in attitude of the American elite  which  in his view  has been transitioning itself from pillars of society to a special interest group  172  Author Timothy Noah estimates that what he calls  Wall Street and corporate boards  pampering  of the highest earning 0 1  is  responsible for 30   of the post 1978 increase in inequality  158   edit  Decline of unions The era of inequality growth has coincided with a dramatic decline in labor union membership from 20  of the labor force in 1983 to about 12  in 2007  173  Economists have traditionally thought that since the chief purpose of a union is to maximize the income of its members  a strong but not all encompassing union movement led to increased income inequality because union members in higher paying occupations  such as skilled trades like plumbing and carpentry  tend to have stronger unions and more influence than members in lower paying ones  such as workers in small businesses   who in turn typically earn more than nonunion blue collar workers 174  175   However more recently research has shown that unions ability to reduce income disparities among members outweighed other factors and its net effect has been to reduce national income inequality  175  176  The decline of unions has hurt this leveling effect among men  and one economist  Berkeley economist David Card  estimating about 15 20  of the  Great Divergence  among that gender is the result of declining unionization  175  177  Still other researchers think it is the labor movement s loss of national political power to promote equalizing  government intervention and changes in private sector behavior  has had the greatest impact on inequality in the US  178  175  Timothy Noah estimates the  decline  of labor union power  responsible for 20   of the Great Divergence  158   edit  Taxation How much tax policy change over the last thirty years has contributed to income inequality is disputed  In their comprehensive 2011 study of income inequality  Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007   the CBO estimated that only 12  of the increase in inequality in the US during that time came from tax policy changes  137  179  According to journalist Timothy Noah you can t really demonstrate that U S  tax policy had a large impact on the three decade income inequality trend one way or the other  The inequality trend for pre tax income during this period was much more dramatic  161  Noah estimates tax changes account for 5  of the Great Divergence  158  But many   such as economist Paul Krugman   emphasize the effect of changes in taxation   such as the 2001 and 2003 Bush administration tax cuts which cut taxes far more for high income households than those below   on increased income inequality  180  Part of the growth of income inequality under Republican administrations  described by Larry Bartels  has been attributed to tax policy  A study by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez found that Large reductions in tax progressivity since the 1960s took place primarily during two periods  the Reagan presidency in the 1980s and the Bush administration in the early 2000s  181  During Republican President Ronald Reagan s tenure in office the top marginal income tax rate was reduced from over 70 to 28 percent  high top marginal rates like 70  being the sort in place during much of the period of great income equality following the  Great Compression   161  182  183  President Ronald Reagan s 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only 20    its lowest level since the Hoover administration  184  During the Republican George W  Bush administration  the tax rate on capital gains and qualifying dividends   a disproportionate source of income for top earners   fell to 15    less than half the 35  top rate on ordinary income  185  President Bush s veto of tax harmonization has also been attributed to rising inequality  as this would have shut down offshore tax havens  186  One study found reductions of total effective tax rates were most significant for individuals with highest incomes  For those with incomes in the top 0 01 percent to 0 1 percent  overall rates of Federal tax were 55 3 percent in 1960  59 1 percent in 1970  51 0 percent in 1980  34 3 percent in 1990  40 2 percent in 2000 and 34 1 percent in 2004  For those with income in the top 0 01 percent of the income distribution  the effective tax rate was 71 4 percent in 1960  74 6 percent in 1970  59 3 percent in 1980  35 4 percent in 1990  40 8 percent in 2000 and 34 7 percent in 2004  The study found the decline in progressivity since 1960 was due to the shift from allocation of corporate income taxes among labor and capital to the effects of the individual income tax  However the study also noted that in 1960 the top tax rate reached only 31 percent for those at the very top  187  188 Paul Krugman also supports this claim saying   The overall tax rate on these high income families fell from 36 5 percent in 1980 to 26 7 percent in 1989   189  From the White House s own analysis  the tax burden for those making greater than  250 000 fell considerably during the late 1980s  1990s and 2000s  from an effective tax of 35 percent in 1980  down to under 30  from the late 1980s to present  190  Many studies argue that tax changes of S type Corporations confound the statistics prior to 1990  However  even after these changes inflation adjusted average after tax income grew by 25  between 1996 and 2006  the last year for which individual income tax data is publicly available   This average increase  however  obscures a great deal of variation  The poorest 20  of tax filers experienced a 6  reduction in income while the top 0 1  of tax filers saw their income almost double  Tax filers in the middle of the income distribution experienced about a 10  increase in income  Also during this period  the proportion of income from capital increased for the top 0 1  from 64  to 70   191   edit  Effects of race and gender The black white gap in median family income is about 3  smaller today than it was in 1979  a lack of progress that may be dismaying but excludes the disparity from explaining any part of the 30 year growth of inequality  24  Gender disparity in income has also improved in during the last three decades  The gap in the median annual income between men and women working full time has declined from 40  to 23   24  Median income for male and female workers from 1953 to 2005 in constant dollars  90  Year or change Gini index  Persons

 Since 1967 inequality has risen for households and for full time workers of both sexes  but especially for male workers   see table above  Personal income has risen considerably for female workers since 1953  less so for male workers  whose income stagnated during the 1970s 1980s  and 1990s  90  It is unclear whether the dramatic increase of women in the workforce and women s income has led to greater inequality  e g  dual earner families causing greater inequality   According to the Census Bureau  as of 2005  42  of all U S  households and 76  of those in the top quintile had two or more income earners  110  125  But looking at empirical studies  the CBO study  Trends in the Distribution of Household Income   found  mixed results  of the effect of dual earner families  with estimates depending on the period studied and the methodology use   The study also found that the level of inequality for household with children and  nonelderly  households without children was  virtually identical   193  The growth of single parent households may have led to lower incomes but most of it occurred before 1980 and in recent years the percentage of women who are actually working who are single parents has increased  63   edit  Significance of inequality Commentators  economists  politicians do not agree on the issue of increase in inequality in America or its importance  Among economists and other experts most agree that America s growing income inequality is  deeply worrying   24  unjust  142  a danger to democracy social stability  194  195  196  and or even a sign of national decline  172  Concern extends even to such supporters  or former supporters  of laissez faire economics as the former Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan  who has stated reference to growing inequality   This is not the type of thing which a democratic society   a capitalist democratic society   can really accept without addressing   24  Some economists  David Moss  Paul Krugman  believe the Great Divergence may be connected to the financial crisis of 2008  57  197  On the other side of the issue are those who have claimed that the increase is not significant 198   that it doesn t matter 196  because America s economic growth and or equality of opportunity are what s important 20   that it is a global phenomenon which would be foolish to try to change through US domestic policy 199   that it  has many economic benefits and is the result of     a well functioning economy  200  57   and has or may become an excuse for  class warfare rhetoric  198   and may lead to policies that  reduce the well being of wealthier individuals  46  57    edit  Public attitudes The growth of inequality has provoked a political protest movement the Occupy movement    starting in Wall Street and spreading to 600 communities across the United States in 2011  Its main political slogan    We are the 99     references its dissatisfaction with the concentration of income in the top 1   Opinion surveys of what respondents thought was the right level of inequality was have found Americans no more accepting of income inequality than other nationalities  but more accepting of what they thought the level of inequality was less was in their country  being under the impression that there was less inequality than there was  201 Dan Ariely and Michael Norton show in a study  2011  that US citizens across the political spectrum significantly underestimate the current US wealth inequality and would prefer a more egalitarian distribution of wealth  202  A 16 December 2011 Gallup poll found a decline in the number of Americans who felt reducing the gap in income and wealth between the rich and the poor was extremely or very important  203  However  in 1998 a Gallup poll found 52 percent of Americans agreeing that the gap between rich and the poor was a problem that needed to be fixed  while 45 percent regarded it as  an acceptable part of the economic system   In 2011  those numbers are reversed  Only 45 percent see the gap as in need of fixing  while 52 percent do not  However  there was a large difference between Democrats and Republicans  with 71  of Democrats calling for a fix  203  In contrast  a national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People  amp  the Press  204  found that respondents  sense of unfairness about taxes centered on the perception that wealthy Americans were not paying their fair share of taxes  57  say this is what bothers them most about the tax system  an increase of 6  over a poll taken in March 2003  205  A more recent poll found about two thirds of Americans now believe there are  strong conflicts  between rich and poor in the United States  206  207   edit  Impact on democracy and society Economists Jared Bernstein and Paul Krugman have attacked the concentration of income as variously  unsustainable  195  and  incompatible  196  with real democracy  Political Scientist Jacob S  Hacker and Paul Pierson quote a warning by Greek Roman historian Plutarch   An imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics   194  Two journalists concerned about social separation are Robert Frank who notes that  Today s rich had formed their own virtual country     T hey had built a self contained world unto themselves  complete with their own health care system  concierge doctors   travel network  Net jets  destination clubs   separate economy       The rich weren t just getting richer  they were becoming financial foreigners  creating their own country within a country  their own society within a society  and their economy within an economy   208  and George Packer  Inequality hardens society into a class system     Inequality divides us from one another in schools  in neighborhoods  at work  on airplanes  in hospitals  in what we eat  in the condition of our bodies  in what we think  in our children s futures  in how we die  Inequality makes it harder to imagine the lives of others  172  One possible specific tangible harm to non elites from inequality may be higher rates of bankruptcy as people go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle  Researchers Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi found a fivefold increase in the number of families filing for bankruptcy between 1980 and 2005  209  The bankruptcies came not from increased spending  on luxuries   but from an  increased spending on housing  largely driven by competition to get into good school districts   Intensifying inequality may mean a dwindling number of ever more expensive school districts that compel middle class   or would be middle class  to  buy houses they can t really afford  taking on more mortgage debt than they can safely handle   210  Disagreeing with this focus on the top earning 1  and urging attention to the economic and social pathologies of lower income lower education Americans  is conservative journalist David Brooks  Whereas in the 1970s  high school and college graduates had  very similar family structures   today  high school grads are much less likely to get married and be active in their communities  and much more likely to smoke  be obese  get divorced  or have  a child out of wedlock   211  The zooming wealth of the top one percent is a problem  but it s not nearly as big a problem as the tens of millions of Americans who have dropped out of high school or college  It s not nearly as big a problem as the 40 percent of children who are born out of wedlock  It s not nearly as big a problem as the nation s stagnant human capital  its stagnant social mobility and the disorganized social fabric for the bottom 50 percent  211   212   edit  Opportunity and equality Conservatives and libertarians such as economist Thomas Sowell  and Congressman Paul Ryan  R   Wisc   213  argue that more important than the level of equality of results is America s equality of opportunity  especially relative to other developed countries such as western Europe   edit  Mobility during a lifetime Strong  intra generational  or individual economic mobility between the strata of rich  middle class and poor means both that  1  a high level of inequality of annual income is made irrelevant by a more even distribution of lifetime income  and  2  however extreme the earnings at the top  they are not out of reach for the poor  or middle income  but ambitious  19  Sowell claims mobility is robust  An absolute majority of the people who were in the bottom 20 percent  of income  in 1975 have also been in the top 20 percent at some time since then  Most Americans don t stay put in any income bracket  At different times  they are both  rich  and  poor     as these terms are recklessly thrown around in the media        There are of course some people who remain permanently in the bottom 20 percent  But such people constitute less than one percent of the American population  according to data published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in its 1995 annual report  Perhaps the intelligentsia and the politicians have been too busy waxing indignant to be bothered by anything so mundane as facts  20  According to Thomas A  Garrett  studies examining quintiles of wealth levels may provide a misleading picture   46  For example  a U S  Treasury study of the period from 1996 to 2005 found that   l ess than half  40 percent or 43 percent depending on the measure  of those in the top 1 percent in 1996 were still in the top 1 percent in 2005  Only about 25 percent of the individuals in the top 1 100th percent in 1996 remained in the top 1 100th percent in 2005   214  Other have not found individual mobility so fluid  A 2007 study  by Kopczuk  Saez and Song in 2007  found the top population in America  very stable  and  not mitigated the dramatic increase in annual earnings concentration since the 1970s   215  Economist Paul Krugman  attacks conservatives for resorting to  extraordinary series of attempts at statistical distortion   He argues that while in any given year  some of the people with low incomes will be  workers on temporary layoff  small businessmen taking writeoffs  farmers hit by bad weather     the rise in their income in succeeding years is not the same  mobility  as poor people rising to middle class or middle income rising to wealth  It s the mobility of  the guy who works in the college bookstore and has a real job by his early thirties   Studies by the Urban Institute and the US Treasury have both found that about half of the families who start in either the top or the bottom quintile of the income distribution are still there after a decade  and that only 3 to 6 percent rise from bottom to top or fall from top to bottom  19  On the issue of whether most Americans do not stay put in any one income bracket  Krugman quotes from 2011 CBO distribution of income study Household income measured over a multi year period is more equally distributed than income measured over one year  although only modestly so  Given the fairly substantial movement of households across income groups over time  it might seem that income measured over a number of years should be significantly more equally distributed than income measured over one year  However  much of the movement of households involves changes in income that are large enough to push households into different income groups but not large enough to greatly affect the overall distribution of income  Multi year income measures also show the same pattern of increasing inequality over time as is observed in annual measures  22  In other words   many people who have incomes greater than  1 million one year fall out of the category the next year   but that s typically because their income fell from  say  1 05 million to 0 95 million  not because they went back to being middle class   22  216   edit  Mobility between generations Several studies have found the ability of children from poor or middle class families to rise to upper income   known as  upward relative intergenerational mobility    is lower in the US than in other developed countries 217    and at least two economist have found this development linked to income inequality  23  24  In their  Great Gatsby  curve  23 White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Alan B  Krueger and labor economist Miles Corak show a correlation in a number of countries between inequality and  intergenerational income elasticity   i e  the likelihood that someone will inherit their parents  relative position of income level  i e  low socio economic mobility 24  218   In the words of journalist Timothy Noah you can t really experience ever growing income inequality without experiencing a decline in Horatio Alger style upward mobility because  to use a frequently employed metaphor  it s harder to climb a ladder when the rungs are farther apart  24  Aside from the proverbial distant rungs  the connection between income inequality and low mobility can be explained by the lack of access for un affluent children to better  more expensive  schools and preparation for schools crucial to finding high paying jobs  the lack of health care that may lead to obesity and diabetes and limit education and employment  217  Krueger estimates that  the persistence in the advantages and disadvantages of income passed from parents to the children  will  rise by about a quarter for the next generation as a result of the rise in inequality that the U S  has seen in the last 25 years
