        Sama am   is an Indian religion that prescribes a path of non violence towards all living beings  Its philosophy and practice emphasize the necessity of self effort to move the soul towards divine consciousness and liberation  Any soul that has conquered its own inner enemies and achieved the state of supreme being is called a jina   conqueror  or  victor    The ultimate status of these perfect souls is called siddha  Ancient texts also refer to Jainism as shramana dharma  self reliant  or the  path of the niganthas   those without attachments or aversions   Jain doctrine teaches that Jainism has always existed and will always exist  1  2  3  although historians date the foundation of the organized or present form of Jainism to sometime between the 9th and the 6th century BC  4  5  Like most ancient Indian religions  Jainism has its roots from the Indus Valley Civilization  reflecting native spirituality prior to the Indo Aryan migration into India  6  7  8  Other scholars suggested the shramana traditions were separate and contemporaneous with Indo Aryan religious practices of the historical Vedic religion  9  Contemporary Jainism is a small but influential religious minority with as many as 4 2 million followers in India  10  and successful growing immigrant communities in North America  Western Europe  the Far East  Australia and elsewhere  11  Jains have significantly influenced and contributed to ethical  political and economic spheres in India  Jains have an ancient tradition of scholarship and have the highest degree of literacy for a religious community in India  12  13  Jain libraries are the oldest in the country  14  Contents 1 Main principles 2 Core beliefs 3 Non violence in thought and practice 4 Concept of karma 4 1 Shedding of past

development through cultivation of one s own personal wisdom and reliance on self control through vows  Sanskrit        vrata   15  The triple gems of Jainism   right vision or view  Samyak Darshana   right knowledge  Samyak Gyana  and right conduct  Samyak Charitra    provide the path for attaining liberation from the cycles of birth and death  When the soul sheds its karmic bonds completely  it attains divine consciousness  Those who have attained moksha are called siddhas  while those attached to the world through their karma are called samsarin  Every soul has to follow the path  as explained by the Jinas and revived by the tirthankaras  to attain complete liberation or nirvana  Jains do not believe in a creator deity that could be responsible for the manifestation  creation  or maintenance of this universe  The universe is self regulated by the laws of nature  Jains believe that life exists in various forms in different parts of the universe including earth  Jainism has extensive classification of various living organisms including micro organisms that live in mud  air and water  All living organisms have soul and therefore need to be interacted without causing much harm  Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation from all karmic bonding  one must practice the following ethical principles not only in thought  but also in words  speech  and action   Such a practise through lifelong work towards oneself is called as observing the Mahavrata   Great Vows    These vows are  Ahimsa  Non violence    to cause  no harm  to living beings  on the lines of  live  and  let live    The vow involves  minimizing  intentional as well as unintentional harm to another living creature  There should even be no room for any thought conjuring injury to others  let alone talking about it or performing of such an act  16  Besides  it also includes respecting the views of others  non absolutism and acceptance of multiple views   Satya  Truthfulness    to always speak of truth such that no harm is caused to others  A person who speaks truth becomes trustworthy like a mother  venerable like a preceptor and dear to everyone like a kinsman  Given that non violence has priority  all other principles yield to it whenever there is a conflict  For example  in a situation where speaking truth would lead to violence  it would be perfectly moral to remain silent  for you are neither being untrue  nor causing violence by way of truth  Asteya  Non stealing    not to take into possession  anything that is not willingly offered  It is the strict adherence to one s own possessions without desiring for the ones that belong to others  One should remain satisfied by whatever is earned through honest labour  Any attempt to squeeze material wealth from others and or exploit the weak is considered theft  Some of the guidelines for this principle follow as under  Always give people fair value for their labor or product  Not to take into possession materials that are not earned or offered by others  Not to take materials into personal possession that have been dropped off or forgotten by others  Not to purchase materials as a result of being cheaper in value  if the resultant price reduction is a result of improper method of preparation  For instance  products made out of raw materials obtained by way of pyramid schemes  illegal businesses  stolen goods  etc   should be strictly prohibited Brahmacharya  Celibacy    to exercise control over senses  including mind  from indulgence  The basic intent of this vow is to conquer passion  thus preventing wastage of energy in the direcition of pleasurable desires  During observance of this vow  the householder must not have a sensual relationship with anybody other than one s own spouse  Jain monks and nuns practice complete abstinence from any sexual activity  17  Aparigraha  Non possession  Non materialism    to observe detachment from people  places and material things  Ownership of an object itself is not possessiveness  however  attachment to the owned object is possessiveness  For householders  non possession is owning without attachment  because the notion of possession is illusory  The basic principle behind observance of this vow lies in the fact that life changes  What you own today may not be rightfully yours tomorrow  Hence the householder is encouraged to discharge his or her duties to related people and objects as a trustee  without excessive attachment or aversion  For monks and nuns  non possession involves complete renunciation of property and human relations  18  Jains hold that universe and its laws of nature are eternal  and have always existed in time  However  it constantly undergoes cyclical changes as per governing universal laws  The universe is occupied by both living beings  j va  and non living objects  Aj va   The samsarin soul incarnates in various life forms during its journey over time  Human  sub human  category catering to inclusion of animals  birds  insects and other forms of living creatures   super human  heavenly beings  and hellish beings are the four forms of samsarin soul incarnations  A living being s thoughts  expressions and actions  executed with intent of attachment and aversion  give rise to the accumulation of karma  These influxes of karma in turn contribute to determination of circumstances that would hold up in our future in the form of rewards or punishment  Jain scholars have explained in depth methods and techniques that will result into clearance of past accumulated karmas as well as stopping the inflow of fresh karmas  This is the path to salvation  A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviours  19  One s unconquered mind tainted with anger  pride  ego   deceit  and greed joined with uncontrolled sense organs are powerful enemies of humans  Anger comes in way of good human relations  pride destroys humility  deceit destroys peace  and greed destroys good judgement  Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness  pride  ego  by humility  deceit by straight forwardness  and greed by contentment  20  The principle of non violence seeks to minimize karmas that limit the capabilities of one s own soul  Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become siddha  paramatma  highest soul    Because all living beings possess a soul  great care and awareness is essential in one s actions  Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life  advocating harmlessness towards all  whether great or small  This policy extends even to microscopic organisms  Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders  The Great Vows are prescribed for Jain monastics while limited vows  anuvrata  are prescribed for householders  Householders are encouraged to practice five cardinal principles of non violence  truthfulness  non stealing  celibacy  and non possessiveness with their current practical limitations  while monks and nuns have to observe them very strictly  With consistent practice  it is possible to overcome the limitations gradually  accelerating spiritual progress   21   edit  Core beliefs Every living being has soul  22  Every soul is potentially divine  with innate qualities of infinite knowledge  perception  power  and bliss  masked by its karmas   Therefore regard every living being as you do yourself  harming no one and being kind to all living beings  Every soul is born as a heavenly being  human  sub human or hellish being according to its own karma  Every soul is the architect of its own life  here or hereafter  23  When a soul is freed from karmas  it becomes free and attains divine consciousness  experiencing infinite knowledge  perception  power  and bliss  Moksha   24  The triple gems of Jainism   Right View  Right Knowledge and Right Conduct   provide the way to this realisation  25  There is no supreme divine creator  owner  preserver  or destroyer  The universe is self regulated  and every soul has the potential to achieve divine consciousness  siddha  through its own efforts  Non violence  to be in soul consciousness rather than body consciousness  is the foundation of right view  the condition of right knowledge and the kernel of right conduct  It leads to a state of being unattached to worldly things and being non judgmental and non violent  this includes compassion and forgiveness in thoughts  words and actions toward all living beings and respecting views of others  non absolutism   Jainism stresses the importance of controlling the senses including the mind  as they can drag one far away from true nature of the soul  Limit possessions and lead a life that is useful to yourself and others  Owning an object by itself is not possessiveness  however  attachment to an object is possessiveness  26  Non possessiveness is the balancing of needs and desires while staying detached from our possessions  Enjoy the company of the holy and better qualified  be merciful to afflicted souls  and tolerate the perversely inclined  27  Four things are difficult for a soul to attain  1  human birth  2  knowledge of the laws governing the souls  3  absolute conviction in the philosophy of non violence  and 4  practicing this knowledge with conviction in everyday life activities  It is  therefore  important not to waste human life in evil ways  Rather  strive to rise on the ladder of spiritual evolution  The goal of Jainism is liberation of the soul from the negative effects of unenlightened thoughts  speech  and action  This goal is achieved through clearance of karmic obstructions by following the triple gems of Jainism  Namokar Mantra is the fundamental prayer in Jainism and can be recited at any time of the day  Praying by reciting this mantra  the devotee bows in respect to liberated souls still in human form  arihants   fully liberated souls forever free from rebirth  siddhas   spiritual leaders  Acharyas   teachers  and all the monks and nuns  28  By saluting them saying  namo namaha   Jains receive inspiration from them to follow their path to achieve true bliss and total freedom from the karmas binding their souls  In this main prayer  Jains do not ask for any favours or material benefits  This mantra serves as a simple gesture of deep respect toward beings that are more spiritually advanced  The mantra also reminds followers of the ultimate goal of reaching nirvana or moksha  29  Jains worship the icons of jinas  arihants and Tirthankaras  who have conquered their inner passions and attained divine consciousness  and study the Scriptures of these liberated beings  Jainism acknowledges the existence of powerful heavenly souls that look after the well being of Tirthankaras  Usually they are found in pairs around the icons as male  yaksha  and female  yakshini  guardian deities  Even though they have supernatural powers  these deities are also souls wandering through the cycles of births and deaths just like most other souls  Over time  people began worshiping these deities as well  30   edit  Non violence in thought and practice Main articles  Ahimsa in Jainism and Anekantavada Jains hold the above five major vows at the center of their lives  These vows cannot be fully implemented without the acceptance of a philosophy of non absolutism  An k ntav da   multiple points of view   is a foundation of Jain philosophy  This philosophy allows the Jains to accept the truth in other philosophies from their perspective and thus inculcating a tolerance for other viewpoints  Jain scholars have devised methods to view both physical objects and abstract ideas from different perspectives systematically  This is the application of non violence in the sphere of thought  It is a Jain philosophical standpoint just as there is the Advaitic standpoint of Sankara and the standpoint of the  middle way  of the Buddhists  31  This search to view things from different angles leads to understanding and toleration of different and even conflicting views  When this happens prejudices subside and a tendency to accommodate increases  The doctrine of An k nta is therefore a unique experiment of non violence at the root  22  A derivation of this principle is the doctrine of Sy dv da that highlights every model relative to its view point  It is a matter of our daily experience that the same object that gives pleasure to us under certain circumstances becomes boring under different situations  Nonetheless  relative truth is useful  as it is a stepping stone to the ultimate realization and understanding of reality  The doctrine of Sy dv da is based on the premise that every proposition is only relatively true  It all depends on the particular aspect from which we approach that proposition  Jains  therefore  developed logic that encompasses seven fold predication so as to assist in the construction of proper judgment about any proposition  Sy dv da provides Jains with a systematic methodology to explore the real nature of reality and consider the problem in a non violent way from different perspectives  This process ensures that each statement is expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions  and thus it is known as theory of conditioned predication  These seven propositions are described as follows  1 Sy d asti    in some ways it is  2 Sy d n sti    in some ways it is not  3 Sy d asti n sti    in some ways it is and it is not  4 Sy d asti avaktavya    in some ways it is and it is indescribable  5 Sy d n sti avaktavya    in some ways it is not and it is indescribable  6 Sy d asti n sti avaktavya    in some ways it is  it is not and it is indescribable  7 Sy d avaktavya    in some ways it is indescribable  For example  a tree could be stationary with respect to an observer on earth  however it will be viewed as moving along with planet Earth for an observer in space  Jains are very welcoming and friendly toward other faiths and often help with interfaith functions  Several non Jain temples in India are administered by Jains  A palpable presence in Indian culture  Jains have contributed to Indian philosophy  art  architecture  and science   edit  Concept of karma Main article  Karma in Jainism Karma in Jainism conveys a totally different meaning than commonly understood in the Hindu philosophy and western civilization  32  It is not the so called inaccessible force that controls the fate of living beings in inexplicable ways  It does not simply mean  deed    work   nor mystical force  adrsta   but a complex of very fine matter  imperceptible to the senses  which interacts with the soul in intensity and quantity proportional to the thoughts  speech and physical actions carried out with attachments and aversions  causing further bondages  Karma in Jainism is something material  karmapaudgalam   which produces certain conditions  like a medical pill has many effects  33  The effects of karma in Jainism is therefore a system of natural laws rather than moral laws  When one holds an apple in one s hand and then lets go of the apple  the apple will fall due to gravitational force  In this example  there is no moral judgment involved  since this is a mechanical consequence of a physical action  34  The concept of Karma in Jainism is basically a reaction due to the attachment or aversion with which an activity  both positive and negative  is executed in thought  verbal and physical sense  Extending on the example outlined  the same apple dropped within a zero gravity environment such as a spacecraft circling around earth  will float in its place  Similarly  when one acts without attachment and aversion there will be no further karmic bonding to the soul  Karmas are grouped as Destructive Karmas  that obstruct the true nature of the soul and Non Destructive Karmas that only affect the body in which the soul resides  As long as there are Destructive Karmas  the soul is caged in a body and will have to experience pain and suffering in many different forms  Jainism has extensive sub classifications and detailed explanations of each of these major categories  Jain liturgy and scriptures explains ways to stop the influx as well as get rid of the accumulated karmas   edit  Shedding of past karmas  Nirjara  Main article  Nirjara Jainism prescribes mainly two methods for shedding karmas  Nirjara   accumulated by the soul  Passive Method   By allowing past karmas to ripen in due course of time and experiencing the results  both good and bad with equanimity  If the fruits of the past karmas are received with attachment or with agitation then the soul earns fresh karmic bondages  It is also not possible for the soul to know before hand when and which karma will start to produce results  Therefore  a person should practice equanimity under all circumstances  Active Method   By practicing internal and external austerities  penances or tapas  so as to accelerate the ripening process as well as reducing the effects produced  This is the recommended approach as it prepares and conditions the soul and reminds one to be vigilant  The internal austerities are Atonement of sinful acts Practice politeness and humility   in spite of having comparatively more wealth  wisdom  social status  power  etc  Service to others  especially monks  nuns  elders and the weaker souls without any expectations in return Scriptural study  questioning and expanding the spiritual knowledge Abandonment of passions   especially anger  ego  deceit and greed Meditation The external austerities are meant to discipline the sensual cravings  They are Fasting Eating less than one s normal diet Abstention from tasty and stimulating food Practising humility and thankfulness   by seeking help and offering assistance without egoistic tendencies Practising solitude and introspection Mastering demands of the body  edit  Tirthankaras Main article  Tirthankara See also  Parshva and Mahavira Sculpture representing two founders of Jainism  left  Rishabha first of the 24 tirthankaras  right Mahavira  the last of those 24  who consolidated and reformed the religious and philosophical system  The purpose of life is to undo the negative effects of karma through mental and physical purification  This process leads to liberation accompanied by a great natural inner peace  A soul is called a  victor   in Sanskrit Pali language  Jina  because one has achieved liberation by one s own efforts  A Jain is a follower of Jinas   conquerors    35  36  Jinas are spiritually advanced human beings who rediscovered the dharma  became fully liberated from the bondages of karma by conquering attachments and aversions  and taught the spiritual path to benefit all living beings  Jains believe that dharma and true living declines and revives cyclically through time  The special Jinas who not only rediscover dharma but also preach it for the Jain community are called Tirthankara  The literal meaning of Tirthankara is  ford builder   Jains compare the process of becoming a pure soul to crossing a swift river  an endeavour requiring patience and care  A ford builder has already crossed the river and can therefore guide others  Only a few souls that reach Arihant status become Thirthankars who take a leadership role in assisting the other souls to move up on the spiritual path  Jaina tradition identifies Rishabha  also known as Adinath  as the first tirthankar of this declining  avasarpini  time cycle  kalachakra   37  The 24th  and last Tirthankar is Mahavira  who lived from 599 to 527 BC  The 23rd Tirthankar  Parsva  lived from 877 to 777 BC  22  38  The last two Tirthankaras  Parshva and Mahavira  are historical figures whose existence is recorded  38  The 24 Tirthankaras in chronological order are  Rishabha  Ajitnath  Sambhavanath  Abhinandannath  Sumatinath  Padmaprabha  Suparshvanath  Chandraprabha  Pushpadanta  Suvidhinath   Sheetalnath  Shreyansanath  Vasupujya  Vimalnath  Anantnath  Dharmanath  Shantinath  Kunthunath  Aranath  Mallinath  Munisuvrata  Naminatha  Neminath  Parshva and Mahavira  Vardhamana   These special Jinas are also referred to in different languages as Bhagv n and I aiva   Kannada           T rtha kara  Tamil         I aiva  and Hindi        Bhagv n   Tirthankaras are not regarded as deities in the pantheistic or polytheistic sense  but rather as pure souls that have awakened the divine spiritual qualities that lie dormant within each of us  Apart from the Tirthankaras  Jains worship special Arihants such as Bahubali  According to the scriptures  Bahubali  also known as Gommateshvara  was the second of the one hundred sons of Rishabha and king of Podanpur  A statue of Bahubali is located at Shravana Belagola in the Hassan district of Karnataka State  It is a sacred place of pilgrimage for Jains  When standing at the statue s feet looking up  one sees the saint against the vastness of the sky  This statue of Bahubali is carved from a single large stone that is fifty seven feet high  The giant image was carved in 981 AD   by order of Chavundaraya  the minister of the Ganga King Rachamalla  and is considered the largest stone sculpture in the world   edit  Cosmology Main article  Jain cosmology Structure of Universe as per the Jain Scriptures  Depiction of Siddha Shila as per Jain cosmology  which is abode of infinite Siddhas  According to Jain beliefs  the universe was never created  nor will it ever cease to exist  Therefore  it is shaswat  eternal  from that point of view  It has no beginning or end  but time is cyclical with progressive and regressive spirituality phases  In other words  within the universe itself there will be constant changes  movements and modifications in line with the macro phases of the time cycles  Jain text claims that the universe consists of infinite amount of Jiva  life force or souls   and infinite amount of Ajiva  lifeless objects   The shape of the Universe as described in Jainism is shown alongside  At the very top end of the universe is the residence of the liberated souls that reached the siddha status  This supreme abode is above a crescent like boundary  Below this arch is the Deva Loka  Heaven   where all devas  powerful souls enjoying the positive karmic effects  reside  According to Jainism  there are sixteen heavens in total  39  The enjoyment in heaven is time limited and eventually the soul has to be reborn after its positive karmic effect is exhausted  Similarly  beneath the  waist  like area are the Narka Loka  Hells   There are seven hells  each for a varying degree of suffering a soul has to go through as consequences of its negative karmic effects  From the first to the seventh hell  the degree of suffering increases and light reaching it decreases  with no light in the seventh hell   The ray of hope is that the suffering in hell is also time limited and the soul will be reborn somewhere else in the universe after its negative karmic effects are exhausted  Human  animal  insect  plant and microscopic life forms reside on the middle part of the universe  Ultimate liberation is possible only from this region of the universe  In Jainism  time is divided into Utsarpinis  Progressive Time Cycle  and Avasarpinis  Regressive Time Cycle   An Utsarpini and an Avasarpini constitute one Time Cycle  Kalachakra   Every Utsarpini and Avasarpini is divided into six unequal periods known as Aras  During the Utsarpini half cycle  humanity develops from its worst to its best  ethics  progress  happiness  strength  health  and religion each start the cycle at their worst  before eventually completing the cycle at their best and starting the process again  During the Avasarpini half cycle  these human experiences deteriorate from the best to the worst  Jains believe we are currently in the fifth Ara of the Avasarpini phase  During the first and last two Aras  the knowledge and practice of dharma lapse among humanity and then reappear through the teachings of enlightened humans  those who have reached liberation from their karma  during the third and fourth Aras  Traditionally  in our universe and in this time cycle  Rishabha is regarded as the first to realize the truth  Mahavira  Vardhamana  was the last  24th  Tirthankara to attain enlightenment  For further reading on this aspect of Jainism refer to  The Jaina Path of Purification  by P S  Jaini  40   edit  Customs and practices Jains are vegetarians  They avoid eating root vegetables in general  as cutting root from a plant kills it unlike other parts of the plant  leaf  fruit  seed  etc    Furthermore  according to Jain texts  root vegetables contain infinite microorganisms called nigodas  Followers of Jain dharma eat before the night falls  They filter water regularly so as to remove any small insects that may be present and boil water prior to consumption  Jain monks and nuns practice strict asceticism and strive to make their current birth their last  thus ending their cycle of transmigration  41  The lay men and women also pursue the same five major vows to the limited extent depending on their capability and circumstances  Following the primary non violence vow  the laity usually choose professions that revere and protect life and totally avoid violent livelihoods  Jain monks and nuns walk barefoot and sweep the ground in front of them to avoid killing insects or other tiny beings  Even though all life is considered sacred by the Jains  human life is deemed the highest form of life  For this reason  it is considered vital never to harm or upset any person  Along with the Five Vows  Jains avoid harboring ill will and practice forgiveness  They believe that atma  soul  can lead one to becoming parmatma  liberated soul  and this must come from one s inner self  Jains refrain from all violence  ahimsa  and recommend that sinful activities be avoided  Pratikraman  turning back from transgression  is a practice of confession and repentance  This is a process of looking back at the bad thoughts and actions carried out during daily activities and learn from this process so as to resolve not to commit those mistakes again  Forgiving others for their faults  extending friendship and asking forgiveness for their own wrongful acts without reservation is part of this process  This enables Jains to get away from the tendency of finding fault in others  criticizing others and to develop habit of self analysis  self improvement and introspection  Jains practice Samayika  which is a Sanskrit word meaning equanimity  During this practice  they remain calm and undisturbed  This helps in recollecting the teachings of Thirthankars and discarding sinful activities for a minimum of 48 minutes  Sadhvis meditating Mahatma Gandhi was deeply influenced  particularly through the guidance of Shrimad Rajchandra  by Jain tenets such as peaceful  protective living and honesty  and made them an integral part of his own philosophy  42  Jainism has several different traditions  Historically  this has led to traditions refusing to recognize each other s religious texts as authoritative  For example  the Digamabaras reject the Svetambara canon  43  Even though there are some differences in customs and practices among them  the core belief systems are the same  Each tradition brings a unique perspective and completes the picture in the true sense of Non Absolutism  Anekantvad   For this reason Jains are encouraged to keep their tradition  and at the same time respect other practices so as to complete the Jain view  All traditions unanimously accept and believe in the core Jain philosophies including the major vows of Non violence  Truthfulness  Non stealing  Celibacy and Non possession  Jainism is mainly divided into two major sects  namely Svetambara and Digambara  Jainism has a distinct idea underlying Tirthankara worship  The physical form is not worshipped  but the characteristics of the Tirthankara  virtues  qualities  are praised and emulated  Tirthankaras remain role models  and sects such as the Sthanakavasi and Terapanth stringently reject idol worship  However  Murtipujak and Digambara sects allow praying before idols so as to assist in stimulating and focusing thoughts while praying   edit  Pacifism Compassion for all life  human and non human  is central to Jainism  Human life is valued as a unique  rare opportunity to reach enlightenment  to kill any person  no matter what crime he may have committed  is considered unimaginably abhorrent  It is a religion that requires monks and laity  from all its sects and traditions  to be vegetarian  Some Indian regions  such as Rajasthan  Gujarat and Karnataka  have been strongly influenced by Jains and often the majority of the local Hindus of every denomination have also become vegetarian  44   edit  Meditation Main article  Jain meditation Jain scriptures offer extensive guidance on meditation techniques to achieve full knowledge and awareness  It offers tremendous physical and mental benefits  Jain meditation techniques are designed to assist the practitioner to remain apart from clinging and hatred thereby liberating from karmic bondages through the Ratnatraya  right perception  right knowledge and right conduct  45  Meditation in Jainism aims at taking the soul to status of complete freedom from bondages  46  Meditation assists greatly in managing and balancing one s passion  Great emphasis is placed on the control of internal thoughts  as they influence the behavior  actions and goals  It prescribes twelve mindful reflections or contemplations to help in this process  They are called Bhavanas or Anuprekshas that assist one to remain on the right course of life  and not stray away  Please note that Jains apply the sevenfold predicate methodology of Syadvada  which includes the consideration of different views on each of these topics including the opposite view  The twelve contemplations for meditation are  Impermanence   Everything in this world is subject to change and transformation  Spiritual values are therefore worth striving for as they alone offer the soul  its ultimate freedom and stability  Protection   Under this reflection  one thinks about how helpless one is against old age  disease and death  The soul is its own saviour and to achieve total freedom one needs to follow the non violent path of Arihants  Siddhas and practicing saints  Leaders with their powerful armies  scientists with their latest advances in technology cannot provide the protection from the eventual decay and death  The refuge to things other than the non violent path are due to delusion  is unfortunate  and must be avoided  Worldly Existence   The soul transmigrates from one life form to another and is full of pain and miseries  There are no permanent relationships as the soul moves from one body form to another and can only exit this illusion through liberation from the cycles of birth  growth  decay and death  Solitude of the Soul   The soul has to bear the consequences of the positive and negative karmas alone  Such thoughts will stimulate to get rid of the existing karmas by one s own efforts and lead a peaceful life of co existence  Separateness of Soul   Under this reflection  one thinks that the soul is separate from other objects or living beings  One should think even the current body is not owned by the soul  It is however an important vehicle to lead a useful life to progress the soul further  The soul therefore should not develop attachment or aversion to any worldly objects  Impureness of the body   Under this section of thought  one is urged to think about constituent elements of one s body so as to compare and contrast it with the purity of soul  This kind of concentration assists in detaching emotionally from one s body  Influx of Karma   Every time the soul enjoys or suffers through the five senses  touch  taste  smell  sight and hearing  with attachment  aversion or ignorance  it attracts new karma  Practising this reflection  reminds the soul to be more careful  Stoppage of influx of Karma   In this reflection  one thinks about stopping evil thoughts and cultivates development of right knowledge that assists to control the wandering mind  Karma shedding   Under this reflection  one thinks about practising external and internal austerities to shed the previously accumulated karma  This assists in development of right discipline as a matter of routine habit  Universe   Universe consists of Souls  Matter  Medium of motion  Medium of Rest  Space and Time  To think of the nature and structure of universe helps one understand the complex dynamics of eternal modifications and work towards the goal of freeing the soul from the seemingly never ending changes  Difficulties in developing triple gems of Jainism   It is very difficult for the transmigrating soul in this world to develop the Right View  Right Knowledge and Right Conduct  Just like one cannot aspire to become a doctor or lawyer or engineer without going through the development process starting from the very basic skill set developments in primary and secondary schooling  spiritual development also needs to go through several stages or steps  Depending on one s current spiritual progress and situation  the challenges faced will differ  Working through the difficulties and applying practical solutions will assist one to continuously make improvements  thereby moving the soul to its goal of ultimate liberation  Difficulties in practising Jain Dharma   Jain Dharma is characterised by the following  Forbearance and Forgiveness Humility Straightforwardness Purity Truth Self restraint  control of senses and mind External Penance Renunciation Neither attachment nor aversion Celibacy In this reflection  the practitioner thinks about the difficulties to practice all of these in the practical world and work through the challenges depending on one s current capabilities and circumstances  Jains are encouraged to reflect on these thoughts with the following four virtues or value systems clearly in force  They are  Peace  love and friendship to all  Appreciation  respect and delight for the achievements of others  Compassion to souls who are suffering  Equanimity and tolerance in dealing with other s thoughts  words and actions   edit  Monasticism Main article  Jain monasticism Palitana

transport  Digambaras take up to eleven oaths  Digambara monks eat standing in one place in their palms without using any utensil  They eat only once a day   edit  Vegetarianism See also  Jain vegetarianism Jains practice strict vegetarianism  The practice of vegetarianism is instrumental for the practice of non violence and peaceful co operative co existence  Basic non violence principles can be performed depending on one s capability and specific situation in terms of meeting one s life s demands and expectations  Jainism acknowledges that it is impossible to discharge one s duties without some degree of himsa violence  but encourages to minimise as much as possible  Jains are strictly forbidden to use any leather or silk products since they are derived by killing of animals  Jains are prohibited from consuming root vegetables such as potatoes  garlic  onions  carrots  radishes  cassava  sweet potatoes  turnips  etc   as the plant needed to be killed in the process of accessing these prior to their end of life cycle  In addition  the root vegetables interact with soil and therefore contain far more micro organisms than other vegetables  Also  the root vegetables themselves are composed of infinite smaller organisms  hence  consuming these vegetables would mean killing all those organisms as well  However  they consume rhizomes such as dried turmeric and dried ginger  Eggplants  pumpkins  etc  are also not consumed by some Jains owing to the large number of seeds in the vegetable  as a seed is a form of life  However  tomatoes are consumed normally as its seeds are difficult to be killed  even at high temperatures pressures   Mushrooms  fungus and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites  grow in non hygienic environments and may harbor other life forms  Jains are also not supposed to consume food left overnight because of contamination by microbes  Most Jain recipes substitute potato with plantain  47  Apart from all these  Jains also follow strict diets on  teethees    eleven days  six days in Shukla Paksha   New Moon Fortnight and five days in Krishna Paksha   Full Moon Fortnight   They do not eat greens on these days  also termed as not to touch   use any sharp cutting object in the kitchen  These days and are enlisted below  1  All Bij   Second day of both the fortnights for aaradhna of  Samyag Darshan  2  Pacham   Fifth day of Shukla Paksha  amp  Agyiras   Eleventh day of both the fortnights for aaradhna of 14 Purva Gyan 3  Aatham   Eight day of both the fortnights  Chaudas   Fourteenth day of both the fortnights  Punam   Full Moon Day  amp  Amavas   New Moon Day for aaradhna of Charitra  The reason for stricter dietary observance on these eleven days is that the probability of the finalisation of the next birth is much more on these days compared to the other days   edit  Fasting Main article  Fasting in Jainism Fasting is one of the main tools for practicing external austerity  It helps to keep the demands of the body under check and assists in the focus on the upliftment of the soul  Spiritually  it helps in melting away the bad karmas accumulated by an individual  Depending on the capacity of an individual  there are several types of fasting  Complete fasting  giving up food and or water completely for a period Partial fasting  eating less than you need to avoid hunger Vruti Sankshepa  limiting the number of items of food eaten Rasa Parityaga  giving up favourite foods During fasting one immerses oneself in religious activities such as worshipping  serving the saints  monks and nuns  amp  to be in their proximity   reading scriptures  meditating  and donating to the right recipients  However  before starting the fast Jains take a small vow known as pachhchhakhan  A person taking the vow is bound to it and breaking it is considered to be a bad practice  Also  one gets the fruits of a fast only if he is bound by pachhchhakhan  Most Jains fast at special times  such as during festivals  known as Parva  Paryushana and Ashthanhika are the main Parvas  which occurs 3 times in a year  and on holy days  eighth  amp  fourteenth days of the moon cycle   Paryushana is the most prominent festival  lasting eight days for Svetambara Jains and ten days for Digambaras  during the monsoon  Most people fast during Paryushana because even the trouble causing planets Rahu and Ketu become calm and instead help the penancing devotees  However  a Jain may fast at any time of the year  Fasting is also one of the ways of absolving one s Spashta  Baddha  or Nidhatta karmas  Variations in fasts encourage Jains to do whatever they can to maintain self control over their abdominal desires  A unique ritual in this religion involves a holy fasting until death called sallekhana  Through this one achieves a death with dignity and dispassion as well as a reduction of negative karma to a great extent  48  When a person is aware of approaching death  and feels that s he has completed all duties  s he willingly ceases to eat or drink gradually  This form of dying is also called Santhara  It can be as long as 12 years with gradual reduction in food intake  Considered extremely spiritual and creditable  with all awareness of the transitory nature of human experience  it has recently led to a controversy  In Rajasthan  a lawyer petitioned the High Court of Rajasthan to declare santhara illegal  Jains see santhara as spiritual detachment  a declaration that a person has finished with this world and now chooses to leave  This choice however requires a great deal of spiritual accomplishment and maturity as a pre requisite   edit  Rules of complete fast A person undergoing a complete fast can eat nothing and drink only boiled water during his fasting period  The water has to be boiled for at least twenty minutes to ensure that all the living organisms in it die  and new ones don t form  thereby reducing the amount of himsa that a fasting person does  The unboiled water called sachet  meaning  full of life  is turned achet  meaning devoid of life  on boiling for this long  The boiled water remains achet for only five hours  So after five hours  it should be boiled again for at least another twenty minutes to ensure that it remains achet   fit for use to a fasting person  All the different types of complete fasts mandate an individual to do the following steps stringently  Initiation of the fast  The person desiring to observe a fast on a particular day has to take the vow of Chauvihar  meaning not eat or drink anything till at least 48 minutes after sunrise the next day  at least 48 minutes before sunset the previous day  Ingestion during the fast  On the day of fast  he has to take the pachhchhakhan of fast  He cannot eat anything on the day of fast  However  he may drink boiled water after at least 48 minutes after sunrise till at most 48 minutes before sunset on that day  At least 48 minutes before the sunset  he should take the vow of Chauvihar  Termination of the fast  He can break his fast only on the day after the day of fast after at least 48 minutes after sunrise  after taking the vow of Naukaarsi  Porsi  Saadh Porsi  Parimuddhi  etc  Optionally  he may continue his fast for that day also by taking the necessary vows and following them  Chauvihar Upvas  Chauvihar Chhath  Chauvihaar Attham  Chauvihaar Atthai  etc  are those types of complete fasts in which the person can t drink even boiled water during his fasting period  He can eat nothing and drink nothing  The process of initiation and termination of the fast is the same as mentioned above   edit  Types of fasting Maasakshaman  A person practising this form of fasting will not eat anything for thirty days  Atthai  A person

the story of Lord Rishabh not eating or drinking for 400 days  It is possible for people to try a variation of Varshitap by eating every alternate day  in general  They can eat only twice in every alternate day  but in between during some special calendar events  they may have to fast longer periods  Ayambil  A person eats only one kind of food per day  In Ayambil green vegetables  milk and

Main article  Jain rituals and festivals Jains praying at the feet of a statue of Lord Bahubali  Om Hrim Siddhi Chakra used by Jains in dravya puja Every day most Jains bow and say their universal prayer  the Navakar Mantra which is also known variously as Panch Parmesthi Sutra  Panch Namaskar Sutra  Navakar Mantra is the fundamental prayer in Jainism and can be recited at any time of the day  Praying by reciting this mantra  the devotee bows in respect to liberated souls still in human form  Arihantas   fully liberated souls forever free from re birth  Siddhas   spiritual leaders  Acharyas   teachers  Upadyayas  and all the monks  sarva sadhus  and nuns  sadhvis   By saluting them saying  namo namaha   Jains receive inspiration from them to follow their path to achieve true bliss and total freedom from the karmas binding their souls  In this main prayer  Jains do not ask for any favours or material benefits  This mantra serves as a simple gesture of deep respect toward beings that are more spiritually advanced  The mantra also reminds followers of the ultimate goal of reaching nirvana or moksha  Jains worship the icons of Jinas  Arihants  and Tirthankars  who have conquered their inner passions and attained divine consciousness  and study the scriptures of these liberated beings  Jainism acknowledges the existence of powerful heavenly souls  Yaksha and Yakshini  that look after the well beings of Tirthankarars  Usually  they are found in pair around the icons of Jinas as male  yaksha  and female  yakshini  guardian deities  Even though they have supernatural powers  these deities are also souls wandering through the cycles of births and deaths just like most other souls  Over time  people started worshiping these deities as well  The purpose of Jain worship or prayer is to break the barriers of the worldly attachments and desires  so as to assist in the liberation of the soul  Jain prayers and ritual in general include  Panch kalyanak Pratishtha  Celebration of five auspicious events or milestones in the life of Thirthankars  Pratikramana  Repentance of sins  Samayika  Meditation for reducing attachments and aversions  Guru Vandana  Chaitya Vandana  and other sutras to honor ascetics  There are basically two types of prayers  Dravya Puja  with symbolic offerings of material objects  Bhav Puja  with deep feeling and meditation  The material offerings made during the prayer are merely symbolic and are for the benefit of the offeror  The action and ritual of offering keeps the mind in meditative state  The symbolism of prayer is so strong it assists the devotee to concentrate on the virtues of Arihantas and Thirthankaras  Above all  prayer is not performed with a desire for any material goal  Jains are clear that the Jinas reside in moksha  Siddha loka  the permanent abode of the siddhas  and are completely detached from the world  Jains have built temples where idols of tirthankaras are revered  Rituals include offering of symbolic objects and praising Tirthankaras in song  There are some traditions within Jainism that have no prayer at all  and are focused on meditation through scripture reading and philosophical discussions   edit  Preparation for prayer Body cleansing  A bath should be taken before the prayer  A clean body prepares and assists the mind to be in spiritual mode  This is also symbolic of washing one s dirt or karmas  In order to assist in the meditative process place saffron paste or sandal paste on ring finger and anoint the forehead  This may be applied to earlobes  neck and other acupressure parts of the body  Clothes  Simple  clean washed clothes are worn  White clothing is preferred  Traditionally  men wear non stitched cloths  dhotis and khes    edit  Ashta

devotion to Jinas   practicing meditation  spiritual studies and renunciation  Paryushana is the most important festival among the Jain festivals  It happens during late August September commencing on the twelfth day of the fortnight of the waning moon cycle and ending in the fourteenth of the fortnight of the waxing moon cycle  This is generally a rainy season in Northern parts of India  During this 18 day period 49  Jain scholars and monks visit temples and explain the Jain philosophy  Jains during this period practice external austerities such as fasting  limiting their normal activities so as to reduce the harm to worms and insects that thrive during this season  At the conclusion of the festivities  a reflection on the past is encouraged  and Pratikraman is done for repentance of faults  Forgiveness is given to and asked for from all those considered  Mahavir Jayanti  50  The birthday of Mahavir  the last Thirthankar is celebrated on the thirteenth day of the fortnight of the

however  Jain mythology asserts that the line of Tirthankars in the present era began with Rishabhdeva  moreover  Jains themselves believe that Jainism has no single founder  and that it has always existed and will always exist  although it is occasionally forgotten by humans  Emperor Chandragupta Maurya embraced Jainism after retiring  At an older age  Chandragupta renounced his throne and material possessions to join a wandering group of Jain monks  Chandragupta was a disciple of Acharya Bhadrabahu  It is said that in his last days  he observed the rigorous but self purifying Jain ritual of santhara i e  fast unto death  at Shravana Belagola in Karnataka  However  his successor  Emperor Bindusara  was a follower of a Hindu ascetic movement  Ajivika and distanced himself from Jain and Buddhist movements  Samprati  the grandson of Ashoka also embraced Jainism  Samrat Samprati was influenced by the teachings of Jain monk Arya Suhasti Suri and he is known to have built 125 000 Jain Temples across India  Some of them are still found in towns of Ahmedabad  Viramgam  Ujjain and Palitana  It is also said that just like Ashoka  Samprati sent messengers  amp  preachers to Greece  Persia  amp  the Middle East to facilitate the spread of Jainism  But to date no research has been done in this area  Thus  Jainism became a vital force under the Mauryan Rule  Chandragupta  amp  Samprati are credited for the spread of Jainism in Southern India  Hundreds of thousands of Jain Temples and Jain Stupas were erected during their reign  But due to lack of royal patronage and its strict principles  along with the rise of Shankaracharya  amp  Ramanujacharya  Jainism  once the major religion of southern India  began to decline  1  2  According to scholars  Parshvanath was a historical figure and lived in the 9th century BC  51  52  In the 6th century BC  Vardhamana Mahavira became one of the most influential Jainism teachers  He built up a large group of disciples that learned from his teachings and followed him as he taught an ascetic doctrine in order to achieve enlightenment  The disciples referred to him as Jina  which means  the conqueror  and later his followers would use a derivation of this title to refer to themselves as Jains  a follower of the Jina  53  Kharavela s empire at its greatest extent  It is generally accepted that Jainism started spreading in south India from the 3rd century BC  i e  since the time when Badrabahu  a preacher of this religion and the head of the monks  community  came to Karnataka from Bihar  54  Kalinga  modern Orissa Osiaji  was home to many Jains in the past  Rishabhnath  the first Tirthankar  was revered and worshipped in the ancient city Pithunda  capital of Kalinga  This was destroyed by Mahapadma Nanda when he conquered Kalinga and brought the statue of Rushabhanatha to his capital in Magadh  Rushabhanatha is revered as the Kalinga Jina  Ashoka s invasion and his Buddhist policy also subjugated Jains greatly in Kalinga  However  in the first century BC Emperor Kharvela conquered Magadha and brought Rishabhnath s statue back and installed it in Udaygiri  near his capital  Shishupalgadh  The Khandagiri and Udaygiri caves near Bhubaneswar are the only surviving stone Jain monuments in Orissa  Earlier buildings were made of wood and were destroyed  Deciphering of the Brahmi script by James Prinsep in 1788 enabled the reading of ancient inscriptions in India and established the antiquity of Jainism  The discovery of Jain manuscripts has added significantly to retracing Jain history  Archaeologists have encountered Jain remains and artifacts at Maurya  Sunga  Kishan  Gupta  Kalachuries  Rashtrakut  Chalukya  Chandel and Rajput as well as later sites  Several western and Indian scholars have contributed to the reconstruction of Jain history  Western historians like B hler  Jacobi  and Indian scholars like Iravatham Mahadevan  worked on Tamil Brahmi

Temple  Jain temple in Antwerp  Belgium This pervasive influence of Jain culture and philosophy in ancient Bihar gave rise to Buddhism  The Buddhists have always maintained that during the time of Buddha and Mahavira  who  according to the Pali canon  were contemporaries   Jainism was already an ancient  deeply entrenched faith and culture there  Over several thousand years  Jain influence on Hindu rituals has been observed and similarly the concept of non violence has been incorporated into Hinduism  Certain Vedic Hindu holy books contain beautiful narrations about various Jain Tirthankaras  e g  Lord Rushabdev   In the history of mankind  there have been no wars fought in the name of Jainism  With 10 to 12 million followers  55  Jainism is among the smallest of the major world religions  but in India its influence is much greater than these numbers would suggest  Jains live throughout India  Maharashtra  Rajasthan and Gujarat have the largest Jain populations among Indian states  Karnataka  Tamil Nadu  Bundelkhand and Madhya Pradesh have relatively large Jain populations  There is a large following in Punjab  especially in Ludhiana and Patiala  and there used to be many Jains in Lahore  Punjab s historic capital  and other cities before the Partition of 1947  after which many fled to India  There are many Jain communities in different parts of India and around the world  They may speak local languages or follow different rituals but essentially they follow the same principles  Outside India  the United States  United Kingdom  Canada  and East Africa  Kenya  Tanzania  and Uganda  have large Jain communities  The first Jain temple to be built outside India was constructed and consecrated in the 1960s in Mombasa  Kenya by the local Gujarati Jain community  although Jainism in the West mostly came about after the Oswal and Jain diaspora spread to the West in the late 1970s and 1980s  Jainism is presently a strong faith in the United States  and several dozen Jain temples have been built there  primarily by the Gujarati community  American Jainism accommodates all the sects  Smaller Jain communities exist in Nepal  South Africa  Japan  Singapore  Malaysia  Australia  Fiji  and Suriname  In Belgium  the very successful Indian diamond community in Antwerp  almost all of whom are Jain  opened the largest Jain temple outside India in

The differences in belief between the two sects are minor and relatively obscure  Digambara monks do not wear clothes because they believe clothes  like other possessions  increase dependency and desire for material things  and desire for anything ultimately leads to sorrow  This also restricts full monastic life  and therefore moksa  to males as Digambaras do not permit women to be nude  female renunciates wear white and are referred to as Aryikas  Svetambara monastics  on the other hand  wear white seamless clothes for practical reasons  and believe there is nothing in the scriptures that condemns wearing clothes  Women are accorded full status as renunciates and are often called sadhvi  the feminine of the term often used for male munis  sadhu  Svetambaras believe women may attain liberation and that Mallinath  a Tirthankara  was female  56  The earliest record of Digambara beliefs is contained in the Prakrit Suttapahuda of the Digambara mendicant Kundakunda  c  2nd century AD   57  Digambaras believe that Mahavira remained unmarried  whereas Svetambaras believe Mahavira married a woman who bore him a daughter  The two sects also differ on the origin of Mata Trishala  Mahavira s mother  Digambaras believe that only the first five lines are formally part of the Namokar Mantra  the main Jain prayer   whereas Svetambaras believe all nine form the mantra  Other differences are minor and not based on major points of doctrine  Excavations at Mathura revealed many Jain statues from the time of the Kushan Empire  Tirthankaras  represented without clothes  and monks with cloth wrapped around the left arm are identified as Ardhaphalaka  half clothed  and mentioned in some texts  The Yapaniyas  believed to have originated from the Ardhaphalaka  followed Digambara nudity  along with several Svetambara beliefs  Svetambaras sub sects include Sthanakavasi  Terapanthi  and Murtipujaka  Some revering statues while other Jains are aniconic  Svetambaras follow the 12 agama literature  Digambara sub sects include Bisapanthii  Kanjipanthi  Taranapanthi and Terapanthi  Srimadi Most simply call themselves Jains and follow general traditions rather than specific sectarian practices  In 1974 a committee with representatives from every sect compiled a new text called the Saman Suttam   edit  Symbolism Main article  Jain symbols The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes the Jain Vow of Ahimsa  meaning non violence  The word in the middle is  Ahimsa   The wheel represents the dharmacakra  to halt the cycle of reincarnation through the pursuit of truth The swastika is among the holiest of Jain symbols The Jain symbol that was agreed upon by all Jain sects in 1974  Eight auspicious symbols  The Asta Mangalas   Their names are  Swastika   Signifies peace and well being Shrivatsa   A mark manifested on the centre of the Jina s chest  signifying a pure soul  Nandyavartya   Large swastika with nine corners Vardhamanaka   A shallow earthen dish used for lamps  suggests an increase in wealth  fame and merit due to a Jina s grace  Bhadrasana   Throne  considered auspicious because it is sanctified by the blessed Jina s feet  Kalasha   Pot filled with pure water signifying wisdom and completeness Minayugala   Fish couple  It signfifies conquering over sexual desires Darpana   The mirror reflects one s true self because of its clarity The holiest symbol is a simple swastika  A Jain swastika is normally associated with the three dots on the top accompanied with a crest and a dot  Other important symbols are  Dharma Wheel on the palm of a hand  symbolizing Ahimsa 24 Lanchhanas  symbols  of the Tirthankaras  They are in the sequence of the 1st Thirthankara to the 24th are  bull  elephant  horse  monkey  redgoose  lotus flower

umbrellas  signifying protection through triple gems of Jainism  The triple umbrella are usually seen with Thirthankar idols Dreams of Trishala  24th Tirthankar s mother prior to giving birth to Mahavir  edit  Culture  edit  Contributions to Indian culture Coins issued by the East India Company showing Jain Tirthankars Mahavira and Parshva Obverse of the coins issued by the East India Company showing Jain Tirthankars Mahavira and Parshva While Jains represent less than 1  of the Indian constitution and population  their contributions to culture and society in India are extremely significant  Jainism had a major influence in developing a system of philosophy and ethics that had a great impact on all aspects of Indian culture  Scholarly research and evidences have shown that philosophical concepts considered typically Indian   karma  ahimsa  moksa  reincarnation and the like   were propagated and developed by Jain teachers  58  Jains have also contributed to the culture and language of the Indian states Tamil Nadu  Karnataka  Gujarat and Rajasthan  Jain scholars and poets authored Tamil classics of the Sangam period such as the Silappatikaram  Civaka Cintamani  Manimekalai and N la iy r  In the beginning of the medieval period  between the 9th and 13th centuries  Kannada authors were predominantly of the Jain and Lingayati faiths  Jains were the earliest known cultivators of Kannada literature  which they dominated until the 12th century  Jains wrote about the Tirthankaras and other aspects of the faith  Adikavi Pampa is one of the greatest Kannada poets of all time and was the court poet of Chalukya king Arikesari  a Rashtrakuta feudatory  and is best known for his Vikramarjuna Vijaya  The works of Adikavi Pampa  Ponna and Ranna  collectively called the  three gems of Kannada literature   heralded the age of classical Kannada in the 10th century  The earliest known Gujarati text  Bharata Bahubali Rasa  was written by a monk  Some important people in Gujarat s history were Acharya Hemachandra and his pupil  the Solanki ruler Kumarpal  Jains are among the wealthiest Indians  They run numerous schools  colleges and hospitals and are important patrons of the Somapuras  the traditional temple architects in Gujarat  Jains have greatly influenced Gujarati cuisine  Gujarat is predominantly vegetarian  see Jain vegetarianism   and its food is mild as onions and garlic are omitted  Jains encourage their monks to do research and obtain higher education  Jain monks and nuns  particularly in Rajasthan  have published numerous research monographs  This is unique among Indian religious groups and parallels Christian clergy  The 2001 census states that Jains are India s most literate community and that India s oldest libraries at Patan and Jaisalmer are preserved by Jain institutions   edit  Literature Jains have contributed to India s classical and popular literature  For example  almost all early Kannada literature and many Tamil works were written by Jains  Some of the oldest known books in Hindi and Gujarati were written by Jain scholars  The first autobiography in the ancestor of Hindi  Braj Bhasha  is called Ardhakath naka and was written by a Jain  Banarasidasa  an ardent follower of Acarya Kundakunda who lived in Agra  Many Tamil classics are written by Jains or with Jain beliefs and values as the core subject  Practically all the known texts in the Apabhramsha language are Jain works  The oldest Jain literature is in Shauraseni and the Jain Prakrit  the Jain Agamas  Agama Tulya  the Siddhanta texts  etc    Many classical texts are in Sanskrit  Tattvartha Sutra  Puranas  Kosh  Sravakacara  mathematics  Nighantus etc     Abhidhana Rajendra Kosha  written by Acharya Rajendrasuri  is only one available Jain encyclopedia or Jain dictionary to understand the Jain Prakrit  Sanskrit  Ardha Magadhi and other languages  words  their use and references within oldest Jain literature  Jain literature was written in Apabhra  a  Kahas  rasas  and grammars   Standard Hindi  Chhahadhala  Moksh Marg Prakashak  and others   Tamil  N la iy r  Civaka Cintamani  Valayapathi  and others   and Kannada  Vaddaradhane and various other texts   Jain versions of the Ramayana and Mahabharata are found in Sanskrit  the Prakrits  Apabhra  a and Kannada  Jains literature exists mainly in Jain Prakrit  Sanskrit  Marathi  Tamil  Rajasthani  Dhundari  Marwari  Hindi  Gujarati  Kannada  Malayalam  59 Tulu and more recently in English   edit  Constitutional status in India Main article  Legal status of Jainism as a distinct religion in India In 2005 the Supreme Court of India declined to issue a writ of mandamus towards granting Jains the status of a religious minority throughout India  The Court noted that Jains have been declared a minority in five states already  and left it to the rest of the States to decide on the minority status of Jain religion  60  In 2006 the Indian Supreme Court  in a judgment pertaining to an Indian state  opined that  Jain Religion is indisputably not a part of the Hindu Religion   61   edit  Jainism and other religions See also  Buddhism and Jainism  Islam and Jainism  and Jainism and Sikhism Jains are not a part of the Vedic Religion  Hinduism   62  63  64  Ancient India had two philosophical streams of thought  The Shramana philosophical schools  represented by Jainism movement  and the Brahmana Vedic Puranic schools represented by Vedanta  Vaishnava and other movements  Both streams have existed side by side for few thousands of years  influencing each other  65  The Hindu scholar  Lokmanya Tilak credited Jainism with influencing Hinduism and thus leading to the cessation of animal sacrifice in Vedic rituals  Bal Gangadhar Tilak has described Jainism as the originator of Ahimsa and wrote in a letter printed in Bombay Samachar  Mumbai 10 December 1904   In ancient times  innumerable animals were butchered in sacrifices  Evidence in support of this is found in various poetic compositions such as the Meghaduta  Swami Vivekananda 20  66  also credited Jainism as influencing force behind the Indian culture and said   What could have saved Indian society from the ponderous burden of omnifarious ritualistic ceremonialism  with its animal and other sacrifices  which all but crushed the very life of it  except the Jain revolution  which took its strong stand exclusively on chaste morals and philosophical truths  Jains were the first great ascetics and they did some great work   Don t injure any and do good to all that you can  and that is all the morality and ethics  and that is all the work there is  and the rest is all nonsense   And then they went to work and elaborated this one principle all through  and it is a most wonderful ideal  how all that we call ethics they simply bring out from that one great principle of non injury and doing good   Relationship between Jainism and Hinduism   According to the Encyclopedia Britannica Article on Hinduism     With Jainism  which always remained an independent Indian religion  Hinduism has some common concepts and practices that nowadays some Hindus tend to consider Jainism to have derived its roots from Hinduism  Independent Religion   From the Encyclop dia Britannica Article on Jainism      Along with Hinduism and Buddhism  it is one of the three most ancient Indian religious traditions still in existence     While often employing concepts shared with Hinduism and Buddhism  the result of a common cultural and linguistic background  the Jain tradition must be regarded as an independent phenomenon  It is an integral part of South Asian religious belief and practice  but it is not a Hindu sect or Buddhist heresy  as earlier scholars believed   67  The author Koenraad Elst in his book  Who is a Hindu   summarises on the similarities between Jains and the mainstream Hindu society  Monier Williams  in his article of Jainism  mentions that Jains outdo every other Indian sect in carrying the prohibition of violence to the greatest extent  68   edit  See also Mahavira Indian religions  edit  References   a b Helmuth von
