k  st  n   officially the Republic of Uzbekistan  Uzbek  O zbekiston Respublikasi or                          is a doubly landlocked country in Central Asia  It shares borders with Kazakhstan to the west and to the north  Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to the east  and Afghanistan and Turkmenistan to the south  Before 1991  it was part of the Soviet Union  Uzbekistan is an observing member of the Turkic Council  Once part of the Persian Samanid and later Timurid empires  the region was conquered in the early 16th century by Uzbek nomads  who spoke an Eastern Turkic language  Most of Uzbekistan s population today belong to the Uzbek ethnic group and speak the Uzbek language  one of the family of Turkic languages  Uzbekistan was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century and in 1924 became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union  known as the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic  Uzbek SSR   It has been an independent republic since December 1991  Uzbekistan s economy relies mainly on commodity production  including cotton  gold  uranium  potassium  and natural gas  Despite the declared objective of transition to a market economy  Uzbekistan continues to maintain rigid economic controls  which often repel foreign investors  The policy of gradual  strictly controlled transition has nevertheless produced beneficial results in the form of economic recovery after 1995  Uzbekistan s domestic policies on human rights and individual freedoms are often criticised by international organizations  9  Contents 1 Geography 1 1 Environment 2 History 3 Politics 4 Human rights

cities in Uzbekistan Satellite map of Uzbekistan  Uzbekistan has an area of 447 400 square kilometres  172 700 sq mi   It is the 56th largest country in the world by area and the 42nd by population  10  Among the CIS countries  it is the 5th largest by area and the 3rd largest by population  11  Uzbekistan lies between latitudes 37  and 46  N  and longitudes 56  and 74  E  It stretches 1 425 kilometres  885 mi  from west to east and 930 kilometres  580 mi  from north to south  Bordering Kazakhstan and the Aral Sea to the north and northwest  Turkmenistan to the southwest  Tajikistan to the southeast  and Kyrgyzstan to the northeast  Uzbekistan is not only one of the larger Central Asian states but also the only Central Asian state to border all the other four  Uzbekistan also shares a short border  less than 150 km or 93 mi  with Afghanistan to the south  Uzbekistan is a dry  landlocked country  it is one of two doubly landlocked countries in the world  that is  a country completely surrounded by landlocked countries   the other being Liechtenstein  Less than 10  of its territory is intensively cultivated irrigated land in river valleys and oases  The rest is vast desert  Kyzyl Kum  and mountains  The highest point in Uzbekistan is the Khazret Sultan  located at 4 643 metres  15 233 ft  above sea level  located in the southern part of the Gissar Range in Surkhandarya Province  on the border with Tajikistan  just north west of Dushanbe  formerly called Peak of the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party   11  The climate in the Republic of Uzbekistan is continental  with little precipitation expected annually  100 200 millimeters  or 3 9 7 9 inches   The average summer high temperature tends to be 40  C  104  F   while the average winter low temperature is around  23  C   9  F   12  Major cities include Andijan  Bukhara  Samarkand  Namangan and the capital Tashkent   edit  Environment Comparison of the Aral Sea between 1989 and 2008  Decades of questionable Soviet policies in pursuit of greater cotton production have resulted in a catastrophic scenario  The agricultural industry appears to be the main contributor to the pollution and devastation of the air and water in the country  13  The Aral Sea disaster is a classic example  The Aral Sea used to be the fourth largest inland sea on Earth  acting as an influencing factor in the air moisture  14  Since the 1960s  the decade when the misuse of the Aral Sea water began  it has shrunk to less than 50  of its former area and decreased in volume threefold  Reliable or even approximate data have not been collected  stored or provided by any organization or official agency  Much of the water was and still continues to be used for the irrigation of cotton fields  a crop that requires a large amount of water to grow  15  The numbers of animal deaths and human refugees from the area around the sea can only be guessed  The question of who is responsible for the crisis remains open   the Soviet scientists and politicians who directed the distribution of water during the 1960s  or the post Soviet politicians who did not allocate sufficient funding for the building of dams and irrigation systems  Due to the virtually unsolvable Aral Sea problem  high salinity and contamination of the soil with heavy elements are especially widespread in Karakalpakstan  the region of Uzbekistan adjacent to the Aral Sea  The bulk of the nation s water resources is used for farming  which accounts for nearly 94  of the water usage and contributes to high soil salinity  Heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers for cotton growing further aggravates soil pollution  12   edit  History Main article  History of Uzbekistan Female statuette bearing the kaunakes  Chlorite and limestone  Bactria  beginning of the 2nd millennium BC  Alexander at the Battle of Issus  The earliest Bronze Age colonists of the Tarim Basin were people of Caucasoid physical type who entered probably from the north and west and spoke languages that could be classified as Pre  or Proto Tocharian  ancestral to the Indo European Tocharian languages documented later in the Tarim Basin  These early settlers occupied the northern and eastern parts of the Tarim Basin  where their graves have yielded mummies dated about 1800 BC  They participated in a cultural world centered on the eastern steppes of central Eurasia  including modern northeastern Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  and Tajikistan  At the eastern end of the Tarim Basin  people of Mongoloid physical type began to be buried in cemeteries such as Yanbulaq some centuries later  during the later second or early first millennium BC  About the same time  Iranian speaking people moved into the Tarim Basin from the steppes to the west  Their linguistic heritage and perhaps their physical remains are found in the southern and western portions of the Tarim  These three populations interacted  as the linguistic and archaeological evidence reviewed by Mallory and Mair makes clear  and then Turkic people arrived and were added to the mix  16  The first people known to inhabit Central Asia were Iranian nomads who arrived from the northern grasslands of what is now Uzbekistan sometime in the first millennium BC  These nomads  who spoke Iranian dialects  settled in Central Asia and began to build an extensive irrigation system along the rivers of the region  At this time  cities such as Bukhoro  Bukhara  and Samarqand  Samarkand  began to appear as centers of government and culture  By the 5th century BC  the Bactrian  Soghdian  and Tokharian states dominated the region  As China began to develop its silk trade with the West  Iranian cities took advantage of this commerce by becoming centres of trade  Using an extensive network of cities and settlements in the province of Mawarannahr  a name given the region after the Arab conquest  in Uzbekistan and farther east in what is today China s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region  the Soghdian intermediaries became the wealthiest of these Iranian merchants  Because of this trade on what became known as the Silk Route  Bukhoro and Samarqand eventually became extremely wealthy cities  and at times Mawarannahr was one of the most influential and powerful Persian provinces of antiquity  17  Map of the Sassanid Empire  The Registan  The Russians taking over the city of Khiva  Alexander the Great conquered Sogdiana and Bactria in 327 BC  marrying Roxana  daughter of a local Bactrian chieftain  The conquest was supposedly of little help to Alexander as popular resistance was fierce  causing Alexander s army to be bogged down in the region that became the northern part of Hellenistic Greco Bactrian Kingdom  For many centuries the region of Uzbekistan was ruled by Persian empires  including the Parthian and Sassanid Empires  In the 8th century Transoxiana  territory between the Amudarya and Syrdarya rivers  was conquered by Arabs  In the 9th   10th centuries  Transoxiana was included into Samanid State  Later Transoxiana saw the incursion of the Turkic Karakhanids  as well as the Seljuks and Kara Khitans  18  The Mongol conquest under Genghis Khan during the 13th century would bring about a dramatic change to the region  The brutal conquest and widespread genocide characteristic of the Mongols almost entirely exterminated the indigenous Indo Persian  Scythian  people of the region  their culture and heritage being superseded by that of the Mongolian Turkic peoples who settled the region thereafter  Following the death of Genghis Khan in 1227  his empire was divided among his four sons and his family members  Despite the potential for serious fragmentation  Mongol law of the Mongol Empire maintained orderly succession for several more generations  and control of most of Mawarannahr stayed in the hands of direct descendants of Chagatai Khan  the second son of Genghis Khan  Orderly succession  prosperity  and internal peace prevailed in the Chaghatai lands  and the Mongol Empire as a whole remained strong and united  19  In the early fourteenth century  however  as the empire began to break up into its constituent parts  the Chaghatai territory also was disrupted as the princes of various tribal groups competed for influence  One tribal chieftain  Timur  Tamerlane   20  emerged from these struggles in the 1380s as the dominant force in Mawarannahr  Although he was not a descendant of Chinggis  Timur became the de facto ruler of Mawarannahr and proceeded to conquer all of western Central Asia  Iran  Asia Minor  and the southern steppe region north of the Aral Sea  He also invaded Russia and India before dying during an invasion of China in 1405  19  Timur initiated the last flowering of Mawarannahr by gathering in his capital  Samarqand  numerous artisans and scholars from the lands he had conquered  By supporting such people  Timur imbued his empire with a very rich culture  During Timur s reign and the reigns of his immediate descendants  a wide range of religious and palatial construction projects were undertaken in Samarqand and other population centres  Timur also initiated exchange of medical thoughts and patronized physicians  scientists and artists from the neighboring countries like India  21  his grandson Ulugh Beg was one of the world s first great astronomers  It was during the Timurid dynasty that Turkish  in the form of the Chaghatai dialect  became a literary language in its own right in Mawarannahr although the Timurids also patronized writing in Persian  Until then only Persian had been used in the region  The greatest Chaghataid writer  Ali Shir Nava i  was active in the city of Herat  now in northwestern Afghanistan  in the second half of the fifteenth century  19  The Timurid state quickly broke into two halves after the death of Timur  The chronic internal fighting of the Timurids attracted the attention of the Uzbek nomadic tribes living to the north of the Aral Sea  In 1501 the Uzbeks began a wholesale invasion of Mawarannahr  19  The slave trade in the Khanate of Bukhara became prominent and was firmly established  22  Estimates from 1821 suggest that between 25 000 and 40 000 Persian slaves were working in Bukhara at the time  23  In the nineteenth century  the Russian Empire began to expand and spread into Central Asia  By 1912  Russians living in Uzbekistan numbered 210 306  24  The  Great Game  period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the Anglo Russian Convention of 1907  Following the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917  a second  less intensive phase followed  At the start of the nineteenth century  there were some 3 200 kilometres  2 000 mi  separating British India and the outlying regions of Tsarist Russia  Much of the land in between was unmapped  By the beginning of the twentieth century  Central Asia was firmly in the hands of Russia and  despite some early resistance to Bolsheviks  Uzbekistan and the rest of Central Asia became a part of the Soviet Union  On October 27  1924 the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic was created  On August 31  1991  Uzbekistan declared independence  marking September 1 as a national holiday  The country is now the world s third largest exporter of cotton  and it is developing its mineral and petroleum reserves  citation needed   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Uzbekistan The Uzbek parliament  Islam Karimov  president of Uzbekistan  The first elections of the Oliy Majlis  Parliament  were held under a resolution adopted by the 16th Supreme Soviet in 1994  In that year  the Supreme Soviet was replaced by the Oliy Majlis  Since then Uzbekistan has held presidential and parliamentarian elections on regular basis but no real opposition candidates or parties are able to participate  citation needed  The third elections for the bicameral 150 member Oliy Majlis   the Legislative Chamber and the 100 member Senate   for five year terms  were held on December 27  2009  after the second elections that were held in December 2004   2005  The Oliy Majlis was unicameral up to 2004  Its strength increased from 69 deputies  members  in 1994 to 120 in 2004 05 and presently to 150  The executive holds a great deal of power  and the legislature has little power to shape laws  Under terms of a December 27  1995 referendum  Islam Karimov s first term was extended  Another national referendum was held January 27  2002 to extend the Constitutional Presidential term from 5 years to 7 years  The referendum passed  and Karimov s term was extended by an act of parliament to December 2007  Most international observers refused to participate in the process and did not recognize the results  dismissing them as not meeting basic standards  The 2002 referendum also included a plan to create a bicameral parliament  consisting of a lower house  the Oliy Majlis  and an upper house  Senate   Members of the lower house are to be  full time  legislators  Elections for the new bicameral parliament took place on December 26  but no truly independent opposition candidates or parties were able to take part  The OSCE limited observation mission concluded that the elections fell significantly short of OSCE commitments and other international standards for democratic elections  Several political parties have been formed with government approval  Similarly  although multiple media outlets  radio  TV  newspaper  have been established  these either remain under government control or rarely broach political topics  Independent political parties were allowed to organise  recruit members and hold conventions and press conferences  but they have been denied registration under restrictive registration procedures   edit  Human rights Main article  Human rights in Uzbekistan The Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan asserts that  democracy in the Republic of Uzbekistan shall be based upon common human principles  according to which the highest value shall be the human being  his life  freedom  honour  dignity and other inalienable rights   The official position is summarised in a memorandum  The measures taken by the government of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the field of providing and encouraging human rights  25  and amounts to the following  the government does everything that is in its power to protect and to guarantee the human rights of Uzbekistan s citizens  Uzbekistan continuously improves its laws and institutions in order to create a more humane society  Over 300 laws regulating the rights and basic freedoms of the people have been passed by the parliament  For instance  an office of Ombudsman was established in 1996  26  On August 2  2005  President Islam Karimov signed a decree that was to abolish capital punishment in Uzbekistan on January 1  2008  However  non governmental human rights watchdogs  such as IHF  Human Rights Watch  Amnesty International  as well as United States Department of State and Council of the European Union define Uzbekistan as  an authoritarian state with limited civil rights  27  and express profound concern about  wide scale violation of virtually all basic human rights   28  According to the reports  the most widespread violations are torture  arbitrary arrests  and various restrictions of freedoms  of religion  of speech and press  of free association and assembly  29  The reports maintain that the violations are most often committed against members of religious organizations  independent journalists  human rights activists and political activists  including members of the banned opposition parties  In 2005  Uzbekistan was included into Freedom House s  The Worst of the Worst  The World s Most Repressive Societies   In October 2002 Craig Murray  the British Ambassador to the country  made a speech at a human rights conference hosted by Freedom House in Tashkent in which he asserted that  Uzbekistan is not a functioning democracy  and that the boiling to death of two members of Hizb ut Tahrir  is not an isolated incident   30  Later  Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan confronted Uzbek President Islam Karimov with Murray s claims  Murray was summoned to the FCO in London and on 8 March 2003 was reprimanded for writing in a letter to his employers  in response to a speech by President of the United States George W  Bush   when it comes to the Karimov regime  systematic torture and rape appear to be treated as peccadilloes  not to affect the relationship and to be downplayed in the international fora     I hope that once the present crisis is over we will make plain to the US at senior level our serious concern over their policy in Uzbekistan   31  The 2005 civil unrest in Uzbekistan  which resulted in several hundred people being killed  is viewed by many as a landmark event in the history of human rights abuse in Uzbekistan  32  33  34  A concern has been expressed and a request for an independent investigation of the events has been made by the United States  European Union  the UN  the OSCE Chairman in Office and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights  The government of Uzbekistan is accused of unlawful termination of human life and of denying its citizens freedom of assembly and freedom of expression  The government vehemently rebuffs the accusations  maintaining that it merely conducted an anti terrorist operation  exercising only necessary force  35  In addition  some officials claim that  an information war on Uzbekistan has been declared  and the human rights violations in Andijan are invented by the enemies of Uzbekistan as a convenient pretext for intervention into the country s internal affairs  36  Uzbekistan also does not allow Tajiks to teach their youth in their native language  There have been cases of destroying Tajiki  Persian language  literary works  37   edit  Provinces and districts Main articles  Provinces of Uzbekistan and

Uzbekistan s economy declined during the first years of transition and then recovered after 1995  as the cumulative effect of policy reforms began to be felt  It has shown robust growth  rising by 4  per year between 1998 and 2003 and accelerating thereafter to 7  8  per year  According to IMF estimates  42  the GDP in 2008 will be almost double its value in 1995  in constant prices   Since 2003 annual inflation rates averaged less than 10   Uzbekistan has a very low GNI per capita  US 610 in current dollars in 2006  giving a PPP equivalent of US 2 250   43  By GNI per capita in PPP equivalents Uzbekistan ranks 169 among 209 countries  among the 12 CIS countries  only Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan had lower GNI per capita in 2006  Economic production is concentrated in commodities  Uzbekistan is now the world s sixth largest producer and second largest exporter of cotton  44  as well as the seventh largest world producer of gold  It is also a regionally significant producer of natural gas  coal  copper  oil  silver and uranium  45  Agriculture employs 28  of Uzbekistan s labour force and contributes 24  of its GDP  2006 data   11  While official unemployment is very low  underemployment   especially in rural areas   is estimated to be at least 20   5  Still  at cotton harvest time  all students and teachers are mobilized and enslaved as unpaid labour to help in the fields  46  The use of child labour in Uzbekistan has led several companies  including Tesco  47  C amp A  48  Marks  amp  Spencer  Gap  and H amp M  to boycott Uzbek cotton  49  Facing a multitude of economic challenges upon acquiring independence  the government adopted an evolutionary reform strategy  with an emphasis on state control  reduction of imports and self sufficiency in energy  Since 1994  the state controlled media have repeatedly proclaimed the success of this  Uzbekistan Economic Model  50  and suggested that it is a unique example of a smooth transition to the market economy while avoiding shock  pauperism and stagnation  The gradualist reform strategy has involved postponing significant macroeconomic and structural reforms  The state in the hands of the bureaucracy has remained a dominant influence in the economy  Corruption permeates the society and grows more rampant over time  Uzbekistan s 2005 Corruption Perception Index was 137 out of 159 countries  whereas in 2007 Uzbekistan was 175th out of 179 countries  A February 2006 report on the country by the International Crisis Group suggests that revenues earned from key exports  especially cotton  gold  corn and increasingly gas  are distributed among a very small circle of the ruling elite  with little or no benefit for the populace at large  51  According to the Economist Intelligence Unit   the government is hostile to allowing the development of an independent private sector  over which it would have no control   52  Thus  the middle class is marginalised economically and  consequently  politically  The economic policies have repelled foreign investment  which is the lowest per capita in the CIS  53  For years  the largest barrier to foreign companies entering the Uzbekistan market has been the difficulty of converting currency  In 2003  the government accepted the obligations of Article VIII under the International Monetary Fund  54  providing for full currency convertibility  However  strict currency controls and the tightening of borders have lessened the effect of this measure  Uzbekistan experienced rampant inflation of around 1000  per year immediately after independence  1992 1994   Stabilisation efforts implemented with guidance from the IMF 55  paid off  The inflation rates were brought down to 50  in 1997 and then to 22  in 2002  Since 2003 annual inflation rates averaged less than 10   42  Tight economic policies in 2004 resulted in a drastic reduction of inflation to 3 8   although alternative estimates based on the price of a true market basket  put it at 15    56  The inflation rates moved up to 6 9  in 2006 and 7 6  in 2007 but have remained in the single digit range  57  The government of Uzbekistan restricts foreign imports in many ways  including high import duties  Excise taxes are applied in a highly discriminatory manner to protect locally produced goods  Official tariffs are combined with unofficial  discriminatory charges resulting in total charges amounting to as much as 100 to 150  of the actual value of the product  making imported products virtually unaffordable  58  Import substitution is an officially declared policy and the government proudly reports a reduction by a factor of two in the volume of consumer goods imported  A number of CIS countries are officially exempt from Uzbekistan import duties  The Republican Stock Exchange  RSE   Tashkent  opened in 1994  It houses a securities exchange  real estate traders  the national investment fund and the national securities depositary  It does not trade all joint stock companies each month  and therefore market capitalisation varies widely  citation needed  Uzbekistan s external position has been strong since 2003  Thanks in part to the recovery of world market prices of gold and cotton  the country s key export commodities   expanded natural gas and some manufacturing exports  and increasing labour migrant transfers  the current account turned into a large surplus  between 9  and 11  of GDP from 2003 to 2005  and foreign exchange reserves  including gold  more than doubled to around US 3 billion  citation needed  Foreign

scholars put the number up to 20  30   1  2  3  4  The Uzbeks absorbed  among others  the Sarts  a Turko Persian population of Central Asian peasants and merchants  According to recent genetic genealogy testing from a University of Oxford study  the genetic admixture of the Uzbeks clusters somewhere between the Mongols and the Iranian peoples  61  Uzbekistan has an ethnic Korean population that was forcibly relocated to the region by Stalin from the Soviet Far East in 1937 1938  There are also small groups of Armenians in Uzbekistan  mostly in Tashkent and Samarkand  The nation is 88

of the population  in the 1970 census  65  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union  significant emigration of ethnic Russians has taken place  mostly for economic reasons  66  In the 1940s  the Crimean Tatars  along with the Germans  Chechens  Greeks  Turks  Kurds and many other nationalities were deported to Central Asia  67  Approximately 100 000 Crimean Tatars continue to live in Uzbekistan  68  The number of Greeks in Tashkent has decreased from 35 000 in 1974 to about 12 000 today  69  The majority of Meskhetian Turks left Uzbekistan after 1989  70  At least 10  of Uzbekistan s labour force works abroad  mostly in Russia and Kazakhstan   71  Uzbekistan has a 99 3  literacy rate among adults older than 15  2003 estimate   5  which is attributable to the free and universal education system of the Soviet Union  Mosque of Bukhara   edit  Religion Main article  Islam in Uzbekistan Islam is by far the dominant religion in Uzbekistan  as Muslims constitute 90  of the population while 5  of the population follow Russian Orthodox Christianity  and 5  of the population follow other religion according to a 2009 US State Department release  72  However  a 2009 Pew Research Center report stated that Uzbekistan s population is 96 3  Muslim  73  An estimated 93 000 Jews were once present in the country  Despite its predominance  the practice of Islam is far from monolithic  Many versions of the faith have been practiced in Uzbekistan  The conflict of Islamic tradition with various agendas of reform or secularization throughout the 20th century has left the outside world with a confused notion of Islamic practices in Central Asia  The end of Soviet power in Uzbekistan did not bring an upsurge of fundamentalism  as many had predicted  but rather a gradual reacquaintance with the precepts of the faith  However after 2000  there seems to be a rise of support in favor of the Islamists  citation needed  Although constitutionally maintaining rights to freedom of religion  Uzbekistan maintains a ban on all religious activities not approved by that state  with particularly harsh treatment of Protestant Christians being commonplace  See  Human Rights  Freedom of Religion  Uzbekistan  edit  Languages Main article  Uzbek language The Uzbek language is the only official state language  74  and since 1992 is officially written in the Latin alphabet  The Tajik language is widespread in the cities of Bukhara and Samarkand because of their relatively large population of ethnic Tajiks  2  Russian is an important language for interethnic communication  especially in the cities  including much day to day technical  scientific  governmental and business use  Russian is the main language of over 14  of the population and is spoken as a second language by many more  The use of Russian in remote rural areas has always been limited  and today school children have no proficiency in Russian even in urban centres  However  it was reported in 2003 that over half of the population could speak Russian  and a renewed close political relationship between Russia and Uzbekistan have meant that official discouragement of Russian has dropped off sharply  75  In 1992 Uzbekistan officially shifted back to Latin script  citation needed  but many signs and notices  including official government boards in the streets  are still written in Uzbek Cyrillic script that had been used in Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic since 1940  Computers as a rule operate using the  Uzbek Cyrillic  keyboard  and Latin script is reportedly who   composed using the standard English keyboard   edit  Communications Main article  Communications in Uzbekistan According to the official source report  as of March 10  2008  the number of cellular phone users in Uzbekistan reached 7 million  up from 3 7 million on July 1  2007  76  The largest mobile operator in terms of number of subscribers is MTS Uzbekistan  former Uzdunrobita and part of Russian Mobile

TeliaSonera AB   77  As of July 1  2007  the estimated number of internet users was 1 8 million  according to UzACI   edit  Transportation Main article  Transportation in Uzbekistan Central Station of Tashkent Afrosiyob high speed train Tashkent  the nation s capital and largest city  has a three line rapid transit system built in 1977  and expanded in 2001 after ten years  independence from the Soviet Union  Uzbekistan is currently the only country in Central Asia with a subway system  which is promoted as one of the cleanest systems in the former Soviet Union  The stations are exceedingly ornate  For example  the station Metro Kosmonavtov built in 1984 is decorated using a space travel theme to recognise the achievements of mankind in space exploration and to commemorate the role of Vladimir Dzhanibekov  the Soviet cosmonaut of Uzbek origin  A statue of Vladimir Dzhanibekov stands near one of the station s entrances  There are government operated trams  buses and trolley buses running across the city  There are also many taxis  both registered and unregistered  Uzbekistan has car producing plants which produce modern cars  The car production is supported by the government and the Korean auto company Daewoo  The Uzbek government acquired a 50  stake in Daewoo in 2005 citation needed  for an undisclosed sum  and in May 2007 UzDaewooAuto  the car maker  signed a strategic agreement with General Motors Daewoo Auto and Technology  GMDAT  see  GM Uzbekistan also   78  The government also bought a stake in Turkey s Koc in SamKochAvto  a producer of small buses and lorries  Afterwards  it signed an agreement with Isuzu Motors of Japan to produce Isuzu buses and lorries  79  Train links connect many towns within Uzbekistan  as well as neighboring former republics of the Soviet Union  Moreover  after independence two fast running train systems were established  Uzbekistan has launched first high speed railway in Central Asia in September 2011 between Tashkent and Samarqand  The new high speed electric train Talgo 250  called Afrosiyob  was manufactured by Patentes Talgo S L   Spain  and carried out its first trip from Tashkent to Samarkand on August 26  2011  80  There is also a large airplane plant that was built during the Soviet era   Tashkent Chkalov Aviation Manufacturing Plant or        in Russian  The plant originated during World War II  when production facilities were evacuated south and east to avoid capture by advancing Nazi forces  Until the late 1980s  the plant was one of the leading airplane production centers in the USSR  but with dissolution of the Soviet Union its manufacturing equipment became outdated  and most of the workers were laid off  Now it produces only a few planes a year  but with interest from Russian companies growing in it  there are rumours of production enhancement plans   edit  Military Main article  Military of Uzbekistan Uzbek troop during a cooperative operation exercise  Uzbekistan possesses the largest military force in the Central Asian region having around 65 000 people in uniform  Its structure was inherited from the Soviet Armed Forces  Turkestan Military District  although it is moving toward a fully restructured organisation  which is to be based on motor rifle troops  motorised infantry  with some light and Special Forces  The Uzbek Armed Forces  equipment is not modern  and training  while improving  is neither uniform nor adequate for its new mission of territorial security  The government has accepted the arms control obligations of the former Soviet Union  acceded to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty  as a non nuclear state   and supported an active program by the U S  Defense Threat Reduction Agency  DTRA  in western Uzbekistan  Nukus and Vozrozhdeniye Island   The Government of Uzbekistan spends about 3 7  of GDP on the military but has received a growing infusion of Foreign Military Financing  FMF  and other security assistance funds since 1998  Following the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks in the U S   Uzbekistan approved the U S  Central Command s request for access to an air base  the Karshi Khanabad airfield  in southern Uzbekistan  However  Uzbekistan demanded that the U S  withdraw from the airbases after the Andijan massacre and the U S  reaction to this massacre  The last US troops left Uzbekistan in November 2005   edit  Foreign relations Main articles  Foreign relations of Uzbekistan and International organization membership of Uzbekistan Embassy of Uzbekistan in Washington  D C   Uzbekistan joined the Commonwealth of Independent States in December 1991  However  it is opposed to reintegration and withdrew from the CIS collective security arrangement in 1999  Since that time  Uzbekistan has participated in the CIS peacekeeping force in Tajikistan and in UN organized groups to help resolve the Tajikistan and Afghanistan conflicts  both of which it sees as posing threats to its own stability  Previously close to Washington  which gave Uzbekistan half a billion dollars in aid in 2004  about a quarter of its military budget   the government of Uzbekistan has recently restricted American military use of the airbase at Karshi Khanabad for air operations in neighboring Afghanistan  81  Uzbekistan was an active supporter of U S  efforts against worldwide terrorism and joined the coalitions that have dealt with both Afghanistan and Iraq  The relationship between Uzbekistan and the United States began to deteriorate after the so called  colour revolutions  in Georgia and Ukraine  and to a lesser extent Kyrgyzstan   When the U S  joined in a call for an independent international investigation of the bloody events at Andijon  the relationship took an additional nosedive  and President Islam Karimov changed the political alignment of the country to bring it closer to Russia and China  countries which chose not to criticise Uzbekistan s leaders for their alleged human rights violations  In late July 2005  the government of Uzbekistan ordered the United States to vacate an air base in Karshi Kanabad  near Uzbekistan s border with Afghanistan  within 180 days  Karimov had offered use of the base to the U S  shortly after 9 11  It is also believed by some Uzbeks that the protests in Andijan were brought about by the U K  and U S  influences in the area of Andijan  This is another reason for the hostility between Uzbekistan and the West  Uzbekistan is a member of the United Nations  UN   since March 2  1992   the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council  EAPC   Partnership for Peace  PfP   and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe  OSCE   It belongs to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation  OIC  and the Economic Cooperation Organisation  ECO   comprising the five Central Asian countries  Azerbaijan  Turkey  Iran  Afghanistan  and Pakistan   In 1999  Uzbekistan joined the GUAM alliance  Georgia  Ukraine  Azerbaijan and Moldova   which was formed in 1997  making it GUUAM   but pulled out of the organization in 2005  Uzbekistan is also a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation  SCO  and hosts the SCO s Regional Anti Terrorist Structure  RATS  in Tashkent  Uzbekistan joined the new Central Asian Cooperation Organisation  CACO  in 2002  The CACO consists of Uzbekistan  Tajikistan  Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan  It is a founding member of  and remains involved in  the Central Asian Union  formed with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan  and joined in March 1998 by Tajikistan  In September 2006  UNESCO presented Islam Karimov an award for Uzbekistan s preservation of its rich culture and traditions  Despite criticism  this seems to be a sign of improving relationships between Uzbekistan and the West  The month of October 2006 also saw a decrease in the isolation of Uzbekistan from the West  The EU announced that it was planning to send a delegation to Uzbekistan to talk about human rights and liberties  after a long period of hostile relations between the two  Although it is equivocal about whether the official or unofficial version of the Andijan Massacre is true  the EU is evidently willing to ease its economic sanctions against Uzbekistan  Nevertheless  it is generally assumed among Uzbekistan s population that the government will stand firm in maintaining its close ties with the Russian Federation and in its theory that the 2004 2005 protests in Uzbekistan were promoted by the USA and UK   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of Uzbekistan See also  Kurash  Islam in Uzbekistan  and Scout Association of Uzbekistan Traditional Uzbek pottery  Old Uzbek man from central Uzbekistan  Navoi Opera in Tashkent Uzbekistan has a wide mix of ethnic groups and cultures  with the Uzbek being the majority group  In 1995 about 71  of Uzbekistan s population was Uzbek  The chief minority groups were Russians  8    Tajiks  5 30    1  2  3  82 Kazaks  4    Tatars  2 5   and Karakalpaks  2    It is said  however  that the number of non Uzbek people living in Uzbekistan is decreasing as Russians and other minority groups slowly leave and Uzbeks return from other parts of the former Soviet Union  When Uzbekistan gained independence in 1991  there was concern that Muslim fundamentalism would spread across the region  The expectation was that a country long denied freedom of religious practice would undergo a very rapid increase in the expression of its dominant faith  As of 1994  well over half of Uzbekistan s population was said to be Muslim  though in an official survey few of that number had any real knowledge of the religion or knew how to practice it  However  Islamic observance is increasing in the region  Uzbekistan has a high literacy rate  with about 99 3  of adults above the age of 15 being able to read and write  However with only 88  of the under 15 population currently enrolled in education  this figure may drop in the future  citation needed  Uzbekistan has encountered severe budgeting shortfalls in its education program  The education law of 1992 began the process of theoretical reform  but the physical base has deteriorated and curriculum revision has been slow  Uzbekistan s universities create almost 600 000 graduates annually   edit  Music Dance of a Bacha in Samarkand between 1905 and 1915 Main article  Music of Uzbekistan Central Asian classical music is called Shashmaqam  which arose in Bukhara in the late 16th century when that city was a regional capital  Shashmaqam is closely related to Azerbaijani Mugam and Uyghur muqam  The name  which translates as six maqams refers to the structure of the music  which contains six sections in six different Musical modes  similar to classical Persian traditional music  Interludes of spoken Sufi poetry interrupt the music  typically beginning at a lower register and gradually ascending to a climax before calming back down to the beginning tone  Endurance of listening and continual audiences that attend events  such as Bazms or Weddings  is what makes the Folk pop style of music so popular  The classical music in Uzbekistan is very different than that of the pop music  Mostly men listen to Solo or Duo shows during a morning or evening meeting amongst men  Shash maqam  which is the main component of the classical genre of music  The large support of the musicians from high class families  which meant the Patronage was to be paid to the Shash maqam above all things  Poetry is where some of the music is drawn from  In some instances of the music  the 2 languages are even mixed in the same song  In the 1950s  the folk music became less popular  and the genre was barred from the radio stations  They did not completely dispel the music all together  although the name changed to Feudal music  Although banned  the folk musical groups continued to play their music in their own ways and spread it individually as well  Many say that it was the most liberated musical experience in their lives   edit  Education WIUT main building in Summer Uzbekistan has a high Literacy rate with about 88  of adults above the age of 15 being able to read and write  However  with only 76  of the under 15 population currently enrolled in education  this figure may drop in the future  Uzbekistan has encountered severe budgeting shortfalls in its education program  The education law of 1992
