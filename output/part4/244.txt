Geography Washington Heights is on the high ridge in Upper Manhattan that rises steeply north of the narrow valley that carries 125th Street to the former ferry landing on the Hudson River that served the village of Manhattanville  Though the neighborhood was once considered to run as far south as 125th Street  modern usage defines the neighborhood as running north from Hamilton Heights at 155th Street to Inwood  topping out just below Dyckman Street  2  The wooded slopes of Washington Heights seen from a sandy cove on the Hudson as they were about 1845 are illustrated in a canvas by John James Audubon s son  Victor Clifford Audubon  conserved by the Museum of the City of New York  3   edit  Manhattan s highest point Fifteen blocks from the northern end of Washington Heights  in its Hudson Heights neighborhood near Pinehurst Avenue and 183rd Street in Bennett Park  is a plaque marking Manhattan s highest natural elevation  265 ft  80 8 m  above sea level  at what was the location of Fort Washington  the Revolutionary War camp of General George Washington and his troops  from whom Washington Heights takes its name  4   edit  History The Battle of Fort Washington  which occurred on November 16  1776  saw Fort Washington fall to the British at great cost to the American forces  130 soldiers were killed or wounded  and an additional 2 700 captured and held as prisoners  many of whom died on prison ships anchored in New York Harbor  The British renamed it  Fort Knyphausen  to honor the German general who had led the successful attack  and held it for the remainder of the war  5  The progress of the battle is marked by a series of bronze plaques along Broadway  Tourists in Washington Heights The series of ridges overlooking the Hudson were sites of villas in the 19th century  including the extensive property of John James Audubon  In the early 1900s  Irish immigrants moved to Washington Heights  European Jews went to Washington Heights to escape Nazism during the 1930s and the 1940s  During the 1950s and 1960s  many Greeks moved to Washington Heights  the community was referred to as the  Astoria of Manhattan   By the 1980 90s  the neighborhood became mostly Dominican  By the 2000s  after years when gangsters ruled a thriving illegal drug trade  urban renewal began  Many Dominicans moved to Morris Heights  University Heights  and other west Bronx neighborhoods  6  While gentrification is often blamed for rapid changes in the neighborhood  the changes in population also reflect the departure of the dominant nationality  Even though Dominicans still make up 73 percent of the neighborhood  their moves to the Bronx have made room for Mexicans and Ecuadorians  according to The Latino Data Project of the City University of New York  7  The proportion of whites in Washington Heights has declined from 18 percent in 1990 to 14 percent in 2005  8   edit  Transportation Three of the bridges that cross the Harlem River are visible  the unused

pedestrian bridge that has been closed since 1970  It has been recently announced High Bridge will reopen after a 20 million dollar renovation project   edit  Step streets Because of their abrupt  hilly topography  pedestrian navigation  particularly in Upper Manhattan and the West Bronx  is facilitated by many step streets  14   The longest of these in Washington Heights  at approximately 130 stairs  connects Fort Washington Ave and Overlook Terrace at 187th St  15  Those averse to climbing stairs can alternatively traverse the elevation change by using the three massive elevators within the 181st Street Subway Station  with entrances on Overlook  16  and Fort Washington  17    edit  Subways Washington Heights is well served by the New York City Subway  On the IND Eighth Avenue Line

the majority of the neighborhood s population is of Dominican birth or descent  the area is sometimes referred to as  Quisqueya Heights    and Spanish is frequently heard being spoken on the streets

Neighborhoods  edit  Fort Tryon  Frankfurt on the Hudson and Hudson Heights Main article  Hudson Heights  Manhattan  Fort Washington Collegiate Church In the years after World War I Fort Tryon was the name of the area between Broadway and the Hudson River  and south of the park to W  179th Street  18  References to the old name survive in the Fort Tryon Jewish Center  on Fort Washington Avenue between W  183rd and W  185th Streets  the Fort Tryon Deli and Grocery  also on Fort Washington Avenue  at W  187th Street   and in the pages of the Not for Tourists Guide to New York City  19  The neighborhood s name had changed by the late 1940s  Jews from Germany and Austria were leaving home as the Nazi party came to power  A disproportionately large number of Germans who settled in the area had come from Frankfurt am Main  giving rise to Frankfurt on the Hudson  18  So many Jewish immigrants lived in Washington Heights after World War II that the neighborhood around Broadway and W  160th Street was jokingly referred to as the Fourth Reich  20  There remains a significant Jewish population  particularly on the west side of Broadway  descended from the previous wave of immigration  as well as students  and recent graduates  of the neighborhood s Yeshiva University  Currently some refer to the area as  Hudson Heights   21  22  Hudson Heights is generally considered to extend as far east as Broadway  23  24  although others shrink it to the blocks between Fort Washington Avenue and the Hudson River  citation needed  The name seems to have stuck starting in the 1990s  when neighborhood real estate brokers and activists started using it  24  As Soviet  and  later  Russian  immigrants filled the area  Russian became far more common than German  Once Spanish become prevalent  and English was the lingua franca  the German nickname fell by the wayside   edit  Fort George Hudson Heights isn t the only Washington Heights neighborhood with a distinct name  Historically  Fort George runs from Broadway east to the Harlem River  and from West 181st Street north to Dyckman Street and Sherman Creek  The largest institution in Fort George is Yeshiva University  whose main campus sits east of Amsterdam Avenue in Highbridge Park  A branch of the Young Men s  amp  Women s Hebrew Association is in the neighborhood  and George Washington High School sits on the site of the original Fort George  One of Manhattan s rare semi private streets is there  Washington Terrace runs south of West 186th Street for a half block between Audubon and Amsterdam Avenues  The single family homes there were built for middle class families but some have been unoccupied for years  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority s M3 bus is labeled as traveling between the East Village and Fort George  25   edit  Sherman Creek and El Alto Sherman Creek is a small inlet of the Harlem River located south of West 201st Street  north of the Harlem River Drive  and east of Tenth Avenue  As a name for the several blocks around it  Sherman Creek is something of a historical relic  as many people don t care to distinguish it from the surrounding parts of Washington Heights  The name  Sherman Creek  in reference to a residential neighborhood  may make a re appearance if a much discussed huge condo complex one day gets off the ground there  Municipal planners haven t stopped using the name  however  The Manhattan Institute 26  held a forum   Saving Sherman Creek   in January 2006 at the Harvard Club of New York  27  The Daily News  New York  has written about the project  28  Interestingly  new names for neighborhoods are generally considered to be ersatz creations of real estate agents and  therefore  emblematic of gentrification  However  the newest name for Washington Heights   an alternative  really   comes not from people with dollar signs in their eyes  The Spanish speaking Caribbean immigrants who have flocked here for decades call Washington Heights a name worthy of its elevation  El Alto   edit  1980s Crime epidemic Although Washington Heights is now one of the safest neighborhoods in Manhattan 29   it was once very different  In the 1980s  the area was severely affected by the crack cocaine epidemic  This was due  in part  to the neighborhood crack gang  known as the Wild Cowboys or the Red Top Gang  who were associated with Yayo  The Wild Cowboys were responsible for the higher number of crimes  especially murders  during the late 80s and early 90s  Robert Jackall wrote a book  Wild Cowboys  Urban Marauders and the Forces of Order  30  describing the events that took place during that period of lawlessness  Homelessness was rampant  Washington Heights had become the largest drug distribution center in the Northeastern United States during that time  31  A housing project which   in the neighborhood was nicknamed  Crack City   32  an epithet commonly bestowed upon rough areas at the time  Former 32nd Precinct House on 152nd Street  a NYC Landmark On October 18  1988  24 year old Police Officer Michael Buczek was murdered by Dominican drug dealers in Washington Heights  The killers fled to the Dominican Republic where one later died in police custody and a second was apprehended by U S  Marshals in 2000  The third suspect was apprehended in the Dominican Republic in May 2002  Fifteen years after the shooting  Pablo Almonte  51  and Jose Fernandez  52  received the maximum sentence  25 years to life  for their roles in the murder of Officer Buczek  Daniel Mirambeaux  the alleged shooter  died in June 1989  plunging to his death under mysterious circumstances after he was ordered turned over to the United States  In the ensuing years  the Buczek family founded the Michael John Buczek Foundation  There is a street  an elementary school  and a little league baseball field named in honor of Michael John Buczek  The Michael Buczek Little League hosts 30 teams with over 350 boys and girls  and is coached by officers from the 34th precinct  Crime fell in the subsequent years  Police presence increased  building landlords allowed police to patrol in apartment buildings  which led to the arrests of thousands of drug dealers a year in Washington Heights  The arrest of police officers involved in drug dealing changed the neighborhood dramatically  The long term effects of Roe vs  Wade also played an important role in the sharp decline of criminal activity   33  People were also being stopped for quality of life crimes  A new police precinct was also added in the area  31  Today  its crime rate  along with that of neighboring Harlem  is much lower 34  Even though crime complaints were down 5 88  in 2007 over 2001  and down 65 47  from 1993   there were five murders in lower Washington Heights  that is  below W  178th St   in 2007  34  By comparison  in the upper portion of Washington Heights  where the 34th Precinct includes Fort George  Hudson Heights and Sherman Creek  as well as Inwood   there was only one murder in 2007  likewise  above W  179th Street  crime complaints were down 21 05  in 2007 over 2001  and down 83 15  from 1993   35  That puts lower Washington Heights on par with Harlem  where the 30th Precinct also recorded five murders in 2007  36  By comparison  the 13th Precinct  Flatiron District  Stuyvesant Town and Union Square  recorded three murders in 2007 37  and the 20th Precinct  the Upper West Side  recorded none  38  In 2011  Washington Heights was the fourth safest neighborhood in Manhattan  according to an analysis of police records by dnainfo com  Its  Crime and Safety Report   39  which ranks every neighborhood in the five boroughs  found that the drop in crime in Upper Manhattan led the neighborhood nearly to the top  Inwood ranked third  By comparison  Greenwich Village ranked 68th   edit  Sports  edit  Historic Five clubs in American professional sports played in the Washington Heights area  the New York Giants

reduced to 10 days and  50  One of the most amazing pitching performances of all time took place at Hilltop Park  on September 4  1908  20 year old Walter Johnson shut out New York 3 0 with a five hitter  The park is now the Columbia University Medical Center  a major hospital complex  which opened on that location in 1928  Washington Heights was the birth place of Yankee star Alex Rodriguez
