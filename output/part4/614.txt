players had come from Canada  with a small handful of Americans  only one European trained player made his NHL debut during the 1942 67 Original Six era  After the NHL doubled in size in 1967  this began to change  During the 1970s and 1980s  the number of American trained players dramatically increased  and the first wave of European players entered the league  mostly from Sweden and Finland

forms of rugby  then all covered by the name  football   were being played in the USA as far back as the 1840s  at Harvard  Yale and Princeton  stemming partly from Americans who had been educated in English schools  6  However  in 1862  Yale dealt it a major blow by banning it for being too violent and dangerous  about seven years later  in 1869  the first game of American football was played

of migrants from cricketing countries who make up almost 16 million of the American population  Cricket used to be the most popular sport in America during the 18th century  19th century and early 20th century  when it suffered a rapid decline  In fact the first intercollegiate tournament in America was a cricket tournament  The first annual Canada vs  USA cricket match  played since the 1840s

the team that scores the most goals by getting the ball past the opposing team s goalkeeper into the net  Gameplay involves swimming  players passing the ball while being defended by opponents  and scoring by throwing into a net defended by a goalie  Water polo  therefore  has strong similarities to the land based game of team handball  The frequency of  man up   or  power play   situations also

premier racing facilities  Motor sports are also widely popular in the United States  but Americans generally ignore major international series  such as Formula One and MotoGP  in favor of home grown racing series  Americans  like the rest of the world  initially began using public streets as a host of automobile races  As time progressed it was soon discovered that these venues were often unsafe to the public as they offered relatively little crowd control  Promoters and drivers in the United States discovered that horse racing tracks could provide better conditions for drivers and spectators than public streets  The result has been long standing popularity for oval track racing while road racing has waned  however  an extensive illegal street racing culture persists  16  Historically  open wheel racing was the most popular nationwide  with the Indianapolis 500 being the most widely followed race  However  an acrimonious split in 1994 between the primary series  CART  later known as Champ Car   and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway  the site of the Indy 500  led to the formation of the Indy Racing League  which launched the rival IndyCar Series in 1996  From that point  the popularity of open wheel racing in the U S  declined dramatically  17  The feud was settled in 2008 with an agreement to merge the two series under the IndyCar banner  but enormous damage had already been done to the sport  18  The CART IRL feud coincided with an enormous expansion of stock car racing  governed by NASCAR  from its past as a mostly regional circuit mainly followed in the Southern U S  to a truly national sport  NASCAR s Sprint Cup Series generally harnesses an 8 million person audience on television  as well as sold out crowds at many tracks  Another one of the most popular forms of motorsports in the United States is the indigenous sport of drag racing  The largest drag racing organization  the National Hot Rod Association  boasts 80 000 members  more than 35 000 licensed competitors and nationwide television coverage  19  And still another one of the most popular forms of motorsports in the United States is the indigenous sport of monster truck racing  Although international street motorcycle racing does not enjoy the mainstream popularity of its all terrain cousin  motocross in the USA  American riders have been very successful  Currently  Ben Spies  Colin Edwards  and Nicky Hayden represent the United States in MotoGp  John Hopkins participates in the Superbike World Championship  Seven different Americans have won a combined fifteen championships in MotoGp  Eddie Lawson has won four championships  more than any other American   Five American riders have won eight Superbike World Championships  more than any other nationality   There are two MotoGP events held in the U S  These include the United States motorcycle Grand Prix at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca and the Red Bull Indianapolis Grand Prix at Indianapolis Motor Speedway  World Superbike holds one race in the U S  at Miller Motorsports Park  Although the world s most popular form of motorsport  Formula One  is not as popular in the U S   a F1 race will be hosted in Austin  Texas in November of 2012  It is to be held at a new venue  which will later host MotoGP  named Circuit of the Americas  It will be the first United States Grand Prix held since 2007  A second race  called Grand Prix of America  will be held in New Jersey starting in 2013  The New York City skyline will be offered as panoramic backdrop for the race  The United States also has two former Driver s World Champions  Phil Hill  1961   amp  Mario Andretti  1978   The last American to compete in F1 is Scott Speed in 2007  Another form of auto racing in the United States is sports car racing  While not as popular as other forms of racing in the country  both the American Le Mans Series and the Rolex Sports Car Series operate as the premier series of sports car endurance racing in the U S  The former  known informally as the ALMS and sanctioned by IMSA  is based on the rules that govern the world famous 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race in France  As such  there is a typical European flair in the races and the cars that participate  The Rolex series  sanctioned by Grand Am  has rules similar to the ALMS  but the cars themselves are ultimately different and are made with a more cost efficient formula in mind  Among the more well known sports car races in America are the 12 Hours of Sebring  24 Hours of Daytona  and Petit Le Mans  All three races have been featured as rounds in world championships in previous years with Sebring slated to open the 2012 season of the FIA World Endurance Championship  The Australia based V8 Supercars series  which uses cars roughly similar in appearance to NASCAR stock cars but runs exclusively on road courses and street circuits  will expand to the U S  in 2013 with a race at the Circuit of the Americas   edit  Outdoor sports Hunting and fishing are very popular in the U S   especially in rural areas  Other popular outdoors activities in the country include hiking  mountain climbing  paintball and kayaking  In winter  many Americans head to mountainous areas for skiing and snowboarding  Cycling and road bicycle racing have increased in popularity  fueled by the success of cyclists Greg LeMond and Lance Armstrong   edit

edit  Organization of American sports  edit  Amateur sports Pre game activities at University of Tennessee football game The extent in the United States to which sports are associated with secondary and tertiary education is rare among nations  Millions of students participate in athletics programs operated by high schools and colleges  Student athletes often receive scholarships to colleges in recognition of their athletic potential  Currently  the largest governing body of collegiate sports is the National Collegiate Athletic Association  NCAA   High school and college sports fill the developmental role that in many other countries would be the place of youth teams associated with clubs  The major professional sports leagues operate drafts once a year  in which each league s teams selected eligible prospects  Eligibility differs from league to league  Baseball and ice hockey operate minor league systems for players who have finished education but are not ready or good enough for the major leagues  The NBA also has a development league for players who are not ready to play at the top level  Especially in basketball and football  high school and particularly college sports

revenue   edit  Professional sports See also  Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada For the most part  there is no system of promotion and relegation in American professional sports  Major sports leagues operate as associations of franchises  The same 30 32 teams play in the league each year unless they move to another city or the league chooses to expand with new franchises  All American sports leagues use the same type of schedule  After the regular season  the 8 16 teams with the best records enter a playoff tournament leading to a championship series or game  American sports  except for soccer  have no equivalent to the cup competitions that run concurrently with leagues in European sports  Even in the case of soccer  the cup competition  the Lamar Hunt U S  Open Cup  draws considerably less attention than the regular season  Also  the only top level U S  professional teams that play teams from other organizations in meaningful games are those in MLS  As of the upcoming 2012 season  all U S  based MLS teams qualify for the U S  Open Cup  in which they compete against teams from lower level U S  leagues  In addition  four of these teams

American broadcasting since the early days of radio  Today  television networks pay millions of dollars for the rights to broadcast sporting events  Contracts between leagues and broadcasters stipulate how often games must be interrupted for commercials  Because of all of the advertisements  broadcasting contracts are very lucrative and account for the biggest chunk of pro teams  revenues

especially young and middle aged adult males  The advent of cable and satellite television has greatly expanded sports offerings on American TV  ESPN  the first all sports cable network in the U S

NFL football games  due to baseball s longer schedule and football s  generally  higher ticket prices  Advocates of football  in turn  point to football s large television audience  including the Super Bowl  typically the most watched television event of the year  Football also enjoys more organized youth participation  though the sport has recently when   endured negative publicity in the world of youth sports due to media coverage of documented health and injury risks posed to players 22  23  Certain teams of both sports  such as the Boston Red Sox  24  New York Yankees  Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers  25  have cultivated famously loyal fan bases across the country  In many cases  identification with a certain football or baseball team is a matter of family inheritance and local identity  In truth  the popularity of each  as well as of hockey  soccer and basketball  vary depending on region  ethnicity and age  It could be claimed that baseball is more popular in the northeast  26  where it developed over 150 years ago  than in other regions  It could be said that college football  i e  NCAA  enjoys unparalleled popularity in the southeastern states
