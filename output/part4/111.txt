country located in the southern portion of the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia  With a total landmass of 181 035 square kilometres  69 898 sq mi   it is bordered by Thailand to the northwest  Laos to the northeast  Vietnam to the east  and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest  With a population of over 14 8 million  Cambodia is the 69th most populous country in the world  The official religion is Theravada Buddhism which is practiced by around 95  of the Cambodian population  The country minority groups include Vietnamese  Chinese  Chams and 30 various hill tribes  6  The capital and largest city is Phnom Penh  the political  economic  and cultural center of Cambodia  The kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with Norodom Sihamoni  a monarch chosen by the Royal Throne Council  as head of state  The head of government is Hun Sen  who is currently the longest serving leader in South East Asia and has ruled Cambodia for over 25 years  In 802 AD Jayavarman II declared himself king which marked the beginning of the Khmer Empire  Successive kings flourished which marked the Khmer empire s immense power and wealth who dominate much of South East Asia for over 600 years  Cambodia was ruled as a vassal between its neighbors  until it was colonized by the French in mid 19th century  Cambodia gained independence in 1953  The Vietnam War extended into Cambodia  giving rise to the Khmer Rouge  which took Phnom Penh in 1975  Cambodia reemerged several years later within a socialistic sphere of influence as the People s Republic of Kampuchea until 1993  After years of isolation  the war ravaged nation was reunited under the monarchy in 1993  Rebuilding from decades of civil war  Cambodia has seen rapid progress in the economic and human resource areas  The country has had one of the best economic records in Asia  with economic growth growing an average 6 0  for the last 10 years  Strong textiles  agriculture  construction  garments  and tourism sectors led to foreign investments and international trade  7  In 2005  oil and natural gas deposits were found beneath Cambodia s territorial waters  and once commercial extraction begins in 2013  the oil revenues could profoundly affect Cambodia s economy  8  However the majority of Cambodians are not beneficiaries of economic growth because wealth is spread very unevenly  as a result of the prevalence of massive government corruption  According to Transparency International Cambodia is the third most corrupt nation in Asia  ahead of only North Korea and Myanmar  and ranked 164 out of 182 in the world

article  Name of Cambodia The official name of the country is the Kingdom of Cambodia  which is pronounced in Khmer as Pre h R ach anach k K mp ch a  Etymologically  its components are   Preah    sacred      Reachea   from Sanskrit raja  meaning  king  royal  realm      ana   from P li       authority  command  power   itself from Sanskrit  j    same meaning   chak  from Sanskrit chakra meaning  wheel   a symbol of power and rule   In the Khmer language  the country is named Kampuchea  Khmer            Kampuchea is a derivation of the Sanskrit term Kambojade a  Sanskrit              The Khmer people will often refer to their country using the polite form Pr teh Kampuchea  Khmer                 which literally means  the Country of Cambodia   Cambodians also most commonly use the more colloquial word  Srok Khmer   Khmer              which translates to  the Land of Khmers   The English name   Cambodia  is derived from the French  Cambodge   a contraction of the Sanskrit name   edit  History Main article  History of Cambodia  edit  Pre history Main article  Early history of Cambodia A gold lotus bowl dating back to 1200AD  Khmer army going to war against the Cham  from a relief on the Bayon There is some sparse evidence for a Pleistocene human occupation of present day Cambodia  which includes quartz and quartzite pebble tools found in terraces along the Mekong River  in Stung Treng and Krati  provinces  and in Kampot Province  although their dating is unreliable  10  Some slight archaeological evidence shows communities of hunter gatherers inhabited Cambodia during Holocene  the most ancient Cambodian archeological site is considered to be the cave of L aang Spean  in Battambang Province  which belongs to the so called Hoabinhian period  Excavations in its lower layers produced a series of radiocarbon dates as of 6000 BC  10  11  Upper layers in the same site gave evidence of transition to Neolithic  containing the earliest dated earthenware ceramics in Cambodia 12  Archeological records for the period between Holocene and Iron Age remain equally limited  Other prehistoric sites of somewhat uncertain date are Samrong Sen  not far from the ancient capital of Udong   where the first investigations began in 1877  13  and Phum Snay  in the northern province of Banteay Meanchey  14  Prehistoric artifacts are often found during mining activities in Ratanakiri  10  The most outstanding prehistoric evidence in Cambodia however are probably various  circular earthworks   discovered in the red soils near Memot and in the adjacent region of Vietnam as of the end of the 1950s  Their function and age are still debated  but some of them possibly date from 2nd millennium BC at least  15  16  A pivotal event in Cambodian prehistory was the slow penetration of the first rice farmers from the north  which began in the late 3rd millennium BC  17  Iron was worked by about 500 BC  with supporting evidence coming from the Khorat Plateau  in modern day Thailand  In Cambodia  some Iron Age settlements were found beneath Angkorian temples  like Baksei Chamkrong  Others were circular earthworks  like Lovea  a few kilometers north west of Angkor  Burials  much richer  testify to improvement of food availability and trade  even on long distances  in the 4th century BC trade relations with India were already opened  and the existence of a social structure and labor organization  17   edit  Pre Angkorian era and Angkorian era Main article  Khmer Empire Angkor Wat Prasat Bayon During the 3rd  4th  and 5th centuries  the Indianised states of Funan and Chenla coalesced in present day Cambodia and southwestern Vietnam  For more than 2 000 years  Cambodia absorbed influences from India  passing them on to other Southeast Asian civilizations that are now Thailand and Laos  18  The Khmer Empire flourished in the area from the 9th to the 13th centuries  19  Around the 13th century  Theravada Buddhism was introduced to the area through monks from Sri Lanka  20  From then on  Theravada Buddhism grew and eventually became the popular religion  The Khmer Empire was Southeast Asia s largest empire during the 12th century and it remained very powerful  The empire declined yet remained powerful in the region until the 15th century  The empire s centre of power was Angkor  where a series of capitals was constructed during the empire s zenith  In 2007 an international team of researchers using satellite photographs and other modern techniques concluded that Angkor had been the largest pre industrial city in the world with an urban sprawl of 1 150 square miles  21  The city could have supported a population of up to one million people 22  and Angkor Wat  the most famous and best preserved religious temple at the site  are reminders of Cambodia s past as a major regional power  The design of the Angkor Wat was inspired by the beauty of the ancient princess of Cambodia  Mo Hy  Her visage is still engrained on the interior of the building next to her brother Mony  23   edit  Dark ages of Cambodia Main article  Dark ages of Cambodia The ancient city of Longvek After a long series of wars with neighboring kingdoms  Angkor was sacked by the Ayutthaya Kingdom and abandoned in 1432 because of ecological failure and infrastructure breakdown  24  25  This led to a period of economic  social  and cultural stagnation when the kingdom s internal affairs came increasingly under the control of its neighbors  By this time  the Khmer penchant for monument building had ceased  Older faiths such as Mahayana Buddhism and the Hindu cult of the god king had been supplanted by Theravada Buddhism for good  The court moved the capital to Longvek where the kingdom sought to regain its glory through maritime trade  Portuguese and Spanish travelers described the city as a place of flourishing wealth and foreign trade  The attempt was short lived however  as continued wars with the Ayutthaya and the Vietnamese resulted in the loss of more territory and Longvek being conquered in 1594  Not long after the conquer of Siamese  the wall of Longvek broke within three days after the order of King Naresuan the Great of Ayutthaya Kingdom  Shortly after  with the capturing of Longvek by the Siamese  the nation never fully recovered and was under colonization of Siam for long periods of time  During the next three centuries  the Khmer kingdom alternated as a vassal state of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and Vietnamese kings  as well as short lived periods of relative independence  A new Khmer capital was established at Udong south of Longvek  but its monarchs could survive only by entering into what amounted to vassal relationships with the Siamese and Vietnamese  A renewed struggle between Siam and Vietnam for control of Cambodia in the nineteenth century resulted in a period when Vietnamese officials attempted to force the Khmers to adopt Vietnamese customs  This led to several rebellions against the Vietnamese  The Siamese Vietnamese War  1841 1845  ended with an agreement to place the country under joint suzerainty  This later led to the signing of a treaty for French Protection of Cambodia by King Norodom I   edit  French colonization King Norodom is credited for saving Cambodia from disappearing altogether Map of French Indochina In 1863 King Norodom  who had been installed by Thailand  26  sought the protection of France from the Thai and Vietnamese after tensions grew between them  In 1867 the Thai king signed a treaty with France  renouncing suzerainty over Cambodia in exchange for the control of Battambang and Siem Reap provinces which officially became part of Thailand  The provinces were ceded back to Cambodia by a border treaty between France and Thailand in 1906  Cambodia continued as a protectorate of France from 1863 to 1953  administered as part of the colony of French Indochina  though occupied by the Japanese empire from 1941 to 1945  27  Between 1874 and 1962  the total population increased from about 946 000 to 5 7 million  28  After King Norodom s death in 1904  France manipulated the choice of king  and Sisowath  Norodom s brother  was placed on the throne  The throne became vacant in 1941 with the death of Monivong  Sisowath s son  and France passed over Monivong s son  Monireth  feeling he was too independently minded  Instead  Norodom Sihanouk  a maternal grand son of king Sisowath was enthroned  The French thought young Sihanouk would be easy to control  27  They were wrong  however  and under the reign of King Norodom Sihanouk  Cambodia gained independence from France on November 9  1953  27   edit  Independence and Vietnam War Cambodia became a constitutional monarchy under King Norodom Sihanouk  When French Indochina was given independence  Cambodia lost official control over the Mekong Delta as it was awarded to Vietnam  citation needed  The area had been controlled by the Vietnamese since 1698 with King Chey Chettha II granting Vietnamese permission to settle in the area decades before  29  In 1955  Sihanouk abdicated in favour of his father in order to participate in politics and was elected prime minister  Upon his father s death in 1960  Sihanouk again became head of state  taking the title of prince  As the Vietnam War progressed  Sihanouk adopted an official policy of neutrality in the Cold War  although he was widely considered to be sympathetic to the communist cause  Sihanouk allowed the Vietnamese communists to use Cambodia as a sanctuary and a supply route for their arms and other aid to their armed forces fighting in South Vietnam  This policy was perceived as humiliating by many Cambodians  In December 1967 Washington Post journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the US wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries  he would not object  unless Cambodians were killed  30  The same message was conveyed to US President Johnson s emissary Chester Bowles in January 1968  31  So the US had no real motivation to overthrow Sihanouk  However members of the government and army  who resented Sihanouk s ruling style as well as his tilt away from the United States  did have such a motivation  While visiting Beijing in 1970 Sihanouk was ousted by a military coup led by Prime Minister General Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak  There is no evidence of any US role in the coup  However once the coup was completed the new regime  which immediately demanded that the Vietnamese communists leave Cambodia  gained the political support of the United States  The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces  desperate to retain their sanctuaries and supply lines from North Vietnam  immediately launched armed attacks on the new government  The king urged his followers to help in overthrowing this government  hastening the onset of civil war  32  Soon the Khmer Rouge rebels began using him to gain support  However from 1970 until early 1972 the Cambodian conflict was largely one between the government and army of Cambodia  and the armed forces of North Vietnam  As they gained control of Cambodian territory the Vietnamese communists imposed a new political infrastructure  which was eventually dominated by the Cambodian communists we now refer to as the Khmer Rouge  33  So the Vietnamese communists played a vital role in the rise of the Khmer Rouge  Norodom Sihanouk and Mao Tse Tung in 1956 Between 1969 and 1973  Republic of Vietnam forces and U S  forces bombed and briefly invaded Cambodia in an effort to disrupt the Viet Cong and Khmer Rouge  34  Some two million Cambodians were made refugees by the war and by the terrorist policies of the Khmer Rouge  and fled to Phnom Penh  Estimates of the number of Cambodians killed during the bombing campaigns vary widely  as do views of the effects of the bombing  The U S  Seventh Air Force argued that the bombing prevented the fall of Phnom Penh in 1973 by killing 16 000 of 25 500 Khmer Rouge fighters besieging the city  35  However  journalist William Shawcross and Cambodia specialists Milton Osborne  David P  Chandler and Ben Kiernan argued that the bombing drove peasants to join the Khmer Rouge  36  Cambodia specialist Craig Etcheson argued that the Khmer Rouge  would have won anyway   even without U S  intervention driving recruitment  37  While president  Bill Clinton released extensive Air Force data on all American bombings of Indochina between 1964 and 1975  Regarding Cambodia in particular  it emerged that  F rom October 4  1965  to August 15  1973  the United States dropped far more ordnance on Cambodia than was previously believed  2 756 941 tons  worth  dropped in 230 516 sorties on 113 716 sites  Just over 10 percent of this bombing was indiscriminate  with 3 580 of the sites listed as having  unknown  targets and another 8 238 sites having no target listed at all         T he total payload dropped during these years to be nearly five times greater than the generally accepted figure  To put the revised total of 2 756 941 tons into perspective  the Allies dropped just over 2 million tons of bombs during all of World War II  including the bombs that struck Hiroshima and Nagasaki  15 000 and 20 000 tons  respectively  Cambodia may well be the most heavily bombed country in history         T he bombing forced the Vietnamese Communists deeper and deeper into Cambodia  bringing them into greater contact with Khmer Rouge insurgents        and  drove ordinary Cambodians into the arms of the Khmer Rouge  a group that seemed initially to have slim prospects of revolutionary success  38  Nixon had commanded that   They  the USAF  have got to go in there and I mean really go in       I want everything that can fly to go in there and crack the hell out of them  There is no limitation on mileage and there is no limitation on budget  Is that clear   38 Taylor Owen and Yale s Ben Kiernan claim that   Previously  it was estimated that between 50 000 and 150 000 Cambodian civilians were killed by the bombing  Given the fivefold increase in tonnage revealed by the database  the number of casualties is surely higher   38   edit  Khmer Rouge regime Main articles  Democratic Kampuchea and Khmer Rouge As the Vietnam War ended  a draft USAID report observed that the country faced famine in 1975  with 75  of its draft animals destroyed  and that rice planting for the next harvest would have to be done  by the hard labour of seriously malnourished people   The report predicted that  Without large scale external food and equipment assistance there will be widespread starvation between now and next February     Slave labour and starvation rations for half the nation s people  probably heaviest among those who supported the republic  will be a cruel necessity for this year  and general deprivation and suffering will stretch over the next two or three years before Cambodia can get back to rice self sufficiency   39  Flag of the Khmer Rouge and Democratic Kampuchea The Khmer Rouge reached Phnom Penh and took power in 1975  The regime  led by Pol Pot  changed the official name of the country to Democratic Kampuchea  The regime modelled itself on Maoist China during the Great Leap Forward  The regime immediately evacuated the cities and sent the entire population on forced marches to rural work projects  They attempted to rebuild the country s agriculture on the model of the 11th century  discarded Western medicine  and destroyed temples  libraries  and anything considered Western  At least a million Cambodians  out of a total population of 8 million  died from executions  overwork  starvation and disease  40  Estimates as to how many people were killed by the Khmer Rouge regime range from approximately one to three million  the most commonly cited figure is two million  about one third of the population   41  42  This era gave rise to the term Killing Fields  and the prison Tuol Sleng became notorious for its history of mass killing  Hundreds of thousands fled across the border into neighbouring Thailand  The regime disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups  The Cham Muslims suffered serious purges with as much as half of their population exterminated  43  In the late 1960s  an estimated 425 000 ethnic Chinese lived in Cambodia  but by 1984  due to Khmer Rouge killings and to emigration  only about 61 400 Chinese remained in the country  44  Forced repatriation in 1970 and deaths during the Khmer Rouge era reduced the Vietnamese population in Cambodia from between 250 000 and 300 000 in 1969 to a reported 56 000 in 1984  28  However most of the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime were not ethnic minorities but ethnic Khmer  Professionals  such as doctors  lawyers and teachers  were also targeted  According to Robert D  Kaplan   eyeglasses were as deadly as the yellow star  as they were seen as a sign of intellectualism

Cambodia in response to border raids by the Khmer Rouge  45  The People s Republic of Kampuchea  PRK   a Pro Soviet state led by the Kampuchean People s Revolutionary Party  a party created by the Vietnamese in 1951  and led by a group of Khmer Rouge who had fled Cambodia to avoid being purged by Pol Pot and Ta Mok  was established  46  It was fully beholden to the occupying Vietnamese army and under direction of the Vietnamese ambassador to Phnom Penh  Its arms came from Vietnam and the Soviet Union  In opposition to the newly created state  a government in exile referred to as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  CGDK  was formed in 1981 from three factions  This consisted of the Khmer Rouge  a royalist faction led by Sihanouk  and the Khmer People s National Liberation Front  Its credentials were recognized by the United Nations  The Khmer Rouge representative to the UN  Thiounn Prasith  was retained  but he had to work in consultation with representatives of the noncommunist Cambodian parties  47  48  Throughout the 1980s the CGDK  supplied by China  Thailand  the United States 49  and the United Kingdom 50  51  controlled parts of the country and attacked some of the territory not under their dominance  The refusal of Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia led to economic sanctions 52  by the U S  and its allies  made reconstruction virtually impossible and left the country deeply impoverished  Peace efforts began in Paris in 1989 under the State of Cambodia  culminating two years later in October 1991 in a comprehensive peace settlement  The UN was given a mandate to enforce a ceasefire and deal with refugees and disarmament known as the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia  UNTAC   53  In 1993  Norodom Sihanouk was restored as King of Cambodia  but all power was in the hands of the government established after the UNTAC sponsored elections  The stability established following the conflict was shaken in 1997 by a coup d  tat led by the co Prime Minister Hun Sen against the noncommunist parties in the government  54   Many of the noncommunist politicians were murdered by Hun Sen s forces  In recent years  reconstruction efforts have progressed and led to some political stability through political repression of a multiparty democracy under a constitutional monarchy  55  In July 2010 Kang Kek Iew was the first Khmer Rouge member found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in his role as the former commandant of the S21 extermination camp  He was sentenced to life in prison  56  57   However Hun Sen has opposed any extensive trials of former Khmer Rouge mass murderers  58  He says that this is because he wishes to avoid political instability  However it is more likely because of

abruptly above the plain to heights of 600 to 1 800 feet  180 to 550 metres   This escarpment marks the southern limit of the D ngr k Mountains  Flowing south through the country s eastern regions is the Mekong River  East of the Mekong the transitional plains gradually merge with the eastern highlands  a region of forested mountains and high plateaus that extend into Laos and Vietnam  In southwestern Cambodia two distinct upland blocks  the Kr vanh Mountains and the D mrei Mountains  form another highland region that covers much of the land area between the Tonle Sap and the Gulf of Thailand  In this remote and largely uninhabited area  Phnom Aural  Cambodia s highest peak  rises to an elevation of 5 949 feet  1 813 metres   The southern coastal region adjoining the Gulf of Thailand is a narrow lowland strip  heavily wooded and sparsely populated  which is isolated from the central plain by the southwestern highlands  The most distinctive geographical feature is the inundations of the Tonle Sap  Great Lake   measuring about 2 590 square kilometers  1 000 sq mi  during the dry season and expanding to about 24 605 square kilometers  9 500 sq mi  during the rainy season  This densely populated plain  which is devoted to wet rice cultivation  is the heartland of Cambodia  Much of this area has been designated as a biosphere reserve   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Cambodia Sun Bear Cambodia s climate  like that of the rest of Southeast Asia  is dominated by monsoons  which are known as tropical wet and dry because of the distinctly marked seasonal differences  Cambodia has a temperature range from 21 to 35  C  69 8 to 95  F  and experiences tropical monsoons  Southwest monsoons blow inland bringing moisture laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from May to October  The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season  which lasts from November to March  The country experiences the heaviest precipitation from September to October with the driest period occurring from January to February  Cambodia has two distinct seasons  The rainy season  which runs from May to October  can see temperatures drop to 22  C  71 6  F  and is generally accompanied with high humidity  The dry season lasts from November to April when temperatures can rise up to 40  C  104  F  around April  Disastrous flooding occurred in 2001 and again in 2002  with some degree of flooding almost every year   edit  Wildlife Main article  Wildlife of Cambodia Sarus Crane Cambodia has a wide variety of plants and animals  There are 212 mammal species  536 bird species  240 reptile species  850 freshwater fish species  Tonle Sap Lake area   and 435 marine fish species  Much of this biodiversity is contained around the Tonle Sap Lake and the surrounding biosphere  62  The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve is a unique ecological phenomenon surrounding the Tonle Sap  It encompasses the lake and nine provinces  Kampong Thom  Siem Reap  Battambang  Pursat  Kampong Chhnang  Banteay Meanchey  Pailin  Oddar Meanchey and Preah Vihear  In 1997  it was successfully nominated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve  63  Other key habitats include the dry forest of Mondolkiri and Ratanakiri provinces and the Cardamom Mountains ecosystem  including Bokor National Park  Botum Sakor National Park  and the Phnom Aural and Phnom Samkos wildlife sanctuaries  The rate of deforestation in Cambodia is one of the highest in the world  Cambodia s primary rainforest cover fell from over 70  in 1969 to just 3 1  in 2007  In total  Cambodia lost 25 000 square kilometres  9 700 sq mi  of forest between 1990 and 2005 3 340 km2  1 290 sq mi  of which was primary forest  Since 2007  less than 3 220 km2  1 243 sq mi  of primary forest remain with the result that the future sustainability of the forest reserves of Cambodia is under severe threat  with illegal loggers looking to generate revenue  64   edit  Administrative divisions Main article
