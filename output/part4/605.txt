Demographics of the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search As of 2012 update   the United States has a total resident population of 313 229 000  making it the third most populous country in the world  1  It is a very urbanized population  with 82  residing in cities and suburbs as of 2008  the worldwide urban rate is 50 5  2    This leaves vast expanses of the country nearly uninhabited  3 California and Texas are the most populous states  4  as the mean center of United States population has consistently shifted westward and southward  5 New York City is the most populous city in the United States  6  The total fertility rate in the United States estimated for 2009 is 2 01 children per woman  which is below the replacement fertility rate of approximately 2 1  9  However  U S  population growth is among the highest in industrialized countries  10  since the vast majority of these have below replacement fertility rates and the U S  has higher levels of immigration  11  12  The United States Census Bureau shows population increase of 0 91  for the twelve month periods ending in July 2011  13  Nonetheless  though high by industrialized country standards  this is below the world average annual rate of 1 092   10  There were 155 6 million females in the United States in 2009  The number of males was 151 4 million  At age 85 and older  there were more than twice as many women as men  People under 20 years of age made up over a quarter of the U S  population  27 3    and people age 65 and over made up one eighth  12 8   in 2009  14  The national median age was 36 8 years  14 Racially  the U S  has a White American majority  The American population more than tripled during the 20th century at a growth rate of about 1 3  a year from about 76 million in 1900 to 281 million in 2000  It reached the 200 million mark in 1967  and the 300 million mark on October 17  2006  15  16  Currently  population growth is fastest among minorities as a whole  and according to the Census Bureau s estimation for 2005  45  of American children under the age of 5 belonged to minority groups  17  Hispanic and Latino Americans accounted for almost half  1 4 million  of the national population growth of 2 9 million between July 1  2005  and July 1  2006  18  Immigrants and their U S  born descendants are expected to provide most of the U S  population gains in the decades ahead  19  The Census Bureau projects a U S  population of 439 million in 2050  which is a 46  increase from 2007  301 3 million   20  However  the United Nations projects a U S  population of 402 million in 2050  an increase of 32  from 2007  the UN projects a gain of 38  for the world at large   21  In either case  such growth is unlike most European countries  especially Germany  Russia  and Greece  or Asian countries such as Japan or South Korea  whose populations are slowly declining  and whose fertility rates are below replacement  Historical populations Census Pop     1790 3 929 214   1800 5 236 631 33 3  1810 7 239 881 38 3  1820 9 638 453 33 1  1830 12 866 020 33 5  1840 17 069 453 32 7  1850 23 191 876 35 9

United States  representing 88  of the total population  22  8 8 million Blacks  with about 90  of them still living in Southern states  23  and slightly more than 500 000 Hispanics  24  Under the current law  the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965  25  the number of first generation immigrants living in the United States has quadrupled  26  from 9 6 million in 1970 to about 38 million in 2007  27  During the 1950s  250 000 legal immigrants entered the country annually  by the 1990s  the number was almost one million  and the vast majority of new immigrants have come from Latin America and Asia  In 2009  37  of immigrants originated in Asia  42  in the Americas  and 11  in Africa  28  Almost 97  of residents of the 10 largest American cities in 1900 were non Hispanic whites  29  In 2006  non Hispanic whites were the minority in thirty five of the fifty largest cities  30  The Census Bureau reported that minorities accounted for 48 6  of the children born in the U S  between July 2008 and July 2009  31   edit  Vital Statistics Source  National Center for Health Statistics  32   U S  Census Bureau  intercensal population estimates   33  Average population  x 1 000  Live births

to the 15th century and concluded that over 80 year spans  generations proceed through 4 stages of about 20 years each  The first phase consists of times of relative crisis and the people born during this period were called  artists   The next phase was a  high  period and those born in this period were called  prophets   The next phase was an  awakening period  and people born in this period were called  nomads   The final stage was the  unraveling period  and people born in this period were called  heroes   The most recent  high period  occurred in the 50s and 60s  hence baby boomers are the most recent crop of  prophets    citation needed  The most definitive recent study of the US generational cohorts was done by Schuman and Scott  1989  in 1985 in which a broad sample of adults of all

1957 Subdivided groups are present when peak boom years or inverted peak bust years are present  and may be represented by a normal or inverted bell shaped curve  rather than a straight curve   The boom subdivided cohorts may be considered as  pre peak   including peak year  and  post peak   The year 1957 was the baby boom peak with 4 3 million births and 122 7 fertility rate  Although post peak births  such as trailing edge boomers  are in decline  and sometimes referred to as a  bust   there are still a relative large number of births  The dearth in birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year  and those including and beyond  leading up to the subsequent normal birth rate  The Baby boom began around 1943 to 1946  citation needed  From the decline in U S  birth rates starting in 1958 and the introduction of the birth control pill in 1960  the Baby Boomer normal distribution curve is negatively skewed  The trend in birth rates from 1958 to 1961 show a tendency to end late in the decade at approximately 1969  thus returning to pre WWII levels  with 12 years of rising and 12 years of declining birth rates  Pre war birth rates were defined as anywhere between 1939 and 1941 by demographers such as the Taeuber s  Philip M  Hauser and William Fielding Ogburn  74  From 1962 to 1964  trend analysis points to 1965 as being the first year to return to baseline birth rates  possibly referring to this cohort as  Generation X   Then came  Generation Y  sometimes a second cohort of the Baby Bust era  and finally  Generation Z  are children of Generation X
