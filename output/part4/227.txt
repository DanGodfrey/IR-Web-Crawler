populous of the 50 United States  It is the only New England state not bordering the Atlantic Ocean  Lake Champlain forms half of Vermont s western border  which it shares with the state of New York  The Green Mountains are within the state  Vermont is bordered by Massachusetts to the south  New Hampshire to the east  New York to the west  and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north  Originally inhabited by two major Native American tribes  the Algonquian speaking Abenaki and the Iroquois   much of the territory that is now Vermont was claimed by France during its early colonial period  France ceded the territory to the Kingdom of Great Britain after being defeated in 1763 in the Seven Years  War  also called the French and Indian War   For many years  the nearby colonies  especially New Hampshire and New York  disputed control of the area  then called the New Hampshire Grants   Settlers who held land titles granted by these colonies were opposed by the Green Mountain Boys militia  which eventually prevailed in creating an independent state  the Vermont Republic  Founded in 1777 during the Revolutionary War  the republic lasted for fourteen years  Vermont is one of seventeen U S  states  along with Texas  Hawaii  the brief California Republic  and each of the original Thirteen Colonies  to have had a sovereign government in the past  In 1791  Vermont joined the United States as the 14th state  the first outside the original 13 Colonies  It abolished slavery while still independent  and upon joining the Union became the first state to have done so  Vermont is the leading producer of maple syrup in the United States  6  The state capital is Montpelier  which has a population of 7 855 and is the least populated state capital in the country  7  Vermont s most

Hampshire   10 Lake Champlain  the major lake in Vermont  is the sixth largest body of fresh water in the United States and separates Vermont from New York in the northwest portion of the state  From north to south  Vermont is 159 miles  256 km  long  Its greatest width  from east to west  is 89 miles  143 km  at the Canadian border  the narrowest width is 37 miles  60 km  at the Massachusetts line  The width averages 60 5 miles  97 4 km   The state s geographic center is Washington  three miles  5 km  east of Roxbury  There are fifteen US federal border crossings between Vermont and Canada  The origin of the name  Vermont  is uncertain  but likely comes from the French les Verts Monts  meaning  the Green Mountains   11 Thomas Young introduced it in 1777  12  Some authorities say that the mountains were called green because they were more forested than the higher White Mountains of New Hampshire and Adirondacks of New York  others say that the predominance of mica quartz chlorite schist  a green hued metamorphosed shale  is the reason  The Green Mountain range forms a north south spine running most of the length of the state  slightly west of its center  In the southwest portion of the state are the Taconic Mountains  the Granitic Mountains are in the northeast  13  In the northwest  near Lake Champlain  is the fertile Champlain Valley  In the south of the valley is Lake Bomoseen  Vermont has 14 counties  Only two Lamoille and Washington are entirely surrounded by Vermont territory  Several mountains have timberlines with delicate year round alpine ecosystems  including Mount Mansfield  the highest mountain in the state  Killington Peak  the second highest  Camel s Hump  the state s third highest  and Mount Abraham  the fifth highest peak  About 77  of the state is covered by forest  the rest is covered in meadow  uplands  lakes  ponds  and swampy wetlands  Areas in Vermont administered by the National Park Service include the Marsh Billings Rockefeller National Historical Park  in Woodstock  and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail  14   edit  Cities Vermont has nine incorporated cities  Burlington  Vermont s largest city Rutland Montpelier

Climate A covered bridge  set against the fall foliage  2009 Vermont has a humid continental climate  with warm  humid summers and cold winters that are colder at higher elevations  15  It has a K ppen climate classification of Dfb  similar to Minsk  Stockholm  and Fargo  16  Vermont is known for its mud season in spring  followed by a generally mild early summer  hot Augusts  a colorful autumn  and its particularly cold winters  the rural northeastern section  dubbed the  Northeast Kingdom   often averages 10  F  5 56  C  colder than the southern areas of the state during winter  The annual snowfall averages between 60 to 100 inches  1 500 to 2 500 mm  depending on elevation  The annual mean temperature for the state is 43  F  6  C   17  Vermont is the seventh coldest state in the country  18  The El Nino meteorology tends to affect winters in the state with a condition known colloquially as  too cold to snow   The air is too cool to contain sufficient moisture to precipitate  19  In the autumn  Vermont s hills display red  orange  and gold foliage displayed on the sugar maple as cold weather approaches  This display of color is not due so much to the presence of a particular variant of the sugar maple  rather  it is caused by a number of soil and climate conditions unique to the area  The highest recorded temperature was 105  F  41  C   at Vernon  on July 4  1911  the lowest recorded temperature was  50  F   46  C   at Bloomfield  on December 30  1933  this is the lowest temperature recorded in New England  Big Black River  Maine  also recorded a verified

Geology There are five distinct physiographic regions of Vermont  Categorized by geological and physical attributes  they are the Northeastern Highlands  the Green Mountains  the Taconic Mountains  the Champlain Lowlands  and the Vermont Piedmont  26  About 500 million years ago Vermont was part of Laurentia and located in the tropics  27  The central and southern Green Mountain range include the oldest rocks in Vermont  formed about one billion years ago during the first mountain building period  or orogeny   Subsequently  about 400 million years ago  the second mountain building period created Green Mountain peaks that were 15 000 20 000 feet  4 600 6 100 m  tall  three to four times their current height and comparable to the Himalayas  The geological pressures that created those peaks remain evident as the Champlain Thrust  running north south to the west of the mountains  now the eastern shore of Lake Champlain   It is an example of geological fault thrusting where bedrock is pushed over the newer rock formation  As a result of tectonic formation  Vermont east of the Green Mountains tends to be formed from rocks produced in the Silurian and Devonian periods  Western Vermont mainly from the older Pre Cambrian and Cambrian material  28  Several large deposits within the state contain granite  The Rock of Ages Quarry in Barre is one of the leading exporters of granite in the country  The work of the trained sculptors of this corporation can be seen only 3 miles  4 8 km  down the road at the Hope Cemetery  where gravestones and mausoleums can be seen  Some buildings in Germany  Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi are constructed almost primarily clarification needed  of Vermont granite  There are eight different colors of granite including  Barre Gray  Bethel White  Galactic Blue  Salisbury Pink  American Black  Gardenia White  Laurentian Pink  and Stanstead grey  29  30  The remains of the Chazy Formation can be observed in Isle La Motte  It was one of the first tropical reefs  It is the site of the limestone Fisk Quarry  which contains a collection of ancient marine fossils such as stromatoporoids  These fossils date back to 200 million years ago  clarification needed  It is believed that at one point  Vermont was connected to Africa  Pangaea  and the fossils found and the rock formations found on the coasts in both Africa and America are further evidence of the Pangaea theory  31  32  33  In the past four centuries  Vermont has experienced a few earthquakes rarely centered under Vermont  the highest being a Richter magnitude scale 6 0 in 1952  34   edit  Natural history Vermont is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome  Much of the state  in particular the Green Mountains  is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England Acadian forests  The western border with New York and the area around Lake Champlain lies within the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests  The southwest corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut River are covered by Northeastern coastal forests of mixed oak  35  The state contains 41 species of reptiles and amphibians  89 species of fish  of which 12 are non native  36  193 species of breeding birds  58 species of mammals  more than 15 000 insect species  and 2 000 higher plant species  plus fungi  algae  and 75 different types of natural communities  37  Vermont contains one species of venomous snake  the Eastern timber rattlesnake  which is confined to a few acres in western Rutland County  38  By the mid 19th century  wild turkeys were exterminated in the state through overhunting and destruction of habitat  Sixteen were re introduced in 1969 and had grown to an estimated flock of 45 000 in 2009  39  Since 1970  reduction of farmland has resulted in reduced environment for  and reduced numbers of various shrubland birds including the American woodcock  brown thrasher  Eastern towhee  willow flycatcher  golden winged warbler  blue winged warbler  field sparrow  and Baltimore oriole  40  Invasive wild honeysuckle has been deemed a threat to the state s forests  native species of plants  and wildlife  41  DDT destroyed the eggshells of ospreys which resulted in their disappearance from the state  This species began reviving in 1998  As of 2010  they were no longer endangered in the state  42  White nose syndrome killed an estimated two thirds of all cave wintering bats in the state from 2008 to 2010  43  Many of Vermont s rivers  including the Winooski River  have been subjected to man made barriers to prevent flooding  Climate change appears to be affecting the maple sugar industry  Sugar maples have been subject to stress by acid rain  asian longhorn beetles  pear thrips  and  in 2011  an excessive deer herd which is forced to eat bark in the winter  These maples need a certain amount of cold to produce sap for maple syrup  The time to tap these trees has shrunk to one week in some years  The tree may be replaced by the more aggressive Norway maples  effectively forcing the sugar maples to  migrate  north to Canada  44   edit  History Main article  History of Vermont Mount Mansfield  at 4 393 feet  1 339 m   is the highest point in Vermont   edit  Pre Columbian Between 8500 to 7000 BC  at the time of the Champlain Sea  Native Americans inhabited and hunted in Vermont  During the Archaic period  from the 8th millennium BC to 1000 BC  Native Americans migrated year round  During the Woodland period  from 1000 BC to AD 1600  villages and trade networks were established  and ceramic and bow and arrow technology was developed  In pre Columbian Vermont  In the western part of the state there lived a small population of Algonquian speaking tribes  including the Mohican and Abenaki peoples  Sometime between 1500 and 1600  the Iroquois drove many of the smaller native tribes out of Vermont  later using the area as a hunting ground and warring with the remaining Abenaki  The population in 1500 was estimated to be around 10 000 people   edit  Colonial See also  List of forts in Vermont The Old Constitution House at Windsor  where the Constitution of Vermont was adopted on

the St  Lawrence Valley  This was the first seismic event noted in Vermont  34  In 1690  a group of Dutch British settlers from Albany established a settlement and trading post at Chimney Point 8 miles  13 km  west of present day Addison  During Dummer s War  the first permanent British settlement was established in 1724  with the construction of Fort Dummer protecting the nearby settlements of Dummerston and Brattleboro  From 1731 to 1734  the French constructed Fort St  Fr d ric which gave the French control of the New France Vermont frontier region in the Lake Champlain Valley  With the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754  the French began construction of Fort Carillon at present day Ticonderoga  New York in 1755  The British failed to take Fort St  Fr d ric or Fort Carillon between 1755 and 1758  In 1759  a combined force of 12 000 British regular and provincial troops under Sir Jeffery Amherst captured Carillon  after which the French abandoned Fort St  Fr d ric  Amherst then constructed Fort Crown Point next to the remains of the Fort St  Fr d ric  securing British control over the area  Following France s loss in the French and Indian War  the 1763 Treaty of Paris gave control of the land to the British  Colonial settlement was limited by the crown to lands east of the Appalachians  and Vermont was divided nearly in half in a jagged line running from Fort William Henry in Lake George diagonally north eastward to Lake Memphremagog  citation needed  The end of the war brought new settlers to Vermont  Ultimately  Massachusetts  New Hampshire and New York all claimed this frontier area  On March 20  1764  King George III established the boundary between New Hampshire and New York along the west bank of the Connecticut River  north of Massachusetts  and south of 45 degrees north latitude  When New York refused to recognize land titles known as the New Hampshire Grants  towns created by land grants sold by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth   dissatisfied colonists organized in opposition  which led to the creation of independent Vermont on January 15  1777  45  46  In 1770  Ethan Allen  his brothers Ira and Levi  and Seth Warner recruited an informal militia  known as the Green Mountain Boys  to protect the interests of the original New Hampshire settlers against the new migrants from New York   edit  Independence

article  Vermont Republic On January 15  1777  representatives of the New Hampshire Grants declared the independence of Vermont  47  For the first six months of its existence  it was called The Republic of New Connecticut  48  On June 2  1777  a second convention of 72 delegates met to adopt the name  Vermont   This was on the advice of a friendly Pennsylvanian who wrote to them on how to achieve admission into the newly independent United States as the 14th state  48  On July 4  the Constitution of Vermont was drafted at the Windsor Tavern  it was adopted by the delegates on July 8  This was among the first written constitutions in North America and was indisputably the first to abolish the institution of slavery  provide for universal adult male suffrage  and require support of public schools  It was in effect from 1777 to 1791  49  Slavery was banned again by state law on November 25  1858  50   edit  Revolutionary War Main article  Battle of Bennington The Battle of Bennington  fought on August 16  1777  was a seminal event in the history of the state of Vermont  A combined American force  under General Stark s command  attacked the British column at Hoosick  New York  just across the border from Bennington and killed or captured virtually the entire British detachment  General Burgoyne never recovered from this loss and eventually surrendered the remainder of his 6 000 man force at Saratoga  New York  on October 17  The Battles of Bennington and Saratoga are recognized as the turning point in the Revolutionary War because they were the first major defeat of a British army  The anniversary of the battle is still celebrated in Vermont as a legal holiday  The Battle of Hubbardton  July 7  1777  was the only battle in present day Vermont and though the Continental forces were technically defeated  the British forces were damaged to the point that they did not pursue the Americans  retreating from Fort Ticonderoga  any further   edit  Statehood and the antebellum era Vermont in 1827 Vermont continued to govern itself as a sovereign entity based in the eastern town of Windsor for fourteen years  The independent state of Vermont issued its own coinage from 1785 to 1788 51  and operated a statewide postal service  Thomas Chittenden was the Governor in 1778 1789 and in 1790 1791  The state was obliged to solve conflicting property ownership disputes with New Yorkers  In 1791  Vermont joined the federal union as the fourteenth state  and the first to enter the Union after the original thirteen colonies  Vermont had a unicameral legislature until 1836  The mid 1850s onwards saw a transition from Vermonters mostly favoring slavery s containment  to a far more serious opposition to the institution  producing the Radical Republican and abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens  While the Whig Party shriveled  and the Republican Party emerged  Vermont strongly trended in support of its candidates  In 1860 it voted for President Abraham Lincoln  giving him the largest margin of victory of any state   edit  The Civil War Main article  Vermont in the American Civil War During the American Civil War  Vermont sent more than 34 000 men into United States service  Almost 5 200 Vermonters  15 percent  were killed or mortally wounded in action or died of disease  a higher percentage than any other state  The northernmost land action of the war  the St  Albans Raid  took place in Vermont   edit  Postbellum era and beyond The first election in which women were allowed to vote was on December 18  1880  when women were granted limited suffrage and were first allowed to vote in town elections  and then in state legislative races  Large scale flooding occurred in early November 1927  During this incident  84 people died including the state s lieutenant governor  52  The 1938 New England hurricane blew down 15 000 000 acres  61 000 km2  of trees  one third of the total forest at the time in New England  3 billion board feet were salvaged  Many of the older trees in the state are about 75 years old  dating from after this storm  53  Another flood occurred in 1973  causing the death of two people and millions of dollars in property damage  In 1964  the US Supreme Court decision in Reynolds v  Sims that forced  one man  one vote  redistricting on all states required large changes in Vermont  giving cities an equitable share of votes in both houses for the entire country  54  Until that time  counties had often been represented by area in state senates and were often unsympathetic to possible solutions to urban problems that would increase taxes  citation needed  The governor called the 2011 flooding caused by Tropical Storm Irene one of the worst in the 20th and 21st century  second only to the flood

the state s economy  92  However  another study claims that agriculture contributed 2 2  of the state s domestic product in 2000  93  In 2000  about 3 percent of the state s working population engaged in agriculture  94  Fall foliage seen from Hogback Mountain  Wilmington Over the past two centuries  logging has fallen off as over cutting and the exploitation of other forests made Vermont s forest less attractive  The decline of farms has resulted in a regrowth of Vermont s forests due to ecological succession  Today  most of Vermont s forests are secondary  The state and non profit organizations are actively encouraging regrowth and careful forest management  Over 78 percent of the land area of the state is forested  Over 85 percent of that area is non industrial  private forestland owned by individuals or families  Dairy farming is the primary source of agricultural income  In the last half of the 20th century  developers had plans to build condos and houses on what was relatively inexpensive  open land  Vermont s government responded with a series of laws controlling development and with some pioneering initiatives to prevent the loss of Vermont s dairy industry  Still  the number of Vermont dairy farms has declined more than 85 percent from the 11 206 dairy farms operating in 1947  In 2003 there were fewer than 1 500 dairy farms in the state  in 2006 there were 1 138  and in 2007 there were 1 087  The number of dairy farms has been diminishing by 10 percent annually  95  The number of cattle in Vermont had declined by 40 percent  however  milk production has doubled in the same period due to tripling the production per cow  96  While milk production rose  Vermont s market share declined  Within a group of states supplying the Boston and New

pounds  45 kg  of milk  This dropped in 2008 to  17  99  The average dairy farm produced 1 3 million pounds of milk annually in 2008  100  The dairy barn remains an iconic image of Vermont  but the 87 percent decrease in active dairy farms between 1947 and 2003  101  preservation of the dairy barns has increasingly become dependent upon a commitment to maintaining a legacy rather than basic need in the agricultural economy  The Vermont Barn Census  organized by a collaboration of educational and nonprofit state and local historic preservation programs  has developed educational and administrative systems for recording the number  condition  and features of barns throughout Vermont  102  In 2009  there were 543 organic farms  Twenty percent of the dairy farms were organic and 23 percent  128  vegetable farms were organic  Organic farming increased in 2006 07  but leveled off in 2008 09  Nor are any expected for 2010  103  A significant amount of milk is shipped into the Boston market  Therefore the Commonwealth of Massachusetts certifies that Vermont farms meet Massachusetts sanitary standards  Without this certification  a farmer may not sell milk for distribution into the bulk market  104  An important and growing part of Vermont s economy is the manufacture and sale of artisan foods  fancy foods  and novelty items trading in part upon the Vermont  brand  which the state manages and defends  Examples of these specialty exports include Cabot Cheese  the Vermont Teddy Bear Company  Fine Paints of Europe  Vermont Butter and Cheese Company  several micro breweries  ginseng growers  Burton Snowboards  Lake Champlain Chocolates  King Arthur Flour  and Ben and Jerry s Ice Cream  There were about 2 000 maple products producers in 2010  105  In 2001  Vermont produced 275 000 US gallons  1 040 000 L  of maple syrup  about one quarter of U S  production  For 2005 that number was 410 000 US gallons  1 600 000 l  340 000 imp gal  accounting for 37 percent of national production  106  This rose to 920 000 US gallons  3 500 000 l  770 000 imp gal  in 2009  107  Wine industry in Vermont started in 1985  There are 14 wineries today  108  Farms in

the 17th highest state in the nation for mortgage affordability  However  in 41 other states  inhabitants contributed within plus or minus 4 percent of Vermont s 18 4 percent of household income to a mortgage  115  Housing prices did not rise much during the early 2000s  As a result  the collapse in real estate values was not that precipitous either  While foreclosure rose significantly in 2007  the state stood 50th  last  and best  in ratio of foreclosure filings to households  116  While housing sales dropped annually from 2004 to 2008  prices continued to rise  117  In 2007  Vermont was best in the country for construction of new energy efficient homes as evaluated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Energy Star program  118  However  about 60 percent of Vermont homes were heated with oil in 2008  119  In August 2008  the cost in Vermont of various heating sources per 1 million BTU ranged from  14 39 for cord wood to  43 50 for kerosene  While the number of houses sold in the state has dropped from 8 318 in 2004 to 8 120 in 2005  6 919 in 2006  and 5 820 in 2007  the average price has continued to rise to  202 500 in 2008   200 000 in 2007

2006 constant dollars and remained there in 2010  the nation   36 871  128   edit  Insurance Captive insurance plays an increasingly large role in Vermont s economy  With this form of alternative insurance  large corporations or industry associations form standalone insurance companies to insure their own risks  thereby substantially reducing their insurance premiums and gaining a significant measure of control over types of risks to be covered  There are also significant tax advantages to be gained from the formation and operation of captive insurance companies  According to the Insurance Information Institute  Vermont in 2009 was the world s third largest domicile for captive insurance companies  following Bermuda and the Cayman Islands  129  In 2009  there were 560 such companies

elections  Prior to the 1990s  Vermont had voted Democratic only once  in Lyndon B  Johnson s landslide victory of 1964 against Barry M  Goldwater  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries  Republican presidential candidates frequently won the state with over 70 percent of the vote  Republicans also dominated local Vermont politics from the party s founding in 1854 until the mid 1970s  Prior to the 1960s  rural interests dominated the legislature  As a result  cities  particularly the older sections of Burlington and Winooski  were neglected and fell into decay  People began to move out to newer suburbs  In the meantime  many people had moved in from out of state  citation needed  Much of this immigration included the arrival of more liberal political influences of the urban areas of New York and the rest of New England in Vermont  citation needed  In addition  a series of one man  one vote decisions made by the United States Supreme Court in the 1960s required states to redraw their legislative districts to more fairly reflect population  As a result  urban areas in Vermont began to regain some political power  In 1992  it supported Democrat Bill Clinton for president  the first time the state had done so since 1964  and has voted Democratic in every presidential election since  Vermont gave John Kerry his fourth largest margin of victory in 2004  he won the state s popular vote by 20 percentage points over incumbent George W  Bush  taking almost 59 percent of the vote   Kerry  from neighboring Massachusetts  also became the first Northern Democrat ever to carry Vermont  Johnson was from Texas  Clinton from Arkansas and Al Gore  triumphant in the Green Mountain State in 2000  from Tennessee   Essex County in the state s northeastern section was the only county to vote for Bush  Vermont is the only state that did not receive a visit from George W  Bush during his tenure as President of the United States  In the 2000 presidential election  Bush was the first Republican in American history to win the White House without carrying Vermont or Illinois  202  Vermont gave Barack Obama his third largest winning margin  37 percentage points  winning there 68 31   On the other hand  Republican Governor Douglas won all counties but Windham in the 2006 election  Today  Vermont is one of only two states represented by a member of the United States Congress who does not currently associate with a political party  Senator Bernie Sanders describes his political views as democratic socialist  but is officially registered as an independent and caucuses with the Democrats in the selection of the Senate leadership  203   edit  State politics After the legislature was redistricted under one person  one vote in the 1960s  it passed legislation to accommodate the new arrivals to the state  This legislation was the Land Use and Development Law  Act 250  in 1970  The law  which was the first of its kind in the nation  created nine District Environmental Commissions consisting of private citizens  appointed by the Governor  who must approve land development and subdivision plans that would have a significant impact on the state s environment and many small communities  As a result of Act 250  Vermont was the last state to get a Wal Mart  there are now four in the state  as of December 2009  but only the Williston store was new construction   Because of the success of Act 250  subsequent attempts to dilute its power  and other development pressures  Vermont has been designated one of America s most  endangered historic places  by the National Trust for Historic Preservation  204  A recent controversy was over the adoption of civil unions  an institution which grants same sex couples nearly all the rights and privileges of marriage at the state  but not federal  level  In Baker v  Vermont  1999   the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that  under the Constitution of Vermont  the state must either allow same sex marriage or provide a separate but equal status for them  The state legislature chose the second option by creating the institution of civil union  the bill was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Howard Dean  In April 2009 the state legislature overrode governor Jim Douglas s veto to allow same sex marriage  becoming the first state in the nation to legalize same sex marriage through legislation  205  In September 2009  Vermont became one of six states in which same sex couples could marry  206  In 2007  the state s House of Representatives rejected a measure which would have legalized assisted suicide for the terminally ill  by a vote of 82 63  207  Minor parties and Independents flourish  Rules which eliminate smaller parties from the ballot in most states do not exist in Vermont  As a result  voters often have extensive choices for general elections  This has resulted in the election to Mayor of Burlington and then to U S  Congressman of Bernie Sanders  then a Socialist  and later  as an Independent  to U S  Senator  A political issue has been Act 60  which balances taxation for education funding  This has resulted in the town of Killington trying to secede from Vermont and join New Hampshire due to what the locals say is an unfair tax burden  208  209  The Vermont constitution and the courts supports the right of a person to walk  fish and hunt  on any unposted  unfenced land  That is  trespass must be proven by the owner  it is not automatically assumed  210  The state is an alcoholic beverage control state  In 2007  through the
