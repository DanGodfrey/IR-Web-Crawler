San Diego Comic Con or  SDCC   was founded as the Golden State Comic Book Convention and later the San Diego Comic Book Convention in 1970 by a group of San Diegans  which included Shel Dorf  Richard Alf  Ken Krueger and Mike Towry  2  3  4  5  It is traditionally a four day event  Thursday through Sunday   though a three hour preview night on Wednesday is open to professionals  exhibitors  and some guests pre registered for all four days  held during the summer in San Diego  California  United States  at the San Diego Convention Center  Comic Con is both the name of the annual event and the common name of the organization  Comic Con International also produces two other conventions  WonderCon and the Alternative Press Expo  APE   both held in San Francisco  California  Since 1974  Comic Con has bestowed its annual Inkpot Award to guests and persons of interest in the industries of popular arts as well as to members of Comic Con s Board of Directors and convention committee  It is also the home of the Will Eisner Awards  Originally showcasing comic books  science fiction fantasy and film television  as was evident by the three circled figures appearing in Comic Con s original logo   and related popular arts  the convention has expanded over the years to include a larger range of pop culture elements  such as horror  animation  anime  manga  toys  collectible card games  video games  webcomics  and fantasy novels  The convention is the largest in the Americas  and fourth largest in the world after the Comiket in Japan  the Angoul me International Comics Festival in

History and organization The convention was founded by in 1970 by Shel Dorf  Richard Alf  Ken Krueger and Mike Towry  2  3 Detroit  Michigan born comics fan Shel Dorf  who in the mid 1960s had mounted the Detroit Triple Fan Fairs  one of the first commercial comics fan conventions  When he moved to San Diego  California in 1970  9  he organized a one day convention  Golden State Comic Minicon  on March 21  1970  as a kind of  dry run  for the larger convention he hoped to stage   Dorf went on to be associated with the convention as president or manager  variously  for many years until becoming estranged from the organization  10  Alf co chaired the first convention with Krueger and became chairman in 1971  3  Following the initial gathering  Dorf s first three day San Diego comics convention  the Golden State Comic Con  9  drew 300 people 11  and was held at the U  S  Grant Hotel 9  from August 1 3  1970  12  Other locations in the convention s early years included the El Cortez Hotel  the University of California  San Diego  and Golden Hall  before being moved to the San Diego Convention Center in 1991  13 Richard Alf chairman in 1971  has noted an early factor in the Con s growth was an effort  to expand the Comic Con  organizing  committee base by networking with other fandoms such as the Society for Creative Anachronism and the Mythopoeic Society  among others   We found a lot of talent and strength through diversity    14  By the late 1970s the show had grown to such an extent that Bob Schreck recalled visiting with his then boss Gary Berman of Creation Conventions and reflecting   While  Berman  kept repeating  attempting to convince himself   This show s not any bigger than ours   I was quietly walking the floor stunned and in awe of just how much bigger it really was  I was blown away   15  The convention is organized by a panel of 13 board members  16 to 20 full time and part time workers  and 80 volunteers who assist via committees  Comic Con International is a non profit organization  and proceeds of the event go to funding it  as well as the Alternative Press Expo  APE  and WonderCon  13  In September 2010  the convention announced that it would stay in San Diego through 2015  16  17  According to the San Diego Convention and Visitor s Bureau the convention has an annual regional economic impact of  162 8 million  18  19   edit  Events Sign inside the San Diego Comic Con Along with panels  seminars  and workshops with comic book professionals  there are previews of upcoming feature films  portfolio review sessions with top comic book and video game companies  and such evening events as awards ceremonies and the Masquerade  a costume contest  as well as the Comic Con International Independent Film Festival  which showcases shorts and feature length movies that do not have distribution or distribution deals  Traditional events include an eclectic film program  screening rooms devoted to Japanese animation  gaming  programs such as cartoonist Scott Shaw  s  Oddball Comics  slide show and animation expert Jerry Beck s program featuring TV s  worst cartoons ever   as well as over 350 hours of other programming on all aspects of comic books and pop culture  Like most comic book conventions  Comic Con features a large floorspace for exhibitors  These include media companies such as movie studios and TV networks  as well as comic book dealers and collectibles merchants  Like most comics conventions  Comic Con includes an autograph area  as well as the Artists  Alley where comics artists can sign autographs and sell or do free sketches  Despite the name  artists  alleys can include writers and even models  Academics and comic industry professionals annually hold the Comics Arts Conference at Comic Con  presenting scholarly studies on comics as a medium  In recent years  the number of television shows that are promoted far outnumber films  During the 2011 convention  at least 80 TV shows were represented  compared to about 35 films  20  The shows not only promote in the exhibit halls  but also use screenings and panels of various actors  writers  producers  and others from their shows  While many animated shows are represented  a high number of non animated shows are also promoted by studios and the networks  Examples of the wide variety of TV shows recently promoted include Bones  Burn Notice  Castle  Chuck  Grimm  Mythbusters  Nikita  Once Upon a Time  Psych  Supernatural  The Vampire Diaries  and Torchwood  Of course sci fi TV shows are there  such as Being Human  Eureka  Fringe  Lost Girl  Sanctuary  and Warehouse 13  but HBO and Showtime are also big attractions with shows like Dexter  Shameless and True Blood  20  21  22  There are at least 17 separate rooms in the Convention Center used for panels and screenings  ranging in size from 280 seats to 6 500 seats  The neighboring Hilton Bayfront is also used  with their main ballroom  Indigo  seating up to 2 600  23  24  The other neighboring hotel  the Marriott Marquis  amp  Marina  also hosts a lot of Comic Con activity  Among other things  the hotel serves as the anime headquarters and is where the nighttime films are shown  23   edit  Exclusive collectibles In the 21st century  the convention has drawn toy and collectibles designers who sell  Comic Con Exclusive  products  Such companies have included LEGO  Hasbro  Mattel  and Sideshow Collectibles  25  Most such exclusives are licensed properties of movie  comic book  and animation characters   edit  In the media Comic Con International has served as the setting for Mark Hamill s Comic Book  The Movie  and for an episode of the HBO television series Entourage  the latter of which  while set at the event  was not filmed there  Comic Con also served as an excuse for the fictional characters Seth Cohen and Ryan Atwood s trip to Tijuana  Mexico in the first season of TV series The O C  The convention also featured prominently as a setting for the Numb3rs episode  Graphic   In Season 4 of Beauty and the Geek  an episode was featured where the contestants traveled to Comic Con 07 and were given a challenge to create their own superheroes  In an episode of Punk d  Hilary Swank gets Punk d after an  attack from talking robot   In Season 5  episode six of the Showtime show Weeds  attendees from Comic Con 2009 are seen in Silas and Doug s medicinal marijuana club  It was reported that a mock up of the external area near Hall D of the Convention Center depicting Comic Con would be shown in the movie Paul which stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost  26  Issue  72 of The Invincible Iron Man  1974  was set at the July August 1974 Comic Con at the El Cortez Hotel  and featured cameos by a few of the special guests  Comic

was the scene of the first San Diego Con  which I attended way back in 1970  back when we thought it was mobbed to have 500 comic fans in the same place at the same time  The hotel was undergoing a massive renovation then as well  but was merely upgrading from Extremely Shabby to merely Somewhat Shabby  The place I still miss is the El Cortez Hotel  where the con was held for several years in the seventies  I d say the place was a dump but that would be demeaning to dumps  Still  it was a fun dump  run by a management that didn t seem to care all that much what we did to it  29    Evanier on an early spillover venue    In the seventies  when we all started going to San Diego Comic Book Conventions  back when they called them that  the Hotel San Diego was a frequent venue for con events  Some years  before it outgrew any available hotel ballroom  the Inkpot Awards presentation was held there  There were many memorable parties and gatherings  such as in 1982 when a group of Jack Kirby s friends staged a memorable surprise birthday party for him in one of its halls  Perhaps some year  you were either so hard up for money or so desperate for an available room  or both  that you even booked into its sadly deteriorating accommodations  It was one of the cheaper places to sleep and con goers took advantage of that up until June 2001 when the building was declared structurally unsafe and was closed down   30     edit  Issues and criticism This article s Criticism or Controversy section may compromise the article s neutral point of view of the subject  Please integrate the section

of the convention center in 2011 awaiting the exhibition hall to open  Capacity attendance at Comic Con in 2006 and 2007 has caused crowding issues  Concerns have been raised that the event is possibly too massive for the San Diego Convention Center  Comic Con s home through at least 2015  31  In 2006  Comic Con for the first time  had to close registration for a few hours on Saturday to accommodate crowds  In response  for 2007  Comic Con introduced a new three day membership that did not include Saturday  Nevertheless  the 2007 show went on to sell out Saturday  as well as Friday and Sunday for the first time  Additionally  both the four day and three day memberships sold out for the first time  For 2008  the three day memberships were abandoned and the convention decided to sell memberships only in advance  with no on site registration  32  In 2008  all memberships were sold out before the convention for the first time ever  This sellout has given rise to the new phenomenon of Comic Con memberships being scalped for exorbitant prices on websites such as eBay  33  In April 2008  David Glanzer  Comic Con s director of marketing and public relations  commented on the organization s desire to remain in San Diego  We ve been approached by other cities   but  I don t think anybody wants to leave San Diego  I certainly don t  It s a perfect fit for us  It s expensive  whether it be paying for the street signs that tell you what streets are closed  or for any police or the hall or any of the myriad things  it s expensive  But it s a great city  There s been some talk of expansion of the center  which we would certainly welcome  Hopefully if everything lines up  we will be here for many more years  13  Heidi McDonald reported on her blog The Beat as of October 7  2009 Preview Night for the 2010 show has already sold out  Glazner explained the early sell out  For 2010 the decision was made to offer an option  of whether they wanted to attend Preview Night  to those who pre registered for four day badges  We limited the number of badges for Preview Night to the number of those who attended in 2008  34  Mark Evanier on his blog News from ME noted as of November 9  2009 all 4 day passes for the 2010 show had already been sold out  35  On February 23  2010  The Orange County Register reported that the larger Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim would be making a bid to become the new home of Comic Con starting in 2013  36  On September 30  2010 Comic Con announced that they have extended their stay up to 2015  The North County Times reported on July 26  2010 that 4 day passes with access to Preview night for the 2011 Convention sold out two hours before the 2010 convention closed  37  Due to overcrowding organizers of the event capped attendance  38  this cap has been in place since 2007  39   edit  Locations and dates This section is missing information about panelists and exhibitors  This concern has been noted on the talk
