populous continent  after Asia  At about 30 2 million km   11 7 million sq mi  including adjacent islands  it covers 6  of the Earth s total surface area and 20 4  of the total land area  2  With 1 0 billion people  as of 2009  see table   it accounts for about 14 72  of the world s human population  The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north  both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast  the Indian Ocean to the southeast  and the Atlantic Ocean to the west  The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagoes  It has 54 fully recognized sovereign states   countries    two states with limited recognition and 9 territories  3  Africa  particularly central Eastern Africa  is widely regarded within the scientific community to be the origin of humans and the Hominidae clade  great apes   as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors  as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago   including Sahelanthropus tchadensis  Australopithecus africanus  A  afarensis  Homo erectus  H  habilis and H  ergaster   with the earliest Homo sapiens  modern human  found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200 000 years ago  4  Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas  it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern

usually connected with Phoenician afar   dust   but a 1981 hypothesis 7  has asserted that it stems from the Berber word ifri or ifran meaning  cave  and  caves   in reference to cave dwellers  8  Africa or Ifri or Afer 8  is the name of Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania  Berber Tribe of Yafran   9  Under Roman rule  Carthage became the capital of Africa Province  which also included the coastal part of modern Libya  10  The Latin suffix   ica  can sometimes be used to denote a land  e g   in Celtica from Celtes  as used by Julius Caesar   The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya  modern day Tunisia  also preserved a form of the name  Other etymological hypotheses that have been postulated for the ancient name  Africa   the 1st century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus  Ant  1 15  asserted that it was named for Epher  grandson of Abraham according to Gen  25 4  whose descendants  he claimed  had invaded Libya  Latin word aprica   sunny   mentioned by Isidore of Seville in Etymologiae XIV 5 2  the Greek word aphrike           meaning  without cold   This was proposed by historian Leo Africanus  1488 1554   who suggested the Greek word phrike         meaning  cold and horror    combined with the privative prefix  a    thus indicating a land free of cold and horror  11  Another theory is that the word aphrik  comes from aphr s  foam and Aphrik   land of foam  meaning the land of the big waves  like Attica  from the word akt   Aktik  meaning land of the coasts   citation needed  Massey  in 1881  derived an etymology from the Egyptian af rui ka   to turn toward the opening of the Ka   The Ka is the energetic double of every person and  opening of the Ka  refers to a womb or birthplace  Africa would be  for the Egyptians   the birthplace   12  yet another hypothesis was proposed by Mich le Fruyt in Revue de Philologie 50  1976  221 238  linking the Latin word with africus  south wind   which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally  rainy wind   The Irish female name Aifric is sometimes anglicised as Africa  but the given name is unrelated to the geonym  History Main article  History of Africa Further information  History of North Africa  History of West Africa  History of Central Africa  History of East Africa  and History of Southern Africa Paleohistory The African prosauropod Massospondylus  At the beginning of the Mesozoic Era  Africa was joined with Earth s other continents in Pangaea  13  Africa shared the supercontinent s relatively uniform fauna  which was dominated by theropods  prosauropods and primitive ornithischians by the close of the Triassic period  13  Late Triassic fossils are found throughout Africa  but are more common in the south than north  13  The boundary separating the Triassic and Jurassic marks the advent of an extinction event with global impact  although African strata from this time period have not been thoroughly studied  13  Early Jurassic strata are distributed in a similar fashion to Late Triassic beds  with more common outcrops in the south and less common fossil beds which are predominated by tracks to the north  13  As the Jurassic proceeded  larger and more iconic groups of dinosaurs like sauropods and ornithopods proliferated in Africa  13 Middle Jurassic strata are neither well represented nor well studied in Africa  13  Late Jurassic strata are also poorly represented apart from the spectacular Tendaguru fauna in Tanzania  13  The Late Jurassic life of Tendaguru is very similar to that found in western North America s Morrison Formation  13  Midway through the Mesozoic  about 150 160 million years ago  Madagascar separated from Africa  although it remained connected to India and the rest of the Gondwanan landmasses  13  Fossils from Madagascar include abelisaurs and titanosaurs  13  The African theropod Spinosaurus was the largest known carnivorous dinosaur  Later into the Early Cretaceous epoch  the India Madagascar landmass separated from the rest of Gondwana  13  By the Late Cretaceous  Madagascar and India had permanently split ways and continued until later reaching their modern configurations  13  By contrast to Madagascar  mainland Africa was relatively stable in position throughout the Mesozoic  13  Despite the stable position  major changes occurred to its relation to other landmasses as the remains of Pangea continued to break apart  13  By the beginning of the Late Cretaceous epoch South America had split off from Africa  completing the southern half of the Atlantic Ocean  13  This event had a profound effect on global climate by altering ocean currents  13  During the Cretaceous  Africa was populated by allosauroids and spinosaurids  including the largest known carnivorous dinosaurs  13 Titanosaurs were significant herbivores in its ancient ecosystems  13  Cretaceous sites are more common than Jurassic ones  but are often unable to be dated radiometrically making it difficult to know their exact ages  13  Paleontologist Louis Jacobs  who spent time doing field work in Malawi  citation needed  says that African beds are  in need of more field work  and will prove to be a  fertile ground     for discovery   13  Prehistory Lucy  an Australopithecus afarensis skeleton discovered on November 24  1974  in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia s Afar Depression Africa is considered by most paleoanthropologists to be the oldest inhabited territory on Earth  with the human species originating from the continent  14  15  During the middle of the 20th century  anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago  Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man  such as Australopithecus afarensis  radiometrically dated to approximately 3 9 3 0 million years BC   16 Paranthropus boisei  c  2 3 1 4 million years BC  17  and Homo ergaster  c  1 9 million 600 000 years BC  have been discovered  2  Throughout humanity s prehistory  Africa  like all other continents  had no nation states  and was instead inhabited by groups of hunter gatherers such as the Khoi and San  18  19  20  At the end of the Ice Ages  estimated to have been around 10 500 BC  the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley  and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in Sub Saharan Africa citation needed   However  the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile  The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi permanent settlements  A major climatic recession occurred  lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa  Since this time dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa  and increasingly during the last 200 years  in Ethiopia  The domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter gathering cultures  It is speculated that by 6000 BC cattle were already domesticated in North Africa  21  In the Sahara Nile complex  people domesticated many animals including the donkey  and a small screw horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia  In the year 4000 BC the climate of the Sahara started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace  22  This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification  This  in turn  decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa  22  By the first millennium BC ironworking had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub Saharan Africa 23  and by 500 BC metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa  Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa  although other regions didn t begin ironworking until the early centuries AD  Copper objects from Egypt  North Africa  Nubia and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa  suggesting that trans saharan trade networks had been established by this date  22  Early civilizations Main article  Ancient African history Colossal statues of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel  Egypt  date from around 1400 BC  At about 3300 BC  the historical record opens in Northern Africa with the rise of literacy in the Pharaonic civilisation of Ancient Egypt  24  One of the world s earliest and longest lasting civilizations  the Egyptian state continued  with varying levels of influence over other areas  until 343 BC  25  26  Egyptian influence reached deep into modern day Libya  north to Crete 27  and Canaan citation needed   and south to the kingdoms of Aksum citation needed  and Nubia citation needed   An independent centre of civilisation with trading links to Phoenicia was established by Phoenicians from Tyre on the north west African coast at Carthage  28  29  30  European exploration of Africa began with Ancient Greeks and Romans  In 332 BC  Alexander the Great was welcomed as a liberator in Persian occupied Egypt  He founded Alexandria in Egypt  which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty after his death  31  Following the conquest of North Africa s Mediterranean coastline by the Roman Empire  the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system  Roman settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast  Christianity spread across these areas at an early date  from Judaea via Egypt and beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia  citation needed  by AD 340 at the latest  it had become the state religion of the Aksumite Empire thanks to Syro Greek missionaries who arrived by way of the Red Sea  citation needed  In the early 7th century  the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt  and then into North Africa  In a short while the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes  When the Ummayad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century  the Islamic center of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to Qayrawan in North Africa  Islamic North Africa had become diverse  and a hub for mystics  scholars  jurists and philosophers  During the above mentioned period  Islam spread to sub Saharan Africa  mainly through trade routes and migration  32  9th 18th centuries African horseman of Baguirmi in full padded armour suit 9th century bronzes from the Igbo town of Igbo Ukwu  now at the British Museum 33  Pre colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10 000 different states and polities 34  characterised by many different sorts of political organisation and rule  These included small family groups of hunter gatherers such as the San people of southern Africa  larger  more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu speaking people of central and southern Africa  heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of Africa  the large Sahelian kingdoms  and autonomous city states and kingdoms such as those of the Akan  Yoruba and Igbo people  also misspelled as Ibo  in West Africa  and the Swahili coastal trading towns of East Africa  By the 9th century a string of dynastic states  including the earliest Hausa states  stretched across the sub saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan  The most powerful of these states were Ghana  Gao  and the Kanem Bornu Empire  Ghana declined in the 11th century but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the 13th century  Kanem accepted Islam in the 11th century  In the forested regions of the West African coast  independent kingdoms grew up with little influence from the Muslim north  The Kingdom of Nri of the Igbo was established around the 9th century and was one of the first  It is also one of the oldest Kingdom in modern day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri  The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes  found at the town of Igbo Ukwu  The bronzes have been dated from as far back as the 9th century  35  Ashanti yam ceremony  19th century by Thomas E  Bowdich The Ife  historically the first of these Yoruba city states or kingdoms  established government under a priestly oba  ruler    oba means  king  or  ruler  in the Yoruba language   called the Ooni of Ife  Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in Africa  and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture  The Ife model of government was adapted at Oyo  where its obas or kings  called the Alaafins of Oyo once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non Yoruba city states and Kingdoms  the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey was one of the non Yoruba domains under Oyo control  The Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the 11th century  36  The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the 11th and 13th centuries  Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers  where the locals were Arabized  37  and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture  under the unifying framework of Islam  38  Ruins of Great Zimbabwe  11th 15th c   Following the breakup of Mali a local leader named Sonni Ali  1464 1492  founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans Saharan trade  Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473  building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants  His successor Askia Mohammad I  1493 1528  made Islam the official religion  built mosques  and brought Muslim scholars  including al Maghili  d 1504   the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship  to Gao  39  By the 11th century some Hausa states   such as Kano  jigawa  Katsina  and Gobir   had developed into walled towns engaging in trade  servicing caravans  and the manufacture of goods  Until the 15th century these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era  paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem Borno to the east  Height of slave trade See also  Arab slave trade and Atlantic slave trade A point of no return in Ouidah  Benin  a former gateway for slaves to slave ships  Slavery had long been practiced in Africa  40  41  Between the 7th and 20th centuries  Arab slave trade  also known as slavery in the East  took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans Saharan and Indian Ocean routes  Between the 15th and the 19th centuries  500 years   the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7 12 million slaves to the New World  42  43  44  In West Africa  the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities  The gradual decline of slave trading  prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World  increasing anti slavery legislation in Europe and America  and the British Royal Navy s increasing presence off the West African coast  obliged African states to adopt new economies  Between 1808 and 1860  the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1 600 slave ships and freed 150 000 Africans who were aboard  45  Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade  for example against  the usurping King of Lagos   deposed in 1851  Anti slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers  46  The largest powers of West Africa  the Asante Confederacy  the Kingdom of Dahomey  and the Oyo Empire  adopted different ways of adapting to the shift  Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of  legitimate commerce  in the form of palm oil  cocoa  timber and gold  forming the bedrock of West Africa s modern export trade  The Oyo Empire  unable to adapt  collapsed into civil wars  47  Colonialism and the  Scramble for Africa  Main article  Colonization of Africa Further information  Scramble for Africa Map of Africa in 1909  showing boundary of colonial control and location of resources Areas of Africa under the control  influence  or claimed control  of the colonial powers in 1913  along with modern borders    Belgium   Germany   Spain   France   United Kingdom   Italy   Portugal   independent In the late 19th century  the European imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent  creating many colonial territories  and leaving only two fully independent states  Ethiopia  known to Europeans as  Abyssinia    and Liberia  Egypt and Sudan were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire  however  after the British occupation of 1882  Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922  Berlin Conference The Berlin Conference held in 1884 85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups  It was convened by King Leopold II of Belgium  and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories  It sought to bring an end to the Scramble for Africa by European powers by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence  They set up the political divisions of the continent  by spheres of interest  that exist in Africa today  Independence struggles Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II  when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence  Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II  which left the major European powers weakened  In 1951  Libya  a former Italian colony  gained independence  In 1956  Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France  48 Ghana followed suit the next year  March 1957   49  becoming the first of the sub Saharan colonies to be freed  Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade  Portugal s overseas presence in Sub Saharan Africa  most notably in Angola  Cape Verde  Mozambique  Guinea Bissau and S o Tom  and Pr ncipe  lasted from the 16th century to 1975  after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon  Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965  under the white minority government of Ian Smith  but was not internationally recognised as an independent state  as Zimbabwe  until 1980  when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war  Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence  the state remained under the control of the country s white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994  Post colonial Africa Today  Africa contains 54 sovereign countries  most of which still have the borders drawn during the era of European colonialism  Since colonialism  African states have frequently been hampered by instability  corruption  violence  and authoritarianism  The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule  However  few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis  and many have instead cycled through a series of coups  producing military dictatorships  Great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups  and graft under these leaders  For political gain  many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts that had been exacerbated  or even created  by colonial rule  In many countries  the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order  and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s  During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s  Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations  Border and territorial disputes were also common  with the European imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts  Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union  as well as the policies of the International Monetary Fund  also played a role in instability  When a country became independent for the first time  it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers  Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid  while many in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States  France or both  The 1970s saw an escalation  as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union  and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by funding insurgency movements  There was a major famine in Ethiopia  when hundreds of thousands of people starved  Some claimed that Marxist Soviet policies made the situation worse  50  51  52  The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War  By 2008  this conflict and its aftermath had killed 5 4 million people  Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster  AIDS has also been a prevalent issue in post colonial Africa  In the 21st century  however  the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined  For instance  the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years  This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist style command economies and opening up for market reforms  The improved stability and economic reforms have lead to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations  mainly from China  which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries  seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline  Several African economies are among the world s fasted growing as of 2011  Geography A composite satellite image of Africa  centre  with North America  left  and Eurasia  right   to scale Main article  Geography of Africa Africa is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the Earth  Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea  it is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez  transected by the Suez Canal   163 km  101 mi  wide  53   Geopolitically  Egypt s Sinai Peninsula east of the Suez Canal is often considered part of Africa  as well   54  Biomes of Africa  From the most northerly point  Ras ben Sakka in Tunisia  37 21  N   to the most southerly point  Cape Agulhas in South Africa  34 51 15  S   is a distance of approximately 8 000 km  5 000 mi   55  from Cape Verde  17 33 22  W  the westernmost point  to Ras Hafun in Somalia  51 27 52  E  the most easterly projection  is a distance of approximately 7 400 km  4 600 mi   56  The coastline is 26 000 km  16 000 mi  long  and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is illustrated by the fact that Europe  which covers only 10 400 000 km2  4 000 000 sq mi    about a third of the surface of Africa   has a coastline of 32 000 km  20 000 mi   56  Africa s largest country is Algeria  and its smallest country is the Seychelles  an archipelago off the east coast  57  The smallest nation on the continental mainland is The Gambia  According to the ancient Romans  Africa lay to the west of Egypt  while  Asia  was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east  A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy  85 165 AD   indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa  As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent  the idea of Africa expanded with their knowledge  Geologically  Africa includes the Arabian Peninsula  the Zagros Mountains of Iran and the Anatolian Plateau of Turkey mark where the African Plate collided with Eurasia  The Afrotropic ecozone and the Saharo Arabian desert to its north unite the region biogeographically  and the Afro Asiatic language family unites the north linguistically  Climate A map of Africa showing the ecological break around the Sahara desert Main article  Climate of Africa The climate of Africa ranges from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks  Its northern half is primarily desert or arid  while its central and southern areas contain both savanna plains and very dense jungle  rainforest  regions  In between  there is a convergence where vegetation patterns such as sahel  and steppe dominate  Africa is the hottest continent on earth  drylands and deserts comprise 60  of the entire land surface  58  The record for the highest temperature recorded was set in Libya in 1922  58  C  136  F    59  Fauna Savanna at Ngorongoro Conservation Area  Tanzania Main article  Fauna of Africa Africa boasts perhaps the world s largest combination of density and  range of freedom  of wild animal populations and diversity  with wild populations of large carnivores  such as lions  hyenas  and cheetahs  and herbivores  such as buffalo  elephants  camels  and giraffes  ranging freely on primarily open non private plains  It is also home to a variety of  jungle  animals including snakes and primates and aquatic life such as crocodiles and amphibians  In addition  Africa has the largest number of megafauna species  as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna  Ecology Deforestation is affecting Africa at twice the world rate  according to the United Nations Environment Programme  UNEP   60  According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center  31  of Africa s pasture lands and 19  of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded  and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest every year  which is twice the average deforestation rate compared to the rest of the world  58  Some sources claim that deforestation has already destroyed roughly 90  of the original  virgin forests in West Africa  61  Since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago  Madagascar has lost more than 90  of its original forest  62  About 65  of Africa s agricultural land suffers from soil degradation  63  Biodiversity Africa has over 3 000 protected areas  with 198 marine protected areas  50 biosphere reserves and 80 wetlands reserves  Significant habitat destruction  increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa s biological diversity  Human encroachment  civil unrest and the introduction of non native species threatens biodiversity in Africa  This has been exacerbated by administrative problems  inadequate personnel and funding problems  58  Politics See also  List of political parties in Africa by country There are clear signs of increased networking among African organisations and states  For example  in the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  former Zaire   rather than rich  non African countries intervening  neighbouring African countries became involved  see also Second Congo War   Since the conflict began in 1998  the estimated death toll has reached 5 million  The African Union Map of the African Union with suspended states highlighted in light green  Main article  African Union The African Union  AU  is a 54 member federation consisting of all of Africa s states except Morocco  The union was formed  with Addis Ababa  Ethiopia as its headquarters  on 26 June 2001  The union was officially established on 9 July 2002 64  as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity  OAU   In July 2004  the African Union s Pan African Parliament  PAP  was relocated to Midrand  in South Africa  but the African Commission on Human and Peoples  Rights remained in Addis Ababa  There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation s institutions so that they are shared by all the states  The African Union  not to be confused with the AU Commission  is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union  which aims to transform the African Economic Community  a federated commonwealth  into a state under established international conventions  The African Union has a parliamentary government  known as the African Union Government  consisting of legislative  judicial and executive organs  It is led by the African Union President and Head of State  who is also the President of the Pan African Parliament  A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP  and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP  The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan African Parliament  as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties  including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat  AU Commission  to the PAP  The government of the AU consists of all union  federal   regional  state  and municipal authorities  as well as hundreds of institutions  that together manage the day to day affairs of the institution  Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co operation and peace between the continent s many countries  Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa  often under the oversight of the state  Most of such violations occur for political reasons  often as a side effect of civil war  Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Sierra Leone  Liberia  Sudan  Zimbabwe  and C te d Ivoire  A clickable Euler diagram showing

Community  Main article  Economy of Africa See also  Economy of the African Union Although it has abundant natural resources  Africa remains the world s poorest and most underdeveloped continent  the result of a variety of causes that may include the spread of deadly diseases and viruses  notably HIV AIDS and malaria   corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations  failed central planning  high levels of illiteracy  lack of access to foreign capital  and frequent tribal and military conflict  ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide   65  According to the United Nations  Human Development Report in 2003  the bottom 25 ranked nations  151st to 175th  were all African  66  Poverty  illiteracy  malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation  as well as poor health  affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent  In August 2008  the World Bank 67  announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of  1 25 per day  versus the previous measure of  1 00   80 5  of the Sub Saharan Africa population was living on less than  2 50  PPP  a day in 2005  compared with 85 7  for India  68  The Casablanca Twin Center shopping complex in Casablanca  Morocco  The new figures confirm that sub Saharan Africa has been the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty   1 25 per day   some 50  of the population living in poverty in 1981  200 million people   a figure that rose to 58  in 1996 before dropping to 50  in 2005  380 million people   The average poor person in sub Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day  and was poorer in 2003 than he or she was in 1973  69  indicating increasing poverty in some areas  Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programs spearheaded by foreign companies and governments  but other studies and reports have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors  70  71  72  From 1995 to 2005  Africa s rate of economic growth increased  averaging 5  in 2005  Some countries experienced still higher growth rates  notably Angola  Sudan and Equatorial Guinea  all three of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity  The continent is believed to hold 90  of the world s cobalt  90  of its platinum  50  of its gold  98  of its chromium  70  of its tantalite  73  64  of its manganese and one third of its uranium  74  The Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC  has 70  of the world s coltan  and most mobile phones in the world are made with elements refined from this mineral  The DRC also has more than 30  of the world s diamond reserves  75 Guinea is the world s largest exporter of bauxite  76  As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture  it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels  In fact  the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis has pushed back 100 million people into food insecurity  77  In recent years  the People s Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations  In 2007  Chinese companies invested a total of US 1 billion in Africa  78  A Harvard University study showed that Africa could easily feed itself  if only it had decent governance  79  Demographics Main articles  African people and Demographics of Africa Woman from Benin Africa s population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years  and consequently  it is relatively young  In some African states  half or more of the population is under 25 years of age  80  The total number of people in Africa grew from 221 million in 1950 to 1 billion in 2009  81  82  San Bushman man from Botswana Speakers of Bantu languages  part of the Niger Congo family  are the majority in southern  central and southeast Africa  The Bantu speaking farmers from West Africa s inland savanna progressively expanded over most of Sub Saharan Africa  83  But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa  the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast  and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan   San  or  Bushmen   and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa  respectively  Bantu speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea  and are found in parts of southern Cameroon  In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa  the distinct people known as the Bushmen  also  San   closely related to  but distinct from  Hottentots   have long been present  The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa  Pygmies are the pre Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa  84  The peoples of West Africa primarily speak Niger Congo languages  belonging mostly  though not exclusively  to its non Bantu branches  though some Nilo Saharan and Afro Asiatic speaking groups are also found  The Niger Congo speaking Yoruba  Igbo  Fulani  Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential  In the central Sahara  Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant  and in east Central Africa Nilo Saharan speaking groups such as the Zaghawa  Baya  Kanuri and Sao predominate  Chadic speaking groups  including the Hausa  are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara  Berber boys from the Atlas Mountains The peoples of North Africa comprise three main groups  Berbers in the northwest  Egyptians and Libyans in northeast  and Nilo Saharan speaking peoples in the east  The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa  The Semitic Phoenicians  who founded Carthage  and Hyksos  the Indo Iranian Alans  the Indo  European Greeks  Romans and Vandals settled in North Africa as well  Berbers still make up the majority in Morocco  while they are a significant minority within Algeria  They are also present in Tunisia and Libya  85  The Berber speaking Tuareg and other often nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa  In Mauritania  there are small communities of Berber speaking peoples in the north and Niger Congo speaking peoples in the south  though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates  In Sudan  although Arabic and Arab culture predominates  it is mostly inhabited by originally Nilo Saharan speaking groups such as the Nubians  Nuba  Fur and Zaghawa who over the centuries have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula  Small communities of Afro Asiatic speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan  Beja bedouins from Northeast Africa In the Horn of Africa  some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups  like the Amhara and Tigrayans  collectively known as Habesha  speak languages from the Semitic branch of the Afro Asiatic language family  while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro Asiatic  Afrikaner Trekboers in the Karoo of South Africa Prior to the decolonization movements of the post World War II era  Europeans were represented in every part of Africa  86  Decolonisation during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of European descended settlers out of Africa   especially from Algeria and Morocco  1 6 million pieds noirs in North Africa   87  Kenya  Congo  88  Rhodesia  Mozambique and Angola  89  By the end of 1977  more than one million Portuguese were thought to have returned from Africa  90  Nevertheless  White Africans remain an important minority in many African states  particularly South Africa  Zimbabwe  Namibia and R union  91  The African country with the largest White African population is South Africa  92  The Afrikaners  the Anglo Africans  of British origin  and the Coloureds are the largest European descended groups in Africa today  European colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians  particularly people from the Indian subcontinent  to British colonies  Large Indian communities are found in South Africa  and smaller ones are present in Kenya  Tanzania  and some other southern and East African countries  The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972  though many have since returned  The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin  often mixed with Africans and Europeans  The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people  but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu  Arab  Indian and European origins  Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds  people with origins in two or more races and continents   During the 20th century  small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese 78  have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa  respectively  93  Languages Main article  Languages of Africa Map showing the distribution of the various language families of Africa  By most estimates  well over a thousand languages  UNESCO has estimated around two thousand  are spoken in Africa  94  Most are of African origin  though some are of European or Asian origin  Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world  and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages  but one or more European ones as well  There are four major language families indigenous to Africa  The Afro Asiatic languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the Horn of Africa  North Africa  the Sahel  and Southwest Asia  The Nilo Saharan language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people  Nilo Saharan languages are spoken by tribes in Chad  Ethiopia  Kenya  Sudan  South Sudan  Uganda  and northern Tanzania  The Niger Congo language family covers much of Sub Saharan Africa and is probably the largest language family in the world in terms of different languages  The Khoisan languages number about fifty and are spoken in Southern Africa by approximately 120 000 people  Many of the Khoisan languages are endangered  The Khoi and San peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa  Following the end of colonialism  nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent  although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages  such as Swahili  Yoruba  Igbo and Hausa   In numerous countries  English and French  see African French  are used for communication in the public sphere such as government  commerce  education and the media  Arabic  Portuguese  Afrikaans  Malagasy and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa  and that are used by millions of Africans today  both in the public and private spheres  Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in Africa  Prior to World War I  German was used in certain areas also  Culture The rock hewn Church of Saint George in Lalibela  Ethiopia is a UNESCO World Heritage Site  Main article  Culture of Africa Some which   aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practiced in recent years as a result of years of neglect and suppression by colonial and post colonial regimes  There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalourise African traditional cultures  under such movements as the African Renaissance  led by Thabo Mbeki  Afrocentrism  led by a group of scholars  including Molefi Asante  as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality  In recent years  traditional African culture has become synonymous with rural poverty and subsistence farming  Visual art and architecture African art and architecture reflect the diversity of African cultures  The oldest existing examples of art from Africa are 82 000 year old beads made from Nassarius shells that were found in the Aterian levels at Grotte des Pigeons  Taforalt  Morocco  citation needed  The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt was the world s tallest structure for 4 000 years  until the completion of Lincoln Cathedral around the year 1300  The stone ruins of Great Zimbabwe are also noteworthy for their architecture  and the complexity of monolithic churches at Lalibela  Ethiopia  of which the Church of Saint George is representative  citation needed  A musician from South Africa Music and dance Main article  Music of Africa The Namibia rugby team Egypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world  while remembrance of the rhythms of sub Saharan Africa  in particular West Africa  was transmitted through the Atlantic slave trade to modern samba  blues  jazz  reggae  hip hop  and rock  The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of Afrobeat and Highlife music  Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous  dominated by the music of the Democratic Republic of Congo  Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions  and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of North Africa and Southern Africa  Arab influences are visible in North African music and dance and  in Southern Africa  Western influences are apparent due to colonisation  Sports Fifty three African countries have football  soccer  teams in the Confederation of African Football  while Cameroon  Nigeria  Senegal  and Ghana have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups  South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup tournament  becoming the first African country to do so  According to FIFA ranking  Egypt currently has the best soccer team in Africa  Their team has won the African Cup 7 times  and a record making 3 times in a row  Cricket is popular in some African nations  South Africa and Zimbabwe have Test status  while Kenya is the leading non test team in One Day International cricket and has attained permanent One Day International status  The three countries jointly hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup  Namibia is the other African country to have played in a World Cup  Morocco in northern Africa has also hosted the 2002 Morocco Cup  but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament  Rugby is a popular sport in South Africa and Namibia  Religion A map showing religious distribution in Africa  The Great Mosque of Kairouan  erected in 670  is the oldest mosque in North Africa  95 Kairouan  Tunisia  Main article  Religion in Africa Africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs 96  and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are too sensitive a topic for governments with mixed populations  97  According to the World Book Encyclopedia  Islam is the largest religion in Africa  followed by Christianity  However  according to Encyclop dia Britannica  45  of the population are Christians  40  are Muslims and less than 15  continue to follow traditional African religions  A small number of Africans are Hindu  Baha i  or have beliefs from the Judaic tradition  Examples of African Jews are the Beta Israel  Lemba peoples and the Abayudaya of Eastern Uganda  There is also a small minority of Africans who are non religious
