the Iranian speaking Medes and Achaemenids  In the Zoroastrian Avesta  Widewdat  i  15  Ragha is mentioned as the twelfth sacred place created by Ahura Mazda  19  In the Old Persian inscriptions  Behistun 2  10 18   Ragha appears as a province  From Ragha  Darius the Great sent reinforcements to his father Wishtaspa when the latter was putting down the rebellion in Parthia  Behistun 3  1 10   19 Damavand mountain located near the city also appears in the Shahnama as the place where Freydun bounds the dragon fiend Zahak  In the Persian mytho logical and legendary events  20  Kay mar   the Zoroastrian prototype of human beings and the first king in the Shahnama  was said to have resided in Dam vand  20  In these legends  the foundation of the city of Damavand was attributed to him  20 Arash  the archer who sacrificed his body by giving all his strength to the arrow that demarcated Iran and Turan  shot his arrow from Mount Dam vand  20  This Persian legend was celebrated every year in the Tiregan festival  A popular feast is reported to have been held in the city of Damavand on 7  aww l 1230 31 August 1815  during which the people celebrated the anniversary of Zahhaks death  20  In the Zoroastrian legends  the tyrant Zahak is to finally be killed by the Iranian hero Gar  sp before the final days  20  In some Middle Persian texts  Ray  Ragha  is given as the birthplace of Zoroaster 21  although modern historians generally place the birth of Zoraster in Greater Khorasan  In one Persian tradition  the legendary king Man  ehr was born in Damavand  20  During the Sassanid era  Yazdegerd III in 641 issued from Rayy his last appeal to the nation before fleeing to Khorasan  19  The sanctuary of Bibi Shahr Banu situated in modern Tehran spur and accessible only to women is associated with the memory of the daughter of Yazdagird who  according to tradition  became the wife of al Husayn b  Ali  the third Shi ite Imam  19  Rayy was the fief of the Persian Mihran family and Siyawakhsh the son of Mihran the son of Bahram Chubin resisted the Arab invasion  19  Due to this resistance  when the Arabs captured Rayy  they ordered the town to be destroyed and ordered Farrukhan b  Zaynabi b  Kula to rebuilt the town  19  In the 10th century  Rayy is described in detail in the work of Islamic geographers  19  Despite the interest of Baghdad displayed in Rayy  the number of Arabs there was insignificant  and the population consisted of Persians of all classes  19  22  The Ghuzz Turks laid Rayy to waste in 1035 and in 1042  but the city recovered during the Saljuqid and Khwarazmian era  19  The Mongols laid Rayy to complete waste and according to Islamc historians of the era  virtually all of its inhabitants were massacared  19  The city is mentioned in later Safavid chronicles 19  as an unimportant city  The origin of the name Tehran is unknown  23  Tehran was well known as a village in the 9th century  but was less well known than the city of Rhages  Ray  which was flourishing nearby in the early era  Najm al Din Razi known as Dayya gives the population of Rayy as 500 000 before the Mongol invasion  In the 13th century  following the destruction of Ray by Mongols  many of its inhabitants escaped to Tehran  In some sources of the early era  the city is mentioned as  Rhages s Tehran    The city is later mentioned in Hamdollah Mostowfi s Nuz hat al Qulub  written in 1340  as a famous village  There is also a shrine there  dedicated to commemorate Princess Shahr Banu  eldest daughter of the last ruler of the Sassanid Empire  She gave birth to Ali Zayn al Abidin  the fourth holy Imam of the Shia faith  This was through her marriage to Husayn ibn Ali  the grandson of Muhammad  the prophet of Islam  A nearby mountain is also named after her  However  some sources attribute the shrine to the goddess of water and fertility  Anahita  claiming it was renamed in Islamic times to protect it from any possible harm after the conversion of Iranians to Islam  Don Ruy Gonz les de Clavijo  a Castilian ambassador  was probably the first European to visit Tehran  stopping in July 1404  while on a journey to Samarkand  now in Uzbekistan  the capital of Timur  who ruled Iran at the time  At this time  the city of Tehran was unwalled  In the early of 18th century  Karim Khan Zand ordered a palace  and a government office to be built in Tehran  possibly to declare the city his capital  but later moved his government to Shiraz  Tehran finally became the capital of Iran in 1795  when the Qajar king Agha Mohammad Khan was crowned in the city  It remains the capital to this day  In the 1920s and 30s  the city essentially was started from scratch under the rule of the Shah of Iran  Reza Shah Pahlavi  Reza Shah believed that ancient buildings such as large parts of the Golestan Palace  Takieh ye Dowlat  the Toopkhaneh Square  the city fortifications and the old citadel among others should not be part of a modern city  They were systematically destroyed and modern buildings with pre islamic Iranian style  such as the National Bank  Police Headquarter  Telegraph Office and Military Academy were built in their place  The Tehran Bazaar was divided in half and many historic buildings were destroyed in order to build wide straight avenues in the capital  Many examples of Persian Gardens also became targets to new construction projects  During World War II  Soviet and British troops entered the city  Tehran was the site of the Tehran Conference in 1943  attended by U S  President Franklin D  Roosevelt  Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin  and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill  In the 1960s and 70s Tehran was rapidly developing under the reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi  Modern buildings altered the face of Tehran and ambitious projects were envisioned for the following decades  The majority of these projects were continued after the Islamic revolution in 1979 when Tehran s urbanization had reached its peak  and the new government started many other new projects like Milad Tower  During the 1980 88 Iran Iraq War  Tehran was the scene of repeated Scud missile attacks and air strikes   edit  Climate View of Mount Damavand as seen from the Dizin ski resort  Tehran features a semi arid  continental climate  K ppen climate classification BSk   Tehran s climate is largely defined by its geographic location  with the towering Alborz Mountains to its north and the central desert to the south  It can be generally described as mild in the spring and autumn  hot and dry in the summer  and cold in the winter  As a large city with a significant differences in elevation among various districts  the weather is often cooler in the hilly north as compared to the flat southern part of Tehran  Summer is usually hot and dry with very little rain  but relative humidity is generally low and the nights are cool  The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs from late autumn to mid spring  but no one month is particularly wet  The hottest month is July  mean minimum temperature 26 C  mean maximum temperature 36 C  and the coldest is January  mean minimum temperature  1 C  mean maximum temperature 8 C   24  Although compared with other parts of the country Tehran enjoys a more moderate climate  weather conditions can sometimes be unpredictably harsh  The record high temperature is 43 C and the record low is  15 C  On January 5  amp  6  2008  after years of relatively little snow  a wave of heavy snow and low temperatures shocked the city covering it in a thick layer of snow and ice  forcing the Council of Ministers to officially declare a state of emergency and calling the following two days  January 6 and 7  off for the capital  25  Tehran has seen an increase in the relative humidity and annual precipitation in the last ten years  This is most likely because of the afforestation projects which also includes expanding parks and lakes  The northern parts of Tehran are still more lush than the southern parts  Tehran s climate can be described to have some monsoon influences  the summers and winters are very dry and the spring and fall are rather lush with the main precipitation occuring at this time  Climate data for Tehran Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high  C   F  19 6  67 3  23  73  28  82  32 4  90 3  37  99  41  106  43

population of approximately 7 8 million in 2006  27  With its cosmopolitan atmosphere  Tehran is home to diverse ethnic and linguistics groups from all over the country and represents the ethnic linguistic composition of Iran  though with a different percentage   The native language of the city is the Tehrani accent of Persian and the majority of people in Tehran identify themselves as Persian  16  28  Minority groups include Azeri  Kurds  Arab  Baluch  Armenian  Bakhtiari  Assyrian  Talysh  etc  According to a 2010 census conducted by the Sociology Department of Tehran University

Persian  67  identify themselves as ethnic Persian  13  understand to some level some European languages  29  Tehran saw a drastic change in its ethno social composition in the early 1980s  Following the political  social and economic consequences of the Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979 and onwards  many Iranian citizens  mostly Tehranis  left Iran due to mounting political  social and most importantly religious pressure  Many Iranians moved to countries such as Canada  the United States  France  Sweden and other European countries  The highest Iranian emigration has been to the United States  France and Canada  With the start of the Iran Iraq War  1980 1988  following an Iraqi invasion  a second wave of inhabitants fled the city  especially during Iraqi air offensive on the capital  With most major powers backing Iraq at that time  economic isolation caused even more reasons for the inhabitants to leave the city  and the country   Having left all they had and having struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life  most of them never came back when the war was over  During the war  Tehran also received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering Iraq  The unstable situation and the war in neighboring Afghanistan and Iraq prompted a rush of refugees into the country who came in millions  with Tehran being a magnet for modest workers who helped the city to recover from war wounds  charging far less than local construction workers  Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of UNHCR but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave  being pessimistic about the situation in their respective country of origin  Afghan refugees are mostly Persian speaking Hazara or Tajiks  speaking a dialect of Persian  and Iraqi refugees  who are mainly Shia Islam Mesopotamian Arabic speakers of Iranian origin  The majority of Tehranis are believed to be moderate followers of Twelver Shia Islam which is also the state religion but it cannot be confirmed independently for lack of independent statistics  Religious minorities include followers of various sects of Sunni Islam  Mystic Islam  Zoroastrianism  Judaism  Christianity  including the adherents of the Assyrian Church of the East  Armenian Apostolic Church  Roman Catholic Church  Chaldean Catholic Church  Iranian Protestant churches like Jama at e Rabbani  Assemblies of God   Armenian Evangelical Church  Armenian Brotherhood Church  Russian Orthodox Church  and the Presbyterian Church  and some from the Bah    Faith  Despite being the seat of a theological government and the fact that most important religious unions and academies of the country are based in Tehran  half of the city

Iran Tehran suffers from severe air pollution and the city is often covered by smog making breathing difficult and causing widespread pulmonary illnesses  It is estimated that about 27 people die each day from pollution related diseases  42  According to local officials  3 600 people died in a single month due to the hazardous air quality  43  80  of the city s pollution is due to cars  44  The remaining 20  is due to industrial pollution  Other estimates suggest that motorcycles alone account for 30  of air and 50  of sound pollution in Tehran  45  In 2007 Iran imposed fuel rations but the plan has met little success in reducing the pollution levels  In 2011  with the improvements in the public transport system and the rise in fuel prices due to the new subsidies reform plan  the Government is hoping to be able to improve the problems of pollution and traffic  46  The air pollution is due to several different reasons  Economical  most Iranian industries are located on the outskirts of Tehran  The city is also overrun with old and aging cars which do not meet today s emission regulations  Furthermore  Iran s busiest airport  Mehrabad International Airport  is located in the west of the city  Most people are then obliged to either use private cars or hire taxis  This has created severe traffic congestion  Geographical  Tehran is bound in the north by the massive Alborz mountain range that is stopping the flow of the humid Caspian wind  As a result  thermal inversion that traps Tehran s polluted air is frequently observed  The lack of humidity and clouds makes Tehran a very sunny city  The UV radiations then combined with the existing pollutants significantly raise the level of the ozone  In fact one of the urban landmarks in central Tehran is a giant air quality gauge  47  Furthermore  the reportedly poor quality of Iranian manufactured gasoline may also be contributing to the pollution  48  The government  however  is engaged in a battle to reduce the air pollution  It has for instance encouraged taxis and buses to convert from petrol engines to engines that run on compressed natural gas  Furthermore  since 1979 the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has set up a  Traffic Zone               covering the city center during peak traffic hours  Entering and driving inside this zone is only allowed with a special permit  The government is also trying to raise people s awareness about the hazards of the pollution  One method that is currently being employed is the installation of Pollution Indicator Boards all around the city to monitor the current level of particulate matter  PM10   nitrogen dioxide  NO2   ozone  O3   sulfur dioxide  SO2   and carbon monoxide  CO   The board also displays the Pollutant Standards Index  PSI   which is a general indication of air quality based on the measurements of the above mentioned five pollutants  The Pollution Indicator Boards classify the level of each pollutants as either safe  hazardous or dangerous   edit  Education and research See also  Education in Iran  List of colleges and universities in Tehran  and Science in Iran Tehran is the largest and most
