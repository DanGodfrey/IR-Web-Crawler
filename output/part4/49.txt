born in West Bromwich  West Midlands  England where along with his parents  Frank and Nelsie  he lived with his maternal grandmother  2  While living there  he was first exposed to the American superheroes that would dominate his professional life through reruns of American programs such as The Adventures of Superman  In Britain  he was able to read domestic comics such as Eagle as well as reprints of DC Comics  3  When he was eight years old he left England with his parents and moved to Canada  According to Byrne himself  he was not an academically gifted student  His first encounter with Marvel Comics was in 1962 with Stan Lee and Jack Kirby s Fantastic Four  5  4  He later commented that  the book had an  edge  like nothing DC was putting out at the time   5  Jack Kirby s work in particular had a strong influence on Byrne and he has worked with many of the characters Kirby created or co created  Besides Kirby  Byrne was also influenced by the naturalistic style of Neal Adams  In 1970  Byrne enrolled at the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary  He created the superhero parody Gay Guy for the college newspaper  which poked fun at the campus stereotype of homosexuality among art students  Gay Guy is also notable for featuring a prototype of the Alpha Flight character Snowbird  While there  he also published his first comic book  ACA Comix  1  featuring  The Death s Head Knight   6  Byrne left the college in 1973 without graduating  He broke into comics with a  Fan Art Gallery  piece in Marvel s promotional publication FOOM in early 1974 7  and by illustrating a two page story by writer Al Hewetson for Skywald Publications  black and white horror magazine Nightmare No  20  August 1974   He then began freelancing for Charlton Comics  making his color comics debut with the E Man backup feature  Rog 2000   starring a robot character he d created in the mid 1970s that colleagues Roger Stern and Bob Layton named and began using for spot illustrations in their fanzine CPL  Contemporary Pictorial Literature   A Rog 2000 story written by Stern  with art by Byrne and Layton  had gotten the attention of Charlton Comics editor Nicola Cuti  who extended Byrne an invitation  Written by Cuti   Rog 2000  became one of several alternating backup features in the Charlton Comics superhero series E Man  starting with the eight page  That Was No Lady  in issue No  6  Jan  1975   Byrne went on to work on the Charlton books Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch  Space  1999  and Emergency   and co created with writer Joe Gill the post apocalyptic science fiction series Doomsday   1  Byrne additionally drew a cover for the supernatural anthology The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves No  54  Dec  1975    edit  Marvel Comics Byrne s first story for Marvel Comics was  Dark Asylum   plotted by Tony Isabella and written by David Anthony Kraft   published in Giant Size Dracula No  5  June 1975   8  He began drawing Marvel s lower selling titles  including Iron Fist  The Champions  and Marvel Team Up  For many issues  he was paired with writer Chris Claremont  with whom he also teamed up for some issues of the black and white Marvel magazine Marvel Preview featuring Star Lord  The Star Lord story was inked by Terry Austin  who soon after teamed up with Claremont and Byrne on X Men  Cover to The Uncanny X Men No  135  July 1980   by Byrne  amp  Terry Austin   edit  The Uncanny X Men Byrne joined Claremont beginning with The X Men No  108  Dec  1977   Their work together  along with inker Terry Austin  on such classic story arcs as the  Dark Phoenix Saga    Days of Future Past   and  Proteus  would make them both fan favorites  and X Men became one of the industry s best selling titles  In addition  Byrne insisted that the title keep its Canadian character  Wolverine  and contributed a series of story elements to justify his presence that eventually made the character among the most popular in Marvel s publishing history  Byrne has repeatedly compared his working relationship with Claremont to Gilbert and Sullivan  and has said that they were  almost constantly at war over who the characters were   9  After more than three years on Uncanny X Men  during which time he created the character Kitty Pryde Shadowcat  10  Byrne left the title with issue No  143  Mar  1981    edit  The Avengers During the course of 1979   while serving as the regular penciller of X Men   Byrne displayed his versatility by also taking on penciling duties for the Avengers  Working for the most part with writer David Michelinie  Byrne drew issues  181 191 of the Marvel team title   edit  Captain America In the early 1980s  Byrne worked on a number of other Marvel books  His nine issue run   247 255  1980 1981  with writer Roger Stern on Captain America included an issue   250  in which the character mulled a run for the U S  presidency  11  an idea originally developed by Roger McKenzie and Don Perlin  Stern  in his capacity as editor of the title  had originally rejected the idea but later changed his mind about the concept  12  13  McKenzie and Perlin received credit for the idea on the letters page at Stern s insistence  14  Fantastic Four No  232  July 1981   Byrne s debut as writer artist  Cover art by Byrne and inker Terry Austin  edit  Fantastic Four Byrne s most important post X Men body of work at Marvel was his five year run on Fantastic Four   232 293  1981 1986   considered by many to be a  second Golden Age  15  on that title  Byrne said his goal was to  turn the clock back       get back and see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception   16  He also made a number of significant changes to the title  the Thing was replaced as a member of the quartet by the She Hulk  while the Thing had adventures in his own comic  also written by Byrne   and his longtime girlfriend Alicia Masters left him for his teammate the Human Torch  the Invisible Girl was developed into the most powerful member with her heightened control of her refined powers and the self confident assertiveness to use it epitomized by her name change to the Invisible Woman  and the Baxter Building  their headquarters  was destroyed and replaced with Four Freedoms Plaza  Byrne has cited multiple reasons for leaving the book  including  internal office politics  5  and that  it simply started to get old   17   edit  Alpha Flight In 1983   while still at the helm of Fantastic Four   Marvel persuaded Byrne to write and draw Alpha Flight  a Canadian superhero team who were first introduced  merely to survive a fight with the X Men   5  For more than two years  from 1983 to 1985  Byrne penciled and wrote every issue of both titles  Alpha Flight was initially very popular  its first issue sold 500 000 copies   but Byrne has said the book  was never much fun   and that he considered the characters two dimensional  5  One of Alpha Flight s characters  Northstar  eventually became Marvel s first openly gay superhero  Though intended by Byrne to be gay from the beginning  18  Northstar s homosexuality was only hinted at during Byrne s tenure on the book   edit  The Incredible Hulk In 1985  after issue No  28 of Alpha Flight  Byrne swapped books with Bill Mantlo  writer of The Incredible Hulk  According to Byrne  he discussed his ideas with editor in chief Jim Shooter ahead of time  but once Byrne was on the book  Shooter objected to them  5  Byrne only wrote and drew six issues   314 319  of The Incredible Hulk   edit  DC  edit  The Untold Legend of the Batman In early 1980  Byrne did his first work for DC Comics  penciling the first issue of The Untold Legend of the Batman mini series  19  Byrne had always wanted to draw Batman  and had a three month window of time during which he was not under contract to Marvel  20  Hearing about the Untold Legend series  Byrne contacted editor Paul Levitz to express interest  DC took him up on his offer  but it wasn t until the second month of his three month window that Byrne received the plot for the first issue  Byrne told Levitz that he would not be able to finish the project due to time constraints despite DC then allegedly offering Byrne double his Marvel pay rate  after initially saying they could not match his Marvel rate  20  Nonetheless  Byrne penciled the first issue  which was inked by Jim Aparo after being intended for Terry Austin  20  This experience soured Byrne on DC for quite some time  20   edit  Superman Near the end of his time at Marvel  Byrne was hired by DC Comics to revamp its flagship character Superman  21  This was part of a company wide restructuring of the history of the DC Universe and all of its characters following the limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths  Byrne s reworking of Superman in particular gained widespread media coverage outside the comic book industry  including articles in Time and The New York Times  The Man of Steel  1  July 1986  At the time  Byrne said   I m taking Superman back to the basics     It s basically Siegel and Shuster s Superman meets the Fleischer Superman in 1986   22  Byrne significantly reduced Superman s powers  though he was still one of the most powerful beings on Earth   eliminated the Fortress of Solitude  Krypto  and had his foster parents the Kents still alive while Superman was an adult to enjoy their adopted son s triumphs as well as to provide him with support  grounding  and advice whenever he needed it  Byrne did away with the childhood teenage career as Superboy  in Byrne s revamped history  Clark Kent does not put on a costume and become a super hero until he s an adult  In the Superman mythos  Byrne wrote Clark Kent as having a more aggressive and extroverted personality than previously depicted  even making him a top high school football player  Byrne did his part to come up with explanations for how Superman s disguise works  such as the public simply does not realize that he has a secret identity since he is unmasked  that Superman would vibrate his face via his super speed in order to blur his image to photographers  and having Kent keep a weight training set around to explain how the human and presumably weaker Kent could have a frame as massive as Superman s  Byrne s Superman felt that his deepest roots were on Earth  and that his home planet of  Krypton is anathema to him   22  Byrne s version of Superman debuted in the six issue miniseries The Man of Steel  which described his origin and early career  Byrne penciled the 6 issue DC Universe crossover mini series Legends  November 1986   May 1987  during this time  23  Byrne wrote and drew two monthly Superman titles with the hero s present day adventures  a new Superman title beginning with issue No  1  January 1987  24  and Action Comics  in which  beginning with issue  584  Superman teamed up with another hero or group  The original Superman book was renamed Adventures of Superman starting with issue No  424 and was initially written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by Jerry Ordway  but the writing chores were taken over by Byrne after a year  from issues  436 442  and 444   As 1988 marked the 50th anniversary year of Superman s creation  Byrne managed to do more Superman related projects while working on the core Superman monthly titles at the same time  he wrote the prestige format graphic novel  Superman  The Earth Stealers  while writing three separate four issue mini series  The World of Krypton  The World of Metropolis  and The World of Smallville  He supplied the cover art for the March 14  1988 issue of Time magazine 25  and an interior spread which featured Superman  where his pencils were inked by Jerry Ordway  Byrne spent about two years on the Superman titles before leaving  He cited the lack of  conscious support  for his work from DC Comics and the fact that the version of Superman that the company licensed for merchandise was different from his version in the comic books as the reasons for his dissatisfaction  5   edit  Return to Marvel  edit  Star Brand In 1986  Marvel began publication of a new line of superhero titles created by then Editor in Chief Jim Shooter  which took place in a continuum removed from the Marvel Universe proper  called the New Universe  In 1987  the New Universe line saw a revamp under new Editor in Chief Tom DeFalco  and Byrne took over writing and art breakdowns on the line s flagship title  Star Brand  renamed The Star Brand during Byrne s term on the book   Byrne s run started with issue No  11 and continued until the series  cancellation eight issues later upon Marvel s discontinuation of the New Universe line   edit  Avengers West Coast In 1989  after leaving Superman  Byrne returned to work on a number of titles for Marvel Comics  His work on West Coast Avengers  issues 42 57  soon renamed Avengers West Coast  was contingent on his being allowed to do what he called  my Vision story   5 The Vision was a long standing Marvel superhero and member of The Avengers  an android originally created by the villain Ultron constructed with the body of the original Human Torch  The Vision went on to join the team  marry his teammate the Scarlet Witch  and father two children by her  Byrne radically changed this  revealing that Ultron lied about the Vision s creation  The android Human Torch was found and joined the WCA  The Vision was disassembled and stripped of his emotions  The couple s twins were revealed to be pieces of the soul of the demon Master Pandemonium  In addition to these changes  Byrne s run is remembered for the introduction of the Great Lakes Avengers  an eclectic group of new superheroes   edit  The Sensational She Hulk During She Hulk s tenure with the Fantastic Four  she appeared in Marvel Graphic Novel No  18 in November 1985  titled The Sensational She Hulk  which Byrne also wrote and illustrated  On the request of editor Mark Gruenwald  Byrne wrote and drew a new series in 1989  The Sensational She Hulk  maintaining the 1985 graphic novel s title   Gruenwald directed that it be significantly different from the character s 1970s series  The Savage She Hulk  26  Byrne s take was comedic and the She Hulk  who was aware she was in a comic book  regularly broke the fourth wall  developing a love hate relationship with her artist writer by criticizing his storylines  drawing style  character development  etc  Byrne left the book after writing and drawing the first eight issues  Byrne was asked for input on writer Dwayne McDuffie s She Hulk  Ceremony graphic novel  and according to Byrne  most of his objections to the story and notations of errors were ignored  and his editor  Bobbie Chase   was rewriting my stuff to bring it into line with  the story in Ceremony  Upon complaining to DeFalco  Byrne says he was fired from his series  26  He later returned to write and draw issues  31 50 under new editor Ren e Witterstaetter   edit  Iron Man Byrne took over writing Iron Man   258 277   drawn by John Romita Jr  and later by Paul Ryan  Byrne launched a second  Armor Wars  story arc  restored the Mandarin as a major Iron Man nemesis  and featured the 1950s  pre superhero Marvel  monster Fin Fang Foom   edit  Namor  the Sub Mariner Byrne also started a new series  Namor  the Sub Mariner  Byrne s take on the undersea antihero Namor cast him as the head of a surface company  Oracle  Inc   in order to help keep the ocean unpolluted  and had Namor involved in corporate intrigue  Byrne wrote and drew the book for 25 issues  until new artist Jae Lee inspired a sharp change in the mood and plot of the book  Byrne wrote the book until  32   edit  Creator owned works In the early 1990s  Byrne began creating a series of original  creator owned works for publisher Dark Horse Comics  This was during a general trend in the industry for established creators working for Marvel and DC to bring their original works to other publishers or create their own companies to publish the works themselves  one prominent example is Image Comics   A number of these creators  including Byrne  Frank Miller  Mike Mignola  and Art Adams  banded together to form the Legend imprint at Dark Horse  Byrne s first title for Dark Horse was Next Men  a work he considered darker and more realistic than his previous work  The Next Men were five young people who were the product of a secret government experiment  Byrne said   I thought I would see what I could do with superheroes in the  real world    and   e xplore the impact their existence would have   5  Byrne s other Dark Horse titles were Babe  and Danger Unlimited  an all age readers book about a team of heroes in the future fighting an alien occupation of Earth  The Next Men lasted until issue 30 in 1994  when Byrne ended the series  intending to return  in no more than six months   However  Byrne says he  did not count on   the virtual collapse of the whole comic book industry  which seemed to occur at just the time I put Next Men on the shelf   In the present  very depressed marketplace  I don t feel Next Men would have much chance  so I leave the book hibernating until such time as the market improves   5  IDW  an idependent publisher  revived John Byrne s Next Men in 2010 following a series of trade paperbacks that collected the first series  The original storyline that had a cliffhanger ending in 1995 was continued   edit  Later career In later years  Byrne has worked on titles for Marvel  DC  and other publishers  including the 1992 prestige format graphic novel Green Lantern  Ganthet s Tale with science fiction author Larry Niven at DC  In 1990  Byrne wrote and drew a Batman 3 D graphic novel with 3 D effects by Ray Zone  27  He returned to the X Men franchise at Marvel from 1991 to 1992  succeeding longtime writer Chris Claremont  who left after 17 years working on the various X Men related titles  Byrne s return as the new writer was brief  as he only wrote Uncanny X Men   281 285 and 288 with artist Whilce Portacio  and X Men  vol  2    4 5 with artist Jim Lee  He wrote and drew another of DC s signature series  the long running Wonder Woman  from 1995 1998  During that time  he relegated the superheroine to the status of observer in many issues by killing the character 28  who then ascended to Mount Olympus as the Goddess of Truth  Byrne then spotlighted supporting characters such as Queen Hippolyta in their own adventures but restored the series  status quo in his last issue  29  He additionally took over New Gods vol  4 at the end of 1996  as writer artist of issues  12 15  continuing with it as the series was rebooted with a new No  1 as Jack Kirby s Fourth World  That ran 20 issues from 1997 to 1998  During his tenure on the New Gods  Byrne was writer of the four issue comic book mini series crossover Genesis  a storyline published weekly by DC Comics in August 1997  The series was drawn by Ron Wagner and Joe Rubinstein  Byrne wrote a Wonder Woman prose novel  Wonder Woman  Gods and Goddesses  1997  Prima Lifestyles  ISBN 0 7615 0483 4   In the series Spider Man  Chapter One  Byrne sought to retell some of Spider Man s earliest adventures  changing some key aspects  In late 1998  Byrne became writer of the flagship series  The Amazing Spider Man  at the end of the series with issue  440  by which time Marvel had decided to relaunch the book  The  last  issue of The Amazing Spider Man was No  441  November 1998   with Marvel re initiating the series with a new issue No  1  Jan  1999  with Howard Mackie as writer and Byrne as penciler  Byrne penciled issues  1 18  from 1999 2000  and wrote  13 14  Marvel hired Byrne in 1999 for a second volume of the series featuring The Incredible Hulk  re titled Hulk  with Ron Garney penciling  Byrne wrote the first seven issues  as well as that series  summer annual  From 1999 2001  Byrne returned to the X Men once again  as he wrote and drew the flashback series X Men  The Hidden Years  The series lasted 22 issues  Byrne explained the title s cancellation to Comic Book Resources in November 2000   I was officially informed yesterday that  despite the fact that they are still profitable  several  redundant  X Titles are being axed   This disagreement factored in his decision to no longer work for Marvel Comics  30  Like X Men  The Hidden Years  works of this period have involved characters and events in time periods mostly skipped over by other comics  Marvel  The Lost Generation   or alternate timelines  DC s Superman  amp  Batman  Generations   a common feature is to have characters who actually age during the course of the series  which is uncommon for characters in ongoing comics  In early 2003  Byrne spent ten weeks as guest penciler on the syndicated newspaper strip Funky Winkerbean  Byrne did this as a favor for Winkerbean s creator  Tom Batiuk  who was recovering from foot surgery  31  32  Most of his 2000s work has been for DC Comics  JLA   94 99  the  Tenth Circle  story arc   Doom Patrol  Blood of the Demon  a five issue arc of JLA Classified  Superman  True Brit was a collaboration with former Monty Python member John Cleese and Kim Johnson  with art by Byrne and inker Mark Farmer  it reimagines the origin of Superman  by considering how Clark Kent s upbringing would be different if his spaceship had crashed in England instead of the fictional town of Smallville  33  Byrne returned to Action Comics for issues  827 835 working with writer Gail Simone  Afterward  Simone and Byrne reteamed to launch The All New Atom series in 2006  with Byrne pencilling the first three issues  For publisher IDW  Byrne worked on the superhero series FX  1 6  written by Wayne Osborne  starting with the March 2008 issue  His other

revived his Next Men series in late 2010 2011  with a sequel series called Aftermath which started in early 2012  picking up where Next Men ended  Other work for IDW will include a new series titled Trio  35   edit  Controversies Over the years  Byrne has gained a reputation as a controversial figure  and has noted this himself  stating that  as the people who have figured me out have said  I just don t suffer fools gladly   36 Gail Simone  who worked with Byrne on The All New Atom  2006   described Byrne   John is very opinionated  a lot of artists are opinionated  and I m okay with that  Actually  I think John Byrne is brilliant and his forceful personality is part of that   37  Byrne s opinions can lead to disputes  and commentators have noted disputes with Peter David  38 Jim Shooter  Joe Quesada  Mark Evanier  Marv Wolfman  39  and Erik Larsen  39  In 1982  during a panel discussion at the Dallas Fantasy Fair  Byrne made unflattering comments about longtime comics writer and one time Marvel Comics editor in chief Roy Thomas  After a transcript of the panel was published in The Comics Journal No  75  Sept  1982   Thomas threatened a libel suit if Byrne did not apologize  In a letter printed in The Comics Journal No  82  July 1983   Byrne retracted his statements  claiming he was only repeating information from Wolfman and Wein  writing   I acted only in the office of a parrot   40  In the 1980s  Steve Gerber and Jack Kirby lampooned him in Destroyer Duck  drawing him as a character called Cogburn  possessing a removable spine and existing only to serve as a cog in the mammoth corporation that owned him  41 Erik Larsen created a villain in the 1990s for his Savage Dragon and Freak Force series  Johnny Redbeard The Creator  who also parodies Byrne  a massive cranium with atrophied appendages  he can bestow superpowers indiscriminately  42  However  Byrne is also regarded as an enthusiastic speaker  and someone with a warm love of his chosen medium  36 Tony Isabella has commented upon Byrne s approachability when at comic conventions  describing him as  friendly  funny  and well received by those who attended the show   43  The magazine Heroplay examined Byrne s alleged treatment of women in his comics and concluded   As dynamic as his art can be  and as ambitious as his storylines are  he just seems to have an axe to grind with the female of the species   and that he made women  either bitchy  flighty  or evil   44   edit  Art style Promotional art for Blood of the Demon  1  series written and drawn by Byrne for DC Comics  Byrne s original work has been noted as being rough  with his drawings emphasizing curves over straight lines  Byrne has himself called the straight line  his least favorite artistic element   45  Ron Goulart has called Byrne s artwork  an eminently acceptable mix of bravura  complexity and storytelling clarity   46  In Scott McCloud s book Understanding Comics  Byrne is charted along with other comics artists in the  Big Triangle   47  McCloud s placement of Byrne within it identifies his style as similar to Gilbert Hernandez and Jim Lee  making the point that Byrne s line style is naturalistic without being overly detailed  As of 2009  Byrne is an accomplished comic book creator  and is capable of producing virtually all aspects of a book  although he does still produce work in collaboration  The one exception is coloring  since Byrne is color blind and has difficulty distinguishing between certain shades of green and brown  for instance  during the first year that Byrne illustrated Iron Fist  he believed that the protagonist s costume was brown  48  While he experimented with his own hand developed lettering fonts in the early 1980s  he now uses a computer font based on the handwriting of the letterer Jack Morelli  49  Byrne s artistic style  his layouts and his storytelling have been sources of instruction and inspiration to many comics artists  including 50 Jim Lee  51 Todd McFarlane  52 Bryan Hitch  53  and Marcos Mart n  54  Others have been critical  however  John Kricfalusi called Byrne a  fifth generation Neal Adams imitator   55   edit  Personal life Byrne was married to photographer and actress Andrea Braun Byrne for 15 years  Braun s son from a previous marriage is Kieron Dwyer  56  and Byrne became Dwyer s stepfather when the boy was 13   They only lived together for a short time  however  as the young Dwyer soon moved to Los Angeles to live with his father   Byrne encouraged the young Dwyer s aspirations to be a superhero cartoonist  and his connections led to Dwyer s first professional job  doing a Batman fill in in 1987   57   edit  Awards Byrne has been the recipient of multiple comic book awards  including Favourite Comicbook Artist Eagle Awards in 1978 and 1979  a 1980 Inkpot Award  and the 1993 Squiddy Award for Favorite Penciller  In 2008  Byrne was inducted into the Canadian Comic Book Creator Hall of Fame   edit
