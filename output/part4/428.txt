Ghost Rider  Johnny Blaze  After the western comics character who originally used the name  the next known Ghost Rider appears in the Marvel comic book Marvel Spotlight  5  Aug  1972   where the story and characters are credited as being created by Gary Friedrich  aided and abetted by writer editor Roy Thomas  with artist Mike Ploog  Johnny Blaze  a motorcycle stunt performer in a traveling circus  sold his soul to one whom he believes to be Satan but actually is the demon Mephisto  a retcon   in order to save his stepfather   Crash  Simpson  from cancer  Crash later dies in a motorcycle accident and Mephisto attempts to take Blaze s soul  only to be thwarted by Crash s daughter Roxanne  who had learned of the deal and had prepared a counter spell based on selfless love  Since Roxanne interrupted in the middle of the pact  Mephisto could only bind half the soul of a demon with Blaze  making him transform only at night when around evil  1  Blaze then finds himself transforming into a demonic entity at nightfall  during which times he wields strange powers  He is called the Ghost Rider for his strange appearance  As time goes on  he is able to call on his demonic abilities whenever he wishes  not just at night  Eventually  he seems to have a different personality as Ghost Rider and it is finally revealed that Mephisto has forced Blaze to share his body with a demon rival named Zarathos  Originally  Zarathos was stripped of his memories and so Blaze was in control whenever they transformed into Ghost Rider  But now  Zarathos  true personality has resurfaced and from then on it is a continuing battle for dominance between him and Blaze  Being a demon  Zarathos craves the punishment of sinners and so Blaze at times willingly releases him when criminals or other threats are nearby  However  it is always a struggle to force Zarathos back so that Blaze can resume his control and his human identity  At times  Zarathos tries to find ways to destroy Blaze s soul so that he may be free to enjoy complete physical existence  The character received his own series in 1973  with Friedrich penning the first several issues  until writing was taken over by penciller Jim Mooney Several different creative teams mixed and matched until penciller Don Perlin began a long stint with  26  eventually joined by writer Michael Fleisher through  58  Tony Isabella wrote a Ghost Rider story arc where Johnny Blaze became a Christian and thereby freed himself of the curse  Isabella said that  Johnny Blaze accepts Jesus Christ into his life  This gives him the strength to overcome Satan  though with more pyrotechnics than most of us can muster  He retains the Ghost Rider powers he had been given by Satan  but they are his to use as his new faith directs him   However  the story was apparently rewritten at the last moment  2  Towards the end of the run  a villain named Centurious was introduced  Centurious was a man without a soul  making him immune to Ghost Rider s hellfire  and he had a history with Zarathos  This Ghost Rider s career ended when Zarathos fled Blaze s body in issue  81  June 1983   the finale  in order to pursue Centurious  Now free of his curse  Blaze went off to live with Roxanne  In the next Ghost Rider series  it would be revealed that Roxanne and Johnny eventually got married and had two children   edit  Johnny Blaze returns A six issue miniseries  again featuring Blaze as the Ghost Rider  though how this happened was not explained   debuted in 2001 under the Marvel Knights imprint  Subtitled  The Hammer Lane   it was written by Devin K  Grayson and penciled by Trent Kaniuga  The miniseries was ill regarded by fans  citation needed  Some elements of the series  such as Roxanne s death  have also been overturned by the later released final issue of the Dan Ketch series  citation needed  A second six issue miniseries  by writer Garth Ennis and artist Clayton Crain  subtitled  Road to Damnation   debuted November 2005  This series also featured Blaze  who was now dead and in Hell  trapped in the form of the Ghost Rider  The series focused on his futile attempts at escaping from Hell  His powers here now included being able to breathe hellfire like a dragon and launching chains from his throat  Blaze s new Ghost Rider appearance is similar to Daniel Ketch s  a change that assistant editor Michael O Connor attributes citation needed  to the manifestation of Ghost Rider s powers themselves  In July 2006  a new ongoing monthly series  titled simply Ghost Rider  began  Written by Daniel Way with art by Javier Saltares and Mark Texeira  it takes place after the Ennis miniseries  It features Blaze still in Hell  desperately trying to escape  At the end of the first issue  he is manipulated into returning to Earth  bringing Lucifer with him  The series then revolves around Blaze fighting Lucifer and his forces  Flashback issues also show Johnny Blaze finally dying and being condemned to Hell due to his original deal with the Devil  Roxanne s whereabouts are unknown  In Way s last story arc  it is revealed 3  that it was not due to Mephisto but rather because of an angel named Zadkiel that the original Ghost Rider was born  intended to be Heaven s weapon on Earth who would fight demons  and that this angelic purpose is why the Devil could not keep him in Hell  With issue  20  writer Jason Aaron and penciler Roland Boschi became the creative team  and reintroduced Danny Ketch  now a normal human who learns from the Caretaker that his initial transformation into the second Ghost Rider had been inadvertent   edit  Daniel Ketch Main article  Ghost Rider  Danny Ketch  The next Ghost Rider  was a young man named Daniel Ketch  debuted in Ghost Rider vol  2   1  May 1990   This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous  although his costume was now a black leather biker jacket with spiked shoulder pads  grey leather pants  and a mystic chain that he wore across his chest  which responded to his mental commands and served as his primary melee weapon  His new motorcycle resembled a futuristic machine and the front of it could lower to serve as a battering ram  Like the original Ghost Rider s bike  the wheels were composed of mystic hellfire  Unlike relationship between the previous Ghost Rider  Johnny Blaze  and the demonic Zarathos who possessed him  Ketch and his demon   eventually revealed in  91  Dec  1997  to be Marvel s incarnation of the Angel of Death Judgment   are cooperative with each other  As with Blaze and Zarathos  they can sometimes communicate through dreams or will leave messages for each other  such as writing a note or using lipstick to scribble messages on a mirror  At the close of the series  with vol  2   93  Feb  1998   Blaze seemed to lose his children to mystical forces and Roxanne was killed  only to be transformed into the demon Black Rose  Daniel Ketch also apparently died and Noble Kale became a ruler in Hell  The following year  Peter Parker  Spider Man  93  July 1999  revealed Ketch was still alive  Nearly a decade later  Marvel published the long completed final issue as Ghost Rider Finale  Jan  2007   which reprints vol  2   93 and the previously unpublished  94  Note  While the trademarked cover logo reads Ghost Rider  94  the comic s postal indicia lists the comic copyrighted as Ghost Rider Finale  The finale revealed that Roxanne s true spirit was restored and that she left her existence as Black Rose behind and returned to Blaze s side  though she suffered from heavy memory loss   edit  Alejandra During the Fear Itself storyline  a Nicaraguan woman named Alejandra ends up becoming a Ghost Rider through a ritual performed by a man named Adam at the time when Sin  in the form of Skadi  attacks Dayton  Ohio alongside Deathwatch and the half demon version of Blackout  This Ghost Rider dispatches Deathwatch and Blackout before engaging Skadi  But when she touches Skadi s hammer  she is incapacitated and reverted to human form because according to Skadi  touching the hammer was akin to touching fear itself  Later she shows how many unknown powers the Ghost Rider has  4   edit  Powers and abilities The Ghost Rider is a human who can transform into a being with a flaming skull and supernatural powers  The motorcycles he rides can travel faster than conventional motorcycles and can perform such seemingly impossible feats such as riding up a vertical surface  across the surface of water and leaping across great distances that normal motorcycles could not match  The Ghost Riders are notoriously hard to injure by any conventional means  as bullets and knives usually pass through them without causing pain  It is possible that they are genuinely immortal  it is said that God created them and only God can destroy them  5  The Ghost Riders possess superhuman strength  enough to easily pick up a truck and hurl it across a road  It has been stated that Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider can press around 25 tons  or more as seen in World War Hulk   6  Each Ghost Rider entity also had abilities specific to him  Johnny Blaze   Originally when Blaze transformed into Ghost Rider  his body changed but not the clothes he was wearing  In his new incarnation  this is different and his clothes take on a darker  more sinister appearance with a spiked leather jacket and chains  As Ghost Rider  he can cause his motorcycle to transform and surround itself with hellfire or he can create a new cycle from pure hellfire  He is also capable of projecting hellfire as a weapon  Hellfire  burns the soul  without leaving physical injuries on the victim and its effects have been seen as similar to the  Penance Stare   In his new incarnation  Blaze is now possibly the most powerful hero on Earth  During  World War Hulk  it was stated by Dr  Stephen Strange that Ghost Rider might be equally as powerful as the  Green Scar  persona of Hulk   actually it is stated that Ghost Rider is the most powerful entity created  and that its human host only served as a  safety switch  to contain the power  and could defeat him  but wouldn t because Ghost Rider only defended the innocent and the Illuminati wasn t innocent  Ghost Rider also has the  Penance Stare  and mystical chain  both of which were specific to the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider  Blaze also uses a shotgun and discovered that he can discharge hellfire from the weapon when he first encountered Ketch  He also now has new abilities including hellfire breath and the ability to produce chains from either his throat or chest  He is also now able to travel between the incorporeal realms  Daniel Ketch   When Ketch transformed into Ghost Rider  his clothes changed with him  taking on the appearance of a spiked leather jacket with chains  gray leather pants and spiked gloves and boots  Likewise  his motorcycle underwent a radical transformation  changing from a conventional into a high tech motorcycle  This transformation was not strictly limited to the motorcycle he found in the cemetery as he was once seen to be able to transform another cycle in  Ghost Rider Wolverine Punisher  Hearts of Darkness    Along with flaming wheels that allows the bike to nearly fly across surfaces  the bike included a shield like battering ram on the front  As the Ghost Rider  Ketch used a mystical chain which responded to his mental commands  It could grow in length  alter direction while in the air  stiffen into a staff or spear  and separate into several links which can strike like shrapnel and then return to their original form  Daniel s most famous power was the Penance Stare  By locking eyes with a target and mentally focusing  the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider was able to make the target experience all the pain they had ever inflicted on anyone else  This ability was seen to have little effect on some people who were mentally unstable  such as the being known as Madcap  Ghost Rider was also knocked out when attempting to use the Penance Stare on Carnage   Originally  this incarnation of the Ghost Rider could only be summoned if Danny was present when  innocent blood was spilled   an innocent simply being threatened was not enough   at which time Danny had to touch the gas cap of his motorcycle for the transformation process to occur  Later  he was able to summon the Ghost Rider without touching the gas cap  but still needed to wait for innocent blood to be spilled  Later still  he was able to summon the Ghost Rider by willpower alone   edit  Origins Thomas  Marvel s editor in chief at the time  described the character s genesis  I had made up a character as a villain in Daredevil   a very lackluster character   called Stunt Master    a motorcyclist  Anyway  when Gary Friedrich started writing Daredevil  he said   Instead of Stunt Master  I d like to make the villain a really weird motorcycle riding character called Ghost Rider   He didn t describe him  I said   Yeah  Gary  there s only one thing wrong with it   and he kind of looked at me weird  because we were old friends from Missouri  and I said   That s too good an idea to be just a villain in Daredevil  He should start out right away in his own book   When Gary wasn t there the day we were going to design it  Mike Ploog  who was going to be the artist  and I designed the character  I had this idea for the skull head  something like Elvis  1968 Special jumpsuit  and so forth  and Ploog put the fire on the head  just because he thought it looked nice  Gary liked it  so they went off and did it  7  Friedrich on the above  in 2001  Well  there s some disagreement between Roy  Mike  and I over that  I threatened on more than one occasion that if Marvel gets in a position where they are gonna make a movie or make a lot of money off of it  I m gonna sue them  and I probably will     It was my idea  It was always my idea from the first time we talked about it  it turned out to be a guy with a flaming skull and rode a motorcycle  Ploog seems to think the flaming skull was his idea  But  to tell you the truth  it was my idea  8  Ploog recalled  in a 2008 interview  Now  there s been all kinds of dialog about who was the creator of Ghost Rider  Gary Friedrich was the writer on it      The flaming skull  That was the big area of dispute  Who thought of the flaming skull  To be honest with you I can t remember  What else were you going to do with him  You couldn t put a helmet on him  so it had to be a flaming skull  As far as his costume went  it was part of the old  Western  Ghost Rider s costume  with the Western panel front  The stripes down the arms and the legs were there merely so I could make the character  s costume  as black as I possibly could and sill keep track of his body  It was the easiest way to design him  9  On April 4  2007  Friedrich sued Marvel Enterprises  Sony Pictures  Columbia TriStar Motion Pictures  Relativity Media  Crystal Sky Pictures  Michael DeLuca Productions  Hasbro  and Take Two Interactive  alleging his copyrights to the Ghost Rider character have been exploited and used in a  joint venture and conspiracy   The lawsuit states that the film rights and merchandising reverted from Marvel to him in 2001  10   edit  Other Spirits of Vengeance  edit  Vengeance Main article  Vengeance  comics  Michael Badilino  an ex member of the New York City Police Department  is one third of an  Organic Medallion of Power   the other two are Ketch and Blaze  the Medallion itself was never explained in any true detail   He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider  although he also possesses the Penance Stare and his motorcycle seemed to share characteristics with the Noble Kale version  His appearance is distinguished by a deep purple skull  large fangs protruding from his upper jaw  and backswept curved horns on the top of his skull  In his superhuman form  Badilino was called Vengeance  and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider  believing him to be Zarathos  Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze  Vengeance would also take on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi seriously referred to himself by that name when confronted by Spider Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen  Vengeance killed himself  along with the villain Hellgate  by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire  the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider  Vengeance reappears in the last four issues of Ghost Rider vol  2  involved in Blackheart s plans to kill Noble Kale  Vengeance aids the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle  destroying Blackheart and ruling Hell during Ketch s absences   edit  The Last Stand of the Spirits of Vengeance Seven riders show their flaming heads for the first time in this story arc by writer Jason Aaron and artist Tan Eng Huat  Daniel Ketch returns with a new mission  to collect the powers of all the Ghost Riders for the angel Zadkiel to prevent the corruption of the powers with their human hosts  Zadkiel has other motives he keeps to himself  of which he needs the powers of the riders to tear down the walls of New Jerusalem and wage war on the heavens  The story begins in Tibet with Chinese soldiers harassing a village  questioning them about weapons that killed two of his garrison patrols  During the harassment a monk enters on a donkey  After a few exchange of words and an order to kill given by the General  the monk changes and kills the General s men while his back is turned  When the General turns back he sees the Ghost Rider and gets a penance stare for his trouble  After the attack the rider goes back to his sanctuary where he is visited by Danny Ketch  A short while later Sister Sara and Johnny Blaze arrive at the sanctuary to find out how to get back at Zadkiel  After entering  they find the monk and donkey burnt to husks  That night the two are visited by Ketch and begins a battle with a show of power  When Blaze does the penance stare to his brother  he sees exactly what has transpired  Ketch has murdered the hosts of numerous riders for their powers  During a show of pity for the fallen  Ketch is able to return the stare on Blaze  and sends Blaze into temporary insanity  Before Ketch is able to take the power of Zarathos  he is stopped by the new caretaker Sister Sara  She rescues Blaze and they go to a safehouse  At the safehouse  during Blaze s self pity and Sara s trying to pick him back up  they are visited by two more Ghost Riders  the Arabic Molek and the Chinese Bai Gu Jing  with whom they follow to Japan  When Blaze s team arrives in Japan  they learn Ketch has already taken the power of the rider Yoshio Kannabe  After the conquest  Ketch has another talk with Zadkiel via communications link  During the conversation Zadkiel massacres the squad of the Asura who guard the gates of heaven  Zadkiel tells Ketch to wait to attack the riders til the last ones are together  Meanwhile  elsewhere in the world  former cop Kowalski follows a contact to get a hellfire shotgun for his revenge on Blaze  After acquiring the item he is then driven to the middle of a desert to sit and wait for his chance  After leaving Japan  Blaze s team journeys to the City of the Skulls in the Congo where the last stand would be made  There they meet the Lords of the Congo  the Ghost Riders Baron Skullfire and Marinette Bwachech  and their Phantom Riders  During the day Sara tells Molek about her new experience becoming a Caretaker  and her wonders about religion  with which she is given secret information that Molek knows about both  As the Ghost Riders and their forces get ready for battle  Blaze has his eyes opened back up by kids going to fight  He quickly snaps out of his depression and joins the others for the final battle  During the course of the battle Baron Skullfire dies and the spirit is transferred to one of the Phantom Riders  after which Ketch creates hellfire duplicates of himself to take the powers  A wager is then made by Blaze and Ketch on a race between the brothers around the world for the fates of the powers  During the race  Blaze is critically injured by Kowalski s shotgun and Ketch takes the rider from him as his duplicates overpower the others  Moments later Ketch returns the heaven and Zadkiel is then able to take heaven  The sound of the gates falling is enough to be felt by Spider man s senses  and loud enough to be heard by people and everywhere including Hell and Asgard  When an injured Blaze returns to the City of the Skulls  Ketch falls from the sky and reveals that the battle for Heaven has already been decided  As more energies fall from the heavens  one strikes Kowalski and changes him into a new rider that looks a lot like Vengeance   edit  Trail of Tears A
