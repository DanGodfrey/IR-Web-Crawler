the Second World War  often abbreviated as WWII or WW2   was a global armed conflict that was underway by 1939 and ended in 1945  It involved a vast majority of the world s nations including all of the great powers eventually forming two opposing military alliances  the Allies and the Axis  It was the most widespread war in history  with more than 100 million people serving in military units  In a state of  total war   the major participants placed their entire economic  industrial  and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort  erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources  Marked by significant events involving the mass death of civilians  including the Holocaust and the only use of nuclear weapons in warfare  it resulted in 50 million to over 70 million fatalities  These deaths make the war the deadliest conflict in human history  1  Although Japan was already at war with China in 1937  2  the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939  with the invasion of Poland by Germany  and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and most of the countries of the British Empire and Commonwealth  Germany set out to establish a large empire in Europe  From late 1939 to early 1941  in a series of campaigns and treaties  Germany conquered or subdued much of continental Europe  amid Nazi Soviet agreements  the nominally neutral Soviet Union fully or partially occupied and annexed territories of its six European neighbours  including Poland  Britain and the Commonwealth remained the only major force continuing the fight against the Axis  with battles taking place in North Africa as well as the long running Battle of the Atlantic  In June 1941  the European Axis launched an invasion of the Soviet Union  giving a start to the largest land theatre of war in history  which tied down the major part of the Axis  military forces  In December 1941  Japan  which aimed to dominate Asia  attacked the United States and European possessions in the Pacific Ocean  quickly conquering much of the West Pacific  The Axis advance was stopped in 1942  after Japan lost a series of naval battles and European Axis troops were defeated in North Africa and  decisively  at Stalingrad  In 1943  with a series of German defeats in Eastern Europe  the Allied invasion of Fascist Italy  and American victories in the Pacific  the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts  In 1944  the Western Allies invaded France  while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies  The war in Europe ended with the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945  The Japanese Navy was defeated by the United States  and invasion of the Japanese Archipelago   Home Islands   became imminent  The war in Asia ended on 15 August 1945 when Japan agreed to surrender  The war ended with the total victory of the Allies over the Axis in 1945  World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world  The United Nations  UN  was established to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts  The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers  setting the stage for the Cold War  which lasted for the next 46 years  Meanwhile  the influence of European great powers started to decline  while the decolonisation of Asia and Africa began  Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery  Political integration  especially in Europe  emerged as an effort to stabilise postwar relations  Contents 1 Chronology 2 Background 3 Pre war events 3 1 Invasion of Ethiopia 3 2 Spanish Civil War 3 3 Japanese

war is generally held to be 1 September 1939  beginning with the German invasion of Poland  Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later  Other dates for the beginning of war include the start of the Second Sino Japanese War on 7 July 1937  3  4  Others follow British historian A  J  P  Taylor  who held that there was a simultaneous Sino Japanese War in East Asia  and a Second European War in Europe and her colonies  The two wars merged in 1941  becoming a single global conflict  at which point the war continued until 1945  This article uses the conventional dating  Other starting dates sometimes used for World War II include the 1935 Italian invasion of Abyssinia  5  The exact date of the war s end is also not universally agreed upon  It has been suggested that the war ended at the armistice of 14 August 1945  V J Day   rather than the formal surrender of Japan  2 September 1945   in some European histories  it ended on V E Day  8 May 1945   However  the Treaty of Peace with Japan was not signed until 1951  6  and that with Germany not until 1990  7  Background Main article  Causes of World War II World War I radically altered the political map  with the defeat of the Central Powers  including Austria Hungary  Germany and the Ottoman Empire  and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia  Meanwhile  existing victorious Allies such as France  Belgium  Italy  Greece and Romania gained territories  while new states were created out of the collapse of Austria Hungary and the Russian and Ottoman Empires  In the aftermath of the war  irredentist and revanchist nationalism became important in a number of European states  Irredentism and revanchism were strong in Germany because of the significant territorial  colonial  and financial losses incurred by the Treaty of Versailles  Under the treaty  Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all of its overseas colonies  while German annexation of other states was prohibited  reparations were imposed  and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country s armed forces  8  Meanwhile  the Russian Civil War had led to the creation of the Soviet Union  9  The German Empire was dissolved in the German Revolution of 1918 1919  and a democratic government  later known as the Weimar Republic  was created  The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the right and left  Although Italy as an Entente ally made some territorial gains  Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by Britain and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled with the peace settlement  From 1922 to 1925  the Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist  totalitarian  and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy  repressed socialist  left wing and liberal forces  and pursued an aggressive foreign policy aimed at forcefully forging Italy as a world power   a  New Roman Empire   10  In Germany  the Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler sought to establish a fascist government in Germany  With the onset of the Great Depression  domestic support for the Nazis rose and  in 1933  Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany  In the aftermath of the Reichstag fire  Hitler created a totalitarian single party state led by the Nazis  11  The Kuomintang  KMT  party in China launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid 1920s  but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese communist allies  12  In 1931  an increasingly militaristic Japanese Empire  which had long sought influence in China 13  as the first step of what its government saw as the country s right to rule Asia  used the Mukden Incident as a pretext to launch an invasion of Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo  14  Too weak to resist Japan  China appealed to the League of Nations for help  Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for its incursion into Manchuria  The two nations then fought several battles  in Shanghai  Rehe and Hebei  until the Tanggu Truce was signed in 1933  Thereafter  Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in Manchuria  and Chahar and Suiyuan  15  Benito Mussolini  left  and Adolf Hitler  right  Adolf Hitler  after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government in 1923  became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933  He abolished democracy  espousing a radical  racially motivated revision of the world order  and soon began a massive rearmament campaign  16  Meanwhile  France  to secure its alliance  allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia  which Italy desired as a colonial possession  The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles  accelerated his rearmament programme and introduced conscription  17  Hoping to contain Germany  the United Kingdom  France and Italy formed the Stresa Front  The Soviet Union  concerned due to Germany s goals of capturing vast areas of eastern Europe  wrote a treaty of mutual assistance with France  Before taking effect though  the Franco Soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations  which rendered it essentially toothless  18  19  However  in June 1935  the United Kingdom made an independent naval agreement with Germany  easing prior restrictions  The United States  concerned with events in Europe and Asia  passed the Neutrality Act in August  20  In October  Italy invaded Ethiopia  and Germany was the only major European nation to support the invasion  Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany s goal of absorbing Austria  21  Hitler defied the Versailles and Locarno treaties by remilitarizing the Rhineland in March 1936  He received little response from other European powers  22  When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July  Hitler and Mussolini supported the fascist and authoritarian Nationalist forces in their civil war against the Soviet supported Spanish Republic  Both sides used the conflict to test new weapons and methods of warfare  23  with the Nationalists winning the war in early 1939  In October 1936  Germany and Italy formed the Rome Berlin Axis  A month later  Germany and Japan signed the Anti Comintern Pact  which Italy would join in the following year  In China  after the Xi an Incident the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire in order to present a united front to oppose Japan  24  Pre war events Invasion of Ethiopia Main article  Second Italo Abyssinian War The Second Italo Abyssinian War was a brief colonial war that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936  The war was fought between the armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy  Regno d Italia  and the armed forces of the Ethiopian Empire  also known as Abyssinia   The war resulted in the military occupation of Ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of Italian East Africa  Africa Orientale Italiana  or AOI   in addition  it exposed the weakness of the League of Nations as a force to preserve peace  Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations  but the League did nothing when the former clearly violated the League s own Article X  25  Spanish Civil War Main article  Spanish Civil War The ruins of Guernica after the bombing  Germany and Italy lent support to the Nationalist insurrection led by general Francisco Franco in Spain  The Soviet Union supported the existing government  the Spanish Republic  which showed leftist tendencies  Both Germany and the USSR used this proxy war as an opportunity to test improved weapons and tactics  The deliberate Bombing of Guernica by the German Condor Legion in April 1937 contributed to widespread concerns that the next major war would include extensive terror bombing attacks on civilians  26  27  Japanese invasion of China Main article  Second Sino Japanese War A Chinese machine gun nest in the Battle of Shanghai  1937  In July 1937  Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of Beijing after instigating the Marco Polo Bridge Incident  which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China  28  The Soviets quickly signed a non aggression pact with China to lend materiel support  effectively ending China s prior cooperation with Germany  Generalissimo Chiang Kai shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai  but after three months of fighting  Shanghai fell  The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back  capturing the capital Nanjing in December 1937 and committed the Nanking Massacre  In June 1938  Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by flooding the Yellow River  this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defenses at Wuhan  the city was taken by October  29  Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve  instead the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war  30  Japanese invasion of the Soviet Union and Mongolia See also  Nanshin ron and Soviet Japanese Border Wars Soviet troops fought the Japanese during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol in Mongolia  1939  On 29 July 1938  the Japanese invaded the USSR and were checked at the Battle of Lake Khasan  Although the battle was a Soviet victory  the Japanese dismissed it as an inconclusive draw  and on 11 May 1939 decided to move the Japanese Mongolian border up to the Khalkhin Gol River by force  After initial successes the Japanese assault on Mongolia was checked by the Red Army that inflicted the first major defeat on the Japanese Kwantung Army  31  32  These clashes convinced some factions in the Japanese government that they should focus on conciliating the Soviet government to avoid interference in the war against China and instead turn their military attention southward  towards the US and European holdings in the Pacific  and also prevented the sacking of experienced Soviet military leaders such as Georgy Zhukov  who would later play a vital role in the defence of Moscow  33  European occupations and agreements Further information  Anschluss  Appeasement  Munich Agreement  German occupation of Czechoslovakia  and Molotov Ribbentrop Pact From left to right  front   Chamberlain  Daladier  Hitler  Mussolini  and Ciano pictured before signing the Munich Agreement  In Europe  Germany and Italy were becoming bolder  In March 1938  Germany annexed Austria  again provoking little response from other European powers  34  Encouraged  Hitler began pressing German claims on the Sudetenland  an area of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German population  and soon France and Britain conceded this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement  which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government  in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands  35  Soon after that  however  Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary and Poland  36  In March 1939  Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and the pro German client state  the Slovak Republic  37  Alarmed  and with Hitler making further demands on Danzig  France and Britain guaranteed their support for Polish independence  when Italy conquered Albania in April 1939  the same guarantee was extended to Romania and Greece  38  Shortly after the Franco British pledge to Poland  Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the Pact of Steel  39  In August 1939  Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact  40  a non aggression treaty with a secret protocol  The parties gave each other rights   in the event of a territorial and political rearrangement   to  spheres of influence   western Poland and Lithuania for Germany  and eastern Poland  Finland  Estonia  Latvia and Bessarabia for the USSR   It also raised the question of continuing Polish independence  41  Course of the war War breaks out in Europe Common parade of German Wehrmacht and Soviet Red Army on 23 September 1939 in Brest  Eastern Poland at the end of the Invasion of Poland  At centre is Major General Heinz Guderian and at right is Brigadier Semyon Krivoshein  On 1 September 1939  Germany and Slovakia a client state in 1939 attacked Poland  42  On 3 September France and Britain  followed by the countries of the Commonwealth  43  declared war on Germany but provided little support to Poland other than a small French attack into the Saarland  44  Britain and France also began a naval blockade of Germany on 3 September which aimed to damage the country s economy and war effort  45  46  On 17 September  after signing a cease fire with Japan  the Soviets also invaded Poland  47  Poland s territory was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union  with Lithuania and Slovakia also receiving small shares  The Poles did not surrender and established a Polish Underground State  an underground Home Army  and continued to fight with the Allies on all fronts outside Poland  48  About 100 000 Polish military personnel were evacuated to Romania and the Baltic countries  many of these soldiers later fought against the Germans in other theaters of the war  49 Poland s Enigma codebreakers were also evacuated to France  50  During this time  Japan launched its first attack against Changsha  a strategically important Chinese city  but was repulsed by late September  51  Following the invasion of Poland and a German Soviet treaty governing Lithuania  the Soviet Union forced the Baltic countries to allow it to station Soviet troops in their countries under pacts of  mutual assistance   52  53  54  Finland rejected territorial demands and was invaded by the Soviet Union in November 1939  55  The resulting conflict ended in March 1940 with Finnish concessions  56  France and the United Kingdom  treating the Soviet attack on Finland as tantamount to entering the war on the side of the Germans  responded to the Soviet invasion by supporting the USSR s expulsion from the League of Nations  54  German troops by the Arc de Triomphe  Paris  after the 1940 fall of France  In Western Europe  British troops deployed to the Continent  but in a phase nicknamed the Phoney War by the British and  Sitzkrieg   sitting war  by the Germans  neither side launched major operations against the other until April 1940  57  The Soviet Union and Germany entered a trade pact in February 1940  pursuant to which the Soviets received German military and industrial equipment in exchange for supplying raw materials to Germany to help circumvent the Allied blockade  58  In April 1940  Germany invaded Denmark and Norway to secure shipments of iron ore from Sweden  which the Allies were about to disrupt  59 Denmark immediately capitulated  and despite Allied support  Norway was conquered within two months  60  In May 1940 Britain invaded Iceland to preempt a possible German invasion of the island  61 British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to the replacement of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain with Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940  62  Axis advances Germany invaded France  Belgium  the Netherlands  and Luxembourg on 10 May 1940  63  The Netherlands and Belgium were overrun using blitzkrieg tactics in a few days and weeks  respectively  64  The French fortified Maginot Line and the Allied forces in Belgium were circumvented by a flanking movement through the thickly wooded Ardennes region  65  mistakenly perceived by French planners as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles  66  British troops were forced to evacuate the continent at Dunkirk  abandoning their heavy equipment by early June  67  On 10 June  Italy invaded France  declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom  68  twelve days later France surrendered and was soon divided into German and Italian occupation zones  69  and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime  On 3 July  the British attacked the French fleet in Algeria to prevent its possible seizure by Germany  70  In June  during the last days of the Battle of France  the Soviet Union rigged elections in the Baltic states and forcibly and illegally annexed them  53  it then annexed the region of Bessarabia in Romania  Whereas the increased cooperation between the USSR and Nazi Germany  which included broad economic cooperation  limited military assistance  population exchange and border agreements made the former a de facto German ally  71  72  Soviet takeover of the Baltic states  Bessarabia and North Bukovina had been seen with disquiet by Germany  73  74  This  as well as growing tensions over spheres of influence demonstrated the impossibility of further expansion of Nazi Soviet cooperation  and both states had begun the countdown to war  75  With France neutralized  Germany began an air superiority campaign over Britain  the Battle of Britain  to prepare for an invasion  76  The campaign failed  and the invasion plans were canceled by September  77  Using newly captured French ports  the German Navy enjoyed success against an over extended Royal Navy  using U boats against British shipping in the Atlantic  78  Italy began operations in the Mediterranean  initiating a siege of Malta in June  conquering British Somaliland in August  and making an incursion into British held Egypt in September 1940  Japan increased its blockade of China in September by seizing several bases in the northern part of the now isolated French Indochina  79  The Battle of Britain ended the German advance in Western Europe  Throughout this period  the neutral United States took measures to assist China and the Western Allies  In November 1939  the American Neutrality Act was amended to allow  cash and carry  purchases by the Allies  80  In 1940  following the German capture of Paris  the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased and  after the Japanese incursion into Indochina  the United States embargoed iron  steel and mechanical parts against Japan  81  In September  the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases  82  Still  a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention into the conflict well into 1941  83  At the end of September 1940  the Tripartite Pact united Japan  Italy and Germany to formalize the Axis Powers  84  The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country  with the exception of the Soviet Union  not in the war which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three  85  During this time  the United States continued to support the United Kingdom and China by introducing the Lend Lease policy authorizing the provision of materiel and other items 86  and creating a security zone spanning roughly half of the Atlantic Ocean where the United States Navy protected British convoys  87  As a result  Germany and the United States found themselves engaged in sustained naval warfare in the North and Central Atlantic by October 1941  even though the United States remained officially neutral  88  89  The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary  Slovakia and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact  90  These countries participated in the subsequent invasion of the USSR  with Romania making the largest contribution to recapture territory ceded to the USSR and pursue its leader Ion Antonescu s desire to combat communism  91  In October 1940  Italy invaded Greece but within days was repulsed and pushed back into Albania  where a stalemate soon occurred  92  In December 1940  British Commonwealth forces began counter offensives against Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa  93  By early 1941  with Italian forces having been pushed back into Libya by the Commonwealth  Churchill ordered a dispatch of troops from Africa to bolster the Greeks  94  The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats  with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission by a carrier attack at Taranto  and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan  95  German paratroopers invading the Greek island of Crete  May 1941  The Germans soon intervened to assist Italy  Hitler sent German forces to Libya in February  and by the end of March they had launched an offensive against the diminished Commonwealth forces  96  In under a month  Commonwealth forces were pushed back into Egypt with the exception of the besieged port of Tobruk  97  The Commonwealth attempted to dislodge Axis forces in May and again in June  but failed on both occasions  98  In early April  following Bulgaria s signing of the Tripartite Pact  the Germans intervened in the Balkans by invading Greece and Yugoslavia following a coup  here too they made rapid progress  eventually forcing the Allies to evacuate after Germany conquered the Greek island of Crete by the end of May  99  The Allies did have some successes during this time  In the Middle East  Commonwealth forces first quashed a coup in Iraq which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichy controlled Syria  100  then  with the assistance of the Free French  invaded Syria and Lebanon to prevent further such occurrences  101  In the Atlantic  the British scored a much needed public morale boost by sinking the German flagship Bismarck  102  Perhaps most importantly  during the Battle of Britain the Royal Air Force had successfully resisted the Luftwaffe s assault  and the German bombing campaign largely ended in May 1941  103  In Asia  despite several offensives by both sides  the war between China and Japan was stalemated by 1940  In order to increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes  and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers  Japan had seized military control of southern Indochina 104  In August of that year  Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China  in retaliation  Japan instituted harsh measures  the Three Alls Policy  in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists  105  Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941  effectively ending their co operation  106  With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable  Germany  Japan  and the Soviet Union made preparations  With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource rich European possessions in Southeast Asia  the two powers signed the Soviet Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941  107  By contrast  the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union  amassing forces on the Soviet border  108  The war becomes global German infantry and armoured vehicles battle the Soviet defenders on the streets of Kharkov  October 1941  On 22 June 1941  Germany  along with other European Axis members and Finland  invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa  The primary targets of this surprise offensive 109  were the Baltic region  Moscow and Ukraine  with an ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk Astrakhan line  connecting the Caspian and White Seas  Hitler s objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power  exterminate Communism  generate Lebensraum   living space   110  by dispossessing the native population 111  and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany s remaining rivals  112  Although the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter offensives before the war  113 Barbarossa forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt a strategic defence  During the summer  the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory  inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel  By the middle of August  however  the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre  and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad  114  The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful  resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies  and made further advance into Crimea and industrially developed Eastern Ukraine  the First Battle of Kharkov  possible  115  Soviet counter attack during the battle of Moscow  December  1941  The diversion of three quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front 116  prompted Britain to reconsider its grand strategy  117  In July  the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany 118  The British and Soviets invaded Iran to secure the Persian Corridor and Iran s oil fields  119  In August  the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter  120  By October  when Axis operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved  with only the sieges of Leningrad 121  and Sevastopol continuing  122  a major offensive against Moscow had been renewed  After two months of fierce battles  the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow  where the exhausted troops 123  were forced to suspend their offensive  124  Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces  but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives  two key cities remained in Soviet hands  the Soviet capability to resist was not broken  and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential  The blitzkrieg phase of the war in Europe had ended  125  The Axis controlled territory in Europe at the time of its maximal expansion  1941 42   By early December  freshly mobilised reserves 126  allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops  127  This  as well as intelligence data that established a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East sufficient to prevent any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army  128  allowed the Soviets to begin a massive counter offensive that started on 5 December along a 1 000 kilometres  620 mi  front and pushed German troops 100 250 kilometres  62 160 mi  west  129  German successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on European governments in south east Asia  The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies  while refusing to hand over political control of the colonies  Vichy France  by contrast  agreed to a Japanese occupation of French Indochina  130  The United States  United Kingdom and other Western governments reacted to the seizure of Indochina with a freeze on Japanese assets  while the United States  which supplied 80 percent of Japan s oil 131   responded by placing a complete oil embargo  132  That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in Asia and the prosecution of the war against China  or seizing the natural resources it needed by force  the Japanese military did not consider the former an option  and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war  133  Japan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific  the Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war  134  To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet from the outset  135  On 7 December  8 December in Asian time zones   1941  Japan attacked British and American holdings with near simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific  136  These included an attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor  landings in Thailand and Malaya 136  and the battle of Hong Kong  The February 1942 Fall of Singapore saw 80 000 Allied soldiers captured and enslaved by the Japanese  These attacks led the U S   Britain  Australia and other Allies to formally declare war on Japan  Germany and the other members of the Tripartite Pact responded by declaring war on the United States  In January  the United States  Britain  Soviet Union  China  and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the Declaration by United Nations  which affirmed the Atlantic Charter  137  The Soviet Union did not adhere to the declaration  it maintained a neutrality agreement with Japan  138  139  and exempted itself from the principle of self determination  120  From 1941  Stalin persistently asked Churchill  and then Roosevelt  to open a  second front  in France  140  The Eastern front became the major theatre of war in Europe and the many millions of Soviet casualties dwarfed the few hundred thousand of the Western Allies  Churchill and Roosevelt said they needed more preparation time  leading to claims they stalled to save Western lives at the expense of Soviet lives  141  Meanwhile  by the end of April 1942  Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully conquered Burma  Malaya  the Dutch East Indies  Singapore  142  and Rabaul  inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners  Despite a stubborn resistance in Corregidor  the Philippines was eventually captured in May 1942  forcing the government of the Philippine Commonwealth into exile  143  Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea  Java Sea and Indian Ocean  144  and bombed the Allied naval base at Darwin  Australia  The only real Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha in early January 1942  145  These easy victories over unprepared opponents left Japan overconfident  as well as overextended  146  Germany retained the initiative as well  Exploiting dubious American naval command decisions  the German navy ravaged Allied shipping off the American Atlantic coast  147  Despite considerable losses  European Axis members stopped a major Soviet offensive in Central and Southern Russia  keeping most territorial gains they achieved during the previous year  148  In North Africa  the Germans launched an offensive in January  pushing the British back to positions at the Gazala Line by early February  149  followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives  150  Axis advance stalls American dive bombers engage the Mikuma at the Battle of Midway  June 1942  In early May 1942  Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia  The Allies  however  prevented the invasion by intercepting and defeating the Japanese naval forces in the Battle of the Coral Sea  151  Japan s next plan  motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid  was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated  as a diversion  Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska  152  In early June  Japan put its operations into action but the Americans  having broken Japanese naval codes in late May  were fully aware of the plans and force dispositions and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy  153  With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle  Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua  154  The Americans planned a counter attack against Japanese positions in the southern Solomon Islands  primarily Guadalcanal  as a first step towards capturing Rabaul  the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia  155  Both plans started in July  but by mid September  the battle for Guadalcanal took priority for the Japanese  and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the island  where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Buna Gona  156  Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal  By the start of 1943  the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops  157  In Burma  Commonwealth forces mounted two operations  The first  an offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942  went disastrously  forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943  158  The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese front lines in February which  by the end of April  had achieved dubious results  159  Soviet soldiers attack a house during the Battle of Stalingrad  1943  On Germany s eastern front  the Axis defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov  160  and then launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia in June 1942  to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy Kuban steppe  while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front  The Germans split the Army Group South into two groups  Army Group A struck lower Don River while Army Group B struck south east to the Caucasus  towards Volga River  161  The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad  which was in the path of the advancing German armies  By mid November the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street fighting when the Soviets began their second winter counter offensive  starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad 162  and an assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow  though the latter failed disastrously  163  By early February 1943  the German Army had taken tremendous losses  German troops at Stalingrad had been forced to surrender 164  and the front line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive  In mid February  after the Soviet push had tapered off  the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov  creating a salient in their front line around the Russian city of Kursk  165  British Crusader tanks moving to forward positions during the North African Campaign  By November 1941  Commonwealth forces had launched a counter offensive  Operation Crusader  in North Africa  and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made  166  In the West  concerns the Japanese might utilize bases in Vichy held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942  167  This success was offset soon after by an Axis offensive in Libya which pushed the Allies back into Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein  168  On the Continent  raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets  culminating in the disastrous Dieppe Raid  169  demonstrated the Western Allies  inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation  equipment  and operational security  170  In August 1942  the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El Alamein 171  and  at a high cost  managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta  172  A few months later  the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt  dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya  173  This attack was followed up shortly after by an Anglo American invasion of French North Africa  which resulted in the region joining the Allies  174  Hitler responded to the French colony s defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France  174  although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice  they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces  175  The now pincered Axis forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia  which was conquered by the Allies in May 1943  176  Allies gain momentum A contemporary video showing bombing of Hamburg by the Allies  Following the Guadalcanal Campaign  the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific  In May 1943  Allied forces were sent to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians  177  and soon after began major operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands  and to breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands  178  By the end of March 1944  the Allies had completed both of these objectives  and additionally neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands  In April  the Allies then launched an operation to retake Western New Guinea  179  Soviet Il 2 planes attacking a Wehrmacht column during the Battle of Kursk  1 July 1943  In the Soviet Union  both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 making preparations for large offensives in Central Russia  On 4 July 1943  Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge  Within a week  German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets  deeply echeloned and well constructed defences 180  181  and  for the first time in the war  Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success  182  This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies  invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which  combined with previous Italian failures  resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month  183  On 12 July 1943  the Soviets launched their own counter offensives  thereby dispelling any hopes of the German Army for victory or even stalemate in the east  The Soviet victory at Kursk heralded the downfall of German superiority  184  giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front  185  186  The Germans attempted to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther Wotan line  however  the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and by the Lower Dnieper Offensives  187  In early September 1943  the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland  following an Italian armistice with the Allies  188  Germany responded by disarming Italian forces  seizing military control of Italian areas  189  and creating a series of defensive lines  190  German special forces then rescued Mussolini  who then soon established a new client state in German occupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic  191  The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in mid November  192  German operations in the Atlantic also suffered  By May 1943  as Allied counter measures became increasingly effective  the resulting sizable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign  193  In November 1943  Franklin D  Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai shek in Cairo 194  and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran  195  The former conference determined the post war return of Japanese territory  194  while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany s defeat  195  British troops firing a mortar during the Battle of Imphal  North East India  1944  From November 1943  during the seven week Battle of Changde  the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition  while awaiting Allied relief  196  197  In January 1944  the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and attempted to outflank it with landings at Anzio  198  By the end of January  a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region  199  ending the longest and most lethal siege in history  The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re establish national independence  This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region  200  By late May 1944  the Soviets had liberated Crimea  largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine  and made incursions into Romania  which were repulsed by the Axis troops  201  The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and  at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat  on 4 June Rome was captured  202  The Allies experienced mixed fortunes in mainland Asia  In March 1944  the Japanese launched the first of two invasions  an operation against British positions in Assam  India  203  and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima  204  In May 1944  British forces mounted a counter offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma  204  and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina  205  The second Japanese invasion attempted to destroy China s main fighting forces  secure railways between Japanese held territory and capture Allied airfields  206  By June  the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a renewed attack against Changsha in the Hunan province  207  Allies close in Allied Invasion of Normandy  6 June 1944 On 6 June 1944  known as D Day   after three years of Soviet pressure  208  the Western Allies invaded northern France  After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy  they also attacked southern France  209  These landings were successful  and led to the defeat of the German Army units in France  Paris was liberated by the local resistance assisted by the Free French Forces on 25 August 210  and the Western Allies continued to push back German forces in Western Europe during the latter part of the year  An attempt to advance into northern Germany spear headed by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands ended with a failure  211  After that  the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany  unsuccessfully trying to cross the Rur river in a large offensive  In Italy the Allied advance also slowed down  when they ran into the last major German defensive line  Red Army personnel and equipment crossing a river during the northern Summer of 1944 On 22 June  the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus  known as  Operation Bagration   that resulted in the almost complete destruction of the German Army Group Centre  212  Soon after that  another Soviet strategic offensive forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland  The successful advance of Soviet troops prompted resistance forces in Poland to initiate several uprisings  though the largest of these  in Warsaw  as well as a Slovak Uprising in the south  were not assisted by the Soviets and were put down by German forces  213  The Red Army s strategic offensive in eastern Romania cut off and destroyed the considerable German troops there and triggered a successful coup d  tat in Romania and in Bulgaria  followed by those countries  shift to the Allied side  214  Polish insurgents during the Warsaw Uprising  In September 1944  Soviet Red Army troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of the German Army Groups E and F in Greece  Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off  215  By this point  the Communist led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito  who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941  controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and were engaged in delaying efforts against the German forces further south  In northern Serbia  the Red Army  with limited support from Bulgarian forces  assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October  A few days later  the Soviets launched a massive assault against German occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945  216  In contrast with impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans  the bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to the signing of Soviet Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions  217  218  with a subsequent shift to the Allied side by Finland  By the start of July  Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in Assam  pushing the Japanese back to the Chindwin River 219  while the Chinese captured Myitkyina  In China  the Japanese were having greater successes  having finally captured Changsha in mid June and the city of Hengyang by early August  220  Soon after  they further invaded the province of Guangxi  winning major engagements against Chinese forces at Guilin and Liuzhou by the end of November 221  and successfully linking up their forces in China and Indochina by the middle of December  222  In the Pacific  American forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter  In mid June 1944 they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands  and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the Battle of the Philippine Sea  These defeats led to the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister T j  and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands  In late October  American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte  soon after  Allied naval forces scored another large victory during the Battle of Leyte Gulf  one of the largest naval battles in history  223  Axis collapse  Allied victory American and Soviet troops meet in April 1945  east of the Elbe River  On 16 December 1944  Germany attempted its last desperate measure for success on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter offensive in the Ardennes to attempt to split the Western Allies  encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at Antwerp in order to prompt a political settlement  224  By January  the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled  224  In Italy  the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line  In mid January 1945  the Soviets attacked in Poland  pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany  and overran East Prussia  225  On 4 February  U S   British  and Soviet leaders met in Yalta  They agreed on the occupation of post war Germany  226  and when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan  227  In February  the Soviets invaded Silesia and Pomerania  while Western Allies invaded Western Germany and closed to the Rhine river  By March  the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr  encircling the German Army Group B  228  while the Soviets advanced to Vienna  In early April  the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across Western Germany  while Soviet forces stormed Berlin in late April  the two forces linked up on Elbe river on 25 April  On 30 April 1945  the Reichstag was captured  signalling the military defeat of Third Reich  229  A devastated Berlin street in the city centre post Battle of Berlin  taken 3 July 1945  Several changes in leadership occurred during this period  On 12 April  U S  President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by Harry Truman  Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April  230  Two days later  Hitler committed suicide  and was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl D nitz  231  German forces surrendered in Italy on 29 April  The German instrument of surrender was signed on 7 May in Rheims  232  and ratified on 8 May in Berlin  233  German Army Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May  234  In the Pacific theatre  American forces accompanied by the forces of the Philippine Commonwealth advanced in the Philippines  clearing Leyte by the end of April 1945  They landed on Luzon in January 1945 and captured Manila in March following a battle which reduced the city to ruins  Fighting continued on Luzon  Mindanao and other islands of the Philippines until the end of the war  235  Atomic explosion at Nagasaki  9 August 1945  In May 1945  Australian troops landed in Borneo  overrunning the oilfields there  British  American and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in northern Burma in March  and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by 3 May  236  Chinese forces started to counterattack in Battle of West Hunan that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945  American forces also moved towards Japan  taking Iwo Jima by March  and Okinawa by the end of June  237  American bombers destroyed Japanese cities  and American submarines cut off Japanese imports  238  On 11 July  the Allied leaders met in Potsdam  Germany  They confirmed earlier agreements about Germany  239  and reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of all Japanese forces by Japan  specifically stating that  the alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction   240  During this conference the United Kingdom held its general election  and Clement Attlee replaced Churchill as Prime Minister  241  When Japan continued to ignore the Potsdam terms  the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August  Between the two bombs  the Soviets  pursuant to the Yalta agreement  invaded Japanese held Manchuria  and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army  which was the largest Japanese fighting force  242  243  The Red Army also captured Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands  On 15 August 1945 Japan surrendered  with the surrender documents finally signed aboard the deck of the American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945  ending the war  232  Aftermath Main article  Aftermath of World War II The Supreme Commanders on 5 June 1945 in Berlin  Bernard Montgomery  Dwight D  Eisenhower  Georgy Zhukov and Jean de Lattre de Tassigny The Allies established occupation administrations in Austria and Germany  The former became a neutral state  non aligned with any political bloc  The latter was divided onto western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the USSR  accordingly  A denazification program in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals and the removal of ex Nazis from power  although this policy moved towards amnesty and re integration of ex Nazis into West German society  244  Germany lost a quarter of its pre war  1937  territory  the eastern territories  Silesia  Neumark and most of Pomerania were taken over by Poland  East Prussia was divided between Poland and the USSR  followed by the expulsion of the 9 million Germans from these provinces  as well as of 3 million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia  to Germany  By the 1950s  every fifth West German was a refugee from the east  The USSR also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon line  from which 2 million Poles were expelled   245  Eastern Romania  246  247  and part of eastern Finland 248  and three Baltic states  249  250  Prime Minister Winston Churchill gives the  Victory  sign to crowds in London on Victory in Europe Day  In an effort to maintain peace  251  the Allies formed the United Nations  which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945  252  and adopted The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948  as a common standard for all member nations  253  The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over  254  Germany had been de facto divided  and two independent states  Federal Republic of Germany and German Democratic Republic 255  were created within the borders of Allied and Soviet occupation zones  accordingly  The rest of Europe was also divided onto Western and Soviet spheres of influence  256  Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere  which led to establishment of Communist led regimes  with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities  As a result  Poland  Hungary  257 Czechoslovakia  258 Romania  Albania  259  and East Germany became Soviet Satellite states  Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy causing tension with the USSR  260  Post war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances  the United States led NATO and the Soviet led Warsaw Pact  261  the long period of political tensions and military competition between them  the Cold War  would be accompanied by unprecedented arms race and proxy wars  262  World map of colonization at the end of the Second World War in 1945  With the end of the war  the wars of national liberation ensued  leading to the creation of Israel  the often bloody decolonization of Asia and  somewhat later  of Africa  In Asia  the United States led the occupation of Japan and administrated Japan s former islands in the Western Pacific  while the Soviets annexed Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands  263 Korea  formerly under Japanese rule  was divided and occupied by the US in the South and the Soviet Union in the North between 1945 and 1948  Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948  each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea  which led ultimately to the Korean War  264  In China  nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in June 1946  Communist forces were victorious and established the People s Republic of China on the mainland  while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949  265  In the Middle East  the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of the Arab Israeli conflict  While European colonial powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires  their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful  leading to decolonisation  266  267  The global economy suffered heavily from the war  although participating nations were affected differently  The US emerged much richer than any other nation  it had a baby boom and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers and it dominated the world economy  268  269  The UK and US pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany in the years 1945 1948  270  Due to international trade interdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and delayed European recovery for several years  271  272  Recovery began with the mid 1948 currency reform in Western Germany  and was sped up by the liberalization of European economic policy that the Marshall plan  1948 1951  both directly and indirectly caused  273  274  The post 1948 West German recovery has been called the German economic miracle  275  Also the Italian 276  277  and French economies rebounded  278  By contrast  the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin  279  and continued relative economic decline for decades  280  The Soviet Union  despite enormous human and material losses  also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate post war era  281  Japan experienced incredibly rapid economic growth  becoming one of the most powerful economies in the world by the 1980s  282  China returned to its pre war industrial production by 1952  283  Impact Casualties and war crimes Main articles  World War II casualties and War crimes during World War II World War II deaths Estimates for the total casualties of the war vary  because many deaths went unrecorded  Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war  including about 20 million soldiers and 40 million civilians  284  285  286  Many civilians died because of disease  starvation  massacres  bombing and deliberate genocide  The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people during the war  287  including 8 7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths  The largest portion of military dead were ethnic Russians  5 756 000   followed by ethnic Ukrainians  1 377 400   288  One of every four Soviet citizens was killed or wounded in that war  289  Germany sustained 5 3 million military losses  mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany  290  Of the total deaths in World War II approximately 85 percent mostly Soviet and Chinese were on the Allied side and 15 percent on the Axis side  Many of these deaths were caused by war crimes committed by German and Japanese forces in occupied territories  An estimated 11 291  to 17 292  million civilians died as a direct or indirect result of Nazi ideological policies  including the systematic genocide of around six million Jews during The Holocaust along with a further five million Roma  homosexuals as well as Slavs and other ethnic and minority groups  293  Roughly 7 5 million civilians died in China under Japanese occupation  294  and hundreds of thousands  varying estimates  of ethnic Serbs  along with gypsies and Jews  were murdered by the Axis aligned Croatian Usta e in what would become Yugoslavia  with retribution related killings of Croatian civilians later in the war  295  Chinese civilians to be buried alive by Japanese soldiers  The best known Japanese atrocity was the Nanking Massacre  in which several hundred thousand Chinese civilians were raped and murdered  296  Between 3 million to more than 10 million civilians  mostly Chinese  were killed by the Japanese occupation forces  297  Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported 2 7 million casualties occurred during the Sank  Sakusen  General Yasuji Okamura implemented the policy in Heipei and Shantung  298  The Axis forces employed limited biological and chemical weapons  The Italians used mustard gas during their conquest of Abyssinia  299  while the Imperial Japanese Army used a variety of such weapons during their invasion and occupation of China  see Unit 731  300  301  and in early conflicts against the Soviets  302  Both the Germans and Japanese tested such weapons against civilians 303  and  in some cases  on prisoners of war  304  While many of the Axis s acts were brought to trial in the world s first international tribunals  305 incidents caused by the Allies were not  Examples of such Allied actions include population transfers in the Soviet Union and Japanese American internment in the United States  the Operation Keelhaul  306 expulsion of Germans after World War II  mass rape of German women by Soviet Red Army  the Soviet Union s Katyn massacre  for which Germans faced counter accusations of responsibility  Large numbers of famine deaths can also be partially attributed to the war  such as the Bengal famine of 1943 and the Vietnamese famine of 1944 45  307  It has been suggested by some historians who   that the mass bombing of civilian areas in enemy territory  including Tokyo and most notably the German cities of Dresden  Hamburg and Cologne by Western Allies  308  which resulted in the destruction of more than 160 cities and the deaths of more than 600 000 German civilians 309  be considered as war crimes  Concentration camps and slave work Further information  The Holocaust  Consequences of German Nazism  Japanese war crimes  and Allied war crimes during World War II The Nazis were responsible for The Holocaust  the killing of approximately six million Jews  overwhelmingly Ashkenazim   as well as two million ethnic Poles and four million others who were deemed  unworthy of life   including the disabled and mentally ill  Soviet POWs  homosexuals  Freemasons  Jehovah s Witnesses  and Romani  as part of a programme of deliberate extermination  About 12 million  most of whom were Eastern Europeans  were employed in the German war economy as forced labourers  310  Dead bodies in the Mauthausen Gusen concentration camp after liberation  possibly political prisoners or Soviet POWs In addition to Nazi concentration camps  the Soviet gulags  labour camps  led to the death of citizens of occupied countries such as Poland  Lithuania  Latvia  and Estonia  as well as German prisoners of war  POWs  and even Soviet citizens who had been or were thought to be supporters of the Nazis  311  Sixty percent of Soviet POWs of the Germans died during the war  312 Richard Overy gives the number of 5 7 million Soviet POWs  Of those  57 percent died or were killed  a total of 3 6 million  313  Soviet ex POWs and repatriated civilians were treated with great suspicion as potential Nazi collaborators  and some of them were sent to the GULAG upon being checked by the NKVD  314  Japanese prisoner of war camps  many of which were used as labour camps  also had high death rates  The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 1 percent  for American POWs  37 percent   315  seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians  316  While 37 583 prisoners from the UK  28 500 from the Netherlands  and 14 473 from United States were released after the surrender of Japan  the number for the Chinese was only 56  317  According to historian Zhifen Ju  at least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board  or K ain  for work in mines and war industries  After 1942  the number reached 10 million  318  The U S  Library of Congress estimates that in Java  between 4 and 10 million romusha  Japanese   manual laborers    were forced to work by the Japanese military  About 270 000 of these Javanese laborers were sent to other Japanese held areas in South East Asia  and only 52 000 were repatriated to Java  319  Mistreated and starved prisoners in the Mauthausen camp  Austria  1945 On 19 February 1942  Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066  interning thousands of Japanese  Italians  German Americans  and some emigrants from Hawaii who fled after the bombing of Pearl Harbor for the duration of the war  The U S  and Canadian governments interned 150 000 Japanese Americans  320  321  In addition  14 000 German and Italian residents of the U S  who had been assessed as being security risks were also interned  322  In accordance with the Allied agreement made at the Yalta conference millions of POWs and civilians were used as forced labor by the Soviet Union  323  In Hungary s case  Hungarians were forced to work for the Soviet Union until 1955  324  Home fronts and production Main articles  Military production during World War II and Home front during World War II Allied to Axis GDP ratio The Soviet T 34  the most produced tank of the war  going to the front  Over 57 000 T 34s had been built in the USSR by 1945  In Europe  before the outbreak of the war  the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics  In 1938  the Western Allies  United Kingdom  France  Poland and British Dominions  had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis  Germany and Italy   if colonies are included  it then gives the Allies more than a 5 1 advantage in population and nearly 2 1 advantage in GDP  325  In Asia at the same time  China had roughly six times the population of Japan  but only an 89 percent higher GDP  this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included  325  Though the Allies  economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan  they became the decisive factor by 1942  after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies  as the war largely settled into one of attrition  326  While the Allies  ability to out produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources  other factors  such as Germany and Japan s reluctance to employ women in the labour force  327  328  Allied strategic bombing  329  330  and Germany s late shift to a war economy 331  contributed significantly  Additionally  neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war  and were not equipped to do so  332  333  To improve their production  Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers  334 Germany used about 12 million people  mostly from Eastern Europe  310  while Japan pressed more than 18 million people in Far East Asia  318  319  Occupation Main articles  Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II  Resistance during World War II  and German occupied Europe Soviet partisans hanged by German forces in January 1943 An execution of Poles by an German Einsatzgruppe in Leszno  October 1939 In Europe  occupation came under two very different forms  In Western  Northern and Central Europe  France  Norway  Denmark  the Low Countries  and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia  Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69 5 billion reichmarks  27 8 billion US Dollars  by the end of the war  this figure does not include the sizable plunder of industrial products  military equipment  raw materials and other goods  335  Thus  the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation  a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on  336  In the East  the much hoped for bounties of Lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the German invaders  337  Unlike in the West  the Nazi racial policy encouraged excessive brutality against what it considered to be the  inferior people  of Slavic descent  most German advances were thus followed by mass executions  338  Although resistance groups did form in most occupied territories  they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East 339  or the West 340  until late 1943  In Asia  Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the Greater East Asia Co prosperity Sphere  essentially a Japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples  341  Although Japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from European domination in many territories  their excessive brutality turned local public opinions against them within weeks  342  During Japan s initial conquest it captured 4 000 000 barrels  640 000 m3  of oil   5 5 105 tonnes  left behind by retreating Allied forces  and by 1943 was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels   6 8 10 6 t   76 percent of its 1940 output rate  342  Advances in technology and warfare Main article  Technology during World War II Aircraft were used for reconnaissance  as fighters  bombers and ground support  and each role was advanced considerably  Innovation included airlift  the capability to quickly move limited high priority supplies  equipment and personnel   343  and of strategic bombing  the bombing of civilian areas to destroy industry and morale   344 Anti aircraft weaponry also advanced  including defences such as radar and surface to air artillery  such as the German 88 mm gun  The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered  and though late introduction meant it had little impact  it led to jets becoming standard in worldwide air forces  345  U 995 Type VIIC at the German navy memorial at Laboe  Between 1939 and 1945  3 500 Allied merchant ships were sunk at a cost of 783 German U boats  Advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare  most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines  Although at the start of the war aeronautical warfare had relatively little success  actions at Taranto  Pearl Harbor  the South China Sea and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship  346  347  348  In the Atlantic  escort carriers proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys  increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid Atlantic gap  349  Carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft 350  and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured  351  Submarines  which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War 352  were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second  The British focused development on anti submarine weaponry and tactics  such as sonar and convoys  while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability  with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics  353  Gradually  improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh light  hedgehog  squid  and homing torpedoes proved victorious  Land warfare changed from the static front lines of World War I to increased mobility and combined arms  The tank  which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War  had evolved into the primary weapon  354  In the late 1930s  tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I  355  and advances continued throughout the war in increasing speed  armour and firepower  Boeing B 17E in flight  The Allies had lost 160 000 airmen and 33 700 planes during the air war over Europe  356  At the start of the war  most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications  357  This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour  and German doctrine of avoiding tank versus tank combat  This  along with Germany s use of combined arms  were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France  354  Many means of destroying tanks  including indirect artillery  anti tank guns  both towed and self propelled   mines  short ranged infantry antitank weapons  and other tanks were utilised  357  Even with large scale mechanisation  infantry remained the backbone of all forces  358  and throughout the war  most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I  359  The portable machine gun spread  a notable example being the German MG42  and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings  359  The assault rifle  a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun  became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces  360  361  Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security presented by using large codebooks for cryptography with the use of ciphering machines  the most well known being the German Enigma machine  362 SIGINT  signals intelligence  was the countering process of decryption  with the notable examples being the Allied breaking of Japanese naval codes 363  and British Ultra  which was derived from methodology given to Britain by the Polish Cipher Bureau  which had been decoding Enigma for seven years before the war  364  Another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception  which the Allies used to great effect  such as in operations Mincemeat and Bodyguard  363  365  Other technological and engineering feats achieved during  or as a result of  the war include the world s first programmable computers  Z3  Colossus  and ENIAC   guided missiles and modern rockets  the Manhattan Project s development of nuclear weapons and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English Channel  366  See also World War II portal War portal Main article  Outline of World War II Air warfare
