Science fiction film From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search This article needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to

are not necessarily accepted by mainstream science  such as extraterrestrial life forms  alien worlds  extrasensory perception  and time travel  often along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft  robots  cyborgs  interstellar space travel or other technologies  Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues  and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition  In many cases  tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held  1  The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema  when Georges Melies  A Trip to the Moon  1902  amazed audiences with its trick photography effects  The next major example in the genre was the 1927 film Metropolis  From the 1930s to the 1950s  the genre consisted mainly of low budget B movies  After Stanley Kubrick s 1968 landmark 2001  A Space Odyssey  the science fiction film genre was taken more seriously  In the late 1970s  big budget science fiction films filled with special effects became popular with audiences after the success of Star Wars and paved the way for the blockbuster hits of subsequent decades  Contents 1 Definition 2 History 2 1 1900 1920s 2 2 1930s 1950s 2 3 1960s 2 4 1970s 1980s 2 5 1990s

precisely which films belong to the science fiction genre is often difficult  as there is no universally accepted definition of the genre  or in fact its underlying genre in literature  According to one definition  Science fiction film is a film genre which emphasizes actual  extrapolative  or speculative science and the empirical method  interacting in a social context with the lesser emphasized  but still present  transcendentalism of magic and religion  in an attempt to reconcile man with the unknown  Sobchack 63   This definition assumes that a continuum exists between  real world  empiricism and  supernatural  transcendentalism  with science fiction film on the side of empiricism  and horror film and fantasy film on the side of transcendentalism  However  there are numerous well known examples of science fiction horror films  epitomized by such pictures as Frankenstein and Alien  The visual style of science fiction film can be characterized by a clash between alien and familiar images  This clash is implemented when alien images become familiar  as in A Clockwork Orange  when the repetitions of the Korova Milkbar make the alien decor seem more familiar  2  As well  familiar images become alien  as in the films Repo Man and Liquid Sky  3  For example  in Dr  Strangelove  the distortion of the humans make the familiar images seem more alien  4  Finally  alien and familiar images are juxtaposed  as in The Deadly Mantis  when a giant praying mantis is shown climbing the Washington Monument  Cultural theorist Scott Bukatman has proposed that science fiction film allows contemporary culture to witness an expression of the sublime  be it through exaggerated scale  apocalypse or transcendence   edit  History Main article  History of science fiction films  edit  1900 1920s See also  List of science fiction films  Pre 1920 and List of science fiction films  1920s Science fiction films appeared early in the silent film era  typically as short films shot in black and white  sometimes with colour tinting  They usually had a technological theme and were often intended to be humorous  In 1902  Georges M li s released Le Voyage dans la Lune  generally considered the first science fiction film  5  and a film that used early trick photography to depict a spacecraft s journey to the moon  Several early films merged the science fiction and horror genres  Examples of this are Frankenstein  1910   a film adaptation of Mary Shelley s novel  and Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  1920   based on the psychological tale by Robert Lewis Stevenson  Taking a more adventurous tack  20 000 Leagues Under the Sea  1916  is a film based on Jules Verne s famous novel of a wondrous submarine and its vengeful captain  In the 1920s  European filmmakers tended to use science fiction for prediction and social commentary  as can be seen in German films such as Metropolis  1927  and Frau im Mond  1929   Other notable science fiction films of the silent era include The Impossible Voyage  1904   The Motorist  1906   Conquest of the Pole  1912   Himmelskibet  1918   The Cabinet of Dr  Caligari  1919   L Huomo Meccanico  1921   Paris Qui Dort  1923   Aelita

In the 1930s there were several big budget science fiction films  notably Just Imagine  1930   King Kong  1933   Things to Come  1936  and Lost Horizon  1937   Starting in 1936  a number of science fiction comic strips were adapted as serials  notably Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers  both starring Buster Crabbe  These serials  and the comic strips they were based on  were very popular with the general public  Other notable science fiction films of the 1930s include Frankenstein  1931   The Bride of Frankenstein  1935   Doctor X  1932   Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  1931   F P 1  1932   Island of

Walking Dead  1936   Non Stop New York  1937   and The Return of Doctor X  1939   The 1940s brought us Before I Hang  1940   Black Friday  1940   Dr  Cyclops  1940   The Devil Commands  1941   Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  1941   Man Made Monster  1941  It Happened Tomorrow  1944   It Happens Every Spring  1949   and The Perfect Woman  1949   The release of Destination Moon  1950  and Rocketship X M  1950  brought us to what many people consider  the golden age of the science fiction film   In the 1950s public interest in space travel and new technologies was great  While many 1950s science fiction films were low budget B movies  there were several successful films with larger budgets and impressive special effects  These include The Day the Earth Stood Still  1951   The Thing from Another World  1951   When Worlds Collide  1951   The War of the Worlds  1952   20 000 Leagues Under the Sea  1954   This Island Earth  1955   Forbidden Planet  1956   Invasion of the Body Snatchers  1956   The Curse of Frankenstein  1957   Journey to the Center of the Earth  1959  and On the Beach  1959   There is often a close connection between films in the science fiction genre and the so called  monster movie   Examples of this are Them   1954   The Beast From 20 000 Fathoms  1953   and The Blob  1958   During the 1950s  Ray Harryhausen  protege of master King Kong animator Willis O Brien  used stop motion animation to create special effects for the following notable science fiction films  It Came from Beneath the Sea  1955   Earth vs  the Flying Saucers  1956  and 20 Million Miles to Earth  1957    edit  1960s See also  List of science fiction films  1960s There were relatively few science fiction films in the 1960s  but some of the films transformed science fiction cinema  Stanley Kubrick s 2001  A Space Odyssey  1968  brought new realism to the genre  with its groundbreaking visual effects and realistic portrayal of space travel and influenced the genre with its epic story and transcendent philosophical scope  Other 1960s films included Planet of the Apes  1968  and Fahrenheit 451  1966   which provided social commentary  and the campy Barbarella  1968   which explored the sillier side of earlier science fiction  Jean Luc Godard s French  new wave  film Alphaville  1965  posited a futuristic Paris commanded by an artificial intelligence which has outlawed all emotion  Another influential science fiction film of the 1960s  though it was never produced  was Satyajit Ray s The Alien  a story about a boy in Bengal befriending an alien  After production of the film was cancelled  the script became available throughout America in mimeographed copies  6   edit  1970s 1980s See also  List of science fiction films  1970s and List of science fiction films  1980s The era of manned trips to the moon in 1969 and the 1970s saw a resurgence of interest in the science fiction film  Andrei Tarkovsky s slow paced Solaris  1972  had visuals and a philosophic scope reminiscent of 2001  A Space Odyssey  Science fiction films from the early 1970s explored the theme of paranoia  in which humanity is depicted as under threat from ecological or technological adversaries of its own creation  such as Silent Running  ecology   Westworld  man vs  robot   THX 1138  man vs  the state   and Stanley Kubrick s A Clockwork Orange  threat of brainwashing   Conspiracy thriller films of the 1970s included Soylent Green and Futureworld  The science fiction comedies of the 1970s included Woody Allen s Sleeper and John Carpenter s Dark Star  Star Wars  1977  and Close Encounters of the Third Kind  1978   were box office hits that brought about a huge increase in science fiction films  In 1979  Star Trek  The Motion Picture brought the television series to the big screen for the first time  It was also in this period that The Walt Disney Company released many science fiction films for family audiences such as The Island at the Top of the World  Escape to Witch Mountain  The Black Hole  Flight of the Navigator  and Honey  I Shrunk The Kids  Ridley Scott s films  such as Alien and Blade Runner  along with James Cameron s The Terminator  presented the future as dark  dirty and chaotic  and depicted aliens and androids as hostile and dangerous  In contrast  Steven Spielberg s E T  the Extra Terrestrial  one of the most successful films of the 1980s  presented aliens as benign and friendly  The big budget adaptations of Frank Herbert s Dune  Alex Raymond s Flash Gordon and Arthur C  Clarke s sequel to 2001  2010  were box office duds that dissuaded producers from investing in science fiction literary properties  Disney s Tron turned out to be a moderate success  The strongest contributors to the genre during the second half of the 1980s were James Cameron and Paul Verhoeven with The Terminator and RoboCop entries  Robert Zemeckis  1985 film Back to the Future and its sequels were critically praised and became box office successes  not to mention international phenomena  James Cameron s 1986 sequel to Alien  Aliens  was very different from the original film  falling more into the action science fiction genre  it was both a critical and commercial success and Sigourney Weaver was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the Academy Awards  The Japanese anime film Akira  1988  also had a big influence outside Japan when released   edit  1990s 2000s See also  List of science fiction films  1990s and List of science fiction films  2000s In the 1990s  the emergence of the world wide web and the cyberpunk genre spawned several movies on the theme of the computer human interface  such as Total Recall  1990   The Lawnmower Man  1992   and The Matrix  1999   Other themes included disaster films  e g   Armageddon and Deep Impact both from 1998   alien invasion  e g   Independence Day from 1996  and genetic experimentation  e g   Jurassic Park from 1993 and Gattaca from 1997   As the decade progressed  computers played an increasingly important role in both the addition of special effects  thanks to Terminator 2 Judgment Day  and Jurassic Park  and the production of films  As software developed in sophistication it was used to produce more complicated effects  It also enabled filmmakers to enhance the visual quality of animation  resulting in films such as Ghost in the Shell  1995  from Japan  and The Iron Giant  1999  from the US  During the first decade of the 2000s  superhero films abounded  as did earthbound science fiction such as the Matrix trilogy  In 2005  the Star Wars saga was completed with the darkly themed Star Wars Episode III  Revenge of the Sith  Science fiction also returned as a tool for political commentary in films such as A I  Artificial Intelligence  Minority Report  Sunshine  District 9  Children of Men  Serenity and Pandorum   edit  Themes  imagery  and visual elements Science fiction films are often speculative in nature  and often include key supporting elements of science and technology  However  as often as not the  science  in a Hollywood science fiction movie can be considered pseudo science  relying primarily on atmosphere and quasi scientific artistic fancy than facts and conventional scientific theory  The definition can also vary depending on the viewpoint of the observer  citation needed  Many science fiction films include elements of mysticism  occult  magic  or the supernatural  considered by some to be more properly elements of fantasy or the occult  or religious  film  citation needed  This transforms the movie genre into a science fantasy with a religious or quasi religious philosophy serving as the driving motivation  The movie Forbidden Planet employs many common science fiction elements  but the film carries a profound message   that the evolution of a species toward technological perfection  in this case exemplified by the disappeared alien civilization called the  Krell   does not ensure the loss of primitive and dangerous urges  citation needed  In the film this part of the primitive mind manifests itself as monstrous destructive force emanating from the freudian subconscious  or  Id   Some films blur the line between the genres  such as films where the protagonist gains the extraordinary powers of the superhero  These films usually employ a quasi plausible reason for the hero gaining these powers  citation needed  Not all science fiction themes are equally suitable for movies  In addition to science fiction horror  space opera is most common  citation needed  Often enough  these films could just as well pass as westerns or World War II films if the science fiction props were removed  citation needed  Common motifs also include voyages and expeditions to other planets  and dystopias  while utopias are rare  citation needed   edit  Imagery Film theorist Vivian Sobchack argues that science fiction films differ from fantasy films in that while science fiction film seeks to achieve our belief in the images we are viewing  fantasy film instead attempts to suspend our disbelief  The science fiction film displays the unfamiliar and alien in the context of the familiar  Despite the alien nature of the scenes and science fictional elements of the setting  the imagery of the film is related back to mankind and how we relate to our surroundings  While the sf film strives to push the boundaries of the human experience  they remain bound to the conditions and understanding of the audience and thereby contain prosaic aspects  rather than being completely alien or abstract  citation needed  Genre films such as westerns or war movies are bound to a particular area or time period  This is not true of the science fiction film  However there are several common visual elements that are evocative of the genre  These include the spacecraft or space station  alien worlds or creatures  robots  and futuristic gadgets  More subtle visual clues can appear with changes of the human form through modifications in appearance  size  or behavior  or by means a known environment turned eerily alien  such as an empty city  citation needed   edit  Scientific elements Peter Sellers as the title character from Dr  Strangelove While science is a major element of this genre  many movie studios take significant liberties with scientific knowledge  Such liberties can be most readily observed in films that show spacecraft maneuvering in outer space  The vacuum should preclude the transmission of sound or maneuvers employing wings  yet the sound track is filled with inappropriate flying noises and changes in flight path resembling an aircraft banking  The film makers  unfamiliar with the specifics of space travel  focus instead on providing acoustical atmosphere and the more familiar maneuvers of the aircraft  Similar instances of ignoring science in favor of art can be seen when movies present environmental effects  Entire planets are destroyed in titanic explosions requiring mere seconds  whereas an actual event of this nature would likely take many hours  The role of the scientist has varied considerably in the science fiction film genre  depending on the public perception of science and advanced technology  citation needed  Starting with Dr  Frankenstein  the mad scientist became a stock character who posed a dire threat to society and perhaps even civilization  Certain portrayals of the  mad scientist   such as Peter Sellers s performance in Dr  Strangelove  have become iconic to the genre  citation needed  In the monster films of the 1950s  the scientist often played a heroic role as the only person who could provide a technological fix for some impending doom  Reflecting the distrust of government that began in the 1960s in the U S   the brilliant but rebellious scientist became a common theme  often serving a Cassandra like role during an impending disaster   edit  Alien life forms Main article  Extraterrestrial life in popular culture The concept of life  particularly intelligent life  having an extraterrestrial origin is a popular staple of science fiction films  Early films often used alien life forms as a threat or peril to the human race  where the invaders were frequently fictional representations of actual military or political threats on Earth  Later some aliens were represented as benign and even beneficial in nature in such films as Escape to Witch Mountain  E T  the Extra Terrestrial  and Close Encounters  In order to provide subject matter to which audiences can relate  the large majority of intelligent alien races presented in films have an anthropomorphic nature  possessing human emotions and motivations  In films like Contact  The Box and The Day the Earth Stood Still  the aliens were nearly human in physical appearance  and communicated in a common earth tongue  A few films have tried to represent intelligent aliens as something utterly different from the usual humanoid shape  e g  An intelligent life form surrounding an entire planet in Solaris  the ball shaped creature in Dark Star    edit  Disaster films Main article  Disaster film A frequent theme among science fiction films is that of impending or actual disaster on an epic scale  These often address a particular concern of the writer by serving as a vehicle of warning against a type of activity  including technological research  In the case of alien invasion films  the creatures can provide as a stand in for a feared foreign power  Disaster films typically fall into the following general categories  citation needed  Alien invasion   hostile extraterrestrials arrive and seek to supplant humanity  They are either overwhelmingly powerful or very insidious  Typical examples include The War of the Worlds  1953 film  and Invasion of the Body Snatchers  1956 film   Environmental disaster   such as major climate change  or an asteroid or comet strike  Movies that have employed this theme include Soylent Green  1973  and Waterworld  1995   Man supplanted by technology   typically in the form of an all powerful computer  advanced robots or cyborgs  or else genetically modified humans or animals  Among the films in this category are The Terminator  1984  and The Matrix  1999   Nuclear war   usually in the form of a dystopic  post holocaust tale of grim survival  Examples of such a storyline can be found in the movies Dr  Strangelove  1964   Planet of the Apes  1968   A Boy and His Dog  1975  and Mad Max  1979   Pandemic   a highly lethal disease  often one created by man  threatens or wipes out most of humanity in a massive plague  This topic has been treated in such films as The Andromeda Strain  1971   The Omega Man  1971   and 12 Monkeys  1995    edit  Monster films Main article  Monster movie While monster films do not usually depict danger on a global or epic scale  science fiction film also has a long tradition of movies featuring monster attacks  These differ from similar films in the horror or fantasy genres because science fiction films typically rely on a scientific  or at least pseudo scientific  rationale for the monster s existence  rather than a supernatural or magical reason  Often  the science fiction film monster is created  awakened  or  evolves  because of the machinations of a mad scientist  a nuclear accident  or a scientific experiment gone awry  Typical examples include The Beast from 20 000 Fathoms  1953   Cloverfield and the Godzilla series of films   edit  Mind and identity The core mental aspects of what makes us human has been a staple of science fiction films  particularly since the 1980s  Blade Runner examined what made an organic creation a human  while the RoboCop series saw an android mechanism fitted with the brain and reprogrammed mind of a human to create a cyborg  The idea of brain transfer was not entirely new to science fiction film  as the concept of the  mad scientist  transferring the human mind to another body is as old as Frankenstein  Films such as Total Recall have popularized a thread of films that explore the concept of reprogramming the human mind  The theme of brainwashing in several films of the sixties and seventies including A Clockwork Orange and The Manchurian Candidate coincided with secret real life government experimentation during Project MKULTRA  Voluntary erasure of memory is further explored as themes of the films Paycheck and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  The anime series Serial Experiments Lain also explores the idea of reprogrammable reality and memory  The idea that a human could be entirely represented as a program in a computer was a core element of the film Tron  This would be further explored in the film version of The Lawnmower Man  and the idea reversed in Virtuosity as computer programs sought to become real persons  In the Matrix series  the virtual reality world became a real world prison for humanity  managed by intelligent machines  In eXistenZ  the nature of reality and virtual reality become intermixed with no clear distinguishing boundary   edit  Robots Robots have been a part of science fiction since the Czech playwright Karel  apek coined the word in 1921  In early films  robots were usually played by a human actor in a boxy metal suit  as in The Phantom Empire  although the female robot in Metropolis is an exception  The first depiction of a sophisticated robot in a United States film was in The Day the Earth Stood Still  Robots in films are often sentient and sometimes sentimental  and they have filled a range of roles in science fiction films  Robots have been supporting characters  such as Robby the Robot in Forbidden Planet  sidekicks  e g   C 3PO and R2 D2 from Star Wars   and extras  visible in the background to create a futuristic setting  As well  robots have been formidable movie villains or monsters  e g   the robot Box in the 1976 film Logan s Run  In some cases  robots have even been the leading characters in science fiction films  in the 1982 film Blade Runner  many of the characters are bioengineered android  replicants   Films like Bicentennial Man and A I  Artificial Intelligence depicted the emotional fallouts of robots that are self aware  One popular theme in science fiction film is whether robots will someday replace humans  a question raised in the film adaptation of Isaac Asimov s I  Robot  or whether intelligent robots could develop a conscience and a motivation to take over or destroy the human race  as depicted in The Terminator    edit  Time travel Main article  Time travel in fiction The concept of time travel travelling backwards and forwards through time has always been a popular staple of science fiction film and science fiction television series  Time travel usually involves the use of some type of advanced technology  such as H  G  Wells  classic The Time Machine  or the commercially successful 1980s era Back to the Future trilogy  Other movies  such as the Planet of the Apes series  explained their depictions of time travel by drawing on physics concepts such as the Special relativity phenomenon of time dilation  which could occur if a spaceship was travelling near the speed of light   Some films show time travel not being attained from advanced technology  but rather from an inner source or personal power  such as the 2000s era films Donnie Darko and The Butterfly Effect  More conventional time travel movies use technology to bring the past to life in the present  or in a present that lies in our future  The film Iceman  1984  told the story of the reanimation of a frozen Neanderthal  The film Freejack  1992  shows time travel used to pull victims of horrible deaths forward in time a split second before their demise  and then use their bodies for spare parts  A common theme in time travel film is the paradoxical nature of travelling through time  In the French New Wave film La jet e  1962   director Chris Marker depicts the self fulfilling aspect of a person being able to see their future by showing a child who witnesses the death of his future self  La Jet e was the inspiration for 12 Monkeys   1995  director Terry Gilliam s film about time travel  memory  and madness  The Back to the Future series goes one step further and explores the result of altering the past  while in Star Trek  First Contact  1996  the crew must rescue the Earth from having its past altered by time travelling cyborgs   edit  Genre as commentary on social issues The science fiction film genre has long served as a useful vehicle for  safely  discussing controversial topical issues and often providing thoughtful social commentary on potential unforeseen future issues  Presentation of issues that are difficult or disturbing for an audience  can be made more acceptable when they are explored in a future setting or on a different  earth like world  The altered context can allow for deeper examination and reflection of the ideas presented  with the perspective of a viewer watching remote events  Most controversial issues in science fiction films tend to fall into two general story lines  Utopian or dystopian  Either a society will become better or worse in the future  Because of controversy  most science fiction films will fall into the dystopian film category rather than the Utopian category  The types of commentary and controversy presented in science fiction films often illustrate the particular concerns of the periods in which they were produced  Early science fiction films expressed fears about automation replacing workers and the dehumanization of society through science and technology  For example  1951 s The Man in the White Suit used a science fiction concept as a means to satirize postwar British  establishment  conservatism  industrial capitalists  and trade unions  Later films explored the fears of environmental catastrophe or technology created disasters  and how they would impact society and individuals  i e  Soylent Green   The monster movies of the 1950s like Godzilla  1954  served as stand ins for fears of nuclear war  communism and views on the cold war  citation needed  In the 1970s  science fiction films also became an effective way of satirizing contemporary social mores with Silent Running and Dark Star presenting hippies in space as a riposte to the militaristic types that had dominated earlier films  citation needed Stanley Kubrick s A Clockwork Orange presented a horrific vision of youth culture  portraying a youth gang engaged in rape and murder  along with disturbing scenes of forced psychological conditioning serving to comment on societal responses to crime  Logan s Run depicted a futuristic swingers utopia that practiced euthanasia as a form of population control and The Stepford Wives anticipated a reaction to the women s liberation movement  Enemy Mine demonstrated that the foes we have come to hate are often just like us  even if they appear alien  Contemporary science fiction films continue to explore social and political issues  One recent example would be 2002 s Minority Report  debuting in the months after the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001 and focused on the issues of police powers  privacy and civil liberties in the near future United States  Some like Never Let Me Go explore the issues surrounding cloning  More recently  the headlines surrounding events such as the Iraq War  international terrorism  the avian influenza scare  and U S  anti immigration laws have found their way into the consciousness of contemporary filmmakers  The 2006 film V for Vendetta drew inspiration from controversial issues such as The Patriot Act and the War on Terror  while science fiction thrillers such as Children of Men  also 2006  and District 9  2009  commented on diverse social issues such as xenophobia  propaganda  and cognitive dissonance  Avatar  2009  had remarkable resemblance to colonialism of native land  mining by multinational corporations and the Iraq War   edit  Future Noir Lancaster University professor Jamaluddin Bin Aziz argues that as science fiction has evolved and expanded  it has fused with other film genres such as gothic thrillers and film noir  When science fiction integrates film noir elements  Bin Aziz calls the resulting hybrid form  future noir   a form which      encapsulates a postmodern encounter with generic persistence  creating a mixture of irony  pessimism  prediction  extrapolation  bleakness and nostalgia   Future noir films such as Blade Runner  Twelve Monkeys  Dark City  and Children of Men use a protagonist who is     increasingly dubious  alienated and fragmented   at once  dark and playful like the characters in Gibson s Neuromancer   yet still with the     shadow of Philip Marlowe     Future noir films that are set in a post apocalyptic world     restructure and re represent society in a parody of the atmospheric world usually found in noir s construction of a city   dark  bleak and beguiled   Future noir films often intermingle elements of the gothic thriller genre  such as Minority Report  which makes references to occult practices  and Alien  with its tagline  In space  no one can hear you scream   and a space vessel  Nostromo   that hark s  back to images of the haunted house in the gothic horror tradition   Bin Aziz states that films such as James Cameron s The Terminator are a sub genre of  techno noir  that create     an atmospheric feast of noir darkness and a double edged world that is not what it seems   7   edit  Film versus literature When compared to science fiction literature  science fiction films often rely less on the human imagination and more upon action scenes and special effect created alien creatures and exotic backgrounds  Since the 1970s  film audiences have come to expect a high standard for special effects in science fiction films  In some cases  science fiction themed films superimpose an exotic  futuristic setting onto what would not otherwise be a science fiction tale  Nevertheless  some critically acclaimed science fiction movies have followed in the path of science fiction literature  using story development to explore abstract concepts   edit  Influence of science fiction authors Jules Verne was the first major science fiction author to be adapted for the screen with Melies Le Voyage dans la Lune  1902  and 20 000 lieues sous les mers  1907   which used Verne s scenarios as a framework for fantastic visuals  By the time Verne s work fell out of copyright in 1950 the adaptations were treated as period pieces  His works have been adapted a number of times since then  including 20 000 Leagues Under the Sea in 1954  From the Earth to the Moon in 1958  and Journey to the Center of the Earth in 1959  2001  A Space Odyssey  the landmark 1968 collaboration between filmmaker Stanley Kubrick and classic science fiction author Arthur C  Clarke featured groundbreaking special effects  such as the realization of the space ship Discovery One  pictured here  H  G  Wells novels The Invisible Man  Things to Come and The Island of Doctor Moreau were all adapted into films during his lifetime while The War of the Worlds was updated in 1953 and again in 2005  adapted to film at least four times altogether  The Time Machine has had two film versions  1961 and 2002  while Sleeper in part is a pastiche of Wells  1910 novel The Sleeper Awakes  With the drop off in interest in science fiction films during the 1940s  few of the  golden age  science fiction authors made it to the screen  A novella by John W  Campbell provided the basis for The Thing from Another World  1951   Robert A  Heinlein contributed to the screenplay for Destination Moon in 1950  but none of his major works were adapted for the screen until the 1990s  The Puppet Masters in 1994 and Starship Troopers in 1997  Isaac Asimov s fiction influenced the Star Wars and Star Trek films  but it was not until 1988 that a film version of one of his short stories  Nightfall  was produced  The first major motion picture adaptation of a full length Asimov work was Bicentennial Man  1999   based on the short stories  Bicentennial Man  and  The Positronic Man   the latter co written with Robert Silverberg   although 2004 s I  Robot  a film loosely based on Asimov s book of short stories by the same name  drew more attention  The adaptation of science fiction author Arthur C  Clarke s novel as 2001  A Space Odyssey won the Academy Award for Visual Effects and offered thematic complexity not typically associated with the science fiction genre at the time  Its sequel  2010  was commercially successful but less highly regarded by critics  Reflecting the times  two earlier science fiction works by Ray Bradbury were adapted for cinema in the 1960s with Fahrenheit 451 and The Illustrated Man  Kurt Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse Five was filmed in 1971 and Breakfast of Champions in 1998  Philip K  Dick s fiction has been used in a number of science fiction films  in part because it evokes the paranoia that has been a central feature of the genre  Films based on Dick s works include Blade Runner  1982   Total Recall  1990   Impostor  2001   Minority Report  2002   Paycheck  2003   and A Scanner Darkly  2006   These films are loose adaptations of the original story  with the exception of A Scanner Darkly  which is close to Dick s book   edit  See also Science fiction  novels and short stories  List of science fiction films List of dystopian films
