Vampire From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search For other uses  see Vampire  disambiguation   The Vampire  by Philip Burne Jones  1897 Vampires are mythological or folkloric beings who subsist by feeding on the life essence  generally in the form of blood  of living creatures  regardless of whether they are undead or a living person  1  2  3  4  5  6  Although vampiric entities have been recorded in many cultures  and may go back to  prehistoric times   7  the term vampire was not popularized until the early 18th century  after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent  such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe  8  although local variants were also known by different names  such as vrykolakas in Greece and strigoi in Romania  This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism  While even folkloric vampires of the Balkans and Eastern Europe had a wide range of appearance ranging from nearly human to bloated rotting corpses  it was the success of John Polidori s 1819 novella The Vampyre that established the archetype of charismatic and sophisticated vampire  it is arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century  9  inspiring such works as Varney the Vampire and eventually Dracula  10 The Vampyre was itself based on Lord Byron s unfinished story  Fragment of a Novel   also known as  The Burial  A Fragment   published in 1819  However  it is Bram Stoker s 1897 novel Dracula that is remembered as the quintessential vampire novel and which provided the basis of modern vampire fiction  Dracula drew on earlier mythologies of werewolves and similar legendary demons and  was to voice the anxieties of an age   and the  fears of late Victorian patriarchy   11  The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire genre  still popular in the 21st century  with books  films  video games  and television shows  The vampire is such a dominant figure in the horror genre that literary historian Susan Sellers places the current vampire myth in the  comparative safety of nightmare fantasy   11  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Folk beliefs 2 1 Description and common attributes 2 1 1 Creating vampires 2 1 2 Identifying vampires 2 1 3 Protection 2 1 3 1

7 External links Etymology The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first appearance of the word vampire in English from 1734  in a travelogue titled Travels of Three English Gentlemen published in the Harleian Miscellany in 1745  12  13  Vampires had already been discussed in German literature  14  After Austria gained control of northern Serbia and Oltenia with the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718  officials noted the local practice of exhuming bodies and  killing vampires   14  These reports  prepared between 1725 and 1732  received widespread publicity  14  The English term was derived  possibly via French vampyre  from the German Vampir  in turn derived in the early 18th century from the Serbian        vampir  15  16  17  18  19  when Arnold Paole  a purported vampire in Serbia was described during the time Serbia was incorporated into the Austrian Empire  The Serbian form has parallels in virtually all Slavic languages  Bulgarian and Macedonian         vampir   Croatian vampir  Czech and Slovak up r  Polish w pierz  and  perhaps East Slavic influenced  upi r  Ukrainian       upyr   Russian        upyr    Belarusian       upyr   from Old East Slavic        upir     Note that many of these languages have also borrowed forms such as  vampir wampir  subsequently from the West  these are distinct from the original local words for the creature   The exact etymology is unclear  20  Among the proposed proto Slavic forms are   pyr  and   pir   21  Another  less widespread theory  is that the Slavic languages have borrowed the word from a Turkic term for  witch   e g   Tatar ubyr   21  22  The first recorded use of the Old Russian form        Upir   is commonly believed to be in a document dated 6555  1047 AD   23  It is a colophon in a manuscript of the Book of Psalms written by a priest who transcribed the book from Glagolitic into Cyrillic for the Novgorodian Prince Volodymyr Yaroslavovych  24  The priest writes that his name is  Upir  Likhyi                   which means something like  Wicked Vampire  or  Foul Vampire   25  This apparently strange name has been cited as an example both of surviving paganism and of the use of nicknames as personal names  26   It is also possible that  in this context  Upir is simply a transliteration of Norse name  pir  27   Another early use of the Old Russian word is in the anti pagan treatise  Word of Saint Grigoriy   dated variously to the 11th 13th centuries  where pagan worship of upyri is reported  28  29  Folk beliefs See also  List of vampires in folklore and mythology The notion of vampirism has existed for millennia  cultures such as the Mesopotamians  Hebrews  Ancient Greeks  and Romans had tales of demons and spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires  However  despite the occurrence of vampire like creatures in these ancient civilizations  the folklore for the entity we know today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th century southeastern Europe  8  when verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published  In most cases  vampires are revenants of evil beings  suicide victims  or witches  but they can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire  Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires  30  Description and common attributes Further information  List of vampire traits in folklore and fiction Vampyren   The Vampire   by Edvard Munch It is difficult to make a single  definitive description of the folkloric vampire  though there are several elements common to many European legends  Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance  and ruddy  purplish  or dark in colour  these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood  Indeed  blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin and its left eye was often open  31  It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in  and its teeth  hair  and nails may have grown somewhat  though in general fangs were not a feature  32  Creating vampires The causes of vampiric generation were many and varied in original folklore  In Slavic and Chinese traditions  any corpse that was jumped over by an animal  particularly a dog or a cat  was feared to become one of the undead  33  A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk  In Russian folklore  vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the Russian Orthodox Church while they were alive  34  Cultural practices often arose that were intended to prevent a recently deceased loved one from turning into an undead revenant  Burying a corpse upside down was widespread  as was placing earthly objects  such as scythes or sickles  35  near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin  This method resembles the Ancient Greek practice of placing an obolus in the corpse s mouth to pay the toll to cross the River Styx in the underworld  it has been argued that instead  the coin was intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body  and this may have influenced later vampire folklore  This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the vrykolakas  in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription  Jesus Christ conquers  were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire  36  Other methods commonly practised in Europe included severing the tendons at the knees or placing poppy seeds  millet  or sand on the ground at the grave site of a presumed vampire  this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains  37  indicating an association of vampires with arithmomania  Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire like being came across a sack of rice  it would have to count every grain  this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent  as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings  38  In Albanian folklore  the dhampir is the son of the karkanxholl or the lugat  If the karkanxholl sleeps with his wife  and she is impregnated with a child  the offspring is called dhampir and has the unique ability to discern the karkanxholl  from this derives the expression the dhampir knows the lugat  The lugat cannot be seen  he can only be killed by the dhampir  who himself is usually the son of a lugat  In different regions  animals can be revenants as lugats  also  living people during their sleep  Dhampiraj is also an Albanian surname  39  Identifying vampires Many elaborate rituals were used to identify a vampire  One method of finding a vampire s grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion the horse would supposedly baulk at the grave in question  34  Generally a black horse was required  though in Albania it should be white  40  Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken as a sign of vampirism  41  Corpses thought to be vampires were generally described as having a healthier appearance than expected  plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition  42  In some cases  when suspected graves were opened  villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face  43  Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle  sheep  relatives or neighbours  Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor poltergeist like activity  such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects  44  and pressing on people in their sleep  45  Protection An image from Max Ernst s Une Semaine de Bont  Apotropaics Apotropaics  items able to ward off revenants  are common in vampire folklore  Garlic is a common example  46  a branch of wild rose and hawthorn plant are said to harm vampires  and in Europe  sprinkling mustard seeds on the roof of a house was said to keep them away  47  Other apotropaics include sacred items  for example a crucifix  rosary  or holy water  Vampires are said to be unable to walk on consecrated ground  such as those of churches or temples  or cross running water  48  Although not traditionally regarded as an apotropaic  mirrors have been used to ward off vampires when placed  facing outwards  on a door  in some cultures  vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow  perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire s lack of a soul   49  This attribute  although not universal  the Greek vrykolakas tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow   was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers  50  Some traditions also hold that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner  although after the first invitation they can come and go as they please  49  Though folkloric vampires were believed to be more active at night  they were not generally considered vulnerable to sunlight  50  Methods of destruction Methods of destroying suspected vampires varied  with staking the most commonly cited method  particularly in southern Slavic cultures  51 Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states  52  or hawthorn in Serbia  53  with a record of oak in Silesia  54  Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart  though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany 55  56  and the stomach in north eastern Serbia  57  Piercing the skin of the chest was a way of  deflating  the bloated vampire  this is similar to the act of burying sharp objects  such as sickles  in with the corpse  so that they may penetrate the skin if the body bloats sufficiently while transforming into a revenant  58 Decapitation was the preferred method in German and western Slavic areas  with the head buried between the feet  behind the buttocks or away from the body  51  This act was seen as a way of hastening the departure of the soul  which in some cultures  was said to linger in the corpse  The vampire s head  body  or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising  59 Gypsies drove steel or iron needles into a corpse s heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth  over the eyes  ears and between the fingers at the time of burial  They also placed hawthorn in the corpse s sock or drove a hawthorn stake through the legs  In a 16th century burial near Venice  a brick forced into the mouth of a female corpse has been interpreted as a vampire slaying ritual by the archaeologists who discovered it in 2006  60  Further measures included pouring boiling water over the grave or complete incineration of the body  In the Balkans  a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned  by repeating the funeral service  by sprinkling holy water on the body  or by exorcism  In Romania  garlic could be placed in the mouth  and as recently as the 19th century  the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken  For resistant cases  the body was dismembered and the pieces burned  mixed with water  and administered to family members as a cure  In Saxon regions of Germany  a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires  61  Ancient beliefs Lilith  1892   by John Collier Tales of supernatural beings consuming the blood or flesh of the living have been found in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries  62  Today  we would associate these entities with vampires  but in ancient times  the term vampire did not exist  blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood  even the Devil was considered synonymous with the vampire  63  Almost every nation has associated blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon  or in some cases a deity  In India  for example  tales of vet las  ghoul like beings that inhabit corpses  have been compiled in the Bait l Pac s   a prominent story in the Kath sarits gara tells of King Vikram ditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one  64 Pi  ca  the returned spirits of evil doers or those who died insane  also bear vampiric attributes  65  The Persians were one of the first civilizations to have tales of blood drinking demons  creatures attempting to drink blood from men were depicted on excavated pottery shards  66  Ancient Babylonia and Assyria had tales of the mythical Lilitu  67  synonymous with and giving rise to Lilith  Hebrew        and her daughters the Lilu from Hebrew demonology  Lilitu was considered a demon and was often depicted as subsisting on the blood of babies  67  And Estries  female shape changing  blood drinking demons  were said to roam the night among the population  seeking victims  According to Sefer Hasidim  Estries were creatures created in the twilight hours before God rested  68  And injured Estrie could be healed by eating bread and salt given her by her attacker  Ancient Greek and Roman mythology described the Empusae  69  the Lamia  70  and the striges  Over time the first two terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively  Empusa was the daughter of the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic  bronze footed creature  She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood  69  The Lamia preyed on young children in their beds at night  sucking their blood  as did the gelloudes or Gello  70  Like the Lamia  the striges feasted on children  but also preyed on young men  They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general  and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix  a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood  71  Medieval and later European folklore Main article  Vampire folklore by region Many of the myths surrounding vampires originated during the medieval period  The 12th century English historians and chroniclers Walter Map and William of Newburgh recorded accounts of revenants  30  72  though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant  73  The Old Norse draugr is another medieval example of an undead creature with similarities to vampires  74  Vampires proper originate in folklore widely reported from Eastern Europe in the late 17th and 18th centuries  These tales formed the basis of the vampire legend that later entered Germany and England  where they were subsequently embellished and popularized  One of the earliest recordings of vampire activity came from the region of Istria in modern Croatia  in 1672  75  Local reports cited the local vampire Giure Grando of the village Khring near Tinjan as the cause of panic among the villagers  76  A former peasant  Guire died in 1656  however  local villagers claimed he returned from the dead and began drinking blood from the people and sexually harassing his widow  The village leader ordered a stake to be driven through his heart  but when the method failed to kill him  he was subsequently beheaded with better results  77  During the 18th century  there was a frenzy of vampire sightings in Eastern Europe  with frequent stakings and grave diggings to identify and kill the potential revenants  even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires  78  Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment  during which most folkloric legends were quelled  the belief in vampires increased dramatically  resulting in a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe  30  The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734  which spread to other localities  Two famous vampire cases  the first to be officially recorded  involved the corpses of Peter Plogojowitz and Arnold Paole from Serbia  Plogojowitz was reported to have died at the age of 62  but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food  When the son refused  he was found dead the following day  Plogojowitz supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood  78  In the second case  Paole  an ex soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before  died while haying  After his death  people began to die in the surrounding area and it was widely believed that Paole had returned to prey on the neighbours  79  Another famous Serbian legend involving vampires concentrates around a certain Sava Savanovi  living in a watermill and killing and drinking blood from millers  The character was later used in a story written by Serbian writer Milovan Gli i  and in the Serbian 1973 horror film Leptirica inspired by the story  The two incidents were well documented  government officials examined the bodies  wrote case reports  and published books throughout Europe  79  The hysteria  commonly referred to as the  18th Century Vampire Controversy   raged for a generation  The problem was exacerbated by rural epidemics of so claimed vampire attacks  undoubtedly caused by the higher amount of superstition that was present in village communities  with locals digging up bodies and in some cases  staking them  Although many scholars reported during this period that vampires did not exist  and attributed reports to premature burial or rabies  superstitious belief increased  Dom Augustine Calmet  a well respected French theologian and scholar  put together a comprehensive treatise in 1746  which was ambiguous concerning the existence of vampires  Calmet amassed reports of vampire incidents  numerous readers  including both a critical Voltaire and supportive demonologists  interpreted the treatise as claiming that vampires existed  80  In his Philosophical Dictionary  Voltaire wrote  81  These vampires were corpses  who went out of their graves at night to suck the blood of the living  either at their throats or stomachs  after which they returned to their cemeteries  The persons so sucked waned  grew pale  and fell into consumption  while the sucking corpses grew fat  got rosy  and enjoyed an excellent appetite  It was in Poland  Hungary  Silesia  Moravia  Austria  and Lorraine  that the dead made this good cheer  The controversy only ceased when Empress Maria Theresa of Austria sent her personal physician  Gerard van Swieten  to investigate the claims of vampiric entities  He concluded that vampires did not exist and the Empress passed laws prohibiting the opening of graves and desecration of bodies  sounding the end of the vampire epidemics  Despite this condemnation  the vampire lived on in artistic works and in local superstition  80  Non European beliefs Africa Various regions of Africa have folkloric tales of beings with vampiric abilities  in West Africa the Ashanti people tell of the iron toothed and tree dwelling asanbosam  82  and the Ewe people of the adze  which can take the form of a firefly and hunts children  83  The eastern Cape region has the impundulu  which can take the form of a large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning  and the Betsileo people of Madagascar tell of the ramanga  an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail clippings of nobles  3  The Americas The Loogaroo is an example of how a vampire belief can result from a combination of beliefs  here a mixture of French and African Vodu or voodoo  The term Loogaroo possibly comes from the French loup garou  meaning  werewolf   and is common in the culture of Mauritius  However  the stories of the Loogaroo are widespread through the Caribbean Islands and Louisiana in the United States  84  Similar female monsters are the Soucouyant of Trinidad  and the Tunda and Patasola of Colombian folklore  while the Mapuche of southern Chile have the bloodsucking snake known as the Peuchen  85 Aloe vera hung backwards behind or near a door was thought to ward off vampiric beings in South American superstition  38  Aztec mythology described tales of the Cihuateteo  skeletal faced spirits of those who died in childbirth who stole children and entered into sexual liaisons with the living  driving them mad  34  During the late 18th and 19th centuries the belief in vampires was widespread in parts of New England  particularly in Rhode Island and Eastern Connecticut  There are many documented cases of families disinterring loved ones and removing their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family  although the term  vampire  was never actually used to describe the deceased  The deadly disease tuberculosis  or  consumption  as it was known at the time  was believed to be caused by nightly visitations on the part of a dead family member who had died of consumption themselves  86  The most famous  and most recently recorded  case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen year old Mercy Brown  who died in Exeter  Rhode Island in 1892  Her father  assisted by the family physician  removed her from her tomb two months after her death  cut out her heart and burned it to ashes  87  Asia Rooted in older folklore  the modern belief in vampires spread throughout Asia with tales of ghoulish entities from the mainland  to vampiric beings from the islands of Southeast Asia  South Asia also developed other vampiric legends  The Bh ta or Pr t is the soul of a man who died an untimely death  It wanders around animating dead bodies at night  attacking the living much like a ghoul  88  In northern India  there is the Brahmar k hasa  a vampire like creature with a head encircled by intestines and a skull from which it drank blood  The figure of the Vetala who appears in South Asian legend and story may sometimes be rendered as  Vampire   see the section on  Ancient Beliefs  above   Although vampires have appeared in Japanese cinema since the late 1950s  the folklore behind it is western in origin  89  However  the Nukekubi is a being whose head and neck detach from its body to fly about seeking human prey at night  90  The manananggal of Philippine mythology  Legends of female vampire like beings who can detach parts of their upper body also occur in the Philippines  Malaysia and Indonesia  There are two main vampire like creatures in the Philippines  the Tagalog mandurugo   blood sucker   and the Visayan manananggal   self segmenter    The mandurugo is a variety of the aswang that takes the form of an attractive girl by day  and develops wings and a long  hollow  thread like tongue by night  The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim  The manananggal is described as being an older  beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge bat like wings and prey on unsuspecting  sleeping pregnant women in their homes  They use an elongated proboscis like tongue to suck fetuses from these pregnant women  They also prefer to eat entrails  specifically the heart and the liver  and the phlegm of sick people  91  The Malaysian Penanggalan may be either a beautiful old or young woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means  and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature  She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood  typically from pregnant women  92  Malaysians would hang jeruju  thistles  around the doors and windows of houses  hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns  93  The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore  94  A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia  95  or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia  96  is a woman who died during childbirth and became undead  seeking revenge and terrorizing villages  She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in the back of her neck  with which she sucked the blood of children  Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off  Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads  eggs under each armpit  and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir  97  Jiang Shi  simplified Chinese      traditional Chinese     or     pinyin  ji ngsh   literally  stiff corpse    sometimes called  Chinese vampires  by Westerners  are reanimated corpses that hop around  killing living creatures to absorb life essence  q   from their victims  They are said to be created when a person s soul    p   fails to leave the deceased s body  98  However  some have disputed the comparison of jiang shi with vampires  as jiang shi are usually mindless creatures with no independent thought  99  One unusual feature of this monster is its greenish white furry skin  perhaps derived from fungus or mould growing on corpses  100  Modern beliefs In modern fiction  the vampire tends to be depicted as a suave  charismatic villain  32  Despite the general disbelief in vampiric entities  occasional sightings of vampires are reported  Indeed  vampire hunting societies still exist  although they are largely formed for social reasons  30  Allegations of vampire attacks swept through the African country of Malawi during late 2002 and early 2003  with mobs stoning one individual to death and attacking at least four others  including Governor Eric Chiwaya  based on the belief that the government was colluding with vampires  101  In early 1970 local press spread rumours that a vampire haunted Highgate Cemetery in London  Amateur vampire hunters flocked in large numbers to the cemetery  Several books have been written about the case  notably by Sean Manchester  a local man who was among the first to suggest the existence of the  Highgate Vampire  and who later claimed to have exorcised and destroyed a whole nest of vampires in the area  102  In January 2005  rumours circulated that an attacker had bitten a number of people in Birmingham  England  fuelling concerns about a vampire roaming the streets  However  local police stated that no such crime had been reported and that the case appears to be an urban legend  103  In 2006  a phys ics pro f es sor at the University of Central Florida wrote a paper arguing that it is mathematically impossible for vampires to exist  based on geometric progression  According to the paper  if the first vampire had appeared on January 1  1600  and it fed once a month  which is less often than what is depicted in films and folklore   and every victim turned into a vampire  then within two and a half years the entire human population of the time would have become vampires  104  The paper made no attempt to address the credibility of the assumption that every vampire victim would turn into a vampire  In one of the more notable cases of vampiric entities in the modern age  the chupacabra   goat sucker   of Puerto Rico and Mexico is said to be a creature that feeds upon the flesh or drinks the blood of domesticated animals  leading some to consider it a kind of vampire  The  chupacabra hysteria  was frequently associated with deep economic and political crises  particularly during the mid 1990s  105  In Europe  where much of the vampire folklore originates  the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being  although many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes  In some cases  especially in small localities  vampire superstition is still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently  In Romania during February 2004  several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire  They dug up his corpse  tore out his heart  burned it  and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it  106  Vampirism and the Vampire lifestyle also represent a relevant part of modern day s occultist movements  The mythos of the vampire  his magickal qualities  allure  and predatory archetype express a strong symbolism that can be used in ritual  energy work  and magick  and can even be adopted as a spiritual system  107  The vampire has been part of the occult society in Europe for centuries and has spread into the American sub culture as well for more than a decade  being strongly influenced by and mixed with the neo gothic aesthetics  108  Collective noun  Coven  has been used as a collective noun for vampires  possibly based on the Wiccan usage  An alternative collective noun is a  house  of vampires  109  David Malki  author of Wondermark  suggests in Wondermark  566 the use of the collective noun  basement   as in  A basement of vampires   110  Origins of vampire beliefs Le Vampire  lithograph by R  de Moraine in F val  1851 1852   Commentators have offered many theories for the origins of vampire beliefs  trying to explain the superstition   and sometimes mass hysteria   caused by vampires  Everything ranging from premature burial to the early ignorance of the body s decomposition cycle after death has been cited as the cause for the belief in vampires  Slavic spiritualism Although many cultures possess revenant superstitions comparable to the Eastern European vampire  the Slavic vampire is the revenant superstition that pervades popular culture s concept of vampire  The roots of vampire belief in Slavic culture are based to a large extent in the spiritual beliefs and practices of pre Christianized Slavic peoples and their understanding of life after death  Despite a lack of pre Christian Slavic writings describing the details of the  Old Religion   many pagan spiritual beliefs and rituals have been sustained by Slavic peoples even after their lands were Christianized  Examples of such beliefs and practices include ancestor worship  household spirits  and beliefs about the soul after death  The origins of vampire beliefs in Slavic regions can be traced to the complex structure of Slavic spiritualism  Demons and spirits served important functions in pre industrial Slavic societies and were considered to be very interactive in the lives and domains of humans  Some spirits were benevolent and could be helpful in human tasks  others were harmful and often destructive  Examples of such spirits are Domovoi  Rusalka  Vila  Kikimora  Poludnitsa  and Vodyanoy  These spirits were also considered to be derived from ancestors or certain deceased humans  Such spirits could appear at will in various forms including that of different animals or human form  Some of these spirits could also participate in malevolent activity to harm humans  such as drowning humans  obstructing the harvest  or sucking the blood of livestock and sometimes humans  Hence  the Slavs were obliged to appease these spirits to prevent the spirits from their potential for erratic and destructive behaviour  111  Common Slavic belief indicates a stark distinction between soul and body  The soul is not considered to be perishable  The Slavs believed that upon death the soul would go out of the body and wander about its neighbourhood and workplace for 40 days before moving on to an eternal afterlife  111  Because of this  it was considered necessary to leave a window or door open in the house for the soul to pass through at its leisure  During this time the soul was believed to have the capability of re entering the corpse of the deceased  Much like the spirits mentioned earlier  the passing soul could either bless or wreak havoc on its family and neighbours during its 40 days of passing  Upon an individual s death  much stress was placed on proper burial rites to ensure the soul s purity and peace as it separated from the body  The death of an unbaptized child  a violent or an untimely death  or the death of a grievous sinner  such as a sorcerer or murderer  were all grounds for a soul to become unclean after death  A soul could also be made unclean if its body were not given a proper burial  Alternatively  a body not given a proper burial could be susceptible to possession by other unclean souls and spirits  Slavs feared unclean souls because of their potential for taking vengeance  112  From these deeply implicated beliefs pertaining to death and the soul derives the invention of the Slavic concept of vampir  A vampire is the manifestation of an unclean spirit possessing a decomposing body  This undead creature is considered to be vengeful and jealous towards the living and needing the blood of the living to sustain its body s existence  113  Although this concept of vampire exists in slightly deviating forms throughout Slavic countries and some of their non Slavic neighbours  it is possible to trace the development of vampire belief to Slavic spiritualism pre existing Christianity in Slavic regions  Pathology Decomposition Paul Barber in his book Vampires  Burial and Death has described that belief in vampires resulted from people of pre industrial societies attempting to explain the natural  but to them inexplicable  process of death and decomposition  114  People sometimes suspected vampirism when a cadaver did not look as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred  However  rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition  and many of the signs are little known  This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all  or  ironically  to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life  115  Corpses swell as gases from decomposition accumulate in the torso and the increased pressure forces blood to ooze from the nose and mouth  This causes the body to look  plump    well fed   and  ruddy  changes that are all the more striking if the person was pale or thin in life  In the Arnold Paole case  an old woman s exhumed corpse was judged by her neighbours to look more plump and healthy than she had ever looked in life  116  The exuding blood gave the impression that the corpse had recently been engaging in vampiric activity  43  Darkening of the skin is also caused by decomposition  117  The staking of a swollen  decomposing body could cause the body to bleed and force the accumulated gases to escape the body  This could produce a groan like sound when the gases moved past the vocal cords  or a sound reminiscent of flatulence when they passed through the anus  The official reporting on the Peter Plogojowitz case speaks of  other wild signs which I pass by out of high respect   118  After death  the skin and gums lose fluids and contract  exposing the roots of the hair  nails  and teeth  even teeth that were concealed in the jaw  This can produce the illusion that the hair  nails  and teeth have grown  At a certain stage  the nails fall off and the skin peels away  as reported in the Plogojowitz case the dermis and nail beds emerging underneath were interpreted as  new skin  and  new nails   118  Premature burial It has also been hypothesized that vampire legends were influenced by individuals being buried alive because of shortcomings in the medical knowledge of the time  In some cases in which people reported sounds emanating from a specific coffin  it was later dug up and fingernail marks were discovered on the inside from the victim trying to escape  In other cases the person would hit their heads  noses or faces and it would appear that they had been  feeding   119  A problem with this theory is the question of how people presumably buried alive managed to stay alive for any extended period without food  water or fresh air  An alternate explanation for noise is the bubbling of escaping gases from natural decomposition of bodies  120  Another likely cause of disordered tombs is grave robbing  121  Contagion Folkloric vampirism has been associated with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses  usually within the same family or the same small community  86  The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Peter Plogojowitz and Arnold Paole  and even more so in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally  where a specific disease  tuberculosis  was associated with outbreaks of vampirism  As with the pneumonic form of bubonic plague  it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips  122  Porphyria In 1985 biochemist David Dolphin proposed a link between the rare blood disorder porphyria and vampire folklore  Noting that the condition is treated by intravenous haem  he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream  Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms  123  The theory has been rebuffed medically as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood  or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria  are based on a misunderstanding of the disease  Furthermore  Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional  bloodsucking  vampires with those of folklore  many of whom were not noted to drink blood  124  Similarly  a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers  yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires  In any case  Dolphin did not go on to publish his work more widely  125  Despite being dismissed by experts  the link gained media attention 126  and entered popular modern folklore  127  Rabies Rabies has been linked with vampire folklore  Dr Juan G mez Alonso  a neurologist at Xeral Hospital in Vigo  Spain  examined this possibility in a report in Neurology  The susceptibility to garlic and light could be due to hypersensitivity  which is a symptom of rabies  The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns  thus becoming nocturnal  and hypersexuality  Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection  an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection   Wolves and bats  which are often associated with vampires  can be carriers of rabies  The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth  128  129  Psychodynamic understanding In his 1931 treatise On the Nightmare  Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones noted that vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and defence mechanisms  Emotions such as love  guilt  and hate fuel the idea of the return of the dead to the grave  Desiring a reunion with loved ones  mourners may project the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same  From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives  particularly their spouses  first  130  In cases where there was unconscious guilt associated with the relationship  however  the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety  This may lead to repression  which Sigmund Freud had linked with the development of morbid dread  131  Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a  sexual  reunion may be drastically changed  desire is replaced by fear  love is replaced by sadism  and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity  The sexual aspect may or may not be present  132  Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory  People identify with immortal vampires because  by so doing  they overcome  or at least temporarily escape from  their fear of dying  133  The innate sexuality of bloodsucking can be seen in its intrinsic connection with cannibalism and folkloric one with incubus like behaviour  Many legends report various beings draining other fluids from victims  an unconscious association with semen being obvious  Finally Jones notes that when more normal aspects of sexuality are repressed  regressed forms may be expressed  in particular sadism  he felt that oral sadism is integral in vampiric behaviour  134  Political interpretation The reinvention of the vampire myth in the modern era is not without political overtones  135  The aristocratic Count Dracula  alone in his castle apart from a few demented retainers  appearing only at night to feed on his peasantry  is symbolic of the parasitic Ancien regime  In his entry for  Vampires  in the Dictionnaire philosophique  1764   Voltaire notices how the end of the 18th century coincided with the decline of the folkloric belief in the existence of vampires but that now  there were stock jobbers  brokers  and men of business  who sucked the blood of the people in broad daylight  but they were not dead  though corrupted  These true suckers lived not in cemeteries  but in very agreeable palaces  136   Marx similarly famously defined capital as   dead labour which  vampire like  lives only by sucking living labour  and lives the more  the more labour it sucks  137   In Das Kapital Marx repeatedly refers to capital as a vampire  because of its monstrous metabolism  according to the German philosopher and revolutionary  in fact  capital is capable at once to suck living labour out of the workers and to transform them in an integral part of itself  variable capital  138   Werner Herzog  in his Nosferatu the Vampyre  gives this political interpretation an extra ironic twist when protagonist Jonathon Harker  a middle class solicitor  becomes the next vampire  in this way the capitalist bourgeois becomes the next parasitic class  139  Psychopathology A number of murderers have performed seemingly vampiric rituals upon their victims  Serial killers Peter K rten and Richard Trenton Chase were both called  vampires  in the tabloids after they were discovered drinking the blood of the people they murdered  Similarly  in 1932  an unsolved murder case in Stockholm  Sweden was nicknamed the  Vampire murder   because of the circumstances of the victim s death  140  The late 16th century Hungarian countess and mass murderer Elizabeth B thory became particularly infamous in later centuries  works  which depicted her bathing in her victims  blood in order to retain beauty or youth  141  Modern vampire subcultures Vampire lifestyle is a term for a contemporary subculture of people  largely within the Goth subculture  who consume the blood of others as a pastime  drawing from the rich recent history of popular culture related to cult symbolism  horror films  the fiction of Anne Rice  and the styles of Victorian England  142  Active vampirism within the vampire subculture includes both blood related vampirism  commonly referred to as sanguine vampirism  and psychic vampirism  or supposed feeding from pranic energy  143  Vampire bats Main article  Vampire bat A vampire bat in Peru Although many cultures have stories about them  vampire bats have only recently become an integral part of the traditional vampire lore  Indeed  vampire bats were only integrated into vampire folklore when they were discovered on the South American mainland in the 16th century  144  Although there are no vampire bats in Europe  bats and owls have long been associated with the supernatural and omens  although mainly because of their nocturnal habits  144  145  and in modern English heraldic tradition  a bat means  Awareness of the powers of darkness and chaos   146  The three species of actual vampire bats are all endemic to Latin America  and there is no evidence to suggest that they had any Old World relatives within human memory  It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat  The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa  the Oxford English Dictionary records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774  Although the vampire bat s bite is usually not harmful to a person  the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leave the trademark  two prong bite mark on its victim s skin  144  The literary Dracula transforms into a bat several times in the novel  and vampire bats themselves are mentioned twice in it  The 1927 stage production of Dracula followed the novel in having Dracula turn into a bat  as did the film  where B la Lugosi would transform into a bat  144  The bat transformation scene would again be used by Lon Chaney Jr  in 1943 s Son of Dracula  147  In modern fiction Count Dracula as portrayed by B la Lugosi in 1931 s Dracula  Main article  List of fictional vampires The vampire is now a fixture in popular fiction  Such fiction began with 18th century poetry and continued with 19th century short stories  the first and most influential of which was John Polidori s The Vampyre  1819   featuring the vampire Lord Ruthven  Lord Ruthven s exploits were further explored in a series of vampire plays in which he was the anti hero  The vampire theme continued in penny dreadful serial publications such as Varney the Vampire  1847  and culminated in the pre eminent vampire novel of all time  Dracula by Bram Stoker  published in 1897  148  Over time  some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire s profile  fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century  with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth  149  and Murnau s Nosferatu  1922  fearing daylight  150  The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s  with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula  vanish  on stage  151  Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight  although no account of this is known in traditional folklore  152  Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore  immortality is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature  Much is made of the price of eternal life  namely the incessant need for blood of former equals  153  Literature Main article  Vampire literature  Carmilla  by D  H  Friston  1872  from The Dark Blue  The vampire or revenant first appeared in poems such as The Vampire  1748  by Heinrich August Ossenfelder  Lenore  1773  by Gottfried August B rger  Die Braut von Corinth  The Bride of Corinth  1797  by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  Robert Southey s Thalaba the Destroyer  1801   John Stagg s  The Vampyre   1810   Percy Bysshe Shelley s  The Spectral Horseman   1810    Nor a yelling vampire reeking with gore   and  Ballad  in St  Irvyne  1811  about a reanimated corpse  Sister Rosa  Samuel Taylor Coleridge s unfinished Christabel and Lord Byron s The Giaour  154  Byron was also credited with the first prose fiction piece concerned with vampires  The Vampyre  1819   However this was in reality authored by Byron s personal physician  John Polidori  who adapted an enigmatic fragmentary tale of his illustrious patient   Fragment of a Novel   1819   also known as  The Burial  A Fragment   30  148  Byron s own dominating personality  mediated by his lover Lady Caroline Lamb in her unflattering roman a clef  Glenarvon  a Gothic fantasia based on Byron s wild life   was used as a model for Polidori s undead protagonist Lord Ruthven  The Vampyre was highly successful and the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century  9  Varney the Vampire was a landmark popular mid Victorian era gothic horror story by James Malcolm Rymer  alternatively attributed to Thomas Preskett Prest   which first appeared from 1845 to 1847 in a series of pamphlets generally referred to as penny dreadfuls because of their inexpensive price and typically gruesome contents  The story was published in book form in 1847 and runs to 868 double columned pages  It has a distinctly suspenseful style  using vivid imagery to describe the horrifying exploits of Varney  152  Another important addition to the genre was Sheridan Le Fanu s lesbian vampire story Carmilla  1871   Like Varney before her  the vampire Carmilla is portrayed in a somewhat sympathetic light as the compulsion of her condition is highlighted  155  No effort to depict vampires in popular fiction was as influential or as definitive as Bram Stoker s Dracula  1897   156  Its portrayal of vampirism as a disease of contagious demonic possession  with its undertones of sex  blood and death  struck a chord in Victorian Europe where tuberculosis and syphilis were common  The vampiric traits described in Stoker s work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition  eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire  Drawing on past works such as The Vampyre and  Carmilla   Stoker began to research his new book in the late 19th century  reading works such as The Land Beyond the Forest  1888  by Emily Gerard and other books about Transylvania and vampires  In London  a colleague mentioned to him the story of Vlad  epe   the  real life Dracula   and Stoker immediately incorporated this story into his book  The first chapter of the book was omitted when it was published in 1897  but it was released in 1914 as Dracula s Guest  157  The 21st century has brought more examples of vampire fiction  such as J R  Ward s Black Dagger Brotherhood series  and other highly popular vampire books which appeal to teenagers and young adults  Such vampiric paranormal romance novels and allied vampiric chick lit and vampiric occult detective stories are a remarkably popular and ever expanding contemporary publishing phenomenon  158 L A  Banks  The Vampire Huntress Legend Series  Laurell K  Hamilton s erotic Anita Blake  Vampire Hunter series  and Kim Harrison s The Hollows series  portray the vampire in a variety of new perspectives  some of them unrelated to the original legends  The latter part of the 20th century saw the rise of multi volume vampire epics  The first of these was Gothic romance writer Marilyn Ross  Barnabas Collins series  1966 71   loosely based on the contemporary American TV series Dark Shadows  It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic tragic heroes rather than as the more traditional embodiment of evil  This formula was followed in novelist Anne Rice s highly popular and influential Vampire Chronicles  1976 2003   159  Vampires in the Twilight series  2005 2008  by Stephenie Meyer ignore the effects of garlic and crosses  and are not harmed by sunlight  although it does reveal their supernatural nature   160 Richelle Mead further deviates from traditional vampires in her Vampire Academy series  2007 present   basing the novels on Romanian lore with two races of vampires  one good and one evil  as well as half vampires  161  Film and television Main article  Vampire film Iconic scene from F  W  Murnau s Nosferatu   1922 Considered one of the preeminent figures of the classic horror film  the vampire has proven to be a rich subject for the film and gaming industries  Dracula is a major character in more films than any other but Sherlock Holmes  and many early films were either based on the novel of Dracula or closely derived from it  These included the landmark 1922 German silent film Nosferatu  directed by F  W  Murnau and featuring the first film portrayal of Dracula although names and characters were intended to mimic Dracula s  Murnau could not obtain permission to do so from Stoker s widow  and had to alter many aspects of the film  In addition to this film was Universal s Dracula  1931   starring B la Lugosi as the Count in what was the first talking film to portray Dracula  The decade saw several more vampire films  most notably Dracula s Daughter in 1936  162  The legend of the vampire was cemented in the film industry when Dracula was reincarnated for a new generation with the celebrated Hammer Horror series of films  starring Christopher Lee as the Count  The successful 1958 Dracula starring Lee was followed by seven sequels  Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of these and became well known in the role  163  By the 1970s  vampires in films had diversified with works such as Count Yorga  Vampire  1970   an African Count in 1972 s Blacula  the BBC s Count Dracula featuring French actor Louis Jourdan as Dracula and Frank Finlay as Abraham Van Helsing  and a Nosferatu like vampire in 1979 s Salem s Lot  and a remake of Nosferatu itself  titled Nosferatu the Vampyre with Klaus Kinski the same year  Several films featured female  often lesbian  vampire antagonists such as Hammer Horror s The Vampire Lovers  1970  based on Carmilla  though the plotlines still revolved around a central evil vampire character  163  The pilot for the Dan Curtis 1972 television series Kolchak  The Night Stalker revolved around reporter Carl Kolchak hunting a vampire on the Las Vegas strip  Later films showed more diversity in plotline  with some focusing on the vampire hunter  such as Blade in the Marvel Comics  Blade films and the film Buffy the Vampire Slayer  Buffy  released in 1992  foreshadowed a vampiric presence on television  with adaptation to a long running hit TV series of the same name and its spin off Angel  Still others showed the vampire as protagonist  such as 1983 s The Hunger  1994 s Interview with the Vampire  The Vampire Chronicles and its indirect sequel of sorts Queen of the Damned  and the 2007 series Moonlight  Bram Stoker s Dracula was a noteworthy 1992 film which became the then highest grossing vampire film ever  164  This increase of interest in vampiric plotlines led to the vampire being depicted in films such as Underworld and Van Helsing  and the Russian Night Watch and a TV miniseries remake of  Salem s Lot  both from 2004  The series Blood Ties premiered on Lifetime Television in 2007  featuring a character portrayed as Henry Fitzroy  illegitimate son of Henry VIII of England turned vampire  in modern day Toronto  with a female former Toronto detective in the starring role  A 2008 series from HBO  entitled True Blood  gives a Southern take to the vampire theme  160  Another popular vampire related show is CW s The Vampire Diaries  The continuing popularity of the vampire theme has been ascribed to a combination of two factors  the representation of sexuality and the perennial dread of mortality  165  Another  vampiric  series that has recently come out is the Twilight Saga  a series of films based on the book series of the same name  Games The role playing game Vampire  the Masquerade has been influential upon modern vampire fiction and elements of its terminology  such as embrace and sire  have become widely used  Popular video games about vampires include Castlevania  which is an extension of the original Bram Stoker Dracula novel  and Legacy of Kain  166  Vampires are also sporadically portrayed in other games  including The Elder Scrolls IV  Oblivion  when a character can become afflicted with porphyric haemophilia  167  A different take on vampires is presented in Bethesda s other game Fallout 3 with  The Family   Members of the Family are afflicted with a manic desire to consume human flesh  but restrict themselves to drinking blood to avoid becoming complete monsters  168  Notes    French  Levkievskaja  E E   September 1997    La mythologie slave   probl mes de r partition dialectale  une  tude de cas   le vampire    Cahiers Slaves 1
