homosexuality refers to  an enduring pattern of or disposition to experience sexual  affectionate  or romantic attractions  primarily or exclusively to people of the same sex   it also refers to an individual s sense of personal and social identity based on those attractions  behaviors expressing them  and membership in a community of others who share them   1  2  Homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation  along with bisexuality and heterosexuality  within the heterosexual homosexual continuum  with asexuality sometimes considered the fourth   Scientific and medical understanding is that sexual orientation is not a choice  but rather a complex interplay of biological and environmental factors  1  3  While some religious organizations hold the view that homosexual activity is unnatural or dysfunctional  4  research shows that homosexuality is an example of normal variation in human sexuality and is not in and of itself a source of negative psychological effects  1  Prejudice and discrimination against homosexual and bisexual people  however  have been shown to cause psychological harm  5  The most common terms for homosexual people are lesbian for women and gay for men  though gay is also used to refer generally to homosexual men and women  The number of people who identify as gay or lesbian and the proportion of people who have same sex sexual experiences are difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons  6  In the modern West  according to major studies  2  to 13  of the population is homosexual or has had some form of same sex sexual contact within his or her lifetime  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  In a 2006 study 20  of respondents anonymously reported some homosexual feelings  although fewer participants identified themselves as homosexual  18  Homosexual behavior is also widely observed in animals  19  20  21  22  23  Many gay and lesbian people are in committed same sex relationships  though only recently have census forms and political conditions facilitated their visibility and enumeration  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  These relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects  2  Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired  as well as condemned  throughout recorded history  depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred  33  Since the end of the 19th century  there has been a movement towards increased visibility  recognition and legal rights for homosexual people  including the rights to marriage and civil unions  adoption and parenting  employment  military service  and equal access to health care  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2 1 Africa 2 2 Americas 2 3

and Latin hybrid with the first element derived from Greek      homos   same   not related to the Latin homo   man   as in Homo sapiens   thus connoting sexual acts and affections between members of the same sex  including lesbianism  34 Gay generally refers to male homosexuality  but may be used in a broader sense to refer to all LGBT people  In the context of sexuality  lesbian refers only to female homosexuality  The word  lesbian  is derived from the name of the Greek island Lesbos  where the poet Sappho wrote largely about her emotional relationships with young women  35  36  Many modern style guides in the U S  recommend against using homosexual as a noun  instead using gay man or lesbian  37  Similarly  some recommend completely avoiding usage of homosexual as it has a negative  clinical history and because the word only refers to one s sexual behavior  as opposed to romantic feelings  and thus it has a negative connotation  37 Gay and lesbian are the most common alternatives  The first letters are frequently combined to create the initialism LGBT  sometimes written as GLBT   in which B and T refer to bisexual and transgender people  The first known appearance of homosexual in print is found in an 1869 German pamphlet by the Austrian born novelist Karl Maria Kertbeny  published anonymously  38  arguing against a Prussian anti sodomy law  39  40  In 1879  Gustav Jager used Kertbeny s terms in his book  Discovery of the Soul  1880   40  In 1886  Richard von Krafft Ebing used the terms homosexual and heterosexual in his book Psychopathia Sexualis  probably borrowing them from Jager  Krafft Ebing s book was so popular among both layman and doctors that the terms  heterosexual  and  homosexual  became the most widely accepted terms for sexual orientation  40  41  As such  the current use of the term has its roots in the broader 19th century tradition of personality taxonomy  Although early writers also used the adjective homosexual to refer to any single sex context  such as an all girls  school   today the term is used exclusively in reference to sexual attraction  activity  and orientation  The term homosocial is now used to describe single sex contexts that are not specifically sexual  There is also a word referring to same sex love  homophilia  Some synonyms for same sex attraction or sexual activity include men who have sex with men or MSM  used in the medical community when specifically discussing sexual activity  and homoerotic  referring to works of art   Pejorative terms in English include queer  faggot  fairy  poof  and homo  Beginning in the 1990s  some of these have been reclaimed as positive words by gay men and lesbians  as in the usage of queer studies  queer theory  and even the popular American television program Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  The word homo occurs in many other languages without the pejorative connotations it has in English  As with ethnic slurs and racial slurs  however  the misuse of these terms can still be highly offensive  the range of acceptable use depends on the context and speaker  Conversely  gay  a word originally embraced by homosexual men and women as a positive  affirmative term  as in gay liberation and gay rights   has come into widespread pejorative use among young people  History Main articles  LGBT history and Timeline of LGBT history Societal attitudes towards same sex relationships have varied over time and place  from expecting all males to engage in same sex relationships  to casual integration  through acceptance  to seeing the practice as a minor sin  repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms  and to proscribing it under penalty of death  In a detailed compilation of historical and ethnographic materials of Preindustrial Cultures   strong disapproval of homosexuality was reported for 41  of 42 cultures  it was accepted or ignored by 21   and 12  reported no such concept  Of 70 ethnographies  59  reported homosexuality absent or rare in frequency and 41  reported it present or not uncommon   42  In cultures influenced by Abrahamic religions  the law and the church established sodomy as a transgression against divine law or a crime against nature  The condemnation of anal sex between males  however  predates Christian belief  It was frequent in ancient Greece   unnatural  can be traced back to Plato  43  Many historical figures  including Socrates  Lord Byron  Edward II  and Hadrian  44  have had terms such as gay or bisexual applied to them  some scholars  such as Michel Foucault  have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary construction of sexuality foreign to their times  45  though others challenge this  46  A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive  permanent  or defining mode of sexuality  John Boswell has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by Plato  47  which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality  Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum  Illustration from photograph   1999 Greg Reeder  Africa Though often ignored or suppressed by European explorers and colonialists  homosexual expression in native Africa was also present and took a variety of forms  Anthropologists Stephen Murray and Will Roscoe reported that women in Lesotho engaged in socially sanctioned  long term  erotic relationships  called motsoalle  48 E  E  Evans Pritchard also recorded that male Azande warriors in the northern Congo routinely took on young male lovers between the ages of twelve and twenty  who helped with household tasks and participated in intercrural sex with their older husbands  The practice had died out by the early 20th century  after Europeans had gained control of African countries  but was recounted to Evans Pritchard by the elders to whom he spoke  49  The first record of possible homosexual couple in history is commonly regarded as Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum  an Egyptian male couple  who lived around the 2400 BCE  The pair are portrayed in a nose kissing position  the most intimate pose in Egyptian art  surrounded by what appear to be their heirs  Americas Dance to the BerdacheSac and Fox Nation ceremonial dance to celebrate the two spirit person  George Catlin  1796 1872   Smithsonian Institution  Washington  DC Among indigenous peoples of the Americas prior to European colonization  a common form of same sex sexuality centered around the figure of the Two Spirit individual  Typically this individual was recognized early in life  given a choice by the parents to follow the path and  if the child accepted the role  raised in the appropriate manner  learning the customs of the gender it had chosen  Two Spirit individuals were commonly shamans and were revered as having powers beyond those of ordinary shamans  Their sexual life was with the ordinary tribe members of the same sex  Homosexual and transgender individuals were also common among other pre conquest civilizations in Latin America  such as the Aztecs  Mayans  Quechuas  Moches  Zapotecs  and the Tupinamb  of Brazil  50  51  A woman spying on a pair of male lovers  China  Qing dynasty  The Spanish conquerors were horrified to discover sodomy openly practiced among native peoples  and attempted to crush it out by subjecting the berdaches  as the Spanish called them  under their rule to severe penalties  including public execution  burning and being torn to pieces by dogs  52  East Asia In East Asia  same sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history  Homosexuality in China  known as the pleasures of the bitten peach  the cut sleeve  or the southern custom  has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE  These euphemistic terms were used to describe behaviors  not identities  recently some fashionable young Chinese tend to euphemistically use the term  brokeback      duanbei to refer to homosexual men  from the success of director Ang Lee s film Brokeback Mountain   53  Homosexuality was mentioned in Chinese literature  The instances of same sex affection and sexual interactions described in the classical novel Dream of the Red Chamber seem as familiar to observers in the present as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period  Homosexuality in Japan  variously known as shudo or nanshoku has been documented for over one thousand years and was an integral part of Buddhist monastic life and the samurai tradition  This same sex love culture gave rise to strong traditions of painting and literature documenting and celebrating such relationships  Similarly  in Thailand  Kathoey  or  ladyboys   have been a feature of Thai society for many centuries  and Thai kings had male as well as female lovers  While Kathoey may encompass simple effeminacy or transvestism  it most commonly is treated in Thai culture as a third gender  They are generally accepted by society  and Thailand has never had legal prohibitions against homosexuality or homosexual behavior  Europe Further information  Homosexuality in ancient Greece  Homosexuality in ancient Rome Roman man penetrating a youth  possibly a slave  middle of the 1st century AD  Found in Bittir      near Jerusalem  The earliest Western documents  in the form of literary works  art objects  and mythographic materials  concerning same sex relationships are derived from ancient Greece  In regard of male homosexuality such documents depict a world in which relationships with women and relationships with youths were the essential foundation of a normal man s love life  Same sex relationships were a social institution variously constructed over time and from one city to another  The formal practice  an erotic yet often restrained relationship between a free adult male and a free adolescent  was valued for its pedagogic benefits and as a means of population control  though occasionally blamed for causing disorder  Plato praised its benefits in his early writings 54  but in his late works proposed its prohibition  55  In the Symposium  182B D   Plato equates acceptance of homosexuality with democracy  and its suppression with despotism  saying that homosexuality  is shameful to barbarians because of their despotic governments  just as philosophy and athletics are  since it is apparently not in best interests of such rulers to have great ideas engendered in their subjects  or powerful friendships or physical unions  all of which love is particularly apt to produce   47 Aristotle  in the Politics  dismissed Plato s ideas about abolishing homosexuality  2 4   he explains that barbarians like the Celts accorded it a special honor  2 6 6   while the Cretans used it to regulate the population  2 7 5   47  Female youths are depicted surrounding Sappho in this painting of Lafond  Sappho sings for Homer   1824  Little is known of female homosexuality in antiquity  Sappho  born on the island of Lesbos  was included by later Greeks in the canonical list of nine lyric poets  The adjectives deriving from her name and place of birth  Sapphic and Lesbian  came to be applied to female homosexuality beginning in the 19th century  56  57  Sappho s poetry centers on passion and love for various personages and both genders  The narrators of many of her poems speak of infatuations and love  sometimes requited  sometimes not  for various females  but descriptions of physical acts between women are few and subject to debate  58  59  Sappho reading to her companions on an Attic vase of c  435 BC  In Ancient Rome the young male body remained a focus of male sexual attention  but relationships were between older free men and slaves or freed youths who took the receptive role in sex  All the emperors with the exception of Claudius took male lovers  The Hellenophile emperor Hadrian is renowned for his relationship with Antinous  but the Christian emperor Theodosius I decreed a law on August 6  390  condemning passive males to be burned at the stake  Justinian  towards the end of his reign  expanded the proscription to the active partner as well  in 558   warning that such conduct can lead to the destruction of cities through the  wrath of God   Notwithstanding these regulations  taxes on brothels of boys available for homosexual sex continued to be collected until the end of the reign of Anastasius I in 518  During the Renaissance  wealthy cities in northern Italy   Florence and Venice in particular   were renowned for their widespread practice of same sex love  engaged in by a considerable part of the male population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome  60  61  But even as many of the male population were engaging in same sex relationships  the authorities  under the aegis of the Officers of the Night court  were prosecuting  fining  and imprisoning a good portion of that population  From the second half of the 13th century  death was the punishment for male homosexuality in most of Europe  62  The eclipse of this period of relative artistic and erotic freedom was precipitated by the rise to power of the moralizing monk Girolamo Savonarola  In northern Europe the artistic discourse on sodomy was turned against its proponents by artists such as Rembrandt  who in his Rape of Ganymede no longer depicted Ganymede as a willing youth  but as a squalling baby attacked by a rapacious bird of prey  The relationships of socially prominent figures  such as King James I and the Duke of Buckingham  served to highlight the issue  including in anonymously authored street pamphlets   The world is chang d I know not how  For men Kiss Men  not Women now    Of J  the First and Buckingham  He  true it is  his Wives Embraces fled  To slabber his lov d Ganimede   Mundus Foppensis  or The Fop Display d  1691   Love Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the Famous Mr  Wilson was published in 1723 in England and was presumed by some modern scholars to be a novel  The 1749 edition of John Cleland s popular novel Fanny Hill includes a homosexual scene  but this was removed in its 1750 edition  Also in 1749  the earliest extended and serious defense of homosexuality in English  Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplified  written by Thomas Cannon  was published  but was suppressed almost immediately  It includes the passage   Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms  downright Nonsense  Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts   63  Around 1785 Jeremy Bentham wrote another defense  but this was not published until 1978  64 Executions for sodomy continued in the Netherlands until 1803  and in England until 1835  Between 1864 and 1880 Karl Heinrich Ulrichs published a series of twelve tracts  which he collectively titled Research on the Riddle of Man Manly Love  In 1867  he became the first self proclaimed homosexual person to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the Congress of German Jurists in Munich for a resolution urging the repeal of anti homosexual laws  Sexual Inversion by Havelock Ellis  published in 1896  challenged theories that homosexuality was abnormal  as well as stereotypes  and insisted on the ubiquity of homosexuality and its association with intellectual and artistic achievement  65  Although medical texts like these  written partly in Latin to obscure the sexual details  were not widely read by the general public  they did lead to the rise of Magnus Hirschfeld s Scientific Humanitarian Committee  which campaigned from 1897 to 1933 against anti sodomy laws in Germany  as well as a much more informal  unpublicized movement among British intellectuals and writers  led by such figures as Edward Carpenter and John Addington Symonds  Beginning in 1894 with Homogenic Love  Socialist activist and poet Edward Carpenter wrote a string of pro homosexual articles and pamphlets  and  came out  in 1916 in his book My Days and Dreams  In 1900  Elisar von Kupffer published an anthology of homosexual literature from antiquity to his own time  Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur  Middle East  South and Central Asia Dance of a bacch   dancing boy Samarkand

Eastern Muslim cultures egalitarian or age structured homosexual practices were  and remain  widespread and thinly veiled  The prevailing pattern of same sex relationships in the temperate and sub tropical zone stretching from Northern India to the Western Sahara is one in which the relationships were and are either gender structured or age structured or both  In recent years  egalitarian relationships modeled on the western pattern have become more frequent  though they remain rare  Same sex intercourse officially carries the death penalty in several Muslim nations  Saudi Arabia  Iran  Mauritania  northern Nigeria  Sudan  and Yemen  66  Some scholars argue that there are examples of homosexual love in ancient literature  like in the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh as well as in the Biblical story of David and Jonathan  In the Epic of Gilgamesh  the relationship between the main protagonist Gilgamesh and the character Enkidu has been seen by some to be homosexual in nature  67  68  69  70  Similarly  David s love for Jonathan is  greater than the love of women   71  Ottoman illustration depicting a young man used for group sex  from Sawaqub al Manaquib  There are a handful of accounts by Arab travelers to Europe during the mid 1800s  Two of these travelers  Rifa ah al Tahtawi and Muhammad sl Saffar  show their surprise that the French sometimes deliberately mis translated love poetry about a young boy  instead referring to a young female  to maintain their social norms and morals  72  In Persia homosexuality and homoerotic expressions were tolerated in numerous public places  from monasteries and seminaries to taverns  military camps  bathhouses  and coffee houses  In the early Safavid era  1501 1723   male houses of prostitution  amrad khane  were legally recognized and paid taxes  Today  governments in the Middle East often ignore  deny the existence of  or criminalize homosexuality  Homosexuality is illegal in almost all Muslim countries  73  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  during his 2007 speech at Columbia University  asserted that there were no gay people in Iran  Gay people do live when   in Iran  but most keep their sexuality a secret for fear of government sanction or rejection by their families  74  The Laws of Manu  the foundational work of Hindu law  mentions a  third sex   members of which may engage in nontraditional gender expression and homosexual activities  75  South Pacific In many societies of Melanesia  especially in Papua New Guinea  same sex relationships were an integral part of the culture until the middle of the last century  The Etoro and Marind anim for example  even viewed heterosexuality as sinful and celebrated homosexuality instead  In many traditional Melanesian cultures a prepubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would  inseminate  him  orally  anally  or topically  depending on the tribe  over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty  Many Melanesian societies  however  have become hostile towards same sex relationships since the introduction of Christianity by European missionaries  76  Sexuality and gender identity Sexual orientation  identity  behavior Main articles  Sexual orientation  Sexual orientation identity  and Human sexual activity See also  Situational sexual behavior The American Psychological Association  the American Psychiatric Association  and the National Association of Social Workers identify sexual orientation as  not merely a personal characteristic that can be defined in isolation  Rather  one s sexual orientation defines the universe of persons with whom one is likely to find the satisfying and fulfilling relationships   2  Sexual orientation is commonly discussed as a characteristic of the individual  like biological sex  gender identity  or age  This perspective is incomplete because sexual orientation is always defined in relational terms and necessarily involves relationships with other individuals  Sexual acts and romantic attractions are categorized as homosexual or heterosexual according to the biological sex of the individuals involved in them  relative to each other  Indeed  it is by acting or desiring to act with another person that individuals express their heterosexuality  homosexuality  or bisexuality  This includes actions as simple as holding hands with or kissing another person  Thus  sexual orientation is integrally linked to the intimate personal relationships that human beings form with others to meet their deeply felt needs for love  attachment  and intimacy  In addition to sexual behavior  these bonds encompass nonsexual physical affection between partners  shared goals and values  mutual support  and ongoing commitment  2  Sexual identity development   coming out process  Main article  Coming out Generally  coming out is described in three phases  The first phase is the phase of  knowing oneself   and the realization emerges that one is open to same sex relations  This is often described as an internal coming out  The second phase involves one s decision to come out to others  e g  family  friends  or colleagues  The third phase more generally involves living openly as an LGBT person  77  In the United States today  people often come out during high school or college age  At this age  they may not trust or ask for help from others  especially when their orientation is not accepted in society  Sometimes their own families are not even informed  According to Rosario  Schrimshaw  Hunter  Braun  2006    the development of a lesbian  gay  or bisexual  LGB  sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process  Unlike members of other minority groups  e g   ethnic and racial minorities   most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity  Rather  LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality   78  Outing is the practice of publicly revealing the sexual orientation of a closeted person  79  Notable politicians  celebrities  military service people  and clergy members have been outed  with motives ranging from malice to political or moral beliefs  Many commentators oppose the practice altogether  80  while some encourage outing public figures who use their positions of influence to harm other gay people  81  Gender identity The earliest writers on a homosexual orientation usually understood it to be intrinsically linked to the subject s own sex  For example  it was thought that a typical female bodied person who is attracted to female bodied persons would have masculine attributes  and vice versa  82  This understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of homosexuality from the mid 19th century to early 20th century  such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs  Richard von Krafft Ebing  Magnus Hirschfeld  Havelock Ellis  Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud  as well as many gender variant homosexual people themselves  However  this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time  and through the second half of the 20th century  gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation  Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men  women or both  although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations  see sexual orientation of transwomen   An individual homosexual  heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine  feminine  or androgynous  and in addition  many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the  gender conforming heterosexual  and the  gender nonconforming homosexual  as negative stereotypes  However  studies by J  Michael Bailey and K J  Zucker have found that a majority of gay men and lesbians report being gender nonconforming during their childhood years  83 Richard C  Friedman  in Male Homosexuality published in 1990  84  writing from a psychoanalytic perspective  argues that sexual desire begins later than the writings of Sigmund Freud indicate  not in infancy but between the ages of 5 and 10 and is not focused on a parent figure but on peers  As a consequence  he reasons  homosexual men are not abnormal  never having been sexually attracted to their mothers anyway  85  Social construct Further information  Queer theory Because a homosexual orientation is complex and multi dimensional  some academics and researchers  especially in Queer studies  have argued that it is a historical and social construction  In 1976 the historian Michel Foucault argued that homosexuality as an identity did not exist in the 18th century  that people instead spoke of  sodomy   which referred to sexual acts  Sodomy was a crime that was often ignored but sometimes punished severely  see sodomy law   The term homosexual is often used in European and American cultures to encompass a person s entire social identity  which includes self and personality  In Western cultures some people speak meaningfully of gay  lesbian  and bisexual identities and communities  In other cultures  homosexuality and heterosexual labels do not emphasize an entire social identity or indicate community affiliation based on sexual orientation  86  Some scholars  such as David Green  state that homosexuality is a modern Western social construct  and as such cannot be used in the context of non Western male male sexuality  nor in the pre modern West  87  Same sex romance and relationships Main article  Same sex relationship People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality in a variety of ways  and may or may not express it in their behaviors  1  Many have sexual relationships predominately with people of their own gender identity  though some have sexual relationships with those of the opposite gender  bisexual relationships  or none at all  celibate   1  The Kinsey scale attempts to describe a person s sexual history or episodes of their sexual activity at a given time  It uses a scale from 0  meaning exclusively heterosexual  to 6  meaning exclusively homosexual  It is based on actual sexual behavior surveys  Research indicates that many lesbians and gay men want  and succeed in having  committed and durable relationships  For example  survey data indicate that between 40  and 60  of gay men and between 45  and 80  of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship  88  Survey data also indicate that between 18  and 28  of gay couples and between 8  and 21  of lesbian couples in the U S  have lived together ten or more years  88  Studies have found same sex and opposite sex couples to be equivalent to each other in measures of satisfaction and commitment in romantic relationships  89  90  that age and gender are more reliable than sexual orientation as a predictor of satisfaction and commitment to a romantic relationship  90  and that people who are heterosexual or homosexual share comparable expectations and ideals with regard to romantic relationships  91  Demographics Main article  Demographics of sexual orientation Reliable data as to the size of the gay and lesbian population are of value in informing public policy  92  For example  demographics would help in calculating the costs and benefits of domestic partnership benefits  of the impact of legalizing gay adoption  and of the impact of the U S  military s Don t Ask Don t Tell policy  92  Further  knowledge of the size of the  gay and lesbian population holds promise for helping social scientists understand a wide array of important questions questions about the general nature of labor market choices  accumulation of human capital  specialization within households  discrimination  and decisions about geographic location   92  Measuring the prevalence of homosexuality presents difficulties  6  Many people  despite having same sex attractions  may be reluctant to identify themselves as gay or bisexual  The research must measure some characteristic that may or may not be defining of sexual orientation  The number of people with same sex desires may be larger than the number of people who act on those desires  which in turn may be larger than the number of people who self identify as gay  lesbian  or bisexual  92  In 1948 and 1953  Alfred Kinsey reported that nearly 46  of the male subjects had  reacted  sexually to persons of both sexes in the course of their adult lives  and 37  had had at least one homosexual experience  93  94  Kinsey s methodology was criticized  95  96  A later study tried to eliminate the sample bias  but still reached similar conclusions  97  Estimates of the occurrence of exclusive homosexuality range from one to twenty percent of the population  usually finding there are slightly more gay men than lesbians  8  9  12  13  15  16  17  18  98  Estimates of the frequency of homosexual activity also vary from one country to another  A 1992 study reported that 6 1  of males in Britain had had a homosexual experience  while in France the number was 4 1   99  According to a 2003 survey  12  of Norwegians have had homosexual sex  16  In New Zealand  a 2006 study suggested that 20  of the population anonymously reported some homosexual feelings  few of them identifying as homosexual  Percentage of persons identifying homosexual was 2 3   18  According to a 2008 poll  while only 6  of Britons define their sexual orientation as homosexual or bisexual  more than twice that number  13   of Britons have had some form of sexual contact with someone of the same sex  17  In the United States  according to exit polling on 2008 Election Day for the 2008 Presidential elections  4  of electorate self identified as gay  lesbian  or bisexual  the same percentage as in 2004   100  According to the 2000 United States Census there were about 601 209 same sex unmarried partner households  101  In the UK  the UK Office for National Statistics survey have come up with the figure that 1 5  are gay or bisexual  and suggest that this is in line with other surveys showing between 0 3  and 3   94  Psychology Main article  Homosexuality and psychology Wikinews has related news  Dr  Joseph Merlino on sexuality  insanity  Freud  fetishes and apathy Psychology was one of the first disciplines to study a homosexual orientation as a discrete phenomenon  The first attempts to classify homosexuality as a disease were made by the fledgling European sexologist movement in the late 19th century  In 1886 noted sexologist Richard von Krafft Ebing listed homosexuality along with 200 other case studies of deviant sexual practices in his definitive work  Psychopathia Sexualis  Krafft Ebing proposed that homosexuality was caused by either  congenital  during birth  inversion  or an  acquired inversion   In the last two decades of the 19th century  a different view began to predominate in medical and psychiatric circles  judging such behavior as indicative of a type of person with a defined and relatively stable sexual orientation  In the late 19th century and early 20th century  pathological models of homosexuality were standard  The American Psychological Association  the American Psychiatric Association  and the National Association of Social Workers state    In 1952  when the American Psychiatric Association published its first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  homosexuality was included as a disorder  Almost immediately  however  that classification began to be subjected to critical scrutiny in research funded by the National Institute of Mental Health  That study and subsequent research consistently failed to produce any empirical or scientific basis for regarding homosexuality as a disorder or abnormality  rather than a normal and healthy sexual orientation  As results from such research accumulated  professionals in medicine  mental health  and the behavioral and social sciences reached the conclusion that it was inaccurate to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder and that the DSM classification reflected untested assumptions based on once prevalent social norms and clinical impressions from unrepresentative samples comprising patients seeking therapy and individuals whose conduct brought them into the criminal justice system  In recognition of the scientific evidence  102  the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the DSM in 1973  stating that  homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment  stability  reliability  or general social or vocational capabilities   After thoroughly reviewing the scientific data  the American Psychological Association adopted the same position in 1975  and urged all mental health professionals  to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated with homosexual orientations   The National Association of Social Workers has adopted a similar policy  Thus  mental health professionals and researchers have long recognized that being homosexual poses no inherent obstacle to leading a happy  healthy  and productive life  and that the vast majority of gay and lesbian people function well in the full array of social institutions and interpersonal relationships  2     103  The longstanding consensus of research and clinical literature demonstrates that same sex sexual and romantic attractions  feelings  and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality  104  There is now a large body of research evidence that indicates that being gay  lesbian or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment  103  The World Health Organization s ICD 9  1977  listed homosexuality as a mental illness  it was removed from the ICD 10  endorsed by the Forty third World Health Assembly on May 17  1990  105  106  107  Like the DSM II  the ICD 10 added ego dystonic sexual orientation to the list  which refers to people who want to change their gender identities or sexual orientation because of a psychological or behavioral disorder  F66 1   The Chinese Society of Psychiatry removed homosexuality from its Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders in 2001 after five years of study by the association  108  According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists  This unfortunate history demonstrates how marginalisation of a group of people who have a particular personality feature  in this case homosexuality  can lead to harmful medical practice and a basis for discrimination in society  103  There is now a large body of research evidence that indicates that being gay  lesbian or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment  However  the experiences of discrimination in society and possible rejection by friends  families and others  such as employers  means that some LGB people experience a greater than expected prevalence of mental health difficulties and substance misuse problems  Although there have been claims by conservative political groups in the USA that this higher prevalence of mental health difficulties is confirmation that homosexuality is itself a mental disorder  there is no evidence whatever to substantiate such a claim   109  Most lesbian  gay  and bisexual people who seek psychotherapy do so for the same reasons as heterosexual people  stress  relationship difficulties  difficulty adjusting to social or work situations  etc    their sexual orientation may be of primary  incidental  or no importance to their issues and treatment  Whatever the issue  there is a high risk for anti gay bias in psychotherapy with lesbian  gay  and bisexual clients  110  Psychological research in this area has been relevant to counteracting prejudicial   homophobic   attitudes and actions  and to the LGBT rights movement generally  111  The appropriate application of affirmative psychotherapy is based on the following scientific facts  104  Same sex sexual attractions  behavior  and orientations per se are normal and positive variants of human sexuality  in other words  they are not indicators of mental or developmental disorders  Homosexuality and bisexuality are stigmatized  and this stigma can have a variety of negative consequences  e g   Minority Stress  throughout the life span  D Augelli  amp  Patterson  1995  DiPlacido  1998  Herek  amp  Garnets  2007  Meyer  1995

Psychiatric Association  and National Association of Social Workers stated in 2006    Currently  there is no scientific consensus about the specific factors that cause an individual to become heterosexual  homosexual  or bisexual including possible biological  psychological  or social effects of the parents  sexual orientation  However  the available evidence indicates that the vast majority of lesbian and gay adults were raised by heterosexual parents and the vast majority of children raised by lesbian and gay parents eventually grow up to be heterosexual  2    The Royal College of Psychiatrists stated in 2007    Despite almost a century of psychoanalytic and psychological speculation  there is no substantive evidence to support the suggestion that the nature of parenting or early childhood experiences play any role in the formation of a person s fundamental heterosexual or homosexual orientation  It would appear that sexual orientation is biological in nature  determined by a complex interplay of genetic factors and the early uterine environment  Sexual orientation is therefore not a choice  103    The American Academy of Pediatrics stated in Pediatrics in 2004    Sexual orientation probably is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic  hormonal  and environmental influences  In recent decades  biologically based theories have been favored by experts  Although there continues to be controversy and uncertainty as to the genesis of the variety of human sexual orientations  there is no scientific evidence that abnormal parenting  sexual abuse  or other adverse life events influence sexual orientation  Current knowledge suggests that sexual orientation is usually established during early childhood  103  112  113    The American Psychological Association states  there are probably many reasons for a person s sexual orientation and the reasons may be different for different people   and says most people s sexual orientation is determined at an early age  1  Research into how sexual orientation in males may be determined by genetic or other prenatal factors plays a role in political and social debates about homosexuality  and also raises fears about genetic profiling and prenatal testing  114  Professor Michael King states   The conclusion reached by scientists who have investigated the origins and stability of sexual orientation is that it is a human characteristic that is formed early in life  and is resistant to change  Scientific evidence on the origins of homosexuality is considered relevant to theological and social debate because it undermines suggestions that sexual orientation is a choice   115  Innate bisexuality  or predisposition to bisexuality  is a term introduced by Sigmund Freud  based on work by his associate Wilhelm Fliess  that expounds that all humans are born bisexual but through psychological development which includes both external and internal factors become monosexual  while the bisexuality remains in a latent state  The authors of a 2008 study stated  there is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced  so it is not known how homosexuality  which tends to lower reproductive success  is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency   They hypothesized that  while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals  reproductive success  they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them   Their results suggested that  genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals  which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population   116  A 2009 study also suggested a significant increase in fecundity in the females related to the homosexual people from the maternal line  but not in those related from the paternal one   117  Garcia Falgueras and Swaab state in the abstract of their 2010 study   The fetal brain develops during the intrauterine period in the male direction through a direct action of testosterone on the developing nerve cells  or in the female direction through the absence of this hormone surge  In this way  our gender identity  the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender  and sexual orientation are programmed or organized into our brain structures when we are still in the womb  There is no indication that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation   118  Lesbian narratives and awareness of their sexual orientation Lesbians often experience their sexuality differently from gay men  and have different understandings about etiology from those derived from studies focused mostly on men  For information specific to female homosexuality  see Lesbian  In a U S  based 1970s mail survey by Shere Hite  lesbians self reported their reasons for being lesbian  This is the only major piece of research into female sexuality that has looked at how women understand being homosexual since Kinsey in 1953  The research yielded information about women s general understanding of lesbian relationships and their sexual orientation  Women talked about social conditioning  which made it  almost impossible for me to have a truly healthy sexual relationship with a man   119  Another woman stated that because of their conditioning   w omen are much more sensitive to other people s needs   and so   s ex is better with women physically and emotionally   stating she preferred the symmetries of power and aesthetic between women  119  Some talked about preferring women    p ersonally  I like girls better  they are more tender and loving   119  and some went into how they found that emotional relationships with women were more satisfying than those with men  with women making more creative and versatile lovers  One woman reported it was easier for her  to give myself emotionally to a woman   119  A woman who had been a lesbian for two years said she found that sexual relationships with women were more pleasurable on both psychological and physical levels than with men  this was  because the women I ve had sex with have been my friends first  which was never the case with men  Being friends sets up a trust that I think is essential for satisfying physical intimacy  Relating to another woman physically seems to me like the most natural thing in the world  You ve already got a head start on knowing how to give her pleasure  Gentleness seems to be the key  and is the main difference between relating to men and women    119  Women talked about women making better sexual partners and that was a dominant theme   I find women better lovers  they know what a woman wants and most of all there is an emotional closeness that can never be matched with a man  More tenderness  more consideration and understanding of feelings  etc   119  This was because men were perceived as unliberated  sexually or emotionally or any other way   and lesbianism was perceived  as an alternative to abstinence  and to men generally  119  Men were perceived as usually juvenile  while a relationship with women was described as  more of a communion with self   119  Sex as well as relationships with women were seen as a way of achieving independence from men    s ex with a woman means independence from men   119  Male sexual performance was another problem    t wenty minutes for a man  at least an hour with a woman  usually more   119  as well as attention to the sexual needs of women who themselves  seem to have a more sustained energy level after orgasm  and are more likely to know and do something about it if I m not satisfied   119  One understanding of the difference was that sex with women  is not an  exchange  or a  trade  or services   and not focused on orgasm  with  more kissing and holding  and  more concern for my pleasure   which was experienced as liberating  Sex with women was also seen as a political act   I see lesbianism as putting all my energies  sexual  political social  etc   into women  Sex is a form of comfort and to have sex indiscriminately with males is to give them comfort    119  Hite is more concerned with what respondents say than quantifiable data  She found the two most significant differences between respondents  experience with men and women were the focus on clitoral stimulation  and more emotional involvement and orgasmic responses  119  Since Hite carried out her study she has acknowledged that some women may have chosen the political identity of a lesbian  Julie Bindel  a UK journalist  reaffirmed that  political lesbianism continues to make intrinsic sense because it reinforces the idea that sexuality is a choice  and we are not destined to a particular fate because of our chromosomes   as recently as 2009  120  Sexual orientation change efforts Main article  Sexual orientation change efforts There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether recent sexual orientation change efforts do work to change a person s sexual orientation  Those efforts has been controversial due to tensions between the values held by some faith based organizations  on the one hand  and those held by lesbian  gay  and bisexual rights organizations and professional and scientific organizations  on the other  The longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the health and mental health professions is that homosexuality per se is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation  5  The American Psychological Association says that  most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation   121  Some individuals and groups have promoted the idea of homosexuality as symptomatic of developmental defects or spiritual and moral failings and have argued that sexual orientation change efforts  including psychotherapy and religious efforts  could alter homosexual feelings and behaviors  Many of these individuals and groups appeared to be embedded within the larger context of conservative religious political movements that have supported the stigmatization of homosexuality on political or religious grounds  5  No major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation  These include the American Psychiatric Association  American Psychological Association  American Counseling Association  National Association of Social Workers in the USA  122  the Royal College of Psychiatrists  123  and the Australian Psychological Society  124  The American Psychological Association and the Royal College of Psychiatrists expressed concerns that the positions espoused by NARTH are not supported by the science and create an environment in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish  123  125  The American Psychological Association  encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others  sexual orientation and concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation   126  Fluidity of orientation The American Psychiatric Association  APA  has stated  some people believe that sexual orientation is innate and fixed  however  sexual orientation develops across a person s lifetime   127  In a joint statement with other major American medical organizations  the APA says that  different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual  gay  lesbian  or bisexual   128  A report from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health states   For some people  sexual orientation is continuous and fixed throughout their lives  For others  sexual orientation may be fluid and change over time   129  One study has suggested  considerable fluidity in bisexual  unlabeled  and lesbian women s attractions  behaviors  and identities   130  131  Gender and fluidity In a 2004 study  the female subjects  both gay and straight women  became sexually aroused when they viewed heterosexual as well as lesbian erotic films  Among the male subjects  however  the straight men were turned on only by erotic films with women  the gay ones by those with men  The study s senior researcher said that women s sexual desire is less rigidly directed toward a particular sex  as compared with men s  and it s more changeable over time  132  Parenting See also  LGBT parenting Scientific research has been consistent in showing that lesbian and gay parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents  and their children are as psychologically healthy and well adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents  133  134  135  According to scientific literature reviews  there is no evidence to the contrary  2  136  137  138  139  Health Further information  Men who have sex with men and Lesbian Health Physical The terms  Men who have sex with men   MSM  and  women who have sex with women   WSW  refer to people who engage in sexual activity with others of the same sex regardless of how they identify themselves as many choose not to accept social identities as lesbian  gay and bisexual  140  141  142  143  144  These terms are often used in medical literature and social research to describe such groups for study  without needing to consider the issues of sexual self identity  The terms are seen as problematic  however  because it  obscures social dimensions of sexuality  undermines the self labeling of lesbian  gay  and bisexual people  and does not sufficiently describe variations in sexual behavior   145  MSM and WSW are sexually active with each other for a variety of reasons with the main ones arguably sexual pleasure  intimacy and bonding  In contrast to its benefits  sexual behavior can be a disease vector  Safe sex is a relevant harm reduction philosophy  146  The United States currently prohibits men who have sex with men from donating blood  because they are  as a group  at increased risk for HIV  hepatitis B and certain other infections that can be transmitted by transfusion   147  The UK 148  and many European countries have the same prohibition  147  Public health These safer sex recommendations are agreed upon by public health officials for women who have sex with women to avoid sexually transmitted infections  STIs   Avoid contact with a partner s menstrual blood and with any visible genital lesions  Cover sex toys that penetrate more than one person s vagina or anus with a new condom for each person  consider using different toys for each person  Use a barrier  e g   latex sheet  dental dam  cut open condom  plastic wrap  during oral sex  Use latex or vinyl gloves and lubricant for any manual sex that might cause bleeding  149  These safer sex

medical literature  homosexuality was often approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as its root cause  Much literature on mental health and homosexual patients centered on their depression  substance abuse  and suicide  Although these issues exist among people who are non heterosexual  discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  DSM  in 1973  Instead  social ostracism  legal discrimination  internalization of negative stereotypes  and limited support structures indicate factors homosexual people face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health  152  Stigma  prejudice  and discrimination stemming from negative societal attitudes toward homosexuality lead to a higher prevalence of mental health disorders among lesbians  gay men  and bisexuals compared to their heterosexual peers  153  Evidence indicates that the liberalization of these attitudes over the past few decades is associated with a decrease in such mental health risks among younger LGBT people  154  Gay and lesbian youth Gay and lesbian youth bear an increased risk of suicide  substance abuse  school problems  and isolation because of a  hostile and condemning environment  verbal and physical abuse  rejection and isolation from family and peers   155  Further  LGBT youths are more likely to report psychological and physical abuse by parents or caretakers  and more sexual abuse  Suggested reasons for this disparity are that  1  LGBT youths may be specifically targeted on the basis of their perceived sexual orientation or gender non conforming appearance  and  2  that  risk factors associated with sexual minority status  including discrimination  invisibility  and rejection by family members   may lead to an increase in behaviors that are associated with risk for victimization  such as substance abuse  sex with multiple partners  or running away from home as a teenager   156  A 2008 study showed a correlation between the degree of rejecting behavior by parents of LGB adolescents and negative health problems in the teenagers studied  Higher rates of family rejection were significantly associated with poorer health outcomes  On the basis of odds ratios  lesbian  gay  and bisexual young adults who reported higher levels of family rejection during adolescence were 8 4 times more likely to report having attempted suicide  5 9 times more likely to report high levels of depression  3 4 times more likely to use illegal drugs  and 3 4 times more likely to report having engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse compared with peers from families that reported no or low levels of family rejection  157  Crisis centers in larger cities and information sites on the Internet have arisen to help youth and adults  158 The Trevor Helpline  a suicide prevention helpline for gay youth  was established following the 1998 airing on HBO of the

Violence against LGBT people  Although homosexual acts were decriminalized in some parts of the Western world  such as Poland in 1932  Denmark in 1933  Sweden in 1944  and the United Kingdom in 1967  it was not until the mid 1970s that the gay community first began to achieve limited civil rights in some developed countries  On July 2  2009  homosexuality was decriminalized in India by a High Court ruling  159  A turning point was reached in 1973 when the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  thus negating its previous definition of homosexuality as a clinical mental disorder  In 1977  Quebec became the first state level jurisdiction in the world to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation  During the 1980s and 1990s  most developed countries enacted laws decriminalizing homosexual behavior and prohibiting discrimination against lesbian and gay people in employment  housing  and services  On the other hand  many countries today in the Middle East and Africa  as well as several countries in Asia  the Caribbean and the South Pacific  outlaw homosexuality  In six countries  homosexual behavior is punishable by life imprisonment  in ten others  it carries the death penalty  160  Sexual orientation and the law United States Employment discrimination refers to discriminatory employment practices such as bias in hiring  promotion  job assignment  termination  and compensation  and various types of harassment  In the United States there is  very little statutory  common law  and case law establishing employment discrimination based upon sexual orientation as a legal wrong   161  Some exceptions and alternative legal strategies are available  President Bill Clinton s Executive Order 13087  1998  prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in the competitive service of the federal civilian workforce  162  and federal non civil service employees may have recourse under the due process clause of the U S  Constitution  163  Private sector workers may have a Title VII action under a quid pro quo sexual harassment theory  164  a  hostile work environment  theory  165  a sexual stereotyping theory  166  or others  161  Housing discrimination refers to discrimination against potential or current tenants by landlords  In the United States  there is no federal law against such discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity  but at least thirteen states and many major cities have enacted laws prohibiting it  167  Hate crimes  also known as bias crimes  are crimes motivated by bias against an identifiable social group  usually groups defined by race  classification of human beings   religion  sexual orientation  disability  ethnicity  nationality  age  gender  gender identity  or political affiliation  In the United States  45 states and the District of Columbia have statutes criminalizing various types of bias motivated violence or intimidation  the exceptions are AZ  GA  IN  SC  and WY   Each of these statutes covers bias on the basis of race  religion  and ethnicity  32 of them cover sexual orientation  28 cover gender  and 11 cover transgender gender identity  168  In October 2009  the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd  Jr  Hate Crimes Prevention Act  which     gives

170  Political activism Further information  LGBT social movements Barbara Gittings picketing Independence Hall July 4  1966  Photo taken by Kay Lahusen  Since the 1960s  many LGBT people in the West  particularly those in major metropolitan areas  have developed a so called gay culture  To many  who   gay culture is exemplified by the gay pride movement  with annual parades and displays of rainbow flags  Yet not all LGBT people choose to participate in  queer culture   and many gay men and women specifically decline to do so  To some who   it seems to be a frivolous display  perpetuating gay stereotypes  To some others  who   the gay culture represents heterophobia and is scorned as widening the gulf between gay and non gay people  With the outbreak of AIDS in the early 1980s  many LGBT groups and individuals organized campaigns to promote efforts in AIDS education  prevention  research  patient support  and community outreach  as well as to demand government support for these programs  The bewildering death toll wrought by the AIDS epidemic at first seemed to slow the progress of the gay rights movement  but in time it galvanized some parts of the LGBT community into community service and political action  and challenged the heterosexual community to respond compassionately  Major American motion pictures from this period that dramatized the response of individuals and communities to the AIDS crisis include An Early Frost  1985   Longtime Companion  1990   And the Band Played On  1993   Philadelphia  1993   and Common Threads  Stories from the Quilt  1989   Publicly gay politicians have attained numerous government posts  even in countries that had sodomy laws in their recent past  Examples include Guido Westerwelle  Germany s Vice Chancellor  Peter Mandelson  a British Labour Party cabinet minister and Per Kristian Foss  formerly Norwegian Minister of Finance  LGBT movements are opposed by a variety of individuals and organizations  Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite sex spouse undermine the traditional family 171  and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother  172  173  There is concern that gay rights may conflict with individuals  freedom of speech  174  175  176  177  178  religious freedoms in the workplace  179  180  the ability to run churches  181  charitable organizations 182  183  and other religious organizations 184  in accordance with one s religious views  and that the acceptance of homosexual relationships by religious organizations might be forced through threatening to remove the tax exempt status of churches whose views do not align with those of the government  185  186  187  188  Critics charge weasel words  that political correctness has led to the association of sex between males and HIV being downplayed  189  190  Relationships In 2006  the American Psychological Association  American Psychiatric Association and National Association of Social Workers stated in an Amicus Brief presented to the Supreme Court of the State of California   Gay men and lesbians form stable  committed relationships that are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential respects  The institution of marriage offers social  psychological  and health benefits that are denied to same sex couples  By denying same sex couples the right to marry  the state reinforces and perpetuates the stigma historically associated with homosexuality  Homosexuality remains stigmatized  and this stigma has negative consequences  California s prohibition on marriage for same sex couples reflects and reinforces this stigma   They concluded   There is no scientific basis for distinguishing between same sex couples and heterosexual couples with respect to the legal rights  obligations  benefits  and burdens conferred by civil marriage   2  Military service The US Army defines homosexual conduct as  a homosexual act  a statement by a soldier that demonstrates a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts  the solicitation of another to engage in homosexual act or acts  or a homosexual marriage or attempted marriage   191  Main article  Sexual orientation and military service Policies and attitudes toward gay and lesbian military personnel vary widely around the world  Some countries allow gay men  lesbians  and bisexual people to serve openly and have granted them the same rights and privileges as their heterosexual counterparts  Many countries neither ban nor support LGB service members  A few countries continue to ban homosexual personnel outright  Most Western military forces have removed policies excluding sexual minority members  Of the 26 countries that participate militarily in NATO  more than 20 permit openly gay  lesbian and bisexual people to serve  Of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  three  United Kingdom  France and United States  do so  The other two generally do not  China bans gay and lesbian people outright  Russia excludes all gay and lesbian people during peacetime but allows some gay men to serve in wartime  see below   Israel is the only country in the Middle East region that allows openly LGB people to serve in the military  While the question of homosexuality in the military has been highly politicized in the United States  it is not necessarily so in many countries  Generally speaking  sexuality in these cultures is considered a more personal aspect of one s identity than it is in the United States  According to American Psychological Association empirical evidence fails to show that sexual orientation is germane to any aspect of military effectiveness including unit cohesion  morale  recruitment and retention  192  Sexual orientation is irrelevant to task cohesion  the only type of cohesion that critically predicts the team s military readiness and success  193  On March 18  2010  after U S  President Obama announced that he wanted to put an end to the Don t Ask  Don t Tell policy  former U S  general and high ranking NATO official John Sheehan blamed homosexuals serving in the Dutch military for the fall of Srebrenica to Serb militias in the Bosnian War fifteen years earlier  stating that homosexuals had weakened the Dutch UN battalion charged with protecting the enclave  In the U S  Senate  Sheehan said that European countries had tried to  socialize  their armed forces by letting people serve in the army too easily  which according to him  left them weakened  He claimed that his opinion was shared by the leadership of the Dutch armed forces  mentioning the name  Hankman Berman   most probably referring to the then chief of the Dutch defence staff  Henk van den Breemen  194  Dutch authorities dismissed Sheehan s statements as  disgraceful  and  total nonsense   195  196  197  198  199  Religion Main article  Religion and homosexuality Though the relationship between homosexuality and religion can vary greatly across time and place  within and between different religions and sects  and regarding different forms of homosexuality and bisexuality  current authoritative bodies and doctrines of the world s largest religions generally view homosexuality negatively  This can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity  to explicitly forbidding same sex sexual practices among adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality  Some teach that homosexual orientation itself is sinful  200  while the Catholic Church states that only the sexual act itself is a sin  201  Some claim that homosexuality can be overcome through religious faith and practice  On the other hand  voices exist within many of these religions that view homosexuality more positively  and liberal religious denominations may bless same sex marriages  Some view same sex love and sexuality as sacred  and a mythology of same sex love can be found around the world  Regardless of their position on homosexuality  many people of faith look to both sacred texts and tradition for guidance on this issue  Heterosexism and homophobia Further information

study concluded that 49  of Holland s youth and 58  of youth foreign to the country reject homosexuality  202  Similar to other minority groups they can also be subject to stereotyping  These attitudes tend to be due to forms of homophobia and heterosexism  negative attitudes  bias  and discrimination in favor of opposite sex sexuality and relationships   Heterosexism can include the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite sex attractions and relationships are the norm and therefore superior  Homophobia is a fear of  aversion to  or discrimination against homosexual people  It manifests in different forms  and a number of different types have been postulated  among which are internalized homophobia  social homophobia  emotional homophobia  rationalized homophobia  and others  203  Similar is lesbophobia  specifically targeting lesbians  and biphobia  against bisexual people   When such attitudes manifest as crimes they are often called hate crimes and gay bashing  Negative stereotypes characterize LGB people as less romantically stable  more promiscuous and more likely to abuse children  but there is no scientific basis to such assertions  Gay men and lesbians form stable  committed relationships that are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential respects  2  Sexual orientation does not affect the likelihood that people will abuse children  204  205  206  Claims that there is scientific evidence to support an association between being gay and being a pedophile are based on misuses of those terms and misrepresentation of the actual evidence  205  Violence against gay and lesbian people Main article  Violence against LGBT people In the United States  the FBI reported that 15 6  of hate crimes reported to police in 2004 were based on perceived sexual orientation  Sixty one percent of these attacks were against gay men  207  The 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard  a gay student  is a notorious such incident in the U S  Homosexual behavior in other animals Main article  Homosexual behavior in animals Roy and Silo  two New York Central Park Zoo male Chinstrap Penguins similar to those pictured  became internationally known when they coupled and later were given an egg that needed hatching and care  which they successfully did  208  Homosexual behavior in animals refers to the documented evidence of homosexual  bisexual and transgender behavior in non human animals  Such behaviors include sex  courtship  affection  pair bonding  and parenting  20  Homosexual and bisexual behavior are widespread in the animal kingdom  a 1999 review by researcher Bruce Bagemihl shows that homosexual behavior has been observed in close to 1500 species  ranging from primates to gut worms  and is well documented for 500 of them  20  23 Animal sexual behavior takes many different forms  even within the same species  The motivations for and implications of these behaviors have yet to be fully understood  since most species have yet to be fully studied  209  According to Bagemihl   the animal kingdom  does  it with much greater sexual diversity including homosexual  bisexual and nonreproductive sex than the scientific community and society at large have previously been willing to accept   210  See also LGBT portal Anti LGBT slogans BiNet USA Fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation Gender

Journal of Theoretical Biology 230  1   33 7  doi 10 1016 j jtbi 2004 04 035  PMID 15275997   Bogaert argues that   The prevalence of male homosexuality is debated  One widely reported early estimate was 10   e g   Marmor  1980  Voeller  1990   Some recent data provided support for this estimate  Bagley and Tremblay  1998   but most recent large national samples suggest that the prevalence of male homosexuality in modern western societies  including the United States  is lower than this early estimate  e g   1 2  in Billy et al   1993  2 3  in Laumann et al   1994  6  in Sell et al   1995  1 3  in Wellings et al   1994   It is of note  however  that homosexuality is defined in different ways in these studies  For example  some use same sex behavior and not same sex attraction as the operational definition of homosexuality  e g   Billy et al   1993   many sex researchers  e g   Bailey et al   2000  Bogaert  2003  Money  1988  Zucker and Bradley  1995  now emphasize attraction over overt behavior in conceptualizing sexual orientation    p  33  Also      the prevalence of male homosexuality  in particular  same sex attraction  varies over time and across societies  and hence is a  moving target   in part because of two effects   1  variations in fertility rate or family size  and  2  the fraternal birth order effect  Thus  even if accurately measured in one country at one time  the rate of male homosexuality is subject to change and is not generalizable over time or across societies    p  33    Fay RE  Turner CF  Klassen AD  Gagnon JH  January 1989    Prevalence and
