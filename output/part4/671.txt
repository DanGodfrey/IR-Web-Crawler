rique du Sud  is a continent situated in the Western Hemisphere  mostly in the Southern Hemisphere  with a relatively small portion in the Northern Hemisphere  The continent is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas  2  3  It is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean  North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest  It includes twelve independent countries Argentina  Bolivia  Brazil  Chile  Colombia  Ecuador  Guyana  Paraguay  Peru  Suriname  Uruguay  and Venezuela and French Guiana  which is an overseas region of France  The South American countries that border the Caribbean Sea Colombia  Venezuela  Guyana  Suriname  and French Guiana are also known as Caribbean South America  South America has an area of 17 840 000 square kilometers  6 890 000 sq mi   Its population as of 2005 has been estimated at more than 371 090 000  South America ranks fourth in area  after Asia  Africa  and North America  and fifth in population  after Asia  Africa  Europe  and North America   The word America was coined in 1507 by cartographers Martin Waldseem ller and Matthias Ringmann  after Amerigo Vespucci  who was the first European to suggest that the lands newly discovered by Europeans were not India  but a New World unknown to Europeans  Contents 1 Geography 2 History 2 1 Prehistory 2 2 Pre Columbian

image of South America South America occupies the southern portion of the American landmass  The continent is generally delimited on the northwest by the Dari n watershed along the Colombia Panama border  Some sources citation needed  instead suggest the Panama Canal  Geopolitically and geographically 4  all of Panama   including the segment east of the Panama Canal in the isthmus   is typically included in North America alone 5  6  7  and among the countries of Central America  8  9  Almost all of mainland South America sits on the South American Plate  South America s triangular shape gives it the shortest coastline  for its size  of any of the continents  Traditionally South America also includes some nearby islands  Aruba  Bonaire  Cura ao  Trinidad  Tobago  and the federal dependencies of Venezuela sit on the northerly South American continental shelf and are often considered part of the continent  Geo politically  the island states and overseas territories of the Caribbean are generally grouped as a part or subregion of North America  since they are more distant on the Caribbean Plate  even though San Andreas and Providencia are politically part of Colombia and Aves Island is controlled by Venezuela  7  10  11  Other islands that are included with South America are the Gal pagos islands that belong to Ecuador and Easter Island  in Oceania but belongs to Chile   Robinson Crusoe Island  Chilo  are also Chilean islands  while Tierra del Fuego is split between that country and Argentina  In the Atlantic  Brazil owns Fernando de Noronha  Trindade and Martim Vaz  and the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago  while the Falkland Islands are governed by the United Kingdom  whose sovereignty over the islands is disputed by Argentina  South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands may be associated with either South America or Antarctica  South America is home to the world s highest waterfall  Angel Falls in Venezuela  the largest river  by volume   the Amazon River  the longest mountain range  the Andes  whose highest mountain is Aconcagua at 6 962 m  22 841 ft    the driest place on earth  the Atacama Desert  12  13  14  the largest rainforest  the Amazon Rainforest  the highest capital city  La Paz  Bolivia  the highest commercially navigable lake in the world  Lake Titicaca  and  excluding research stations in Antarctica  the world s southernmost permanently inhabited community  Puerto Toro  Chile  The Andes are the world s longest continental mountain range  South America s major mineral resources are gold  silver  copper  iron ore  tin  and petroleum  These resources found in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere  However  the concentration in producing one major export commodity often has hindered the development of diversified economies  The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states  often causing extreme political instability  This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export  South America is one of the most biodiverse continents on earth  South America is home to many interesting and unique species of animals including the llama  anaconda  piranha  jaguar  vicu a  and tapir  The Amazon rainforests possess high biodiversity  containing a major proportion of the Earth s species  Brazil is the largest country in South America  encompassing around half of the continent s land area and population  The remaining countries and territories are divided among three regions  The Andean States  the Guianas and the Southern Cone   edit  History Main article  History of South America See also  Military history of South America  edit  Prehistory The prehistoric Cueva de las Manos  or Cave of the Hands  in Argentina South America was joined with Africa from the late Paleozoic Era to the early Mesozoic Era  until the supercontinent Pangaea began to rift and break apart about 225 million years ago  Therefore  South America and Africa share similar fossils and rock layers  South America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the Bering Land Bridge  now the Bering Strait  at least 15 000 years ago from the territory that is present day Russia  They migrated south through North America  and eventually reached South America through the Isthmus of Panama  Some archaeological finds do not fit this theory and have led to an alternative theory of pre Siberian American aborigines  The first evidence for the existence of agricultural practices in South America dates back to about 9000 BC  when squashes  chillies and beans began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the Amazon Basin  Pottery evidence further suggests that manioc  which remains a staple food today  was being cultivated as early as 2000 BC  15  By 2000 BC  many agrarian village communities had been settled throughout the Andes and the surrounding religious regions  Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast  helping establish fish as a primary source of food  Irrigation systems were also developed at this time  which aided in the rise of an agrarian society  15  South American cultures began domesticating llamas  vicu as  guanacos  and alpacas in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC  Besides their use as sources of meat and wool  these animals were used for transportation of goods  15   edit  Pre Columbian civilizations Main article  Pre Columbian era South America The Inca estate of Machu Picchu  Peru The rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America  The earliest known settlements  and culture in South America and America altogether  are the Valdivia on the Southwest coast of Ecuador  One of the earliest known South American civilizations was at Norte Chico  on the central Peruvian coast  Though a pre ceramic culture  the monumental architecture of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of Ancient Egypt  Norte Chico governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by Chav n by 900 BC  according to some estimates and archaeological finds  Artifacts were found at a site called Chav n de Huantar in modern Peru at an elevation of 3 177 meters  Chav n civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC  In the central coast of Peru  around the beginning of the I millennium AD  Moche  100 BC   700 AD  at the northern coast of Peru   Paracas and Nazca  400 BC   800 AD  Peru  cultures flourished with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through irrigation and new styles of ceramic art  At the Altiplano  Tiahuanaco or Tiwanaku  100 BC   1200 AD  Bolivia  managed a large commercial network based on religion  Around 7th century  both Tiahuanaco and Wari or Huari Empire  600   1200  Central and northern Peru  expanded its influence to all the Andean region  imposing the Huari urbanism and tiahuanaco religious iconography  The Muisca were the main indigenous civilization in what is now modern Colombia  They established a confederation of many clans  or cacicazgos  that had a free trade network among themselves  They were goldsmiths and farmers  Other important Pre Columbian cultures include    the Ca aris  in south central Ecuador   Chimu Empire  1300 1470  Peruvian northern coast   Chachapoyas  and the Aymaran kingdoms  1000 1450  Bolivia and southern Peru   Holding their capital at the great city of Cusco  the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533  Known as Tawantin suyu  and  the land of the four regions   in Quechua  the Inca civilization was highly distinct and developed  Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities  some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 25 000 kilometer road system  Cities were built with precise  unmatched stonework  constructed over many levels of mountain terrain  Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture  The Mapuche in Central Chile resisted the European and Chilean settles  waging the Arauco War for more than 300 years   edit  European colonization Main articles  Spanish colonization of the Americas and Portuguese colonization of the Americas A representation of a Mestizo  in a  Pintura de Castas  in the Colonial era   From Spaniard and Amerindian woman  begets Mestizo   In 1494  Portugal and Spain  the two great maritime European powers of that time  on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west  signed the Treaty of Tordesillas  by which they agreed  with the support of the Pope  that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive duopoly between the two countries  The Treaty established an imaginary line along a north south meridian 370 leagues west of Cape Verde Islands  roughly 46  37  W  In terms of the treaty  all land to the west of the line  known to comprise most of the South American soil  would belong to Spain  and all land to the east  to Portugal  As accurate measurements of longitude were impossible at that time  the line was not strictly enforced  resulting in a Portuguese expansion of Brazil across the meridian  Beginning in the 1530s  the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign conquistadors  first from Spain and later from Portugal  These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it into colonies  European infectious diseases  smallpox  influenza  measles  and typhus  to which the native populations had no immune resistance and systems of forced labor  such as the haciendas and mining industry s mita  decimated the native population under Spanish control  After this  African slaves  who had developed immunities to these diseases  were quickly brought in to replace them  The Spaniards were committed to convert their native subjects to Christianity and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end  however  most initial attempts at this were only partially successful  as native groups simply blended Catholicism with traditional idolatry and their polytheistic beliefs  Furthermore  the Spaniards brought their language to the degree they did with their religion  although the Roman Catholic Church s evangelization in Quechua  Aymara  and Guaran  actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form  Eventually  the natives and the Spaniards interbred  forming a mestizo class  At the beginning  the mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers  After independence  most mestizos had native fathers and white or mestizo mothers  Many native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers  this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America  which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal  Spaniards and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent  and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges  roads  and the sewer system of the cities they discovered or conquered  They also significantly increased economic and trade relations  not just between the old and new world but between the different South American regions and peoples  Finally  with the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish languages  many cultures that were previously separated became united through that of Latin American  Guyana was a Portuguese  Dutch  and eventually a British colony  The country was once partitioned into three parts  each being controlled by one of the colonial powers until the country was finally taken over fully by the British   edit  Independence Main articles  Spanish American wars of independence and Brazilian Declaration of Independence Guayaquil conference  between Jos  de San Mart n and Sim n Bol var  The European Peninsular War  a theater of the Napoleonic Wars  changed the political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies  First  Napoleon invaded Portugal  but the House of Braganza avoided capture by escaping to Brazil  Napoleon captured as well the Spanish king  Ferdinand VII of Spain  and appointed his own brother instead  This appointment found severe popular resistance in the country  which created Juntas to rule in the name of the captured king  Many cities in the Spanish colonies  however  considered themselves equally authorized to appoint local Juntas than those of Spain  This began the Spanish American wars of independence  between the patriots  who promoted such autonomy  and the royalists  who though that the Spanish cities still maintained authority over the Americas  The Juntas  at both Spain and the Americas  promoted the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment  Five years after the begin of the war  Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and began the Absolutist Restauration  as the royalists got the upper hand in the conflict  The independence of South America was secured by Sim n Bol var  Venezuela  and Jos  de San Mart n  Argentina   the two most important Libertadores  Bol var led a great uprising in northern South America  then led his army southward towards Lima  the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru  Meanwhile  San Mart n led an army across the Andes Mountains  along with Chilean expatriates  and liberated Chile  He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea  and sought the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru  The two armies finally met in Guayaquil  Ecuador  where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender  In the Portuguese colony of Brazil  Dom Pedro I  also Pedro IV of Portugal   son of the Portuguese King Dom Jo o VI  proclaimed the country s independence in 1822  The country maintained a monarchical government  becoming the Empire of Brazil  After some quarreling with Portuguese loyal garrisons in Bahia and Par   this was diplomatically accepted by the crown in Portugal  on conditions of a high compensation paid by Brazil  The new independent nations began a process of Balkanization and several civil wars and wars with the neighbour countries  However  it was not as strong as in Central America  Some countries created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern day  as Paraguay or Uruguay   and others were reconquered and reincorporated into their former countries  as the Republic of Entre R os or the Riograndense Republic    edit  Recent history The Brazilian Minas Geraes class kindled an Argentine Brazilian Chilean naval arms race Early in the 20th century  the three largest South American countries engaged in a vastly expensive naval arms race which was catalyzed by the introduction of a new warship type  the  dreadnought   At one point  the Argentine government was spending a fifth of their entire yearly budget for just two dreadnoughts  a price that did not include later in service costs  which for the Brazilian dreadnoughts was sixty percent of the initial purchase  16  17  The continent became a battlefield of the Cold War in the late 20th century  Some democratically elected governments of Argentina  Brazil  Chile  Uruguay and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s  To curtail opposition  their governments detained tens of thousands of political prisoners  many of whom were tortured and or killed on inter state collaboration  Economically  they began a transition to neoliberal economic policies  They placed their own actions within the U S  Cold War doctrine of  National Security  against internal subversion  Throughout the 1980s and 1990s  Peru suffered from an internal conflict  Argentina and Britain fought the Falklands war in 1982  Colombia has had an ongoing  though diminished internal conflict  which started in 1964 with the creation of Marxist guerrillas  FARC EP  and then involved several illegal armed groups of leftist leaning ideology as well as the private armies of powerful drug lords  Many of these are now defunct  and only a small portion of the ELN remains  along with the stronger  though also greatly reduced FARC  These leftist groups smuggle narcotics out of Colombia to fund their operations  while also using kidnapping  bombings  land mines and assassinations as weapons against both elected and non elected citizens  Revolutionary movements and right wing military dictatorships became common after World War II  but since the 1980s a wave of democratization came through the continent  and democratic rule is widespread now  18  Nonetheless  allegations of corruption are still very common  and several countries have developed crises which have forced the resignation of their governments  although  in most occasions  regular civilian succession has continued this far  Presidents of UNASUR member states at the Second Bras lia Summit on 23 May 2008  International indebtedness turned into a severe problem in late 1980s  and some countries  despite having strong democracies  have not yet developed political institutions capable of handling such crises without recurring to unorthodox economical policies  as most recently illustrated by Argentina s default in the early 21st century  19  The last twenty years have seen an increased push towards regional integration  with the creation of uniquely South American institutions such as the Andean Community  Mercosur and Unasur  Notably  starting with the election of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1998  the region experienced what has been termed a pink tide   the election of several leftist and center left administrations to most countries of the area  except for the Guianas  Peru and Colombia   edit  Politics Union of South American Nations member states During the first decade of the 21st century  South American governments have drifted to the political left  with socialist leaders being elected in Chile  Uruguay  Brazil  Argentina  Ecuador  Bolivia  Paraguay  Peru and Venezuela  Despite the move to the left  South America for the most part still embraces free market policies  and it is taking an active path toward greater continental integration  Recently  an intergovernmental entity has been formed which aims to merge the two existing customs unions  Mercosur and the Andean Community  thus forming the third largest trade bloc in the world  20  This new political organization known as Union of South American Nations seeks to establish free movement of people  economic development  a common defense policy and the elimination of tariffs   edit  Ethnic demographics Descendants of Indigenous peoples  such as the Quechua and Aymara  or the Urarina 21  of Amazonia make up the majority of the population in Bolivia  56   and  per some sources  in Peru  44    22  23  In Ecuador  Amerindians are a large minority that comprises two fifths of the population  The white European population is also a significant element in most other former Portuguese colonies  The demographics of Venezuela and Colombia include approximately 20  white and European descendants  24  while in Peru  European descendants are the third group in importance  15    25  Compared to other South American countries  the people of European descent are more of a majority in Argentina  26 Chile  27  28  and Uruguay  29  and are about half of the population of Brazil  30  31  32  South America is also home to one of the largest populations of Africans  This group is also significantly present in Guyana  Brazil  Colombia  Venezuela  Suriname  French Guiana  and Ecuador  33 Mestizos  mixed white and Amerindian  are the largest ethnic group in Paraguay  Venezuela  Colombia and Ecuador and the second group in Peru  East Indians form the

During the last two decades  South American countries have experienced significant economic growth  which can be seen in many of these countries with the construction of new skyscrapers like the Gran Costanera tower in Chile  and also transportations systems like the Bogota Metro  However  because of histories of high inflation in nearly all South American countries  interest rates remain high and investment remains low  Interest rates are usually twice that of the United States  For example  interest rates are about 22  in Venezuela and 23  in Suriname  The exception is Chile  which has been implementing free market economic policies since establishing military dictatorship in 1973 and has been increasing its social spending since the return of democratic rule in the early 1990s  This has led to economic stability and interest rates in the low single digits  South America relies heavily on the exporting of goods and natural resources  On an exchange rate basis Brazil  the seventh largest economy in the world and the largest in South America  leads the way in total amount of exports at  201 9 billion dollars followed by Argentina at 68 01 billion and Chile with 64 28 billion
