University of Florida Century Tower  begun in 1953  to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of university and as a tribute to the alumni who perished in both World War I and World War II  The University of Florida traces its origins to 1853  when the East Florida Seminary  the oldest of the University of Florida s four predecessor institutions  was founded in Ocala  Florida  On January 6  1853  Florida Governor Thomas Brown signed a bill that provided public support for higher education in the state of Florida  21  Gilbert Kingsbury was the first person to take advantage of the legislation  and established the East Florida Seminary  The East Florida Seminary was the first state supported institution of higher learning in Florida  22  James Henry Roper  an educator from North Carolina and a state senator from Alachua County  built a school  the Gainesville Academy  around the same time  In 1866  after East Florida Seminary had closed during the American Civil War  23  Roper offered his land and school to the State of Florida in exchange for the relocation of East Florida Seminary to Gainesville  24  The second major precursor to the University of Florida was the Florida Agricultural College  established at Lake City by Jordan Probst in 1884  Florida Agricultural College became the state s first land grant college under the Morrill Act  In 1903  the Florida Legislature  desiring to expand the school s outlook and curriculum beyond its agricultural and engineering origins  changed the name of Florida Agricultural College to the  University of Florida   a name that the school would hold for only two years  25   edit   University of the State of Florida  In 1905  the Buckman Act consolidated the colleges of the state  The member of the Florida Legislature who wrote the act  Henry Holland Buckman  is the namesake of Buckman Hall  one of the university s oldest buildings  26  The Buckman Act reorganized the State University System of Florida and created the Florida Board of Control to govern the system  The Act abolished the pre existing state supported institutions of higher education  and consolidated the assets and academic programs of four of them to form the new  University of the State of Florida   the University of Florida at Lake City  formerly Florida Agricultural College  in Lake City  the East Florida Seminary in Gainesville  the St  Petersburg Normal and Industrial School in St  Petersburg  and the South Florida Military College in Bartow  27  The Buckman Act also consolidated the colleges and schools into three institutions segregated by race and sex the University of the State of Florida for white men  the Florida Female College for white women  and the State Normal School for Colored Students for African American men and women  28  The City of Gainesville  led by its Mayor William Reuben Thomas  campaigned to be home to the new university  29  On July 6  1905  the Board of Control selected Gainesville for the new university campus  Andrew Sledd  president of the pre existing University of Florida at Lake City  was selected to be the first president of the new University of the State of Florida  The

campus on September 26  1906 with 102 students  In 1909  the name of the school was officially simplified from the  University of the State of Florida  to the  University of Florida   The alligator
