Madison  declared his intention to establish  in this immense and fast growing city     a system of rational and practical education fitting for all and graciously opened to all   A three day long  literary and scientific convention  held in City Hall in 1830 and attended by over 100 delegates debated the terms of a plan for a new university  These New Yorkers believed the city needed a university designed for young men who would be admitted based on merit  not birthright  status or social class  On April 18  1831  an institution was established  with the support of a group of prominent New York City residents from the city s landed class of merchants  bankers  and traders  Albert Gallatin was elected as the institution s first president  On April 21  1831  the new institution received its charter and was incorporated as the University of the City of New York by the New York State Legislature  older documents often refer to it by that name  The university has been popularly known as New York University since its beginning and was officially renamed New York University in 1896  In 1832  NYU held its first classes in rented rooms of four story Clinton Hall  situated near City Hall  22  In 1835  the School of Law  NYU s first professional school  was established  Although the impetus to found a new school was partly a reaction by evangelical Presbyterians to what they perceived as the Episcopalianism of Columbia College  23  NYU was created non denominational  unlike many American colonial colleges at the time  22  The University Heights campus  now home to the Bronx Community College Whereas NYU had its Washington Square campus since its founding  the university purchased a campus at University Heights in the Bronx because of overcrowding on the old campus  NYU also had a desire to follow New York City s development further uptown  NYU s move to the Bronx occurred in 1894  spearheaded by the efforts of Chancellor Henry Mitchell MacCracken  22  The University Heights campus was far more spacious than its predecessor was  As a result  most of the university s operations along with the undergraduate College of Arts and Science and School of Engineering were housed there  NYU s administrative operations were moved to the new campus  but the graduate schools of the university remained at Washington Square  24  In 1914  Washington Square College was founded as the downtown undergraduate college of NYU  In 1935  NYU opened the  Nassau College Hofstra Memorial of New York University at Hempstead  Long Island   This extension would later become a fully independent Hofstra University  25  In the late 1960s and early 1970s  financial crisis gripped the New York City government and the troubles spread to the city s institutions  including NYU  26  Feeling the pressures of imminent bankruptcy  NYU President James McNaughton Hester negotiated the sale of the University Heights campus to the City University of New York  which occurred in 1973  After the sale of the Bronx campus  University College merged with Washington Square College  In the 1980s  under the leadership of President John Brademas  27  NYU launched a billion dollar campaign that was spent almost entirely on updating facilities  28  The campaign was set to complete in 15 years  but ended up being completed in 10  29  In 2003 President John Sexton launched a 2 5 billion dollar campaign for funds to be spent especially on faculty and financial aid resources  30   edit  University logo The university logo  the upheld torch  is derived from the Statue of Liberty  signifying NYU s service to the city of New York  The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo  designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer Tom Geismar of the branding and design firm Chermayeff  amp  Geismar  There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color  violet  Some believe that it may have been chosen because violets are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building  Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with Athens  the center of learning in ancient Greece  21   edit  Cultural setting Washington Square and Greenwich Village have been hubs of cultural life in New York City since the early nineteenth century  Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history  Artists of the Hudson River School  the United States  first prominent school of painters  settled around Washington Square  Samuel F B  Morse  the first chair of Painting and Sculpture at NYU  and Daniel Huntington were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid nineteenth century   The University rented out studio space and residential apartments within the  academic  building   Artists and intellectuals such as Edgar Allan Poe  Mark Twain  Herman Melville and Walt Whitman contributed to the artistic scene near NYU  As a result  they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university  26  In the 1870s  sculptors Augustus Saint Gaudens and Daniel Chester French lived and worked near the Square  By the 1920s  Washington Square Park was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion  As such  the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy  contributing to academic change at NYU  26  Famed residents of this time include Eugene O Neill  John Sloan  and Maurice Prendergast  In the 1930s  the abstract expressionists Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning  and the realists Edward Hopper and Thomas Hart Benton had studios around Washington Square  In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation  when Allen Ginsberg and Bob Dylan settled there  This led to tension with the university  which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase  26  In 1975  the university opened The Grey Art Gallery at 100 Washington Square East  housing the New York University art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions  31  32   edit  Campus Main article  Campus of New York University Most of NYU s buildings are located across a roughly 229 acre area bounded by Houston Street to the south

highly selective NYU Abu Dhabi campus  112  During the admissions process  some institutions at NYU are relatively more selective than others in certain categories  depending on the institution s educational goals  For example  NYU s Abu Dhabi program looks primarily for students who have demonstrated a history of leadership in addition to gifted intellectual ability  the average SAT scores of

the United States  119  The 2007 2008 academic year was the most successful fundraising year to date for NYU  with the school raising  698 million in only the first 11 months of the year  representing

across campuses  Since the beginning of the 20th century initiation ceremonies have welcomed incoming NYU freshmen  At the Bronx University Heights Campus  seniors used to grab unsuspecting freshmen  take them to a horse watering trough  and then dunk them head first into what was known colloquially as  the Fountain of Knowledge   This underground initiation took place until the 1970s  132  Today freshmen take part in university sponsored activities during what is called  Welcome Week   In addition  throughout the year the university traditionally holds Apple Fest  an apple themed country fest that began at the University Heights campus   the Violet Ball  a dance in the atrium of Bobst Library   Strawberry Fest  featuring New York City s longest Strawberry Shortcake   and the semi annual midnight breakfast where Student Affairs administrators serve free breakfast to students before finals   edit  Greek life Greek life first formed on the NYU campus in 1837 when Psi Upsilon chartered its Delta Chapter  8  The first fraternities at NYU were social ones  With their athletic  professional  intellectual  and service activities  later groups sought to attract students who also formed
