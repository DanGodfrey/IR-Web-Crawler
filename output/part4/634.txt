Capital punishment in the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Capital punishment in the United States  in practice  applies only for aggravated murder and more rarely for felony murder  1 Capital punishment was a penalty at common law  for many felonies  and was enforced in all of the American colonies prior to the Declaration of Independence  Following the American Revolution the Anglo American common law was maintained in the United States  capital punishment with it  The methods of execution and the crimes subject to the penalty vary by jurisdiction and have varied widely throughout time  though the most common method in recent decades has been lethal injection  Thirty four jurisdictions have banned it by law  others have suspended its use  and others are trying to expand its applicability  There were 37 executions in the United States in 2008  2  the lowest number since 1994 3   largely due to lethal injection litigation revolving around a now resolved constitutional question   4  5  There were 46 executions in 2010  44 by lethal injection  one by electric chair  in Virginia   and one by firing squad  in Utah   6  In 2010  12 states executed 46 inmates   28 white  13 black and 5 Hispanic prisoners  in 2009  52 people were executed   7  Capital punishment is a contentious social issue in the United States  While historically  a large majority of the American public has favored it in cases of murder  the extent of this support has varied over time  There has long been strong opposition from many sectors of the population  and As of 2012 update   sixteen states  as well as Washington  D C   have banned its use  While the level of public support today is lower than it was in the 1980s and 1990s  reaching an all time high of 80  in 1994   it has been largely static over the past decade  8  A 2011 Gallup poll showed 61  of Americans favored it in cases of murder while 35  opposed it  the lowest level of support recorded by Gallup since 1972  9  When life in prison without parole is listed as a poll option  the public is more evenly divided  a 2010 Gallup poll found 49  preferring the death penalty and 46  favoring life without parole  10  Contents 1 History 1 1 States without capital punishment 1 1 1 Michigan 1 1 2 Alaska and Hawaii 1 1 3 Other states 1 1 4 Recent abolition 1 2 Puerto Rico 1 3

American colonies was carried out in 1608 on Captain George Kendall  11  who was executed by firing squad at the Jamestown colony for allegedly spying for the Spanish government  12  The Espy file  13  compiled by M  Watt Espy and John Ortiz Smykla  lists 15 269 people executed in the United States and its predecessor colonies between 1608 and 1991  4 661 executions occurred in the U S  in the period from 1930 to 2002 with about two thirds of the executions occurring in the first 20 years  14  Additionally  the United States Army executed 135 soldiers between 1916 and 1999  15  16  17  The largest single execution in United States history was the hanging of 38 Dakota people convicted of murder and rape during the brutal Dakota War of 1862  They were executed simultaneously on December 26  1862  in Mankato  Minnesota  A single blow from an axe cut the rope that held the large four sided platform  and the prisoners  except for one whose rope had broken and who had to be re hanged  fell to their deaths  18  The second largest mass execution was also a hanging  the execution of 13 African American soldiers for taking part in the Houston Riot in 1917  The largest non military public mass execution in one of the original thirteen colonies occurred in 1723  when 26 convicted pirates were hanged in Newport  Rhode Island by order of the Admiralty Court  19   edit  States without capital punishment  edit  Michigan Historically  several states have always been without capital punishment  the earliest being Michigan  which has not conducted an execution since it entered the Union   However  one federal execution occurred in Michigan in 1938   Shortly after attaining statehood  Michigan abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes  becoming the first English speaking government in the world to abolish the death penalty for all crimes except treason  20  21  22  In 1963  Michigan amended its constitution to prevent later attempts at reinstatement  Every attempt through referendums and voter initiatives to reinstate the penalty since 1963 has failed  the latest being a failed attempt at a referendum in 2004  23   edit  Alaska and Hawaii The newest two states  Alaska and Hawaii  abolished the death penalty prior to statehood  Alaska  however  had executed eight men during the earlier territorial government  1900 1959  and even earlier  Miner s Courts  had executed a number of men in the 19th century  24   edit  Other states Other states with long tenures of no death penalty include Wisconsin  with the distinction of being the only state to perform a single state level execution in its history  and also the first to abolish the death penalty for all crimes   Rhode Island  although later reintroduced  it was unused and abolished again   Maine  North Dakota  Minnesota  West Virginia  Iowa  and Vermont  The District of Columbia has also abolished the death penalty  it was last applied there in 1957  One state  Oregon  abolished the death penalty through an overwhelming majority in a 1964 public referendum  25  but reinstated it in a 1984 joint death penalty life imprisonment referendum by an even higher margin  after a similar 1978 referendum succeeded but was not implemented due to judicial rulings   edit  Recent abolition As of March 2011  the following U S  states have fully abolished the death penalty  Alaska  Hawaii  Illinois  Iowa  Maine  Michigan  Minnesota  New Jersey  New Mexico  North Dakota  Rhode Island  Vermont  West Virginia and Wisconsin  The District of Columbia has also abolished the death penalty  New Mexico may yet execute two condemned inmates sentenced prior to abolition  In Illinois  where recent abolition legislation took effect on July 1  2011  all former death row inmates have been moved to regular jail cells  26  Only three of the above states have legislatively abolished the death penalty in the so called  modern era of capital punishment   and only two have attained de facto abolition through their state judiciaries  the remainder either abolished capital punishment before the moratorium was lifted  or had statutes that were struck down and did not reinstate the death penalty  In 2007  New Jersey became the first state to repeal the death penalty in the modern system of capital punishment  27  followed by New Mexico in 2009  though not retroactively  permitting the future execution of two inmates on the state s death row   and Illinois in 2011  with the Governor commuting the death sentences of all death row inmates   28  29  30  However  in states with a large death row population and regular executions  including Texas  31  32  the death penalty remains strongly in the landscape and is unlikely to end at any time soon  33  34  35  36  37  38  Four states in the modern era  Nebraska in 2008  New York and Kansas in 2004  and Massachusetts in 1984  had their statutes ruled unconstitutional by state courts  The death rows of New York and Massachusetts were disestablished  Of the four states  only Nebraska has performed executions since the constitutionality of capital punishment was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1976  the four states having done so last in 1997  1963  1965  and 1947  respectively  In New York and Massachusetts  attempts to restore the death penalty were unsuccessful  39  40  while Kansas successfully appealed State v  Kleypas  the Kansas Supreme Court decision that declared the state s death penalty statute unconstitutional  to the U S  Supreme Court    and death sentences continue to be sought  New York had previously abolished the death penalty temporarily  in 1860  41  Nebraska has performed three executions since 1976  all in the 1990s  its statute has been ineffective since February 8  2008  when the method used  electrocution  was ruled unconstitutional by the Nebraska Supreme Court  However  Nebraska since enacted bill providing executions by lethal injection  The only jurisdictions with constitutional death penalty statutes that have not performed an execution since 1976 are New Hampshire  Kansas  and the United States military  although all have populated death rows   edit  Puerto Rico The U S  territory of Puerto Rico has no death penalty  Puerto Rico instituted a four year moratorium on the use of the death penalty in 1917  The last execution took place in 1927 and the Puerto Rican legislature abolished the death penalty in 1929  42  Puerto Rico s constitution expressly forbids capital punishment  stating  The death penalty shall not exist   setting it apart from all US states and territories other than Michigan  which also has a constitutional prohibition  eleven other states and the District of Columbia have abolished capital punishment through statutory law   however  capital punishment is still applicable to offenses committed in Puerto Rico  if they fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government  though federal death penalty prosecutions that have occurred in Puerto Rico have generated significant controversy  43   edit  Suspension by Supreme Court Further information  Furman v  Georgia Executions in the US since 1960 Capital punishment was suspended in the United States from 1972 through 1976 primarily as a result of the Supreme Court s decision in Furman v  Georgia  408 U S  238  1972   The last pre Furman execution was that of Luis Monge on June 2  1967  In this case  the court found the imposition of the death penalty in a consolidated group of cases to be unconstitutional  on the grounds of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment to the United States Constitution  In Furman  the United States Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases  The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia s death penalty statute  which featured a  unitary trial  procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and  simultaneously  determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment  In a five to four decision  the Supreme Court struck down the imposition of the death penalties in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional  The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision  however  and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result  The narrowest opinions  those of Byron White and Potter Stewart  expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law  Stewart and William O  Douglas worried explicitly about racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty  Thurgood Marshall and William J  Brennan  Jr  expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as  cruel and unusual  punishment  Though many observers expected few  if any  states to readopt the death penalty after Furman  citation needed  37 states did in fact enact new death penalty statutes which attempted to address the concerns of White and Stewart  Some of the states responded by enacting  mandatory  death penalty statutes which prescribed a sentence of death for anyone convicted of certain forms of murder  White had hinted such a scheme would meet his constitutional concerns in his Furman opinion   Other states adopted  bifurcated  trial and sentencing procedures  with various procedural limitations on the jury s ability to pronounce a death sentence designed to limit juror discretion  The Court clarified Furman in Woodson v  North Carolina  428 U S  280  1976  and Roberts v  Louisiana  428 U S  325  1976   431 U S  633   1977   which explicitly forbade any state from punishing a specific form of murder  such as that of a police officer  with a mandatory death penalty  Capital Punishment Since 1976 by jurisdiction  Jurisdiction Executions nb 1  Current death row inmates nb 2  Texas 480

row  This box  view talk edit  edit  Capital punishment resumed Further information  Gregg v  Georgia In 1976  contemporaneously with Woodson and Roberts  the Court decided Gregg v  Georgia  428 U S  153  1976  and upheld a procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt innocence and sentencing phases  At the first proceeding  the jury decides the defendant s guilt  if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first degree murder  the death penalty will not be imposed  At the second hearing  the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist  and whether any mitigating factors exist  and  in many jurisdictions  weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty   either death or life in prison  either with or without parole  The 1977 Coker v  Georgia decision barred the death penalty for rape  and  by implication  for any offense other than murder  The current federal kidnapping statute  however  may be exempt because the death penalty applies if the victim expires in the perpetrator s custody  not necessarily by his hand  thus stipulating a resulting death  which was the wording of the objection  In addition  the federal government retains the death penalty for such non murder offenses as treason  espionage and crimes under military jurisdiction  there has been no challenge to these statutes as of 2007  Executions resumed on January 17  1977  when Gary Gilmore went before a firing squad in Utah  But the pace was quite halting due to use of litigation tactics which involved filing repeated writs for habeas corpus  which succeeded for many in delaying their actual execution for many years  Although hundreds of individuals were sentenced to death in the U S  during the 1970s and early 1980s  only ten people besides Gilmore  who had waived all of his appeal rights  were actually executed prior to 1984  The United States Supreme Court  though  has placed two major restrictions on the use of the death penalty  First  the Supreme Court case of Atkins v  Virginia  decided June 20  2002  44  held that executions of mentally retarded criminals are  cruel and unusual punishments  prohibited by the Eighth Amendment  Generally  a person with an IQ below 70 is considered to be mentally retarded  Prior to this decision  between 1984 and 2002 forty four mentally retarded inmates were executed  45  Second  in 2005 the Supreme Court s decision in Roper v  Simmons  543 U S  551  2005   abolished executions for persons under the age of 18 at the time of the crime  New Mexico repealed its death penalty statute on March 17  2009  becoming the second state  after New Jersey  to abolish the death penalty since executions resumed in 1976  However  the only prisoner executed after 1976 wanted to be executed   The law  signed by Governor Bill Richardson  took effect on July 1  2009 and replaces the death penalty with a life sentence without the possibility of parole  The law  though  is not retroactive   inmates currently on New Mexico s Death Row and persons convicted of capital offenses committed before this date may still be sentenced to death under New Mexico s pre existing death penalty statute  46 Connecticut is considering legislation to abolish its death penalty in the current legislative session  A bill to abolish the death penalty was vetoed by former governor M  Jodi Rell in June 2009 after it easily passed in the General Assembly  47  Current governor Dan Malloy indicated he would sign a bill abolishing the death penalty if it was passed by the General Assembly  48  Possibly in part due to expedited federal habeas corpus procedures embodied in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996  the pace of executions has picked up  Since the death penalty was reauthorized in 1976  1 280 people have been executed  almost exclusively by the states  with most occurring after 1990  Texas has accounted for over a third of modern executions 31  32   and over four times as many as Virginia  the state with the second highest number   California has the greatest number of prisoners on death row  but has held relatively few executions  See the table for executions and death row inmates by jurisdiction   edit  New concerns post Furman In the decades since Furman  new questions have emerged about whether or not prosecutorial arbitrariness has replaced sentencing arbitrariness  A study by Pepperdine University School of Law published in Temple Law Review   Unpredictable Doom and Lethal Injustice  An Argument for Greater Transparency in Death Penalty Decisions   surveyed the decision making process among prosecutors in various states  The authors found that prosecutors  capital punishment filing decisions remain marked by local  idiosyncrasies   suggesting they are not in keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court s directive  This means that  the very types of unfairness that the Supreme Court sought to eliminate  may still  infect capital cases   Wide prosecutorial discretion remains because of overly broad criteria  California law  for example  has 22  special circumstances   making nearly all premeditated murders potential capital cases  The 37 death penalty states have varying numbers and types of  death qualifiers    circumstances that allow for capital charges  The number varies from a high of 34 in California to 22 in Colorado and Delaware to 12 in Texas  Nebraska  Georgia and Montana  The study s authors call for reform of state procedures along the lines of reforms in the federal system  which the U S  Department of Justice initiated with a 1995 protocol  49   edit  Crimes subject to capital punishment Crimes subject to the death penalty vary by jurisdiction  All jurisdictions that use capital punishment designate the highest grade of murder a capital crime  although most jurisdictions require aggravating circumstances  Treason against the United States  as well as treason against the states of Arkansas  California  Colorado  Georgia  Louisiana  Mississippi  Missouri  and Washington are capital offenses  50  Other capital crimes include  the use of a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death  espionage  terrorism  certain violations of the Geneva Conventions that result in the death of one or more persons  and treason at the federal level  aggravated rape in Louisiana  Florida  51  and Oklahoma  extortionate kidnapping in Oklahoma  aggravated kidnapping in Georgia  Idaho  Kentucky and South Carolina  aircraft hijacking in Alabama  drug trafficking resulting in a person s death in Connecticut and Florida  52  train wrecking which leads to a person s death  and perjury which leads to a person s death in California  50  53  54  Additionally  the Uniform Code of Military Justice allows capital punishment for a list of offenses during wartime including  desertion  mutiny  spying  and misconduct before the enemy  In practice  no one has been executed for a crime other than murder or conspiracy to murder since James Coburn was executed for robbery in Alabama on September 4  1964  55  On June 25  2008 in Kennedy v  Louisiana  the U S  Supreme Court ruled against Louisiana s death penalty for child rapists  saying  there is a distinction between intentional first degree murder on the one hand and nonhomicide crimes against individual persons   56  The Court went further  ruling out the death penalty for any crime against an individual  as opposed to  offenses against the state   such as treason or espionage  or crimes against humanity   where the victim s life was not taken   57  As of November 2008  there is only one person on death row facing capital punishment who has not been convicted of murder  Demarcus Sears remains under a death sentence in Georgia for the crime of  Kidnapping With Bodily Injury   Sears was convicted in 2006 for the Kidnapping and Bodily Injury of victim Gloria Ann Wilbur  Wilbur was kidnapped and beaten in Georgia  raped in Tennessee  and murdered in Kentucky  Sears was never charged with the murder of Wilbur in Kentucky  but was sentenced to death by a jury in Georgia for Kidnapping with Bodily Injury  58  59  Several people who were executed have received posthumous pardons for their crimes  For example  slave revolt was a capital crime  and many who were executed for that reason have since been posthumously pardoned  The last executions solely for crimes other than homicide  Crime Convict Date State Aiding a runaway slave Starling Carlton 1859 South Carolina Arson

 64  17790615June 15  1779 Illinois Country  present day Illinois   edit  The legal process The legal administration of the death penalty in the United States is complex  Typically  it involves four critical steps   1  sentencing   2  direct review   3  state collateral review  and  4  federal habeas corpus  Recently  a narrow and final fifth level of process  5  the Section 1983 challenge has become increasingly important  65   Clemency or pardon  through which the Governor or President of the jurisdiction can unilaterally reduce or abrogate a death sentence  is an executive rather than judicial process  66   The number of new death sentences handed down peaked in 1995 1996  309   There were 104 new death sentences handed down in 2010  the lowest number since 1973  44    67   edit  Direct review If a defendant is sentenced to death at the trial level  the case then goes into a direct review  68  The direct review process is a typical legal appeal  An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not  69  Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes  If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing  the appellate court will affirm the judgment  or let the sentence stand  68  If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur  then it will reverse the judgment  or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing  70  Lastly  if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty  a rarity  then it will order the defendant acquitted  or not guilty  of the crime for which he she was given the death penalty  and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible  70  About 60  survive the process of direct review intact  71   edit  State collateral review At times when a death sentence is affirmed on direct review  it is considered final  Yet  supplemental methods to attack the judgment  though less familiar than a typical appeal  do remain  These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review  that is  an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final  72  Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state level trial  as is usually the case  the first step in collateral review is state collateral review   If the case is a federal death penalty case  it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus   Although all states have some type of collateral review  the process varies widely from state to state  73  Generally  the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review  74  Most often these are claims  such as ineffective assistance of counsel  which require the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record  something courts may not do in an ordinary appeal  State collateral review  though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus  is rarely successful in and of itself  Only around 6  of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review  75 In 2010  the death sentences of 53 inmates were overturned as a result of legal appeals or high court reversals  76   edit  Federal habeas corpus After a death sentence is affirmed in state collateral review  the prisoner may file for federal habeas corpus  which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts  Federal habeas corpus is a species of collateral review  and it is the only way that state prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court  other than petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review   The scope of federal habeas corpus is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996  which restricted significantly its previous scope  The purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts  through the process of direct review and state collateral review  have done at least a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner s federal constitutional rights  Prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime  though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process  evidence of innocence must be truly compelling  77  Review through federal habeas corpus is narrow in theory  but it is important in practice  According to Eric Freedman  21  of death penalty cases are reversed through federal habeas corpus  75  James Lieberman  a professor of law at Columbia Law School  stated in 1996 that his study found that when habeas corpus petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case that there was  a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995   78  Similarly  a study by Ronald Tabek in a law review article puts the success rate in habeas corpus cases involving death row inmates even higher  finding that between  1976 and 1991  approximately 47  of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted   79  The different numbers are largely definitional  rather than substantive  Freedam s statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed  while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to habeas corpus review  A similar process is available for prisoners sentenced to death by the judgment of a federal court  80   edit  Section 1983 contested Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act  a state prisoner is ordinarily only allowed one suit for habeas corpus in federal court  If the federal courts refuse to issue a writ of habeas corpus  an execution date may be set  In recent times  however  prisoners have postponed execution through a final round of federal litigation using the Civil Rights Act of 1871   codified at 42 U S C    1983   which allows people to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights  Traditionally  Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus  not Section 1983  is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death  81  In the 2006 Hill v  McDonough case  however  the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state s method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment  The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death  but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out  Therefore  the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit  Yet  as Clarence Hill s own case shows  lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay  Further  the Court s decision in Baze v  Rees  upholding a lethal injection method used by many states  has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through 1983   edit  Mitigating factors The United States Supreme Court in Penry v  Lynaugh and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Bigby v  Dretke have been clear in their decisions that jury instructions in death penalty cases that do not ask about mitigating factors regarding the defendant s mental health violate the defendant s Eighth Amendment rights  saying that the jury is to be instructed to consider mitigating factors when answering unrelated questions  This ruling suggests that specific explanations to the jury are necessary to weigh mitigating factors   edit  Methods The former State of Louisiana execution chamber at the Red Hat Cell Block in the Louisiana State Penitentiary in West Feliciana Parish  The electric chair is a replica of the original  Usage of lethal injection for executions in the United StatesColor key    State uses only this method   State uses this method primarily but has secondary methods   State has never used this method   State once used this method  but no longer does Number of executions each year by the method used in the United States and the earlier colonies from 1608 to 2004  The adoption of electrocution caused a marked drop off in the number of hangings  which was used even less with the use of the gas chamber  After Gregg v  Georgia  most states changed to lethal injection  leading to its rise  Various methods have been used in the history of the American colonies and the United States but only five methods are currently used  Historically  burning  crushing  breaking on wheel  and bludgeoning were used for a small number of executions  while hanging was the most common method  The last person burned at the stake was a black slave in South Carolina August 1825  82  The last person to be hanged in chains was a murderer named John Marshall in West Virginia on April 4  1913  Although beheading was a legal method in Utah from 1851 to 1888  it was never used  83  The last use of the firing squad between 1608 and the moratorium on judicial executions between 1967 and 1977 was when Utah shot James W  Rodgers on March 30  1960  The last use of the gallows between 1608 and the moratorium was when Kansas hanged George York on June 22  1965  The last use of the electric chair between the first electrocution on August 6  1890 and the moratorium was when Oklahoma electrocuted James French on August 10  1966  The last use of the gas chamber between the first gassing on February 8  1924 and the moratorium was when Colorado gassed Luis Monge on June 2  1967  The moratorium ended January 17  1977 with the shooting of Gary Gilmore by firing squad in Utah  The first use of the electric chair after the moratorium was the electrocution of John Spenkelink in Florida May 25  1979  The first use of the gas chamber after the moratorium was the gassing of Jesse Bishop in Nevada October 22  1979  The first use of the gallows after the moratorium was the hanging of Westley Allan Dodd in Washington January 5  1993  December 7  1982 is also an important day in the history of capital punishment in the United States  Charles Brooks  Jr   put to death in Texas  was the first person executed by lethal injection  Until the 21st century  electrocution and gassing were the most prevalent methods of execution in the United States  The electrocutions of John Evans and Horace Franklin Douglas  Jr  in Alabama  Jesse Tafero  Pedro Medina  and Allen Lee Davis in Florida  Alpha Otis Stephens in Georgia  William E  Vandiver in Indiana  Frank J  Coppola  Wilbert Lee Evans  and Derick Lynn Peterson in Virginia  and the gassings of Jimmy Lee Gray in Mississippi and Donald Eugene Harding in Arizona were botched and are often cited by opponents of capital punishment as unacceptable outcomes of such methods  Currently  lethal injection is the method used or allowed in all of the 34 states which allow the death penalty  Nebraska required electrocution  but in 2008 the state s supreme court ruled that the method was unconstitutional  In mid 2009 Nebraska officially changed its method of execution to lethal injection  84  85  86  Other states also allow electricity  firing squads  hanging and lethal gas  From 1976 to March 15  2012  there were 1 286 executions  of which 1 112 were by lethal injection  157 by electrocution  11 by gas chamber  3 by hanging  and 3 by firing squad  87  The method of execution of federal prisoners for offenses under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is that of the state in which the conviction took place  If the state has no death penalty  the judge must choose a state with the death penalty for carrying out the execution  For offenses under the 1988 Drug Kingpin Law  the method of executions is lethal injection  The Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute  Indiana is currently the home of the only death chamber for federal death penalty recipients in the United States  where inmates are put to death by lethal injection  The complex has so far been the only location used for federal executions post Gregg  Timothy McVeigh and Juan Garza were put to death in June 2001  and Louis Jones  Jr  was put to death on March 18  2003  In 2004  Utah made lethal injection the only form of capital punishment  However those already on death row were grandfathered on the type of execution they chose at sentencing  At the time of the change in the law there were still three inmates on Utah s death row who had selected firing squad  The use of lethal injection has become standard  The last executions by other methods are as follows  Method Date State Convict Electrocution 20100318March 18  2010 Virginia Paul Powell Shooting 20100618June 18  2010 Utah Ronnie Lee Gardner Lethal gas 19990303March 3  1999 Arizona Walter LaGrand 88  Hanging 19960125January 25  1996 Delaware William Bailey The remaining two states that allow hanging 89  are New Hampshire  which allows it at the decision of the Corrections officials  90  and Washington  at the decision of the prisoner  91  Electrocution was the preferred method of execution during the 20th century  Electric chairs have commonly been nicknamed Old Sparky  however  Alabama s electric chair became known as the  Yellow Mama  due to its unique color  Some  particularly in Florida  were noted for malfunctions  which caused discussion of their cruelty and resulted in a shift to lethal injection as the preferred method of execution  Although lethal injection dominates as a method of execution  some states allow prisoners on death row to choose the method used to execute them  Regardless of the method  an hour or two before the execution  the condemned person is offered religious services  and a last meal  except in Texas   the contents of which is often released to the news media  Executions are carried out in private with only invited persons able to view the proceedings  in some cases  journalists have reserved spots  such as in Texas  where The Associated Press is entitled to send a reporter to witness each execution   edit  Debate Main article  Capital punishment debate Capital punishment is a controversial issue  with many prominent organizations and individuals participating in the debate  Amnesty International and some religions oppose capital punishment on moral grounds  while the Innocence Project works to free wrongly convicted prisoners  including death row inmates  based on newly available DNA tests  Other groups  such as the Southern Baptists  law enforcement organizations  and some victims  rights groups support capital punishment  The United States is one of only four industrialized democracies that still practice capital punishment  From the others  Japan and Singapore have executed prisoners  like the United States  while South Korea currently has a moratorium in effect  Elections have sometimes turned on the issue  in 1986  three justices were removed from the Supreme Court of California by the electorate  including Chief Justice Rose Bird  partly because of their opposition to the death penalty  Religious groups are widely split on the issue of capital punishment  92  generally with more conservative groups more likely to support it and more liberal groups more likely to oppose it  The Fiqh Council of North America  a group of highly influential Muslim scholars in the United States  has issued a fatwa calling for a moratorium on capital punishment in the United States until various preconditions in the legal system are met  93  In October 2009  the American Law Institute voted to disavow the framework for capital punishment that it had created in 1962  as part of the Model Penal Code   in light of the current intractable institutional and structural obstacles to ensuring a minimally adequate system for administering capital punishment   A study commissioned by the institute had said that experience had proved that the goal of individualized decisions about who should be executed and the goal of systemic fairness for minorities and others could not be reconciled  94  In total  141 prisoners have been either acquitted  or received pardons or commutations on the basis of possible innocence  since 1973  95  Death penalty opponents often argue that this statistic shows how perilously close states have come to undertaking wrongful executions  proponents point out that the statistic refers only to those exonerated in law  and that the truly innocent may be a smaller number  Arguments for and against capital punishment are based on moral  practical  and religious grounds  Advocates of the death penalty argue that it deters crime  is a good tool for prosecutors  in plea bargaining for example   96  improves the community by eliminating recividism by executed criminals  provides closure to surviving victims or loved ones  and is a just penalty for the crimes it punishes  Opponents argue that the death penalty is not an effective means of deterring crime  97  risks the execution of the innocent  is unnecessarily barbaric in nature  is levied disproportionately upon men  racial minorities  and the poor  cheapens human life  and puts a government on the same base moral level as those criminals involved in murder  98  Another argument  specific to the United States  in the capital punishment debate is the cost  The convict is more likely to use the whole appeals process if the jury issues a death sentence than if it issues life without parole  99  But others who contest this argument say that the greater cost of appeals where the prosecution does seek the death penalty is offset by the savings from avoiding trial altogether in cases where the defendant pleads guilty to avoid the death penalty  100  As noted in the introduction to this article  the American public has recently maintained its position of support for capital punishment for murder  However  when given a choice between the death penalty and life imprisonment without parole  support has traditionally been significantly lower than polling which has only mentioned the death penalty as a punishment  in the 2010 poll  for instance  the disparity narrowed  with 49  favoring the death penalty and 46  favoring life imprisonment  10  The highest level of support recorded overall was 80  in 1994  16  opposed   and the lowest recorded was 42  in 1966  47  opposed   on the question of the death penalty vs  life without parole  the strongest preference for the death penalty was 61  in 1997  29  favoring life   and the lowest preference for the death penalty was 47  in 2006  48  favoring life   8  After the September 2011 execution of Troy Davis  believed by many to be innocent  Richard Dieter  the director of the Death Penalty Information Center  said this case was a clear wake up call to politicians across the USA  He said   They weren t expecting such passion from people in opposition to the death penalty  There s a widely held perception that all Americans are united in favour of executions  but this message came across loud and clear that many people are not happy with it   Brian Evans of Amnesty International  which led the campaign to spare Davis s life  said that there was a groundswell in America of people  who are tired of a justice system that is inhumane and inflexible and allows executions where there is clear doubts about guilt   He predicted the debate would now be conducted with renewed energy  101   edit  Ages of condemned prisoners Executions in the United States from 1608 to 2009 Executions in the United States from 1930 to 2009 Total number of prisoners on Death Row in the United States from 1953 to 2008 Since 1642  in the 13 colonies  the United States under the Articles of Confederation  and the current United States  an estimated 364 juvenile offenders have been put to death by states and the federal government  The earliest known execution of a prisoner for crimes committed as a juvenile was Thomas Graunger in 1642  Twenty two of the executions occurred after 1976  in seven states  Due to the slow process of appeals  it was highly unusual for a condemned person to be under 18 at the time of execution  The youngest person to be executed in the 20th century was George Stinney  electrocuted in South Carolina at the age of 14  June 16  1944  The last execution of a juvenile may have been Leonard Shockley  who died in the Maryland gas chamber April 10  1959  at the age of 17  No one has been under age 19 at time of execution since at least 1964  102  103  Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976  22 people have been executed for crimes committed under the age of 18  21 were 17 at the time of the crime  The last person to be executed for a crime committed as a juvenile was Scott Hain April 3  2003 in Oklahoma  104  Before 2005  of the 38 U S  states that allow capital punishment  19 states and the federal government had set a minimum age of 18  5 states had set a minimum age of 17  and 14 states had explicitly set a minimum age of 16  or were subject to the Supreme Court s imposition of that minimum  16 was held to be the minimum permissible age in the 1988 Supreme Court of the United States decision of Thompson v  Oklahoma  The Supreme Court  considering the case Roper v  Simmons  in March 2005  found execution of juvenile offenders unconstitutional by a 5 4 margin  effectively raising the minimum permissible age to 18  State laws have not been updated to conform with this decision  Under the US system  unconstitutional laws do not need to be repealed  but are instead held to be unenforceable   See also List of juvenile offenders executed in the United States   edit  Distribution of sentences Within the context of the overall murder rate  the death penalty cannot be said to be widely or routinely used in the United States  in recent years the average has been about one execution for about every 700 murders committed  or 1 execution for about every 325 murder convictions   edit  Among those sentenced It is noted that the death penalty is sought and applied more often in some jurisdictions  not only between states but within states  A 2004 Cornell University study showed that while 2 5  of murderers convicted nationwide were sentenced to the death penalty  in Nevada 6  were given the death penalty  105 Texas gave 2  of murderers the death sentence  less than the national average  Texas  however  executed 40  of those sentenced  which was about four times higher than the national average  California had executed only 1  of those sentenced   edit  Among races African Americans made up 41  of death row inmates while making up only 12  of the general population   They have made up 34  of those actually executed since 1976   106  However  that number is lower than that of prison inmates  which is 47  107  According to a 2003 Amnesty International report  Africans and Europeans were the victims of murder in almost equal numbers  yet 80  of the people executed since 1977 were convicted of murders involving white victims  106  A summary of executions in Texas since 1982 concludes  32  White  216   46   pop   80   Black  172   37   pop   12   Latin  78   16   pop   16   Asian  2   0 4   pop   5    Percentage totals exceed 100  due to mixed race   According to the Death Penalty Information Center there was 46 executions in the United States in 2010 and 55  of those people were white and 76  of the victims were white as well  As of January 1  2011 there was 3251 people sitting on death row and 44  of those people are white   edit  Among genders As of October 31st  2010 108   men account for 98 3   3206  of the persons currently on death row  while women account for 1 7   55   men account for 99   1220  of the persons executed in recent years  while women account for 1 0   12    edit  Location of executions  public versus private The last public execution in America was that of Rainey Bethea in Owensboro  Kentucky  on August 14  1936  It was the last death sentence in the nation at which the general public was permitted to attend without any legally imposed restrictions   Public execution  is a legal phrase  defined by the laws of various states  and carried out pursuant to a court order  Similar to  public record  or  public meeting   it means that anyone who wants to attend the execution may do so  About 1890  a political movement developed in the United States to mandate private executions  Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a  wall  or  enclosure  to  exclude public view   For example  in 1919  the Missouri legislature adopted a statute  L 1919  p  781  which required   the sentence of death should be executed within the county jail  if convenient  and otherwise within an enclosure near the jail   The Missouri law permitted the local sheriff to distribute passes to individuals  usually local citizens  who he believed should witness the hanging  but the sheriffs for various reasons sometimes denied passes to individuals who wanted to watch  Missouri executions conducted hui after 1919 were not  public  because they were conducted behind closed walls  and the general public was not permitted to attend  Present day statutes from across the nation use the same words and phrases  requiring modern executions to take place within a wall or enclosure to exclude public view  Connecticut General Statute   54 100 requires death sentences to be conducted in an  enclosure  which  shall be so constructed as to exclude public view   Kentucky Revised Statute 431 220 and Missouri Revised Statute   546 730 contain substantially identical language  New Mexico s former death penalty  since repealed  see N M  Stat    31 14 12  required executions be conducted in a  room or place enclosed from public view   Similarly  a dormant Massachusetts law  see Mass  Gen  Law ch  279   60  required executions to take place  within an enclosure or building   North Carolina General Statute   15 188 requires death sentences to be executed  within the walls  of the penitentiary  as do Oklahoma Statute Title 22   1015 and Montana Code   46 19 103  Ohio Revised Code   2949 22 requires that   t he enclosure shall exclude public view   Similarly  Tennessee Code   40 23 116 requires  an enclosure  for  strict seclusion and privacy   United States Code Title 18   3596 and the Code of Federal Regulations Title 28   26 3 limit the witnesses to be present at Federal executions  Today  there are always witnesses to executions sometimes numerous witnesses  but it is the law  not the number of witnesses present  which determines whether the execution is  public   All of the executions which have taken place since the 1936 hanging of Bethea in Owensboro have been conducted within a wall or enclosure  For example  Fred Adams was legally hanged in Kennett  Missouri  on April 2  1937  within a 10 foot  3 m  wooden stockade  Roscoe  Red  Jackson was hanged within a stockade in Galena  Missouri  on May 26  1937  Two Kentucky hangings were conducted after Galena in which numerous persons were present within a wooden stockade  that of John  Peter  Montjoy in Covington  Kentucky on December 17  1937  and that of Harold Van Venison in Covington on June 3  1938  An estimated 400 witnesses were present for the hanging of Lee Simpson in Ryegate  Montana  on December 30  1939  The execution of Timothy McVeigh on June 11  2001  was witnessed by some 300 people  some by closed circuit television    edit  Clemency and commutations The largest number of clemencies was granted in January 2003 in Illinois  when outgoing Governor George Ryan  who had already imposed a moratorium on executions  pardoned four death row inmates and commuted the sentences of the remaining 167 to life in prison without the possibility of parole  109  When Governor Pat Quinn signed legislation abolishing the death penalty in Illinois in March 2011  he commuted the sentences of the fifteen inmates on death row to life imprisonment  28  Previous post Furman mass clemencies took place in 1986 in New Mexico  when Governor Toney Anaya commuted all death sentences because of his personal opposition to the death penalty  In 1991 outgoing Ohio Governor Dick Celeste commuted the sentences of eight prisoners  among them all four women on the state s death row  And during his two terms  1979 1987  as Florida Governor  Bob Graham  although a strong death penalty supporter who had overseen the first post Furman involuntary execution as well as 15 others  agreed to commute the sentences of six people on grounds of  possible innocence  or  disproportionality    edit  Suicide on death row and volunteering for execution The suicide rate of death row inmates was found by Lester and Tartaro to be 113 per 100 000 for the period 1976 1999  This is about ten times the rate of suicide in the United States as a whole and about six times the rate of suicide in the general U S  prison population  110  According to deathpenaltyinfo org  November 22  2011   since the reinstitution of the death penalty  137 prisoners have waived their appeals and asked that the execution be carried out  Four states  Connecticut  Oregon  Pennsylvania  and South Dakota  have executed only volunteers so far   edit  Exonerations from the death row and innocent executed According to deathpenaltyinfo org  since the reinstitution of the death penalty  141 innocent prisoners have been exonerated from the death row   No  141  Richard Miles from Dallas Texas  was exonerated on February 22  2012   It is unknown how many of the people executed since 1976 may have been innocent  but some of them were executed although there was considerable doubt about their guilt  e g  Cameron Willingham  2004  and Troy Davis  2011    edit  Current moratoria and de facto moratoria Since the reinstatement of the death penalty  Kansas and New Hampshire have performed no executions  and four states have executed only  volunteers   Pennsylvania has executed three men  Oregon  two  Connecticut and South Dakota have executed one man  respectively  Therefore  these six states can be regarded as having de facto moratoria  However  in 2010  bills to abolish the death penalty in Kansas and in South Dakota were rejected  In Connecticut  then Governor Jodi Rell vetoed a death abolition bill in 2009  and in 2011  two Democratic senators withdrew their support for a new bill  so the session ended without passage  Idaho ended its de facto moratorium  during which only one volunteer had been executed  on November 18  2011 by executing Paul Ezra Rhoades  Of the 12 prisoners whom Nevada has executed since 1976  11 wanted to die  Kentucky and Montana have executed two prisoners against their will  KY  1997 and 1999  MT  1995 and 1998  and one volunteer  respectively  KY  2008  MT  2006   Colorado  in 1997  and Wyoming  in 1992  have executed only one prisoner  respectively  Democratic Governor Parris N  Glendening halted executions in the state of Maryland by executive order on May 9  2002  but the subsequent Republican governor  Robert Ehrlich  resumed executions in 2004  However  on December 19  2006  the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that state executions would be suspended until the manual that spells out the protocol for lethal injections is reviewed by a legislative panel  The state s Department of Corrections had adopted the manual without having a public hearing or submitting it before a committee  Legislative review of the protocol is required before approval under state law  In North Carolina  a de facto moratorium is in place following a decision by the state s medical board that physicians cannot participate in executions  which is a requirement under state and federal law  In California  U S  District Judge Jeremy Fogel imposed a moratorium on the death penalty in the state of California on December 15  2006  ruling that the implementation used in California was unconstitutional but that it could be fixed  111  In Nebraska  the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled  on February 8  2008  that the use of the electric chair is unconstitutional specifically  that its use conflicts with the Nebraska Constitution  As electrocution was the sole legally authorized method of execution in Nebraska  the state had what technically amounts to no legally authorized death penalty  112  until the introduction of lethal injection in that state in May 2009  113  After the U S  Supreme Court agreed to hear the case Baze v  Rees many states had slowed or halted executions as lawyers for death row prisoners argued that states should not carry out death sentences using a method that may be ruled unconstitutional  While executions had come to an apparent stop until Baze was examined by the court  this was not the intent  according to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia  who stated on October 16  2007 that stopping all executions by that method was not the high court s intention when it agreed to hear Baze  Just because the justices agreed to take on the case  Scalia said  does not necessarily mean that a moratorium should ensue  114  On November 25  2009  the Kentucky Supreme Court placed a moratorium on executions until it adopts regulations for carrying out the penalty by lethal injection  115  In November 2011  Oregon governor John Kitzhaber announced a moratorium on executions in Oregon  canceling a planned execution and ordering a review of the death penalty system in the state  116   edit  See also
