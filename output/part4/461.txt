and the Lucayan term  caya hico   meaning string of islands  The first inhabitants of the islands were Arawakan speaking Ta no people who crossed over from Hispaniola sometime from 500 to 800  Together with Tainos who crossed over from Cuba to the southern Bahamas around the same time  these people became the Lucayans  Around 1200 the Turks and Caicos Islands were resettled by Classical Ta nos from Hispaniola  Soon after they arrived in the islands in 1492  the Spanish began capturing the Ta nos of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Lucayans as slaves to replace the largely depleted native population of Hispaniola  The southern Bahama Islands  including the Turks and Caicos Islands  were completely depopulated by about 1513  and remained so until the 17th century  7  8  9  10  11  The first documented European to sight the islands was Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de Le n  who did so in 1512  During the 16th  17th and 18th centuries  the islands passed from Spanish  to French  to British control  but none of the three powers ever established any settlements  For several decades around the turn of the 18th century they became popular pirate hideouts  Bermudian salt collectors settled the Turk Islands around 1680  In 1765 1783 they were under French occupation and again after the French captured the archipelago in 1783  After the American Revolution  1775 1783  many loyalists fled to Caribbean colonies  including  in 1783  the first settlers on the Caicos Islands  cotton became an important crop briefly  In 1799  both the Turks and the Caicos island groups were annexed by Britain as part of the Bahamas  citation needed  The 1852 lighthouse on Grand Turk In 1841 the Trouvadore  a Spanish ship engaged in the slave trade  was wrecked off the coast of East Caicos  one of the larger Caicos Islands  One hundred and ninety two captive Africans survived the sinking and made it to shore where  under British rule  the slave trade was illegal  These survivors were apprenticed to trades for one year then settled mostly on Grand Turk Island  An 1878 letter documents the  Trouvadore Africans  and their descendants as constituting an essential part of the  labouring population  on the islands  In 2004 marine archaeologists rediscovered a wreck  called the  Black Rock Ship   that subsequent research has suggested may be that of the Trouvadore  This suggestion was further supported when a marine archaeology expedition funded by NOAA in November 2008 confirmed that the wreck comprises artifacts of which the style and date of manufacture support the association of this wreck with that of the Trouvadore  The wreckage has  however  not been identified with absolute certainty  12  In 1848  the Turks and Caicos were declared a separate colony under a council president  The last incumbent was maintained in 1873 when the islands were made part of Jamaica colony  in 1894 the chief colonial official was restyled commissioner  In 1917  Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden suggested that the Turks and Caicos join Canada  but this suggestion was rejected by British Prime Minister David Lloyd George  The islands remained a dependency of Jamaica until 1959  citation needed  On 4 July 1959  the islands were again a separate colony  the last commissioner being restyled administrator  but the governor of Jamaica remained the governor of the islands  Until 31 May 1962  they were one of the constitutive parts of the Federation of the West Indies  citation needed  When Jamaica was granted independence from Britain in August 1962  the Turks  amp  Caicos Islands became a Crown colony  From 1965  the governor of the Bahamas was also governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands and oversaw affairs for the islands  When the Bahamas gained independence in 1973  the Turks and Caicos received their own governor  the last administrator was restyled   In 1974  Canadian New Democratic Party MP Max Saltsman tried to use his Private Member s Bill to create legislation to annex the islands to Canada  but it did not pass in the Canadian House of Commons  13  The islands have had their own government headed by a chief minister  the first of whom was James Alexander George Smith McCartney  since August 1976  In 1979  a move towards independence was agreed upon in principle for 1982  but a change in government caused a policy reversal  citation needed  and they instead approached the Canadian government to discuss a possible union  but at the time the Canadian Government was embroiled in a debate over free trade with the U S   and little attention was paid to the suggestion  citation needed  In 2004 the Canadian province of Nova Scotia gave an invitation to join but Canada s government said they would look at the matter later  citation needed  The islands  political troubles in recent years have resulted in a rewritten constitution promulgated in 2006 and a reintroduction of direct UK Government rule in 2009  citation

politically a separate entity  The Caicos Islands are separated by the Caicos Passage from the closest Bahamian islands  Mayaguana and Great Inagua  The eight main islands and more than 299 smaller islands have a total land area of 616 3 square kilometres  238 0 sq mi   5  primarily of low  flat limestone with extensive marshes and mangrove swamps and 332 square kilometres  128 sq mi  of beach

primary natural resources are spiny lobster  conch and other shellfish  The two distinct island groups are separated by the Turks Passage   edit  Turks Islands The Turks Islands are separated from the Caicos Islands by Turks Island Passage  which is more than 2 200 m 7 200 ft deep   14  The islands form a chain that stretches north south  The estimated population is 5 753 on the two main islands

Together with nearby islands  all on Turks Bank  those two main islands form the two of the six administrative districts of the territory that fall within the Turks Islands  Turks Bank  which is smaller than Caicos Bank  has a total area of about 324 km2  125 sq mi   16   edit  Mouchoir Bank 25 kilometres  16 mi  east of the Turks Islands and separated from them by Mouchoir Passage is the Mouchoir Bank  Although it has no emergent cays or islets  some parts are very shallow and the water breaks on them  Mouchoir Bank is part of the Turks and Caicos Islands and falls within its Exclusive Economic Zone  It measures 960 square kilometres  370 sq mi  in area  17  Two banks further east  Silver Bank and Navidad Bank  are geographically a continuation  but belong politically to the Dominican Republic   edit  Administrative divisions Main article  Districts of the Turks and Caicos Islands The Turks and Caicos Islands are divided into six administrative districts  two in the

Town  the capital of the Turks and Caicos Islands Main article  Politics of the Turks and Caicos Islands The Turks and Caicos Islands are a British Overseas Territory  a possession of the United Kingdom currently ruled directly by a British appointed governor  Its autonomous system of government was suspended in August 2009  The United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization includes the territory on the United Nations list of Non Self Governing Territories  With the election of the territory s first Chief Minister  J A G S  McCartney  the islands adopted a constitution on 30 August 1976  which is Constitution Day  the national holiday  The constitution was suspended in 1986  but restored and revised 5 March 1988  A new constitution came into force on 9 August 2006  but was in parts suspended and amended in 2009  The territory s legal system is based on English common law  with a small number of laws adopted from Jamaica and the Bahamas  Suffrage is universal for those over 18 years of age  English is the official language  Grand Turk is the administrative and political capital of the Turks and Caicos Islands and Cockburn Town has been the seat of government since 1766  As a British territory  Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom is the sovereign  represented by a governor appointed by the monarch  on the advice of the Foreign Office  Under the suspended constitution  the head of government was the premier  appointed by the governor  The cabinet consisted of three ex officio members and five appointed by the governor from among the members of the House of Assembly  The unicameral House of Assembly consisted of 21 seats  of which 15 are popularly elected  members serve four year terms  Elections in the Turks and Caicos Islands were held on 24 April 2003 and again on 9 February 2007  The Progressive National Party  led by Galmo Williams  held thirteen seats  and the People s Democratic Movement  led by Floyd Seymour  held two seats  The judicial branch of government is headed by a Supreme Court and appeals are heard by the court of appeals and final appeals by the United Kingdom s Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was Gordon Ward  The islands also have a Court of Appeal with a President and at least two Justices of Appeal  The Turks and Caicos Islands participates in the Caribbean Development Bank  is an associate in CARICOM  and maintains an Interpol sub bureau  Defence is the responsibility of the United Kingdom  In December 2004  the islands sought to become a new associate member to the Association of Caribbean States citation needed    edit  Moves toward independence The winning party of Turks and Caicos  first general election in 1976  the People s Democratic Movement  PDM  under  Jags  McCartney  sought to establish a framework and accompanying infrastructure in the pursuit of an eventual policy of full independence for the islands  However  with the early death of McCartney  confidence in the country s leadership waned  In 1980  the PDM agreed with the British government that independence would be granted in 1982 if the PDM was reelected in the elections of that year  That election was effectively a referendum on the independence issue and was won by the pro dependency Progressive National Party  PNP   which claimed victory again four years later  With these developments  the independence issue largely faded from the political scene  However  in the mid 2000s  the issue of independence for the islands was again raised  In April 2006  PNP Premier Michael Misick reaffirmed that his party saw independence from Britain as the  ultimate goal  for the islands  but not at the present time  19  In 2008  opponents of Misick accused him of moving toward independence for the islands in order to dodge a commission of inquiry  which examined reports of corruption by the Misick Administration  20   edit  Proposed union with Canada See also  Proposed provinces and territories of Canada In 1917  Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden suggested Canada annex the Turks and Caicos  A great number of tourists who visit the Turks and Caicos Islands are Canadian  Owing to this  the islands  status as a British colony  and historic trade links  some politicians in Canada and the Turks and Caicos have suggested some form of union between Canada and the British territory  In 1917  the Prime Minister of Canada  Robert Borden first suggested that Canada annex the Turks and Caicos Islands  In 1974  Canadian New Democratic Party Member of Parliament Max Saltsman introduced a failed attempt at consolidating the islands  The idea was brought up again in 1986 by Progressive Conservative MP Dan McKenzie  but it was rejected by his party s caucus committee on external affairs in 1987  The committee  chaired by MP David Daubney  looked at immigration  banking  health care and tourism issues in making its decision  citation needed  For the islands to join Canada as a full province would require an amendment to the Canadian constitution ratified by seven provincial legislatures representing at least half of the national population  Because such a step could entice provinces to demand other changes to the constitution in exchange for such support  this is seen to be a politically unfeasible option  Note that less sweeping changes to the Constitution do not require unanimous consent  The last new province  Newfoundland  was brought into the country in 1949 by an act of the British Parliament  Joining as a territory would be easier  as territories can be created by an act of Parliament  In addition  a population of about 30 000 people is considered insufficient for provincial status   the smallest province  Prince Edward Island  has about 130 000 people  However  this attitude might change should the territories of Yukon  the Northwest Territories or Nunavut  with about 30 000 people each  ever become provinces  In 2004  Conservative MP Peter Goldring visited Turks and Caicos to explore the possibility once more  He drafted a motion asking the Canadian Government to look into the issue  but his party declined  citing immigration  tourism  and economic issues  citation needed  However  the Canadian government does not dismiss the possibility of a future union  21  unreliable source   The province of Nova Scotia voted to invite Turks and Caicos to join the province in 2004  should the islands ever become part of Canada  This would bypass the problems with admitting Turks and Caicos as a separate province  22  On March 2  2009  the Ottawa Citizen ran an article on its online site reporting the interest of the Canadian government to open a deep water port in the Caribbean that would open up  a new market for Canadian goods     in the Caribbean and nearby Central and South America   23   Suppose the port  unaffordable for Caribbean countries  boosted their standard of living and bolstered hemispheric security  Suppose the port doubled as a Canadian military operations base for countries wanting help to patrol their waters and to interdict the Caribbean s robust trade in smuggled arms  drugs and people   23  In the Turks and Caicos Islands  support for integration into Canada as an  11th province  was at 90  in the 1990s  while in 2003 support for integration stood at around 60   Goldring  a Conservative MP from Edmonton  has championed the cause of integrating the Turks and Caicos Islands as a Canadian territory for security benefits as well as increasing Canada s influence in Central and Southern America in regards to anti terrorism  trade and combating encroaching Chinese influence in several small Caribbean islands  such as St  Lucia  23  It was announced by the Governor that in March 2011 the two most senior police roles  namely the Commissioner of Police and the Deputy Commissioner of Police will be held by Canadians for a period of two years to assist the jurisdiction with crime prevention and crime solving  24  This is a proactive measure designed to quell the rising tide of crime in the islands   edit  Corruption scandal and suspension of self government  edit  Background In 2008  after members of the British parliament conducting a routine review of the administration received several reports of high level official corruption in the Turks and Caicos  25  then Governor Richard Tauwhare announced the appointment of a Commission of Enquiry into corruption  26  The same year  Premier Michael Misick himself became the focus of a criminal investigation after a woman identified by news outlets as an American citizen residing in Puerto Rico accused him of sexually assaulting her  27  although he strongly denies the charge  28  On Monday  16 March 2009  the UK threatened to suspend self government in the islands and transfer power to the new governor  Gordon Wetherell  over systemic corruption  29  On 18 March 2009  on the advice of her UK ministers  Queen Elizabeth II issued an Order in Council giving the Governor the power to suspend those parts of the 2006 Constitution which deal with ministerial government and the House of Assembly  and to exercise the powers of government himself  The order  which would also establish an Advisory Council and Consultative Forum in place of the House of Assembly  would come into force on a date to be announced by the governor  and remain in force for two years unless extended or revoked  30  On 23 March 2009  after the enquiry found evidence of  high probability of systemic corruption or other serious dishonesty   Misick resigned as Premier to make way for a new  unified government  31  Politicians were accused of selling crown land for personal gain and misusing public funds  32  The following day  Galmo Williams was sworn in as his replacement  31  33  Misick denied all charges  and referred to the British government s debate on whether to remove the territory s sovereignty as  tantamount to being re colonised  It is a backwards step completely contrary to the whole movement of history   32   edit  Suspension and reactions On 14 August 2009 after Misick s last appeals failed  the Governor  on the instructions of the UK Foreign Office  imposed direct rule on the Turks and Caicos Islands by authority of the 18 March 2009 Order in Council issued by the Queen  The islands  administration has been suspended for up to two years and power has been transferred to the Governor  with the United Kingdom also stationing a supply vessel in between Turks and Caicos  Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Chris Bryant said of the decision to impose rule   This is a serious constitutional step which the UK Government has not taken lightly but these measures are essential in order to restore good governance and sound financial management   34  The move was met with vehement opposition by the former Turks and Caicos government  with Misick s successor Williams calling it a  coup   and stating that   Our country is being invaded and re colonised by the United Kingdom  dismantling a duly elected government and legislature and replacing it with a one man dictatorship  akin to that of the old Red China  all in the name of good governance   34  Despite this  the civilian populace was reported to be largely welcoming of the enforced rule  34  The British government stated that they intended to keep true to their word that the country would regain sovereignty in two years or less  and Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant said that elections would be held in 2011   or sooner   35  Governor Wetherell stated that he would aim to  make a clean break from the mistakes of the past  and create  a durable path towards good governance  sound financial management and sustainable development   Wetherell continued to say that   In the meantime we must all learn to foster a quality of public spirit  listen to all those who have the long term interests of these islands at heart  and safeguard the fundamental assets of the Territory for future generations    Our guiding principles will be those of transparency  accountability and responsibility  I believe that most people in the Turks and Caicos will welcome these changes   34   edit  Population  edit  Demographics Eight of the thirty islands in the territory are inhabited  with a total population in mid 2006 of about 32 000  One third of the population is under 15 years old  and only 4  are 65 or older  In 2000 the population was growing at a rate of 3 55  per year

CIA World Factbook describes the islander s ethnicity as  90  Black   with the remainder Mixed  European or North American ancestry  The people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are called  Turks and Caicos Islanders    edit  Language The official language of the islands is English and the population also speaks Turks and Caicos Islands Creole 36  which is similar to Bahamian Creole  37  Due to its close proximity to Cuba and Hispaniola  large Haitian Creole and Spanish speaking communities have developed in the territory due to immigration  both legal and illegal  from Creole speaking Haiti and from Spanish speaking Cuba and Dominican Republic  38   edit  Religion Main article  Religion in the Turks and Caicos Islands The population of Turks and Caicos  as of 2001  were 35 8  Baptists

Turks and Caicos cuisine is based primarily around seafood  especially conch  Two common dishes  whilst not traditionally  local   are conch fritters and conch salad  40   edit  Citizenship Because the Turks and Caicos is a British Overseas Territory and not an independent country  they cannot confer citizenship  Instead  people with close ties to Britain s Overseas Territories  all hold the same nationality  British Overseas Territories Citizen  BOTC  as defined by the British Nationality Act 1981 and subsequent amendments  BOTC  however  does not confer any right to live in any British Overseas Territory  including the territory from which it is derived  Instead  the rights normally associated with citizenship derive from what is called Belonger status and island natives or descendants from natives are said to be Belongers  In 2002  the British Overseas Territories Act restored full British citizenship status to all inhabitants of British Overseas Territories  including the Turks and Caicos   edit  Education system Education is free and mandatory for children aged five to sixteen  Primary education lasts for six years and secondary education lasts for five years  In the 1990s  the island nation launched the Primary In Service Teacher Education Project  PINSTEP  in an effort to increase the skills of its primary school teachers  nearly one quarter of whom were unqualified  Turks and Caicos also worked to refurbish its primary schools  reduce textbook costs  and increase equipment and supplies given to schools  For example  in September 1993  each primary school was given enough books to allow teachers to establish in class libraries  citation needed  In 2001  the student teacher ratio at the primary level was roughly 15 1  citation needed  The Turks

with some  169 2 million of lobster  dried and fresh conch  and conch shells exported in 2000  primarily to the United Kingdom and the United States  In recent years  however  the catch has been declining  The territory used to be an important trans shipment point for South American narcotics destined for the United States  but due to the ongoing pressure of a combined American  Bahamian and Turks and Caicos effort this trade has been greatly reduced  The islands import food and beverages  tobacco  clothing  manufacture and construction materials  primarily from the United States and the United Kingdom  Imports totalled  581 million in 2007  The islands produce and consume about 5 GWh of electricity  per year  all of which comes from fossil fuels   edit  Tourism The United States was
