Publication history Created by writer Chris Claremont  Elizabeth  Betsy  Braddock first appeared in Captain Britain  8  Dec  1976   published by the Marvel Comics imprint Marvel UK  The original spelling of the character s name was  Elizabeth   though relettering of the UK versions for US reprints would occasionally misspell it as  Elisabeth   2  This led to spelling inconsistencies throughout future publications  The inconsistency was resolved by Claremont thirty two years later in 2008 in the series New Exiles  which reasserted the particular spelling of her name as  Elizabeth   2  In the Captain Britain series  Chris Claremont introduced her as a supporting character  the sister of Brian Braddock  the eponymous Captain Britain  and established her career as a charter pilot  He also established that she had psychic abilities  the full extent of which were unknown  though no explanation is given for these powers  In Marvel UK s Super Spider Man and Captain Britain  243  Oct  1977   Betsy Braddock is presented as a professional model  In Marvel UK s Daredevils  3  March 1983   Alan Moore establishes that the character has begun to work for the fictional governmental organization S T R I K E   who are making use of her psychic abilities  Her lover Tom Lennox is also a S T R I K E operative  who is later murdered  The story also presents the character as having dyed her hair purple  this hair color has subsequently become the dominant presentation of the character  3  The next major change for the character came in the 1986 relaunched Captain Britain series  where Betsy Braddock stood in for her brother as Captain Britain  and was rendered blind by the supervillain Slaymaster  4  In New Mutants Annual  2  1986   Claremont integrated Braddock into the X Men franchise  The story sees her abducted to the Mojoverse  where she is subjected to brainwashing  fitted with bionic eyes  and referred to as  the Psylocke  for the first time  5  After being rescued by the New Mutants  she takes up residence at their mutant training academy  run by Magneto at the time in absence of Professor Charles Xavier  After aiding the team unofficially  Braddock proved herself by single handedly facing the murderous supervillain Sabretooth  and also by using her telepathy to glean vital information from his mind during the events of the  Mutant Massacre   Afterward  Braddock is formally invited to join the X Men and officially adopts the codename  Psylocke   3  Initially written as a pure telepath with few fighting skills  3  Psylocke later adopts body armor  6  This changes in Uncanny X Men  250 251  1989   where the X Men flee from the cybernetic terrorists  the Reavers  through the Siege Perilous  an extradimensional teleportation device  In the next story arc  Braddock has fallen prey to the Japanese terrorists the Hand  who brainwash and physically alter her  Braddock now believes herself to be  Lady Mandarin   the Hand s supreme assassin  This physical manipulation involves the modification of Braddock s physical features  modifying them from the previously established depiction of European to Japanese  After she is rescued by the X Men s Wolverine and overcomes her brainwashing  the character retains the combat skills granted through the Hand s modification techniques 7  as well as the ability to manifest her total focused telepathy in the form of a  psychic knife   With the launch of X Men  vol  2  the team splits  with Psylocke joining the team led by Cyclops  In Jim Lee written issues  the character becomes flirtatious with Cyclops  eventually attempting to seduce him  8  At this point  Kwannon  a new character with the physical appearance of Braddock prior to the Hand s manipulation  claims to be the original Psylocke  accusing the Japanese featured Braddock of being an impostor  After Jim Lee and six other creators left Marvel Comics to found Image Comics  new scriptwriter Fabian Nicieza established that Kwannon is the impostor and that Braddock s flirtations with Cyclops were part of a genetic and mental splicing in which the Kwannon impostor was first created  9  In 1994  writer Scott Lobdell set up a relationship between Braddock and her teammate Archangel  10  The character is severely injured by a crazed Sabretooth in the Lobdell written Uncanny X Men  328  Her life is saved by the use of a mystic artifact known as the Crimson Dawn  the aftereffects of which granted Psylocke the ability to teleport in and out of shadows  Lobdell also temporarily took her out of the X Men roster this issue  11  Braddock returns to the team in X Men  vol  2  77 78  where she uses her Crimson Dawn enhanced telepathy to trap the Shadow King in the astral plane  Any use of her telepathy would result in his release  so she forgoes the use of her telepathic ability  12  Some time later she would develop telekinesis for the first time instead  13  Psylocke s relationship with Archangel ends in the Claremont written X Men  vol  2  109  where the character embarks upon a relationship with new Indian X Men recruit Neal Shaara  In the Claremont written X Treme X Men  2  2001   the character dies  her comic book death lasting until 2005 s Uncanny X Men  455  Claremont also wrote this issue  later stating he had always intended to revive her  14  15  Briefly  the character was depicted in Exiles  a spin off comic book series in the X Men franchise  set in an alternate universe  With the cancellation of New Exiles  Psylocke starred in her first solo book  the X Men  Sword of The Braddocks one shot  16  17  18  Afterwards  the character was brought back to the main Marvel universe in early 2009 within the pages of Uncanny X Men  19  Psylocke was featured in a self titled four issue miniseries beginning in November 2009  written by Christopher Yost and with art by Harvey Tolibao  Matsu o Tsurayaba and Wolverine are central characters in the story  20   edit

reality warp  an evil version of Captain Britain from another universe named Kaptain Briton switched places with Brian  The double tried to rape Betsy  In self defense  she telepathically killed him  27  The same night  the twins were informed of their father s Otherworld origins  and a new intelligence agency called R C X  asked them to billet Warpies  children transformed by Jasper s warp  at

him away from the injured until the X Men arrived to help her  While Sabretooth and Wolverine fought  Psylocke used her telepathy to gather information about the Marauders and their leader  Mr  Sinister  from Sabretooth s mind  32  Wolverine  though initially reluctant to involve outsiders in the X Men s affairs  was impressed by her bravery and nominated her to join the team  As an X Man she met Mephisto  33  Dr  Doom and the Fantastic Four  34  and the Horde  35  The X Men later battled Freedom Force and the Adversary in Dallas  and  in a televised battle  sacrificed themselves to

telepathy could restore Kwannon  and Matsu o accepted  Unknown to Matsu o  however  Spiral actually placed the two women s minds into each other s bodies  She also merged their genetic structures  leaving both women with physical and mental traits of the other  and with each possessing half of Psylocke s telepathic power  47  48  With some physical and mental conditioning  Psylocke inhabiting Kwannon s body became the Hand s prime assassin  taking the name Lady Mandarin  She gained highly remarkable fighting skills and learned to focus her telepathic power into a  psychic knife   Lady Mandarin s first mission pitted her against Wolverine  Betsy s psychic knife attack revealed Wolverine s memories of who she used to be and allowed her to break free from the Hand s conditioning  49

X Men s leader  Storm  by Cameron Hodge  Following Hodge s defeat  the X Men reunited and returned to New York  50  51  Psylocke then joined the Blue Team led by Cyclops  for whom she displayed an

magical liquid from the Crimson Dawn dimension that healed her and gave her the new ability to teleport through shadows  but also marked her with a red tattoo over her left eye  63  Her personality took on a cold edge  which created distance between her and Warren  64  Kuragari  Proctor of the Crimson Dawn  tried to claim Betsy as his bride  but was thwarted with Gomurr and Angel s aid  freeing Betsy of the Dawn s influence  however Psylocke still retained the abilities associated with it  Soon after these events  the couple retired from active duty with the X Men  65  Subsequently she aided Storm against the Shadow King  who tricked Psylocke into initiating a psychic shockwave that disabled all other telepaths  leaving him unchallenged on the astral plane  66  Her own astral form was destroyed  but her exposure to the Crimson Dawn gave her a new shadow form with temporarily enhanced powers  which she used to trap the Shadow King s core  To keep him trapped she was forced to constantly focus her telepathy on him  effectively rendering herself powerless  67   edit  Revolution and X Treme Jean Grey s attempt to help Betsy deal with the Shadow King somehow swapped their

Foursaken  about to make their move  Jamie revealed his part in Betsy s resurrection to the X Men  sensing the approaching threat of the cosmically powerful First Fallen and learning of Betsy s demise  an annoyed Jamie resurrected her  reaching back through time to stop her spirit passing into the afterlife  Intending her to be a weapon to use against the First Fallen  Jamie tightened up the  quantum strings  of Betsy s body  rendering her mostly immune to external manipulation  enhancing her telekinetic powers  and leaving her invisible to the First Fallen s senses  85  Jamie was abducted by the Foursaken before he could fully inform them of the imminent threat  trying to rescue him  the X Men were easily captured  except Betsy  who found herself invisible to the Foursaken s senses  86

himself  87  Returning to the UK to tell Brian of Jamie s fate  Betsy learned that Shadow Xavier  leader of the Shadow X Men  had taken over the minds of his jailors in Crossmore Prison  and was

father  Professor Sir James Braddock  is still alive in the Ultimate universe  and oversees the EDI s super soldier program  She is a telepath and  judging by her own assertion  the most powerful in England  The  psychoblast  power she possessed in her British form in the Earth 616 universe was manifested as a  psychic grenade  that she  detonated  in the minds of others  Agents Betsy Braddock and Dai Thomas  were assigned to aid Xavier in his search for his son  David  a powerful mutant who could physically possess the bodies of others and manipulate reality  During the investigation  however  Agent Thomas was killed and Betsy s body was possessed by David  who set about wreaking havoc and killing innocent humans while in her body  She eventually managed to resist his control

survived  however  somehow moving into the comatose body of a Japanese girl called Kwannon  Kwannon was glad to be able to move on to the afterlife  and willingly gave Betsy her body  Betsy regarded her near death experience as intensely fascinating  The change has also led her to bear a less formal look  as she was seen after her body switch with a number of cosmetic piercings  She somehow retained her telepathic powers in Kwannon s body and even gained the new ability to create a blade that can cut through most materials  even a Sentinel  She was said to be aiding in the formation of S T R I K E   the British division of S H I E L D  123  Recently  though  she was revealed to have been working undercover for Charles Xavier as a spy investigating the activities of Fenris  124  Betsy officially joined the X Men as Psylocke  Her employment with S T R I K E  had ended because the body she currently inhabits is that of a minor  making her too young to serve as a government agent  She was recruited by Bishop into his new X Men after angrily informing Cyclops that he had turned his back on the X Men and the good they can achieve after he refused to help a group of mutants being attacked by Sentinels solely because he thought it would make the Xavier Institute look bad  125  Bishop later referred to Psylocke as his wife  when the Fenris twins threatened to kill her  Psylocke confronted Bishop about his comments about their future marriage  and from what he says  it is implied that Psylocke was killed before Bishop traveled back in time  126  Eventually  Bishop is stabbed and killed by Wolverine  127  Xavier returns from the future revealing himself to be alive and Psylocke begins living at the Xavier Institute as a student  She is seen again after the Ultimatum wave hits New York  While the main X Men go after Magneto  she stays at the Institute  128  When Reverend William Stryker attacks the school planning to kill every student  Psylocke uses Cerebro to send a telepathic message to any mutant that can help save them  Ultimately  she survives the school massacre alongside Rogue  Toad  and Firestar  129  though  for some reason  she and Toad are listed among the deceased in the final issue of Ultimatum  130   edit  Age of X Psylocke is depicted as a member of the Force Warriors  a select group of telekinetics who rebuild the telekinetic shields that protect Fortress X on a daily basis  She is also still in her original body  having never switched with Kwannon  Prior to the mutant human conflict she lived a privileged life among the upper class of British society  similar to her Earth 616 counterpart  She is in a relationship with the Age of X version of Iceman  131   edit  Powers and abilities  edit  As Psylocke In her earliest appearances in Uncanny X Men  Psylocke possessed the power of telepathy  she could read and project thoughts over long distances  132  control minds  subdue and tap into other s powers  affect people s memories  133  project mental illusions  134  and generate psi bolts that could stun  135  injure  136  or kill others  137  She could also project her astral self  and the astral bodies of other people  into the astral plane  138  She could scan entire towns with her mind  139  and leaf through the psyches of the inhabitants of a city to learn of their condition 140  or intentions  141  She was powerful enough to telepathically  shout  to her teammates in Australia while she was in Washington D C  without the aid of any type of power enhancing apparati such as Cerebro  142  She could also probe individuals to check up on their status  143  When using her telepathic powers  a butterfly shaped energy aura would appear around her face  It was never truly made clear in the comic books by the writers whether this was something that could be perceived by others or if this was simply an  effect  to show when Psylocke was using her powers to the reading audience  although it was implied that it could be   32  This  butterfly   sometimes depicted as having eyes in its wings  was also the form Psylocke usually took when manifesting her astral form  both on the astral plane  136  and in the physical world  135  although she occasionally used an illusory image of her physical body  138  After her transformation  Psylocke s psi form changed to reflect her new Japanese appearance  144  145  In addition  Psylocke could also use her telepathy to project a focused beam of directed psionic energy called a  psycho blast  that could incapacitate or kill a living being instantly  This attack was powerful enough to pierce the Juggernaut s psi proof helmet  The psycho blast was able to affect inorganic material as well as living targets  when directing a psycho blast at Sabretooth the energy destroyed the metal Cerebro helmet she was wearing   32  Psylocke also possessed limited precognitive powers that occasionally allowed her to envision probable future events  146  or to see quick flashes of the immediate future  147  These visions were random and infrequent  however  and she had no control over them  While in her original body  Psylocke was given bionic eyes by Mojo and Spiral which instantly adjusted to any intensity of light  preventing her from being blinded by brightness  134  The bionic eyes were also cameras  transmitting to Mojo everything that Psylocke saw  148  For a time  Betsy took the role of Captain Britain from her brother  using the deceased Kaptain Briton s costume which had been modified by the Mastermind computer  This costume gave her superhuman strength and the ability to fly  149   edit  Body After her physical transformation into a Japanese ninja assassin she gained highly developed fighting skills in addition to her telepathy  which at this stage was not as powerful as it had originally been before her transformation  as half of her psionic potential still resided with Revanche in her original body  9  150  After Revanche s death  Psylocke s telepathy was restored to its previous strength  The most common usage of her powers was the manifestation of a  psychic knife   which operated in the same manner as her  psycho blast  ability  but at close range  Described as the focused totality of her psychic powers  she often used it to disrupt the minds and nervous systems of her foes by driving the glowing  blade  of psionic energy into their heads  151  At least once  she utilized two psychic knives simultaneously  152  During this time she chose to fight up close most of the time  using her new martial arts skills  although she could still utilize distanced telepathic assaults  153  At least once  she experienced a precognitive flash while in her new body  147  After her exposure to the Crimson Dawn  she also gained the ability to teleport herself and others using areas of shadow as gateways  64  The teleportation could cover huge distances  on one occasion she transported the X Men from America to Africa in a few seconds  12  She could also teleport through the shadows of other dimensions  154  Psylocke has not been seen using this ability since her imprisonment of the Shadow King in the astral plane  12  during a mission against Stryfe  she mentioned to Nightcrawler that she no longer possessed this ability  75   edit  Telekinetic powers To keep the Shadow King imprisoned in the Astral Plane  Psylocke sacrificed the use of her telepathy  but at some point gained Phoenix s telekinesis instead  155  At first  due to the relative newness of her telekinesis  she could not exercise fine control over her powers  e g  she could blast an enemy through a brick wall  but could not levitate small objects  like a dime  from the floor  72  As time progressed  Psylocke grew more proficient at using her powers  e g  she could use her telekinesis to reshape a pistol into smaller metal projectiles  86  Instead of her psychic knife  Psylocke began to manifest a telekinetic katana composed of raw psionic energy  156  At its lowest intensity her katana functions much like her psychic knife once did  short circuiting the victim s nervous system on impact  86  At its highest level  the katana can slice through almost any physical matter  14  Psylocke s control over the katana is such that she can slice an armored opponent and cut through the armor  but only leave her opponent stunned or unconscious  157  Psylocke s telekinetic manifestations produce visible radiance in the physical world  14  and so she can use her psychic katana as a makeshift light source in areas of darkness  The katana can also affect beings that are more powerful than Psylocke herself  85  87  158  She can also use her sword to shatter telepathic power inhibitors imposed on others  despite her own lack of telepathy  159  With no telepathy to guide her when performing this task  she must rely on her instincts to give the blade the sufficient strength necessary to break the inhibitors  without doing permanent damage to the subject in question  During the timeline shift known as House of M  Psylocke showed the ability to summon two telekinetic katanas at the same time  160  It is unknown if she is capable of this under normal circumstances  Aside from the blade  Psylocke can use her telekinesis to enhance her speed  strength  and fighting skills to superhuman levels  161  She can also levitate herself and others  14  or manipulate matter in standard telekinetic fashion  74  She can also create telekinetic shields of various sizes and strength  162  and her telekinesis has been said to be strong enough to shatter mountains  120  After her resurrection  Psylocke s telekinetic powers have been greatly enhanced  163  At the time of Betsy s resurrection  Marvel Girl claimed that Psylocke s telekinesis was on a level even she could not match  15  After her resurrection  Psylocke was shown to be immune to all forms of psionic manipulations such as mind reading  15  mind control or mental attacks  164  and attempts of telepathic communication  165  This is a result of her brother Jamie s manipulation of the quantum strings that comprise her body  85  She is also immune or at least highly resistant to other psionic based powers like the Savage Land Mutate Vertigo s disorientation power  159  or Nocturne s mind possessing abilities  120  Due to Jamie s alterations  Psylocke is also immune to any physical and mental alteration by beings who can radically restructure reality  such as Proteus  She can  however  still be killed in more traditional manners  such as being stabbed or shot  She is also at least partially resistant to magical manipulation  166  Somehow these various immunities also affect her detectability from higher order technological equipment  For example all sensor arrays of the Exiles Crystal Palace are not able to detect her as if she does not even exist  167  Beside this immunity she is able to use her telekinesis to modify her own molecular structure to render herself invisible to at least the naked eye  168  However  Psylocke s telekinetic powers seems to evolve with the return of her telepathy since her encounter with the Sisterhood as  at first  she has rarely been seen using her telekinesis to levitate objects or create her trademark telekinetic katana  It appears also  that she is focusing more on developing her returned telepathic powers and that the various immunities that were granted to her by her resurrection at the hands of her brother seem to have vanished or at least greatly diminished  as during the Necrosha event Proteus was not only able to possess Psylocke but also was able to alter her body structure  169  During the Second Coming storyline Betsy has once more been depicted using her telekinesis for considerable feats  such as making a shield to protect herself and X 23 from bullets  ripping a Nimrod robot in two and even achieving what appears to be a form of flight or levitation  170   edit  Returned powers The events involving the Sisterhood of Mutants triggered a return of her original telepathic abilities  Upon rejoining the X Men  Psylocke states that while she is still primarily a telekinetic  she has gained the ability to telepathically  suggest what people see   i e  cast telepathic illusions   100  In an interview  writer Christopher Yost and editor Daniel Ketchum confirm that Psylocke now possesses both telekinesis and telepathy  Additionally  she is once again able to focus her telepathic energies into a psychic knife and can still manifest her telekinetic katana  171  172  As shown in the events of the Psylocke miniseries  she still appears to be a powerful telepath  with a range of abilities similar to what she possessed at her introduction  as well as manifesting her trademark psychic knife  Also  she is shown to have levels of telekinesis sufficient to increase the power of her physical blows as well as ward off attacks via force fields and telekinetic  pushes   She was also seen manifesting her telekinetic katana during the Utopia storyline  but of late she has been seen using a pair of traditional katanas as well  173  174  After the events of Second Coming  Psylocke establishes that her psychic abilities fluctuate in strength  if her concentration is divided as a result of a telepathic response to her environment  it has an adverse effect on her telekinesis  175  During the  Dark Angel Saga   Psylocke had her powers vastly increased by the Jean Grey from the Age of Apocalypse timeline  She was able to overcome Archangel with her newly increased psionics  a feat that had previously been beyond her power  volume  amp  issue needed  Writer Rick Remender has stated that she is now an Omega level telepath on par with Jean Grey and Professor Xavier  176   edit  Fighting skills Psylocke has been classified as a master martial artist  though the specific fighting arts she has mastered have never been revealed  Psylocke s fighting skills and techniques have been shown to surpass those of the average Hand ninja  151  or Crimson Dawn Undercloak  177  and have been said to rival those of a ninja master  178  In addition to the fighting skills she learned from The Hand  Psylocke has recently received training from fellow Exiles teammate Sabretooth 179  and from an alternate reality s Ogun  who used science and magic combined to alter the passage of time itself  allowing them to accomplish a lifetime s work in a few short hours  thus improving Psylocke s skills once more  180  As a telepath  Psylocke could take advantage of her powers in a fight by reading her opponents  movements seconds before they made them  giving her the opportunity to counter attack faster  151  She could also use her telepathy to mask her presence from other people  humans and superhumans alike  e g  from Wolverine s super enhanced senses  181  or from Jean Grey s telepathy  153  She could also create telepathic illusions to distract her enemies while fighting them  182  and as a ninja  she used her psychic knife to incapacitate her opponents instead of killing them  151  although she will kill her opponents if she finds it to be necessary  75  As a telekinetic  she often uses her powers to augment her strength and speed  74  making her fighting skills strong enough to match  and even outmatch other superhumanly strong opponents  like a holographic version of Sabretooth in the Danger Room  72  183  During a training session with Rogue and Thunderbird  Psylocke was able to match Rogue s attacks despite the fact that Rogue had greatly enhanced speed and strength at the time  24   edit  Armor During the time when the X Men were based in the Australian outback  Psylocke gained possession of a unique suit of armor  Made of an unknown metal  it was lightweight and form fitting  yet extremely resistant to physical damage  giving Psylocke an added protection to her physical body  6  The armor was also resistant to projectiles and energy weapons  184  Wolverine had the armor custom ordered through a weapons and technology firm named Landau  Luckman  and Lake for  a colleague   Mr  Chang  an agent of Landau  Luckman  and Lake  loaned the armor to Lindsay McCabe since Wolverine had sent her to him  Tyger Tiger also wore the body armor for a short time  185  and she was briefly trapped in the armor due to a built in security mechanism  which Wolverine managed to free her from  After traveling through the Siege Perilous and trading bodies with Kwannon  Psylocke no longer used the body armor  When Kwannon  in Betsy s original body  returned to Xavier s mansion  she was wearing an armor that was similar to the one Betsy used to wear  but it has never been officially stated whether or not this armor had the same capabilities as Psylocke s original one  53  The same can be said for the armor worn by Psylocke s resurrected original body  after it was brought back during by Madelyne s sisterhood  wearing armor of the same coloring   edit  Relationships Elizabeth Braddock has been involved in a series of relationships during the years  As a member of S T R I K E  s Psi Division  she was involved with fellow agent Tom Lennox  He was murdered while trying to defend her  during which time she was psi linked to him  Telepathically experiencing Lennox s death left Betsy traumatized for a time  26  After returning to the X Men in Kwannon s body  Psylocke mentally manipulated Cyclops  her team leader  into being attracted to her  53  After regaining her full personality from Kwannon  Psylocke offered a belated apology to Jean  admitting that the flirtation was due to the presence of Kwannon s lingering personality traits in her mind  but that she did in fact find Cyclops attractive  186  Later  Elizabeth and Archangel had a relationship  but chose to end it after realizing that they were too different to stay together  10  77  After Betsy s death  Archangel suffered anguish from being unable to save her  but eventually made peace with it and moved on to a relationship with Paige Guthrie  187  Psylocke and the X Man Neal Shaara were romantically involved until her death  24  So far  neither Warren Worthington nor Neal Shaara s reaction to Elizabeth s resurrection have been depicted or spoken of  despite having both Elizabeth and Warren fighting the villain Ghoul together  alongside other X Men  in Generation M  After joining the Exiles  Psylocke has been flirting with teammate Sabretooth  They kissed each other  188  eventually leading to both acting on their feelings more intimately  189  Some time later  Psylocke and Archangel have been seen to be in the process of rebuilding their romantic relationship  108  Betsy returned to Archangel in the pages of Uncanny X Force  volume  amp  issue needed  but Fantomex has since been flirting with and pursuing her  volume  amp  issue needed   edit  In other media  edit  Television Psylocke appears during the fourth season of the X Men animated series  voiced by Tasha Simms  in the Beyond Good and Evil story arc  She was in episode 51 entitled  Promise of Apocalypse   and in episode 53  entitled  End and Beginning   In this storyline  Psylocke appears to be a lone warrior who practices theft with a cause  She comes into direct conflict with Archangel and  later on  Sabretooth and Mystique  She refers to her brother as fighting to help mutants  but does not name him as Captain Britain  This incarnation of Psylocke had the notable ability to use her psi blades as projectiles  incapacitating opponents from a distance and destroying matter  She also makes two quick cameos  during Season 2 in episode 18   Repo Man   and episode 24   Mojovision   Psylocke also appears in Wolverine and the X Men episode  Time Bomb   voiced by Grey DeLisle  In this series she is Asian in appearance  though no explanation is given as to the circumstances of her ethnicity  She is a telepath and displays a butterfly shaped energy aura when using her powers  It s hinted that Quicksilver had previously rescued her from an anti mutant prison and now wants her to return the favor  He asks her to use her telepathy to block Nitro s powers  The X Men arrive to stop them and later Psylocke is defeated by Emma Frost  Although Psylocke works with the Brotherhood  earlier in the episode she helps a woman who was about to be ticketed by an officer  forcing the latter to eat the ticket  190   edit  Film In the 2003 film X2  X Men United  her name appears on a list of names Mystique scrolls through on Stryker s computer while looking for Magneto s file  In the film s novelization  Psylocke makes a cameo as one of the mutants affected by Dark Cerebro in Vatican City during a fashion show and is seen waking up from her coma  induced by Dark Cerebro  when the machine begins affecting humans  She uses her telepathy to sense what is going on  Meiling Melan on as Psylocke in X Men  The Last Stand Psylocke also appeared as a minor villainess in the 2006 film X Men  The Last Stand  played by actress Meiling Melan on  In the film  she fights against the X Men as a member of The Omegas  During an interview with Wizard magazine  Melan on said that in X3  Psylocke has the power to turn into shadows and create psi blades  However  in the film  she does not demonstrate any psi power  but uses her shadow teleportation to appear out of nowhere  In the film  Psylocke seems to be killed alongside Arclight and a character based on Quill  named  Kid Omega  in the credits  by Jean Grey s disintegration wave  The film s novelization makes no mention of what happens to Psylocke  Quill and Arclight after their unsuccessful attempt to kill Archangel s father  According to scriptwriter Zak Penn  the character played by Melan on was not named as Psylocke in the original script  In a Q amp A  he claimed that   There was some switching of character names later in production  and I m not exactly sure how Psylocke got thrown into the mix   191  In the film s DVD audio commentary  Brett Ratner said that the character is Psylocke and not Revanche   edit  Video
