 engaging in frequent brawls and escape attempts  Eventually transferred to Seagate Prison off the coast of Georgia  he becomes the favorite target of sadistic guard Albert  Billy Bob  Rackham  whose brutality ultimately leads to a demotion that he blames on Lucas  Later  research scientist Dr  Noah Burstein recruits Lucas as a volunteer for experimental cell regeneration based on a variant of the

fangs of a vampire are not able to pierce his skin  60  A second exposure to said experiments further enhanced his strength and durability to current levels  He is described as being significantly stronger than his first enhancement  61  The same experiment which granted him his great strength and durability has also given him a faster than normal recovery time from injury  Cage s recovery time from physical trauma is significantly shorter than that of a normal human  62  A major drawback  however  to his superhuman durability is that when he does sustain serious injury beyond his ability to heal on his own  medical care is difficult  given doctors  inability to get past his hardened skin  as in the Secret War limited series  Luke Cage is an exceptional street fighter and was a gifted athlete before receiving superhuman abilities  He has also studied martial arts under Iron Fist s instruction  learning how to couple leverage with his strength in order to increase his combat
