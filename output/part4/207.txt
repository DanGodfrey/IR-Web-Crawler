Gulf of Mexico and on the west  across the Mississippi River  by Louisiana and Arkansas  In addition to its namesake  major rivers in Mississippi include the Big Black River  the Pearl River  the Yazoo River  the Pascagoula River  and the Tombigbee River  Major lakes include Ross Barnett Reservoir  Arkabutla Lake  Sardis Lake and Grenada Lake  The largest lake in Mississippi is Grenada Lake  The state of Mississippi is entirely composed of lowlands  the highest point being Woodall Mountain  in the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains  806 feet  246 m  above sea level  The lowest point is sea level at the Gulf coast  The mean elevation in the state is 300 feet  91 m  above sea level  Most of Mississippi is part of the East Gulf Coastal Plain  The Coastal Plain is generally composed of low hills  such as the Pine Hills in the south and the North Central Hills  The Pontotoc Ridge and the Fall Line Hills in the northeast have somewhat higher elevations  Yellow brown loess soil is found in the western parts of the state  The northeast is a region of fertile black earth that extends into the Alabama Black Belt  The coastline includes large bays at Bay St  Louis  Biloxi and Pascagoula  It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico proper by the shallow Mississippi Sound  which is partially sheltered by Petit Bois Island  Horn Island  East and West Ship Islands  Deer Island  Round Island and Cat Island  Mississippi State Map The northwest remainder of the state consists of the Mississippi Delta  a section of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain  The plain is narrow in the south and widens north of Vicksburg  The region has rich soil  partly made up of silt which had been regularly deposited by the floodwaters of the Mississippi River  Areas under the management of the

F  about 35 C  in July and about 48  F  about 9  C  in January  The temperature varies little statewide in the summer  however  in winter  the region near Mississippi Sound is significantly warmer than the inland portion of the state  The recorded temperature in Mississippi has ranged from  19  F   28 3  C   in 1966  at Corinth in the northeast  to 115  F  46 1  C   in 1930  at Holly Springs in the north  Heavy snowfall is possible across the state  such as during the New Year s Eve 1963 snowstorm  Yearly precipitation generally increases from north to south  with the regions closer to the Gulf being the most humid  Thus  Clarksdale  in the northwest  gets about 50 inches  about 1 270 mm  of precipitation annually and Biloxi  in the south  about 61 inches  about 1 550 mm   Small amounts of snow fall in northern and central Mississippi  although snow is occasional in the southern part of the state  The late summer and fall is the seasonal period of risk for hurricanes moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico  especially in the southern part of the state  Hurricane Camille in 1969 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005  which killed 238 people in the state  are the most devastating hurricanes to hit the state  both causing nearly total storm surge damage around Gulfport  Biloxi and Pascagoula  As in the rest of the Deep South  thunderstorms are common in Mississippi  especially in the southern part of the state  On average  Mississippi has around 27 tornadoes annually  the northern part of the state has more tornadoes earlier in the year and the southern part a higher frequency later in the year  Two of the five deadliest tornadoes in US history have occurred in the state  These storms struck Natchez  in southwest Mississippi  see The Great Natchez Tornado  and Tupelo  in the northeast corner of the state  About seven F5 tornadoes have been recorded in the state  Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures   F  For Various Mississippi Cities City Jan Feb Mar

welcome sign Mississippi is heavily forested  with over half of the state s area covered by wild trees  including mostly pine  as well as cottonwood  elm  hickory  oak  pecan  sweetgum and tupelo   edit  Ecological problems  edit  Flooding Due to seasonal flooding  possible from December to June  the Mississippi River created a fertile floodplain in the Mississippi Delta  including tributaries  Slaves built levees along the Mississippi River to control flooding  They built on top of the natural levees that formed from dirt deposited after the river flooded  As cultivation of cotton increased in the Delta  planters hired Irish laborers  who immigrated in high numbers in the 1840s  to ditch and drain their land  The state took over levee building from 1858 to 1861  accomplishing it through contractors and hired labor  In those years  planters considered their slaves too valuable to hire out for such dangerous work  Contractors hired gangs of Irish immigrant laborers to build levees and sometimes clear land  Many of the Irish were relatively recent immigrants from the famine years who were struggling to get established  9  Before the American Civil War  the earthwork levees averaged six feet in height  although in some areas they reached twenty feet  Flooding has been an integral part of Mississippi history  but clearing of the land for cultivation and to supply fuel for steamboats took away the absorption of trees and undergrowth  After the Civil War  major floods swept down the valley in 1865  1867  1874 and 1882  Such floods regularly overwhelmed levees damaged by Confederate and Union fighting during the war  as well as those constructed after the war  10  In 1877  the Mississippi Levee District was created for southern counties  In 1879  the United States Congress created the Mississippi River Commission  whose responsibilities included aiding state levee boards in the construction of levees  Both white and black transient workers built the levees in the late 19th century  By 1882  levees averaged seven feet in height  but many in the southern Delta were severely tested by the flood that year  10  After the 1882 flood  the levee system was expanded  In 1884  the Yazoo Mississippi Delta Levee District was established to oversee levee construction and maintenance in the northern Delta counties  also included were some counties in Arkansas  11  Flooding overwhelmed northwestern Mississippi in 1912 1913  causing heavy damage to the levee districts  Regional losses and the Mississippi River Levee Association s lobbying for a flood control bill helped gain passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide federal matching funds for local levee districts  on a scale of 2 1  Although US participation in World War I interrupted funding of levees  the second round of funding helped raise the average height of levees in the Mississippi Yazoo Delta to 22 feet  6 7 m  in the 1920s  12  Scientists now understand the levees have increased flooding  and the region was severely damaged due to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927  There were losses of millions of dollars in property  stock and crops  The most damage occurred in the lower Delta  including Washington and Bolivar counties  13  Even as scientific knowledge about the Mississippi River has grown  upstream development and the consequences of the levees have caused more severe flooding in some years  Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and building of the levees have changed the nature of the river by removing the natural protection of wetlands and forest cover and strengthening the current  The state and federal governments have been struggling for the best approaches to restore some natural habitats in order to best interact with the original riverine ecology   edit  History Main article  History of Mississippi Mississippi State symbols The Flag of Mississippi  The Seal of Mississippi  Animate insignia Bird s  Mockingbird

Clarksdale  Mississippi  in 1939 Nearly 10 000 B C  Native Americans or Paleo Indians arrived in what today is referred to as the South  14  Paleoindians in the South were hunter gatherers who pursued the megafauna that became extinct following the end of the Pleistocene age  After thousands of years  the Paleoindians developed a rich and complex agricultural society  Archaeologists called these people the Mississippians of the Mississippian culture  they were Mound Builders  whose large earthworks related to political and religious rituals still stand throughout the Mississippi and Ohio valleys  Descendant Native American tribes include the Chickasaw and Choctaw  Other tribes who inhabited the territory of Mississippi  and whose names were honored in local towns  include the Natchez  the Yazoo and the Biloxi  The first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of Hernando de Soto  who passed through in 1540  The French  in April 1699  established the first European settlement at Fort Maurepas  also known as Old Biloxi   built at Ocean Springs and settled by Pierre Le Moyne d Iberville  In 1716  the French founded Natchez on the Mississippi River  as Fort Rosalie   it became the dominant town and trading post of the area  The French called the greater territory  New Louisiana   the Spanish continued to claim the Gulf coast  Through the next decades  the area was ruled by Spanish  British and French colonial governments  Under French and Spanish rule  there developed a class of free people of color  gens de couleur libres   mostly descendants of European men and enslaved women  and their multiracial children  In the early days the French and Spanish colonists were chiefly men  Even as more European women joined the settlements  there continued to be interracial unions  Often the European men would help their children get educated  and sometimes settled property on them  as well as freeing slave children and their mothers  The free people of color became educated and formed a third class between the Europeans and enslaved Africans in the French and Spanish settlements  although not so large a community as in New Orleans  After Great Britain s victory in the French and Indian War  Seven Years  War   the French surrendered the Mississippi area to them under the terms of the Treaty of Paris  1763   After the American Revolution  this area became part of the new United States of America  The Mississippi Territory was organized on April 7  1798  from territory ceded by Georgia and South Carolina  It was later twice expanded to include disputed territory claimed by both the United States and Spain  From 1800 to about 1830  the United States purchased some lands  Treaty of Doak s Stand  from Native American tribes for new settlements of European Americans  mostly from other Southern states  15  Many slaveholders brought slaves with them or purchased them through the internal slave market  especially New Orleans  They transported hundreds of thousands of slaves to the Deep South  including Mississippi  This was a forced internal migration that broke up many slave families of the Upper South  where planters were selling excess slaves  On December 10  1817  Mississippi was the 20th state admitted to the Union  David Holmes became the first governor of the state  16  Plantations were along the rivers  where waterfront gave them access to the major transportation routes  This is also where early towns developed  linked by the steamboats that carried commercial products and crops to markets  When cotton was king during the 1850s  Mississippi plantation owners especially those of the Delta and Black Belt regions became wealthy due to the high fertility of the soil  the high price of cotton on the international market  and their assets in slaves  They used the profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves  The planters  dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances among whites  played strong roles both in state politics and in planters  support for secession  By 1860  the enslaved population numbered 436 631 or 55  of the state s total of 791 305  There were fewer than 1000 free people of color  17  The relatively low population of the state before the Civil War reflected the fact that land and villages were developed only along the riverfronts  which formed the main transportation corridors  Ninety percent of the Delta bottomlands were frontier and undeveloped  18  The state needed many more settlers for development  On January 9  1861  Mississippi became the second state to declare its secession from the Union  and it was one of the founding members of the Confederate States of America  During Reconstruction  the first constitutional convention in 1868 framed a constitution whose major elements would last for 22 years  The convention was the first political organization to include freedmen representatives  17 among the 100 members  Although 32 counties had black majorities  they elected whites as well as blacks to represent them  The convention adopted universal suffrage  did away with property qualifications for suffrage or for office  which also benefited poor whites  provided for the state s first public school system  forbade race distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property  and prohibited limiting civil rights in travel  19  Under the terms of Reconstruction  Mississippi was restored to the Union on February 23  1870  While Mississippi typified the Deep South in passing Jim Crow laws in the early 20th century  its history was more complex  Because the Mississippi Delta contained so much fertile bottomland which had not been developed before the Civil War  90 percent of the land was still frontier  After the Civil War  tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the area  They could earn money by clearing the land and selling timber  and eventually advance to ownership  The new farmers included freedmen  who achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in the Mississippi bottomlands  In the 1870s and 1880s  many black farmers succeeded in gaining land ownership  18  By the turn of the century  two thirds of the farmers in Mississippi who owned land in the Delta were African American  Many were able to keep going through difficult years of falling cotton prices only by extending their debts  Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War  As another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s  however  numerous African American farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts  thus losing the land into which they had developed  18  White legislators created a new constitution in 1890  with electoral and voter registration provisions that effectively disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites  Estimates are that 100 000 black and 50 000 white men were removed from voter registration rolls over the next few years  20  The loss of political influence contributed to the difficulties of African Americans in their attempts to obtain extended credit in the late nineteenth century  Together with Jim Crow laws  increased frequency of lynchings beginning in the 1890s  failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation  successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913 created crisis conditions for many African Americans  With control of the ballot box and more access to credit  white planters expanded their ownership of Delta bottomlands and could take advantage of new railroads  By 1910  a majority of black farmers in the Delta had lost their land and were sharecroppers  By 1920  the third generation after freedom  most African Americans in Mississippi were landless laborers again facing poverty  18  Starting about 1913  tens of thousands of black Americans left Mississippi for the North in the Great Migration to industrial cities such as St  Louis  Chicago  Detroit  Philadelphia and New York  They sought jobs  better education for their children  the right to vote  relative freedom from discrimination  and better living  In the migration of 1910 1940  they left a society that had been steadily closing off opportunity  Most migrants from Mississippi took trains directly north to Chicago and often settled near former neighbors  The Second Great Migration from the South started in the 1940s  lasting until 1970  Almost half a million people left Mississippi in the second migration  three quarters of them black  Nationwide during the first half of the 20th century  African Americans became rapidly urbanized and many worked in industrial jobs  The Second Great Migration included destinations in the West  especially California  where the buildup of the defense industry offered higher paying jobs to African Americans  Mississippi generated rich  quintessentially American music traditions  gospel music  country music  jazz  blues and rock and roll  All were invented  promulgated or heavily developed by Mississippi musicians  many of them African American  and most came from the Mississippi Delta  Many musicians carried their music north to Chicago  where they made it the heart of that city s jazz and blues  Mississippi was a center of activity to educate and register black voters during the Civil Rights Movement  Although 42  of the state s population was African American in 1960  discriminatory voter registration processes still prevented most of them from voting  consequent to provisions of the state constitution  which had been in place since 1890  21  Students and community organizers from across the country came to help register voters and establish Freedom Schools  Resistance and harsh attitudes of most white politicians  including the creation of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission   the participation of many Mississippians in the White Citizens  Councils  and the violent tactics of the Ku Klux Klan and its sympathizers  gained Mississippi a reputation in the 1960s as a reactionary state  22  23  In 1966  the state was the last to officially repeal statewide prohibition of alcohol  Prior to that  Mississippi had taxed the illegal alcohol brought in by bootleggers  Governor Paul Johnson urged repeal and the sheriff  raided the annual Junior League Mardi Gras ball at the Jackson Country Club  breaking open the liquor cabinet and carting off the Champagne before a startled crowd of nobility and high ranking state officials   24  The state repealed its ban on interracial marriage  miscegenation  in 1987  which the United States Supreme Court had ruled unconstitutional in 1967   and repealed the segregationist era poll tax in 1989  In 1995  it symbolically ratified the Thirteenth Amendment  which had abolished slavery in 1865  In 2009  the legislature passed a bill to repeal other discriminatory civil rights laws which had been enacted in 1964 but ruled unconstitutional in 1967 by federal courts  Republican Governor Haley Barbour signed the bill into law  25  On August 17  1969  Category 5 Hurricane Camille hit the Mississippi coast  killing 248 people and causing US 1 5 billion in damage  1969 dollars   On August 29  2005  Hurricane Katrina  though a Category 3 storm upon final landfall  caused even greater destruction across the entire 90 miles  145 km  of Mississippi Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Alabama   edit  Demographics The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Mississippi was 2 978 512 on July 1  2011  a 0 38  increase since the 2010 United States Census  1  Mississippi s population has a sizable proportion of African Americans  approximately 37 percent  26  The center of population of Mississippi is located in Leake County  in the town of Lena  27   edit  Ethnic makeup and ancestry The Census Bureau considers race and Hispanic ethnicity to be two separate categories  These data  however  are only for non Hispanic members of each group  non Hispanic Whites  non Hispanic Blacks  etc  Americans of Scots Irish  English and Scottish ancestry are present throughout the state  and are thought to be much larger groups than are reported  English  Scottish and Scots Irish are generally the most under reported ancestry groups in both the South Atlantic States and the East South Central States  The historian David Hackett Fischer estimated that a minimum 20  of Mississippi s population is of English ancestry though the figure is probably much higher  and another large percentage is of Scottish ancestry  but many Mississippians of English and Scottish stock self identify simply as American because their families have been in North America for so long  in many cases since the early 18th century  28  29  In the 1980 census 656 371 Mississippians out of a total of 1 946 775 claimed to be of English ancestry  making them 38  of the state at the time  30  For more information on race and

between the U S  Government and the Choctaw  The Choctaw agreed to sell their traditional homelands in Mississippi and Alabama  for compensation and removal to reservations in Indian Territory  now Oklahoma   This opened up land for sale to European American immigrant settlement  Article 14 in the treaty allowed those Choctaw who chose to remain in the state to become U S  citizens  the first major non European ethnic group to do so  32  33  Today approximately 9 500 Choctaw live in Neshoba  Newton  Leake  and Jones counties  Federally recognized tribes include the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians  From before the Civil War until the 1930s  African Americans made up a majority of Mississippians  Due to the Great Migration  when more than 360 000 African Americans left the state during the 1940s and after  the African American population declined  The state in 2010 had the highest proportion of African Americans in the nation  Recently  the African American percentage of population has begun to increase due mainly to a younger population than the whites  the total fertility rates of the two races are approximately equal   Due to patterns of settlement  in almost all of Mississippi s public school districts  a majority of students are of African descent  African Americans are the majority ethnic group in the northwestern Yazoo Delta  and the southwestern and the central parts of the state  chiefly areas where  historically  African Americans owned land as farmers or worked on cotton plantations and farms  34  According to the 2000 census  the largest

born  Although some ethnic Chinese were recruited as indentured laborers from Cuba during the 1870s and later 19th c   the majority immigrated directly from China to Mississippi between 1910 1930  They were recruited as laborers  While planters first made arrangements with the Chinese for sharecropping  most Chinese soon left that work  Many became small merchants and especially grocers in towns throughout the Delta  35  As the small towns declined  many ethnic Chinese moved to cities or left the state   edit  Religion Under French and Spanish rule beginning in the 17th century  the few Europeans in what is now Mississippi were Roman Catholics  The growth of the cotton culture after 1815 brought in tens of thousands of Anglo American settlers each year  most of whom were Protestants from Southeastern states  Due to such migration  there was rapid growth in Protestant churches  especially Methodist  Presbyterian and Baptist  36  The revivals of the Great Awakening in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries initially attracted the  plain folk  by reaching out to all members of society  including women and blacks  Both slaves and free blacks were welcomed into Methodist and Baptist churches  Independent black Baptist churches were established before 1800 in Virginia  Kentucky  South Carolina and Georgia  and later developed in Mississippi as well  In the post Civil War years  religion became even more influential as the South became known as the  Bible Belt   Freedmen withdrew from white run churches in favor of setting up their own  Many left the Southern Baptist Church  and by 1895 had established numerous black Baptist state associations and the National Baptist Convention of black churches  They wanted to be independent of white supervision  In addition  independent black denominations  such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church  established in Philadelphia  and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church  established in New York   sent missionaries to the South in the postwar years  They quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of converts and founded new churches across the South  Southern congregations brought their own influences to those denominations as well  37  38  By 1900 many ministers  especially in the towns  subscribed to the Social Gospel movement  which attempted to apply Christian ethics to social and economic needs of the day  Many strongly supported Prohibition  believing it would help alleviate many sins  39  African American Baptist churches grew to include more than twice the number of members as their white Baptist counterparts  The African American call for social equality resonated throughout the Great Depression in the 1930s and World War II in the 1940s  The American Civil Rights Movement had many roots in religion  and the strong community of churches helped supply volunteers and moral purpose for their activism  The end of legal segregation and Jim Crow led to the reintegration of some churches  but most today remain all black or all white  40  Since the 1970s  fundamentalist conservative churches have grown rapidly  fueling Mississippi s conservative political trends  36  In 2000 the Southern Baptist Convention had 916 440 adherents and was the largest religious denomination in the state  followed by the United Methodist Church with 240 576  and the Roman Catholic Church with 115 760  41  Other religions have a small presence in Mississippi  as by 2000  there were 3900 Muslims  1400 Jews and 811 Bah     41   edit  Gay and lesbian demographics The 2010 United States census counted 6 286 same sex unmarried partner households in Mississippi  an increase of 1 512 since the 2000 United States census  42  43  33  contained at least one child  giving Mississippi the distinction of leading the nation in the percentage of same sex couples raising children  44  Mississippi has the largest percentage of African American same sex couples among total households  The state capital  Jackson  ranks tenth in the nation in concentration of African American same sex couples  The state ranks fifth in the nation in the percentage of Hispanic same sex couples among all Hispanic households and ninth in the highest concentration of same sex couples who are seniors  45   edit  Health and public safety The state is ranked 50th or last place among all the states for health care  according to the Commonwealth Fund  a nonprofit foundation working to advance performance of the health care system  46  For three years in a row  more than 30 percent of Mississippi s residents have been classified as obese  In a 2006 study  22 8 percent of the state s children were classified as obese  Mississippi had the highest rate of obesity of any U S  state from 2005 2008 and also ranks first in the nation for high blood pressure  diabetes  and adult inactivity  47  48  In a 2008 study of African American women  contributing risk factors were shown to be  lack of knowledge about body mass index  BMI   dietary behavior  physical activity and lack of social support  defined as motivation and encouragement by friends  49  A 2002 report on African American adolescents noted a 1999 survey which suggests that a third of children were obese  with higher ratios for those in the Delta  50  The study stressed that  obesity starts in early childhood extending into the adolescent years and then possibly into adulthood   It noted impediments to needed behavioral modification included the Delta likely being  the most underserved region in the state  with African Americans the major ethnic group  lack of accessibility and availability of medical care  and an estimated 60  of residents living below the poverty level  50  Additional risk factors were that most schools had no physical education curriculum and nutrition education is not emphasized  Previous intervention strategies may have been largely ineffective due to not being culturally sensitive or practical  50  A 2006 survey found nearly 95 percent of Mississippi adults considered childhood obesity to be a serious problem  51   edit  Economy A Mississippi U S  quarter The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Mississippi s total state product in 2010 was  98 billion  52  Per capita personal income in 2006 was  26 908  the lowest per capita personal income of any state  but the state also has the nation s lowest living costs  Although the state has one of the lowest per capita income rates in the United States  Mississippians consistently rank as one of the highest per capita in charitable contributions  53  A 2009 report by the American Legislative Exchange Council ranked Mississippi as having the 19th best economic outlook of all U S  states  54  Before the Civil War  Mississippi was the fifth wealthiest state in the nation  its wealth generated by cotton plantations along the rivers  55  Slaves were then counted as property and the rise in the cotton markets since the 1840s had increased their value  A majority   55 percent   of the population of Mississippi was enslaved in 1860  56  Ninety percent of the Delta bottomlands were undeveloped and the state had low population overall  Largely due to the domination of the plantation economy  focused on the production of agricultural cotton  the state was slow to use its wealth to invest in infrastructure such as public schools  roads and railroads  Industrialization did not come in many areas until the late 20th century  The planter aristocracy  the elite of antebellum Mississippi  kept the tax structure low for themselves and made private improvements  Before the war the most successful planters  such as Confederate President Jefferson Davis  owned riverside properties along the Mississippi River  Most of the state was undeveloped frontier away from the riverfronts  During the Civil War  30 000 mostly white Mississippi men died from wounds and disease  and many more were left crippled and wounded  Changes to the labor structure and an agricultural depression throughout the South caused severe losses in wealth  In 1860 assessed valuation of property in Mississippi had been more than  500 million  of which  218 million  43 percent  was estimated as the value of slaves  By 1870  total assets had decreased in value to roughly  177 million  57  Poor whites and landless former slaves suffered the most from the postwar economic depression  The constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed a committee to recommend what was needed for relief of the state and its citizens  The committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes  58  It took years for the state to rebuild levees damaged in battles  The upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war  By 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state  but the crop of 565 000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures  59  Blacks sold timber and developed bottomland to achieve ownership  In 1900  two thirds of farm owners in Mississippi were blacks  a major achievement for them and their families  Due to the poor economy  low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit  many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties  Two decades later  the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers  The low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more than a generation of African Americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debts  18  Mississippi s rank as one of the poorest states is related to its dependence on cotton agriculture before and after the Civil War  late development of its frontier bottomlands in the Mississippi Delta  repeated natural disasters of flooding in the late 19th and early 20th century requiring massive capital investment in levees  heavy capital investment to ditch and drain the bottomlands  and slow development of railroads to link bottomland towns and river cities  60  In addition  when conservative white Democrats regained control  they passed the 1890 constitution that discouraged industry  a legacy that would slow the state s progress for years  61  Democratic Party paramilitary militias and groups such as the Red Shirts and the Knights of the White Camelia terrorized African American Republicans and suppressed voting  The Democrats regained political control of the state in 1877  The legislature passed statutes to establish segregation and a new constitution that effectively disfranchised most blacks  Native Americans and many poor whites by changes to electoral and voter registration rules  62  The state refused for years to build human capital by fully educating all its citizens  In addition  the reliance on agriculture grew increasingly costly as the state suffered loss of crops due to the devastation of the boll weevil in the early 20th century  devastating floods in 1912 1913 and 1927  collapse of cotton prices after 1920  and drought in 1930  60  It was not until 1884  after the flood of 1882  that the state created the Mississippi Yazoo Delta District Levee Board and started successfully achieving longer term plans for levees in the upper Delta  11  Despite the state s building and reinforcing levees for years  the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 broke through and caused massive flooding of 27 000 square miles  70 000 km2  throughout the Delta  homelessness for hundreds of thousands  and millions of dollars in property damages  With the Depression coming so soon after the flood  the state suffered badly during those years  In the Great Migration  tens of thousands of African Americans migrated North and West for jobs and chances to live as full citizens  The legislature s 1990 decision to legalize casino gambling along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast has led to economic gains for the state  Gambling towns in Mississippi include the Gulf Coast resort towns of Bay St  Louis  Gulfport and Biloxi  and the Mississippi River towns of Tunica  the third largest gaming area in the United States   Greenville  Vicksburg and Natchez  Before Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast  Mississippi was the second largest gambling state in the Union  after Nevada and ahead of New Jersey  citation needed

 Mississippi collects personal income tax in three tax brackets  ranging from 3  to 5   The retail sales tax rate in Mississippi is 7   A local sales tax of 2 5  is levied in Tupelo  64  For purposes of assessment for ad valorem taxes  taxable property is divided into five classes  citation needed  On August 30  2007  a report by the United States Census Bureau indicated that Mississippi was the poorest state in the country  Many cotton farmers in the Delta have large  mechanized plantations  some of which receive extensive federal subsidies  yet many other residents still live as poor  rural  landless laborers  Of  1 2 billion from 2002 2005 in federal subsidies to farmers in the Bolivar County area of the Delta  5  went to small farmers  There has been little money apportioned for rural development  Small towns are struggling  More than 100 000 people have left the region in search of work elsewhere  65  The state had a median household income of  34 473  66  As of January 2010  the state s unemployment rate was 10 9   67   edit  Federal subsidies and spending Despite Mississippi s fiscal conservatism  in which Medicaid  welfare  food stamps  and other social programs are often cut  eligibility requirements are tightened  and stricter employment criteria are imposed  Mississippi still ranks as having the 2nd highest ratio of spending to tax receipts of any state  In 2005  Mississippi citizens received approximately  2 02 per dollar of taxes in the way of federal spending  This ranks the state 2nd highest nationally  and represents an increase from 1995  when Mississippi received  1 54 per dollar of taxes in federal spending and was 3rd highest nationally  68  It should be noted  however  that this figure comes from the year that large portions of the state were devastated by Hurricane Katrina  leading to large influxes of federal aid from FEMA  A proportion of federal spending in Mississippi is directed toward large federal installations such as Camp Shelby  John C  Stennis Space Center  and Keesler Air Force Base  in a state with a relatively low population density and one of the lowest proportions of urban dwellers  69  All three of these installations are also located in the area affected by Hurricane Katrina   edit  Law and government Main article  Law and government of Mississippi As with all other U S  states and the federal government  Mississippi s government is based on the separation of legislative  executive and judicial power  Executive authority in the state rests with the Governor  currently Phil Bryant  R   The Lieutenant Governor  currently Tate Reeves  R   is elected on a separate ballot  Both the governor and lieutenant governor are elected to four year terms of office  Unlike the federal government  but like many other U S  States  most of the heads of major executive departments are elected by the citizens of Mississippi rather than appointed by the governor  Mississippi is one of five states that elects its state officials in odd numbered years  the others are Kentucky  Louisiana  New Jersey and Virginia   Mississippi holds elections for these offices every four years  always in the year preceding Presidential elections  the most recent of which was in 2011  Uniquely  Mississippi was the last state to give shares of its popular vote exceeding 85  and 90  to one candidate in a

Education in Mississippi Until the Civil War era  Mississippi had a small number of schools and no educational institutions for African Americans  The first school for black people was established in 1862  During Reconstruction in 1871  black and white Republicans were the first to establish a system of public education in the state  The state s dependence on agriculture and resistance to taxation limited the funds it had available to spend on any schools  As late as the early 20th century  there were few schools in rural areas  With seed money from the Julius Rosenwald Fund  many rural black communities across Mississippi raised matching funds and contributed public funds to build new schools for their children  Essentially  many black adults taxed themselves twice and made significant sacrifices to raise money for the education of children in their communities  77  Blacks and whites attended separate public schools in Mississippi until the 1960s  when they began to be integrated following the 1954 U S  Supreme Court ruling in Brown v  Board of Education that racially segregated public schools were unconstitutional  In the late 1980s  the state had 954 public elementary and
