eventually settled in the Hampshire city of Portsmouth and established a chain of grocery stores  8  His father  David Bernard Gaiman  9  worked in the same chain of stores  8  his mother  Sheila Gaiman  n e Goldman   was a pharmacist  He has two younger sisters  Claire and Lizzy  10  After living for a period in the nearby town of Portchester  Hampshire  where Neil was born in 1960  the Gaimans moved in 1965 to the West Sussex town of East Grinstead where his parents studied Dianetics at the Scientology centre in the town  11  They remained closely involved with Judaism  Gaiman s sister later said   It would get very confusing when people would ask my religion as a kid  I d say   I m a Jewish Scientologist    11  Gaiman says that he is not a Scientologist  11  Gaiman was able to read at the age of four  He said   I was a reader  I loved reading  Reading things gave me pleasure  I was very good at most subjects in school  not because I had any particular aptitude in them  but because normally on the first day of school they d hand out schoolbooks  and I d read them  which would mean that I d know what was coming up  because I d read it   2  One work that made a particular impression on him was J  R  R  Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings from his school library  although it only had the first two books in the trilogy  He consistently took them out and read them  He would later win the school English prize and the school reading prize  enabling him to finally acquire the third book in the trilogy  2  For his seventh birthday  Gaiman received C  S  Lewis s The Chronicles of Narnia series  He later recalled that  I admired his use of parenthetical statements to the reader  where he would just talk to you   I d think   Oh  my gosh  that is so cool  I want to do that  When I become an author  I want to be able to do things in parentheses   I liked the power of putting things in brackets   2  Another childhood favorite was Lewis Carroll s Alice s Adventures in Wonderland  which he called  a favourite forever  Alice was default reading to the point where I knew it by heart   2  He also enjoyed Batman comics as a child  2  Gaiman was educated at several Church of England schools  including Fonthill School in East Grinstead  12 Ardingly College  1970 74   and Whitgift School in Croydon  1974 77   13  His father s position as a public relations official of the Church of Scientology was the cause of the seven year old Gaiman being blocked from entering a boys  school  forcing him to remain at the school that he had previously been attending  11  14  He lived in East Grinstead for many years  from 1965 1980 and again from 1984 1987  12  He met his first wife  Mary McGrath  while she was studying Scientology and living in a house in East Grinstead that was owned by his father  The couple were married in 1985 after having their first child  Michael  11   edit  Journalism  early writings  and literary influences As a child and a teenager  Gaiman read the works of C  S  Lewis  J  R  R  Tolkien  Lewis Carroll  James Branch Cabell  Edgar Allan Poe  Michael Moorcock  Ursula K  Le Guin  Harlan Ellison  Rudyard Kipling  Lord Dunsany and G  K  Chesterton  2  He later became a fan of science fiction  reading the works of authors as diverse as Alan Moore  15 Samuel R  Delany  Roger Zelazny  Robert A  Heinlein  H  P  Lovecraft  Thorne Smith  and Gene Wolfe  citation needed  In the early 1980s  Gaiman pursued journalism  conducting interviews and writing book reviews  as a means to learn about the world and to make connections that he hoped would later assist him in getting published  2  He wrote and reviewed extensively for the British Fantasy Society  16  His first professional short story publication was  Featherquest   a fantasy story  in Imagine Magazine in May 1984  when he was 24  17  When waiting for a train at Victoria Station in 1984  Gaiman noticed a copy of Swamp Thing written by Alan Moore  and carefully read it  Moore s fresh and vigorous approach to comics had such an impact on Gaiman that he would later write   that was the final straw  what was left of my resistance crumbled  I proceeded to make regular and frequent visits to London s Forbidden Planet shop to buy comics   15  In 1984  he wrote his first book  a biography of the band Duran Duran  as well as Ghastly Beyond Belief  a book of quotations  with Kim Newman  2  Even though Gaiman thought he did a terrible job  the book s first edition sold out very quickly  When he went to relinquish his rights to the book  he discovered the publisher had gone bankrupt  2  18  After this  he was offered a job by Penthouse  He refused the offer  2  He also wrote interviews and articles for many British magazines  including Knave  As he was writing for different magazines  some of them competing  and  wrote too many articles   he sometimes went by a number of pseudonyms  Gerry Musgrave  Richard Grey   along with a couple of house names   19  Gaiman ended his journalism career in 1987 because British newspapers can  make up anything they want and publish it as fact   20  21  In the late 1980s  he wrote Don t Panic  The Official Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy Companion in what he calls a  classic English humour  style  citation needed  Following on from that he wrote the opening of what would become his collaboration with Terry Pratchett on the comic novel Good Omens  about the impending apocalypse  22   edit  Comics and graphic novels See also  Neil Gaiman bibliography Comics and graphic novels After forming a friendship with comic book writer Alan Moore  15  Gaiman started writing comic books  picking up Marvelman after Moore finished his run on the series  Gaiman and artist Mark Buckingham collaborated on several issues of the series before its publisher  Eclipse Comics  collapsed  leaving the series unfinished  His first published comic strips were four short Future Shocks for 2000 AD in 1986 7  He wrote three graphic novels with his favorite collaborator and long time friend Dave McKean  Violent Cases  Signal to Noise  and The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr  Punch  Impressed with his work  DC Comics hired him  and he wrote the limited series Black Orchid  23 Karen Berger  head of DC Comics s Vertigo  read Black Orchid and offered Gaiman a job  to re write an old character  The Sandman  but to put his own spin on him  2  The Sandman tells the tale of the ageless  anthropomorphic personification of Dream that is known by many names  including Morpheus  The series began in December 1988 and concluded in March 1996  the 75 issues of the regular series  along with an illustrated prose text and a special containing seven short stories  have been

Daniel Vozzo  and covers by Dave McKean  2  In 1989  Gaiman published The Books of Magic  collected in 1991   a four part mini series that provided a tour of the mythological and magical parts of the DC Universe through a frame story about an English teenager who discovers that he is destined to be the world s greatest wizard  The miniseries was popular  and sired an ongoing series written by John Ney Rieber  In the mid 90s  he also created a number of new characters and a setting that was to be featured in a title published by Tekno Comix  The concepts were then altered and split between three titles set in the same continuity  Lady Justice  Mr  Hero the Newmatic Man  and Teknophage  24  They were later featured in Phage  Shadow Death and Wheel of Worlds  Although Gaiman s name appeared prominently on all titles  he was not involved in writing of any of the above mentioned books  though he helped plot the zero issue of Wheel of Worlds   citation needed  Gaiman wrote a semi autobiographical story about a boy s fascination with Michael Moorcock s anti hero Elric of Melnibon  for Ed Kramer s anthology Tales of the White Wolf  In 1996  Gaiman and Ed Kramer co edited The Sandman  Book of Dreams  Nominated for the British Fantasy Award  the original fiction anthology featured stories and contributions by Tori Amos  Clive Barker  Gene Wolfe  Tad Williams  and others  Asked why he likes comics more than other forms of storytelling Gaiman said  One of the joys of comics has always been the knowledge that it was  in many ways  untouched ground  It was virgin territory  When I was working on Sandman  I felt a lot of the time that I was actually picking up a machete and heading out into the jungle  I got to write in places and do things that nobody had ever done before  When I m writing novels I m painfully aware that I m working in a medium that people have been writing absolutely jaw droppingly brilliant things for  you know  three four thousand years now  You know  you can go back  We have things like The Golden Ass  And you go  well  I don t know that I m as good as that and that s two and a half thousand years old  But with comics I felt like   I can do stuff nobody has ever done  I can do stuff nobody has ever thought of  And I could and it was enormously fun   25  In 2009  Gaiman wrote a two part Batman story for DC Comics to follow Batman R I P  It is titled  Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader   a play off of the classic Superman story  Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow   by Alan Moore  26  27  28  He also contributed a twelve page Metamorpho story drawn by Mike Allred for Wednesday Comics  a weekly newspaper style series  29   edit  Novels Neil Gaiman at the 2007 Scream Awards See also  Neil Gaiman bibliography Novels In a collaboration with author Terry Pratchett  best known for his series of Discworld novels   Gaiman s first novel Good Omens was published in 1990  In recent years Pratchett has said that while the entire novel was a collaborative effort and most of the ideas could be credited to both of them  Pratchett did a larger portion of writing and editing if for no other reason than Gaiman s scheduled involvement with Sandman  30  The 1996 novelization of Gaiman s teleplay for the BBC mini series Neverwhere was his first solo novel  The novel was released in tandem with the television series though it presents some notable differences from the television series  In 1999 first printings of his fantasy novel Stardust were released  The novel has been released both as a standard novel and in an illustrated text edition  American Gods became one of Gaiman s best selling and multi award winning novels upon its release in 2001  31  A special 10th Anniversary edition was released  with

promoting this edition in 2011  In 2005  his novel Anansi Boys was released worldwide  The book deals with Anansi   Mr  Nancy    a supporting character in American Gods  Specifically it traces the relationship of his two sons  one semi divine and the other an unaware Englishman of American origin  as they explore their common heritage  It debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller

graveyard  It is heavily influenced by Rudyard Kipling s The Jungle Book  As of late January 2009 update   it had been on the New York Times Bestseller children s list for fifteen weeks  33  As of 2008  Gaiman has several books planned  After a tour of China  he decided to write a non fiction book about his travels and the general mythos of China  Following that  will be a new  adult  novel  his first since 2005 s Anansi Boys   After that  another  all ages  book  in the same vein as Coraline and The Graveyard Book   Following that  Gaiman says that he will release another non fiction book called The Dream Catchers  34  In December of 2011  Gaiman announced that in January 2012 he would begin work on what is essentially   American Gods 2   35   edit  Film and screenwriting See also

which Gaiman described the day to day process of revising  publishing  and promoting the novel  After the novel was published  the web site evolved into a more general Official Neil Gaiman Website  49  Gaiman generally posts to the blog several times a week  describing the day to day process of being Neil Gaiman and writing  revising  publishing  or promoting whatever the current project is  He also posts reader emails and answers questions  which gives him unusually direct and immediate interaction with fans  One of his answers on why he writes the blog is  because writing is  like death  a lonely business   50  The original American Gods blog was extracted for publication in the NESFA Press collection of Gaiman miscellany  Adventures in the Dream Trade  51  To celebrate the 7th anniversary of the blog  the novel American Gods was provided free of charge online for a month  52  53   Gaiman is an active user of the social networking site Twitter with over 1 6 million followers

Orleans  64  They were legally married on 2 January 2011  65  The wedding took place in the parlour of writers Ayelet Waldman and Michael Chabon  66   edit  Friendship with Tori Amos One of Gaiman s most commented upon friendships is with the musician Tori Amos  a Sandman fan who became friends with Gaiman after making a reference to  Neil and the Dream King  on her 1991 demo tape  and whom he included as a character  a talking tree  in Stardust  67  Amos also mentions Gaiman in her songs   Tear in Your Hand    If you need me  me and Neil ll be hangin  out with the dream king  Neil says hi by the way    68   Space Dog    Where s Neil when you need him     69   Horses    But will you find me if Neil makes me a tree     70   Carbon    Get me Neil on the line  no I can t hold  Have him read   Snow  Glass  Apples  where nothing is what it seems    71   Sweet Dreams    You re forgetting to fly  darling  when you sleep    71  and  Not Dying Today    Neil is thrilled he can claim he s mammalian   but the bad news   he said   girl you re a dandelion     71  He also wrote stories for the tour book of Boys for Pele and Scarlet s Walk  a letter for the tour book of American Doll Posse  and the stories behind each girl in her album Strange Little Girls  Amos penned the introduction for his novel Death  the High Cost of Living  and posed for the cover  She also wrote a song called  Sister Named Desire  based on his Sandman character  which was included on his anthology  Where s Neil When You Need Him   Gaiman is godfather to Tori Amos s daughter Tash  72  and wrote a poem called  Blueberry Girl  for Tori and Tash  73  The poem has been turned into a book by the illustrator Charles Vess  74  Gaiman read the poem aloud to an audience at the Sundance Kabuki Theater in San Francisco on 5 October 2008 during his book reading tour for The Graveyard Book  75  It was published in March 2009 with the title  Blueberry Girl  S  Alexander Reed has written about the intertextual relationships between Gaiman s and Amos s respective work  Reed does close readings of several of Gaiman s allusions to Amos  arguing that the reference to Amos happens as the texts expand and broaden their focus  and that Amos serves to disrupt the linear flow of the narrative  He reads this disruption in terms of psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan s idea of the mirror stage  arguing that the mutual referentiality serves to create an ideal vision of the reader as fan that the actual reader encounters and misrecognizes as themselves  thus drawing the reader into the role of the devoted  and paying  fan  The essay also contains a fairly thorough list of known references in both Gaiman s and Amos s work  76   edit  Litigation In 1993  Gaiman was contracted by Todd McFarlane to write a single issue of Spawn  a popular title at the newly created Image Comics company  McFarlane was promoting his new title by having guest authors Gaiman  Alan Moore  Frank Miller  and Dave Sim each write a single issue  In issue  9 of the series  Gaiman introduced the characters Angela  Cogliostro  and Medieval Spawn  Prior to this issue  Spawn was an assassin who worked for the government and came back as a reluctant agent of Hell but had no direction  In Angela  a cruel and malicious angel  Gaiman introduced a character who threatened Spawn s existence  as well as providing a moral opposite  Cogliostro was introduced as a mentor character for exposition and instruction  providing guidance  Medieval Spawn introduced a history and precedent that not all Spawns were self serving or evil  giving additional character development to Malebolgia  the demon that creates Hellspawn  As intended  77  all three characters were used repeatedly throughout the next decade by Todd McFarlane within the wider Spawn universe  In papers filed by Gaiman in early 2002  however  he claimed that the characters were jointly owned by their scripter  himself  and artist  McFarlane   not merely by McFarlane in his role as the creator of the series  78  79  Disagreement over who owned the rights to a character was the primary motivation for McFarlane and other artists to form Image Comics  although that argument related more towards disagreements between writers and artists as character creators   80  As McFarlane used the characters without Gaiman s permission or royalty payments  Gaiman believed his copyrighted work was being infringed upon  which violated their original  oral  agreement  McFarlane initially agreed that Gaiman had not signed away any rights to the characters  and negotiated with Gaiman to effectively  swap  McFarlane s interest in the character Marvelman 81   McFarlane believes he purchased interest in the character when Eclipse Comics was liquidated  Gaiman is interested in being able to continue his aborted run on that title  but later claimed that Gaiman s work had been work for hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman s creations entirely  The presiding Judge  however  ruled against their agreement being work for hire  based in large part on the legal requirement that  copyright assignments must be in writing   82  The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court ruling in February 2004 83  granting joint ownership of the characters to Gaiman and McFarlane  On the specific issue of Cogliostro  presiding Judge John Shabaz proclaimed  The expressive work that is the comic book character Count Nicholas Cogliostro was the joint work of Gaiman and McFarlane their contributions strike us as quite equal and both are entitled to ownership of the copyright   84  Similar analysis lead to similar results for the other two characters  Angela and Medieval Spawn  This legal battle was brought by Gaiman and the specifically formed Marvels and Miracles  LLC  which Gaiman created in order to help sort out the legal rights surrounding Marvelman  see the ownership of Marvelman sub section of the Marvelman article   Gaiman wrote Marvel 1602 in 2003 to help fund this project  85  All of Marvel Comics  profits for the original issues of the series went to Marvels and Miracles  85  In 2009  Marvel Comics purchased Marvelman  86  Gaiman returned to court over three more Spawn characters  Dark Ages Spawn  Domina and Tiffany  that are claimed to be  derivative of the three he co created with McFarlane   87  The original three characters  whose first appearance was never reprinted in Spawn trade paperback collections  are just now appearing printed for the first time  The judge ruled that Gaiman was right in his claims and gave McFarlane until the start of September 2010 to settle matters  88  Gaiman is a major supporter and board member of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund  89   edit  References in popular culture Neil Gaiman is mentioned with  humble thanks  in the end credits of Kevin Smith s film Dogma  In the science fiction television series Babylon 5  one of the races  The Gaim  is named in homage to Gaiman  and they are similar in appearance to the protagonist  while in full attire  not the anthropomorphic appearance  of Gaiman s graphic novel series  Sandman   90  In the Star Trek novel How Much for Just the Planet   the character  Ilen the Magian  is an allusion to Neil Gaiman  There are two laws named after Gaiman  Gaiman s First Law  Picking up your first copy of a book

Gaiman made a guest appearance on long running cartoon series The Simpsons in 2011  in an episode called The Book Job  44  Gaiman made a guest appearance on The Guild  season 5  episode 7  Downturn    playing himself   edit  Literary allusions Gaiman s work is known for a high degree of allusiveness  93  Meredith Collins  for instance  has commented upon the degree to which his novel Stardust depends on allusions to Victorian fairy tales and culture  94  Particularly in The Sandman  literary figures and characters appear often  the character of Fiddler s Green is modelled visually on G K  Chesterton  both William Shakespeare and Geoffrey Chaucer appear as characters  as do several characters from within A Midsummer Night s Dream and The Tempest  The comic also draws from numerous mythologies and historical periods  Such allusions are not unique to Sandman  Stardust  for example  also has a character called Shakespeare  Clay Smith has argued that this sort of allusiveness serves to situate Gaiman as a strong authorial presence in his own works  often to the exclusion of his collaborators  95  However  Smith s viewpoint is in the minority  to many  if there is a problem with Gaiman scholarship and intertextuality it is that      his literary merit and vast popularity have propelled him into the nascent comics canon so quickly that there is not yet a basis of critical scholarship about his work   96  David Rudd takes a more generous view in his study of the novel Coraline  where he argues that the work plays and riffs productively on Sigmund Freud s notion of the Uncanny  or the Unheimlich  97  Though Gaiman s work is frequently seen as exemplifying the monomyth structure laid out in Joseph Campbell s The Hero with a Thousand Faces  98  Gaiman says that he started reading The Hero with a Thousand Faces but refused to finish it   I think I got about half way through The Hero with a Thousand Faces and found myself thinking if this is true   I don t want to know  I really would rather not know this stuff  I d rather do it because it s true and because I accidentally wind up creating something that falls into this pattern than be told what the pattern is   99   edit  Selected awards and honours 1991 World Fantasy Award for short fiction for the Sandman issue   A Midsummer Night s Dream  1991 1993 Comics Buyer s Guide Award for Favorite Writer 1997
