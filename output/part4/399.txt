World Wide Web From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search  WWW  redirects here  For other uses  see WWW  disambiguation    The Web  redirects here  For other uses  see Web  disambiguation   Not to be confused with the Internet  World Wide Web The Web s historic logo designed by Robert Cailliau Inventor Tim Berners Lee 1 Robert Cailliau Launch year 1990 1991 Company CERN Availability Worldwide The World Wide Web  abbreviated as WWW or W3  2  and commonly known as the Web  is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet  With a web browser  one can view web pages that may contain text  images  videos  and other multimedia  and navigate between them via hyperlinks  Using concepts from his earlier hypertext systems like ENQUIRE  British engineer and computer scientist Sir Tim Berners Lee  now Director of the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C   wrote a proposal in March 1989 for what would eventually become the World Wide Web  1  At CERN  a European research organization near Geneva situated on Swiss and French soil  3  Berners Lee and Belgian computer scientist Robert Cailliau proposed in 1990 to use hypertext      to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will   4  and they publicly introduced the project in December  5  Contents 1 History 2 Function 2 1 Linking 2 2 Dynamic

is a server  DO NOT POWER IT DOWN    In the May 1970 issue of Popular Science magazine Arthur C  Clarke was reported to have predicted that satellites would one day  bring the accumulated knowledge of the world to your fingertips  using a console that would combine the functionality of the Xerox  telephone  television and a small computer  allowing data transfer and video conferencing around the globe  6  In March 1989  Tim Berners Lee wrote a proposal that referenced ENQUIRE  a database and software project he had built in 1980  and described a more elaborate information management system  7  With help from Robert Cailliau  he published a more formal proposal  on November 12  1990  to build a  Hypertext project  called  WorldWideWeb   one word  also  W3   as a  web  of  hypertext documents  to be viewed by  browsers  using a client server architecture  4  This proposal estimated that a read only web would be developed within three months and that it would take six months to achieve  the creation of new links and new material by readers   so that  authorship becomes universal  as well as  the automatic notification of a reader when new material of interest to him her has become available   While the read only goal was met  accessible authorship of web content took longer to mature  with the wiki concept  blogs  Web 2 0 and RSS Atom  8  The proposal was modeled after the Dynatext SGML reader by Electronic Book Technology  a spin off from the Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship at Brown University  The Dynatext system  licensed by CERN  was technically advanced and was a key player in the extension of SGML ISO 8879 1986 to Hypermedia within HyTime  but it was considered too expensive and had an inappropriate licensing policy for use in the general high energy physics community  namely a fee for each document and each document alteration  The CERN datacenter in 2010 housing some WWW servers A NeXT Computer was used by Berners Lee as the world s first web server and also to write the first web browser  WorldWideWeb  in 1990  By Christmas 1990  Berners Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web  9  the first web browser  which was a web editor as well   the first web server  and the first web pages  10  which described the project itself  On August 6  1991  he posted a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the alt hypertext newsgroup  11  This date also marked the debut of the Web as a publicly available service on the Internet  The first photo on the web was uploaded by Berners Lee in 1992  an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes  Web as a  Side Effect  of the 40 years of Particle Physics Experiments  It happened many times during history of science that the most impressive results of large scale scientific efforts appeared far away from the main directions of those efforts       After the World War 2 the nuclear centers of almost all developed countries became the places with the highest concentration of talented scientists  For about four decades many of them were invited to the international CERN s Laboratories  So specific kind of the CERN s intellectual  entire culture   as you called it  was constantly growing from one generation of the scientists and engineers to another  When the concentration of the human talents per square foot of the CERN s Labs reached the critical mass  it caused an intellectual explosion The Web    crucial point of human s history  was born    Nothing could be compared to it       We cant imagine yet the real scale of the recent shake  because there has not been so fast growing multi dimension social economic processes in human history    12  The first server outside Europe was set up at SLAC to host the SPIRES HEP database  Accounts differ substantially as to the date of this event  The World Wide Web Consortium says December 1992  13  whereas SLAC itself claims 1991  14  15  This is supported by a W3C document entitled A Little History of the World Wide Web  16  The crucial underlying concept of hypertext originated with older projects from the 1960s  such as the Hypertext Editing System  HES  at Brown University  Ted Nelson s Project Xanadu  and Douglas Engelbart s oN Line System  NLS   Both Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush s microfilm based  memex   which was described in the 1945 essay  As We May Think   citation needed  Berners Lee s breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet  In his book Weaving The Web  he explains that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible to members of both technical communities  but when no one took up his invitation  he finally tackled the project himself  In the process  he developed three essential technologies  a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere  the Universal Document Identifier  UDI   later known as Uniform Resource Locator  URL  and Uniform Resource Identifier  URI   the publishing language HyperText Markup Language  HTML   the Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP   17  The World Wide Web had a number of differences from other hypertext systems that were then available  The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones  This made it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource  It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers  in comparison to earlier systems   but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot  Unlike predecessors such as HyperCard  the World Wide Web was non proprietary  making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions  On April 30  1993  CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone  with no fees due  18  Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use  this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web  An early popular web browser was ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Windowing System  Robert Cailliau  Jean Fran ois Abramatic and Tim Berners Lee at the 10th anniversary of the World Wide Web Consortium  Scholars generally agree that a turning point for the World Wide Web began with the introduction 19  of the Mosaic web browser 20  in 1993  a graphical browser developed by a team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign  NCSA UIUC   led by Marc Andreessen  Funding for Mosaic came from the U S  High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative and the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991  one of several computing developments initiated by U S  Senator Al Gore  21  Prior to the release of Mosaic  graphics were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the Web s popularity was less than older protocols in use over the Internet  such as Gopher and Wide Area Information Servers  WAIS   Mosaic s graphical user interface allowed the Web to become  by far  the most popular Internet protocol  The World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  was founded by Tim Berners Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research  CERN  in October 1994  It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science  MIT LCS  with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA   which had pioneered the Internet  a year later  a second site was founded at INRIA  a French national computer research lab  with support from the European Commission DG InfSo  and in 1996  a third continental site was created in Japan at Keio University  By the end of 1994  while the total number of websites was still minute compared to present standards  quite a number of notable websites were already active  many of which are the precursors or inspiration for today s most popular services  Connected by the existing Internet  other websites were created around the world  adding international standards for domain names and HTML  Since then  Berners Lee has played an active role in guiding the development of web standards  such as the markup languages in which web pages are composed   and in recent years has advocated his vision of a Semantic Web  The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy to use and flexible format  It thus played an important role in popularizing use of the Internet  22  Although the two terms are sometimes conflated in popular use  World Wide Web is not synonymous with Internet  23  The Web is a collection of documents and both client and server software using Internet protocols such as TCP IP and HTTP   edit  Function The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used in everyday speech without much distinction  However  the Internet and the World Wide Web are not one and the same  The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks  In contrast  the Web is one of the services that runs on the Internet  It is a collection of text documents and other resources  linked by hyperlinks and URLs  usually accessed by web browsers from web servers  In short  the Web can be thought of as an application  running  on the Internet  24  Viewing a web page on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the URL of the page into a web browser or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource  The web browser then initiates a series of communication messages  behind the scenes  in order to fetch and display it  As an example  consider accessing a page with the URL http   example org wiki World Wide Web   First  the browser resolves the server name portion of the URL  example org  into an Internet Protocol address using the globally distributed database known as the Domain Name System  DNS   this lookup returns an IP address such as 208 80 152 2  The browser then requests the resource by sending an HTTP request across the Internet to the computer at that particular address  It makes the request to a particular application port in the underlying Internet Protocol Suite so that the computer receiving the request can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing such as e mail delivery  the HTTP protocol normally uses port 80  The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as the two lines of text GET  wiki World Wide Web HTTP 1 1 Host  example org The computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80  If the web server can fulfill the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success  which can be as simple as HTTP 1 0 200 OK Content Type  text html  charset UTF 8 followed by the content of the requested page  The Hypertext Markup Language for a basic web page looks like  lt html gt   lt head gt   lt title gt Example org   The World Wide Web lt  title gt   lt  head gt   lt body gt   lt p gt The World Wide Web  abbreviated as WWW and commonly known     lt  p gt   lt  body gt   lt  html gt  The web browser parses the HTML  interpreting the markup   lt title gt    lt p gt  for paragraph  and such  that surrounds the words in order to draw the text on the screen  Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images  other embedded media  scripts that affect page behavior  and Cascading Style Sheets that affect page layout  The browser will make additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other Internet media types  As it receives their content from the web server  the browser progressively renders the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources   edit  Linking Most web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files  source documents  definitions and other web resources  In the underlying HTML  a hyperlink looks like  lt a href  http   example org wiki Main Page  gt Example org  a free encyclopedia lt  a gt  Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW  demonstrating hyperlinks Such a collection of useful  related resources  interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a web of information  Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners Lee first called the WorldWideWeb  in its original CamelCase  which was subsequently discarded  in November 1990  4  The hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the webgraph  the nodes of the webgraph correspond to the web pages  or URLs  the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks  Over time  many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear  relocate  or are replaced with different content  This makes hyperlinks obsolete  a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called dead links  The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites  The Internet Archive  active since 1996  is one of the best known efforts   edit  Dynamic updates of web pages Main article  Ajax  programming  JavaScript is a scripting language that was initially developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich  then of Netscape  for use within web pages  25  The standardized version is ECMAScript  25  To overcome some of the limitations of the page by page model described above  some web applications also use Ajax  asynchronous JavaScript and XML   JavaScript is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server  either in response to user actions such as mouse clicks or based on lapsed time  The server s responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response  Thus  the server must provide only limited  incremental information  Since multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time  users can interact with a page even while data is being retrieved  Some web applications regularly poll the server to ask whether new information is available  26   edit  WWW prefix Many domain names used for the World Wide Web begin with www because of the long standing practice of naming Internet hosts  servers  according to the services they provide  The hostname for a web server is often www  in the same way that it may be ftp for an FTP server  and news or nntp for a USENET news server  These host names appear as Domain Name System  DNS  subdomain names  as in www example com  The use of  www  as a subdomain name is not required by any technical or policy standard  indeed  the first ever web server was called nxoc01 cern ch  27  and many web sites exist without it  According to Paolo Palazzi  28  who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners Lee  the popular use of  www  subdomain was accidental  the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www cern ch while info cern ch was intended to be the CERN home page  however the dns records were never switched  and the practice of prepending  www  to an institution s website domain name was subsequently copied  Many established websites still use  www   or they invent other subdomain names such as  www2    secure   etc  Many such web servers are set up such that both the domain root  e g   example com  and the www subdomain  e g   www example com  refer to the same site  others require one form or the other  or they may map to different web sites  The use of a subdomain name is useful for load balancing incoming web traffic by creating a CNAME record that points to a cluster of web servers  Since  currently  only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME  the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root  When a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field  some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix  www  to the beginning of it and possibly   com     org  and   net  at the end  depending on what might be missing  For example  entering  microsoft  may be transformed to http   www microsoft com  and  openoffice  to http   www openoffice org  This feature started appearing in early versions of Mozilla Firefox  when it still had the working title  Firebird  in early 2003  from an earlier practice in browsers such as Lynx  29  It is reported that Microsoft was granted a US patent for the same idea in 2008  but only for mobile devices  30  In English  www is pronounced by individually pronouncing the name of characters  double u double u double u  or by saying the phrase  triple double u   Although some technical users pronounce it dub dub dub  this is not widespread  although is commonly used by the general public in New Zealand   The English writer Douglas Adams once quipped in The Independent on Sunday  1999    The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it s short for   with Stephen Fry later pronouncing it in his  Podgrammes  series of podcasts as  wuh wuh wuh   In Mandarin Chinese  World Wide Web is commonly translated via a phono semantic matching to w n w i w ng        which satisfies www and literally means  myriad dimensional net   31  a translation that very appropriately reflects the design concept and proliferation of the World Wide Web  Tim Berners Lee s web space states that World Wide Web is officially spelled as three separate words  each capitalized  with no intervening hyphens  32  Use of the www prefix is declining as Web 2 0 web applications seek to brand their domain names and make them easily pronounceable  33  As the mobile web grows in popularity  services like Gmail com  MySpace com  Facebook com and Twitter com are most often discussed without adding the www to the domain  or the  com   edit  Specifiers  http and https The scheme specifiers  http    or https     in URIs refer to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and to HTTP Secure  respectively  and so define the communication protocol to be used for the request and response  The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web  the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when confidential information such as passwords or banking information are to be exchanged over the public Internet  Web browsers usually prepend the scheme to URLs too  if omitted   edit  Web Servers Main article  Web Server The primary function of a web server is to deliver web pages on the request to clients  This means delivery of HTML documents and any additional content that may be included by a document  such as images  style sheets and scripts   edit  Privacy   Whether to make the  reason  mandatory for the   cleanup   template is being discussed  See the request for comment to help reach a consensus   This section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia s quality standards   Consider using more specific cleanup instructions   Please help improve this section if you can  The talk page may contain suggestions   June 2011  This section has been nominated to be checked for its neutrality  Discussion of this nomination can be found on the talk page   June 2011  It is possible that average computer users who use the World Wide Web mainly for things like entertainment may have surrendered their right to privacy in exchange for using a number of services available on the World Wide Web  34  vague  For example  more than half a billion people worldwide have used a social network service  35  and of the generations of people within the United States who have had access to the internet from a young age  half have some form of Social Networking presence  36  and are part of a generational shift that could be changing norms  37  38  further explanation needed  The social network Facebook progressed from U S  college students to a 70  non U S  audience  but in 2009 estimated that only 20  of its members use privacy settings  39  In 2010  six years after co founding the company   Mark Zuckerberg wrote   we will add privacy controls that are much simpler to use   40  Privacy representatives from 60 countries have resolved to ask for laws to complement industry self regulation  for education for children and other minors who use the Web  and for default protections for users of social networks  41  They also believe data protection for personally identifiable information benefits business more than the sale of that information  41  Users can opt in to features in browsers to clear their personal histories locally and block some cookies and advertising networks 42  but they are still tracked in websites  server logs  and in particular web beacons  43  Berners Lee and colleagues see hope in accountability and appropriate use achieved by extending the Web s architecture to policy awareness  perhaps with audit logging  reasoners and appliances  44  In exchange for providing free content  vendors hire advertisers who spy on Web users and base their business model on tracking them  45  Since 2009  they buy and sell consumer data on exchanges  lacking a few details that could make it possible to de anonymize  or identify an individual   45  46  Hundreds of millions of times per day  Lotame Solutions captures what users are typing in real time  and sends that text to OpenAmplify who then tries to determine  to quote a writer at The Wall Street Journal   what topics are being discussed  how the author feels about those topics  and what the person is going to do about them   47  48  Microsoft backed away in 2008 from its plans for strong privacy features in Internet Explorer  49  leaving its users  50  of the world s Web users  open to advertisers who may make assumptions about them based on only one click when they visit a website  50  Among services paid for by advertising  Yahoo  could collect the most data about users of commercial websites  about 2 500 bits of information per month about each typical user of its site and its affiliated advertising network sites  Yahoo  was followed by MySpace with about half that potential and then by AOL TimeWarner  Google  Facebook  Microsoft  and eBay  51   edit  Security The Web has become criminals  preferred pathway for spreading malware  Cybercrime carried out on the Web can include identity theft  fraud  espionage and intelligence gathering  52  Web based vulnerabilities now outnumber traditional computer security concerns  53  54  and as measured by Google  about one in ten web pages may contain malicious code  55  Most Web based attacks take place on legitimate websites  and most  as measured by Sophos  are hosted in the United States  China and Russia  56  The most common of all malware threats is SQL injection attacks against websites  57  Through HTML and URIs the Web was vulnerable to attacks like cross site scripting  XSS  that came with the introduction of JavaScript 58  and were exacerbated to some degree by Web 2 0 and Ajax web design that favors the use of scripts  59  Today by one estimate  70  of all websites are open to XSS attacks on their users  60  Proposed solutions vary to extremes  Large security vendors like McAfee already design governance and compliance suites to meet post 9 11 regulations  61  and some  like Finjan have recommended active real time inspection of code and all content regardless of its source  52  Some have argued that for enterprise to see security as a business opportunity rather than a cost center  62   ubiquitous  always on digital rights management  enforced in the infrastructure by a handful of organizations must replace the hundreds of companies that today secure data and networks  63 Jonathan Zittrain has said users sharing responsibility for computing safety is far preferable to locking down the Internet  64   edit  Standards Main article  Web standards Many formal standards and other technical specifications and software define the operation of different aspects of the World Wide Web  the Internet  and computer information exchange  Many of the documents are the work of the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C   headed by Berners Lee  but some are produced by the Internet Engineering Task Force  IETF  and other organizations  Usually  when web standards are discussed  the following publications are seen as foundational  Recommendations for markup languages  especially HTML and XHTML  from the W3C  These define the structure and interpretation of hypertext documents  Recommendations for stylesheets  especially CSS  from the W3C  Standards for ECMAScript  usually in the form of JavaScript   from Ecma International  Recommendations for the Document Object Model  from W3C  Additional publications provide definitions of other essential technologies for the World Wide Web  including  but not limited to  the following  Uniform Resource Identifier  URI   which is a universal system for referencing resources on the Internet  such as hypertext documents and images  URIs  often called URLs  are defined by the IETF s RFC 3986   STD 66  Uniform Resource Identifier  URI   Generic Syntax  as well as its predecessors and numerous URI scheme defining RFCs  HyperText Transfer Protocol  HTTP   especially as defined by RFC 2616  HTTP 1 1 and RFC 2617  HTTP Authentication  which specify how the browser and server authenticate each other   edit  Accessibility Main article  Web accessibility Access to the Web is for everyone regardless of disability including visual  auditory  physical  speech  cognitive  and neurological  Accessibility features also help others with temporary disabilities like a broken arm or the aging population as their abilities change  65  The Web is used for receiving information as well as providing information and interacting with society  making it essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities  66  Tim Berners Lee once noted   The power of the Web is in its universality  Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect   65  Many countries regulate web accessibility as a requirement for websites  67  International cooperation in the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative led to simple guidelines that web content authors as well as software developers can use to make the Web accessible to persons who may or may not be using assistive technology  65  68   edit  Internationalization The W3C Internationalization Activity assures that web technology will work in all languages  scripts  and cultures  69  Beginning in 2004 or 2005  Unicode gained ground and eventually in December 2007 surpassed both ASCII and Western European as the Web s most frequently used character encoding  70  Originally RFC 3986 allowed resources to be identified by URI in a subset of US ASCII  RFC 3987 allows more characters any character in the Universal Character Set and now a resource can be identified by IRI in any language  71   edit  Statistics Between 2005 and 2010  the number of Web users doubled  and was expected to surpass two billion in 2010  72  Early studies in 1998 and 1999 estimating the size of the web using capture recapture methods showed that the much of the web was not indexed by search engines and the web was much larger than expected  73  74   According to a 2001 study  there were a massive number  over 550 billion  of documents on the Web  mostly in the invisible Web  or Deep Web  75  A 2002 survey of 2 024 million Web pages 76  determined that by far the most Web content was in English  56 4   next were pages in German  7 7    French  5 6    and Japanese  4 9    A more recent study  which used Web searches in 75 different languages to sample the Web  determined that there were over 11 5 billion Web pages in the publicly indexable Web as of the end of January 2005  77  As of March 2009 update   the indexable web contains at least 25 21 billion pages  78  On July 25  2008  Google software engineers Jesse Alpert and Nissan Hajaj announced that Google Search had discovered one trillion unique URLs  79  As of May 2009 update   over 109 5 million domains operated  80  not in citation given  Of these 74  were commercial or other sites operating in the  com generic top level domain  80  Statistics measuring a website s popularity are usually based either on the number of page views or on associated server  hits   file requests  that it receives   edit  Speed issues Frustration over congestion issues in the Internet infrastructure and the high latency that results in slow browsing has led to a pejorative name for the World Wide Web  the World Wide Wait  81  Speeding up the Internet is an ongoing discussion over the use of peering and QoS technologies  Other solutions to reduce the congestion can be found at W3C  82 Guidelines for Web response times are  83  0 1 second  one tenth of a second   Ideal response time  The user does not sense any interruption  1 second  Highest acceptable response time  Download times above 1 second interrupt the user experience  10 seconds  Unacceptable response time  The user experience is interrupted and the user is likely to leave the site or system   edit  Caching If a user revisits a Web page after only a short interval  the page data may not need to be re obtained from the source Web server  Almost all web browsers cache recently obtained data  usually on the local hard drive  HTTP requests sent by a browser will usually ask only for data that has changed since the last download  If the locally cached data are still current  it will be reused  Caching helps reduce the amount of Web traffic on the Internet  The decision about expiration is made independently for each downloaded file  whether image  stylesheet  JavaScript  HTML  or whatever other content the site may provide  Thus even on sites with highly dynamic content  many of the basic resources need to be refreshed only occasionally  Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site wide files so that they can be cached efficiently  This helps reduce page download times and lowers demands on the Web server  There are other components of the Internet that can cache Web content  Corporate and academic firewalls often cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of all   See also Caching proxy server   Some search engines also store cached content from websites  Apart from the facilities built into Web servers that can determine when files have been updated and so need to be re sent  designers of dynamically generated Web pages can control the HTTP headers sent back to requesting users  so that transient or sensitive pages are not cached  Internet banking and news sites frequently use this facility  Data requested with an HTTP  GET  is likely to be cached if other conditions are met  data obtained in response to a  POST  is assumed to depend on the data that was POSTed and so is not cached   edit  See also Internet portal Electronic
