edit  Cast Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker   Spider Man 6  Garfield described Peter Parker as somebody he can relate to while also claiming him as an important symbol to him since he was four years old  7  8  9  Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role  revealing   I was thinking of my history and thinking of the kid at school who I wasn t as strong as  who behaved badly to a lot of people   including myself   and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to   10  He said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider Man he  was blown away by his interpretation   10  After taking the role Garfield studied spiders  movements and tried to incorporate them as much as he could  saying Parker is  a boy spider in terms of how he moves  and not just in the suit   11  On taking over the role Garfield said   I see it as a massive challenge in many ways     To make it authentic  To make the character live and breathe in a new way  The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character  I do  as well  I m probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself  But I have to let that go  No turning back  And I wouldn t want to   12  When first wearing the Spider Man costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine  a better actor in the suit   13  Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy A high school classmate and love interest of Peter Parker  14  Stone described her character as  a daddy s girl   15  Stone dyed her hair blonde for the role of the character  which happens to be her natural hair color even though she is better recognized with her red hair  16  17  She felt that she had a responsibility to educate herself on Spider Man  admitting that she did not know much about the character beyond the Raimi films  After her role she expressed interest in Spider Man  the character she played and the rest of the Marvel Universe that she was going to be involved with  18  Stone also had this to say about the fans who would be protective of Spider Man and the character she plays   There s a part of me that really wants to please people that love Spider Man or Gwen Stacy and want her to be done justice  I hope they ll give me license to interpret her my way  But that fan base  I m one of them  so I completely understand why they would be judgmental of certain things   17  Rhys Ifans as Dr  Curt Connors   The Lizard 19  20  Ifans described the character that he is playing not as an evil incarnated villain but as a flawed character much like Dr  Jekyll and Mr Hyde  21   Curt Conners is by no means an evil villain   Ifans stated   He s not like the Batman villains  like the Joker  who are the embodiment of evil  Curtis Connors is a great man who makes a bad decision       T hat s the whole magic of the Spider Man idea  These people are the embodiment of our flaws and our desires that lead to tragedy   22  In a September  2011 interview  Ifans claimed that his character spends the majority of the film as a human  While filming for the 9 foot tall Lizard  Ifans was required to wear a CGI suit  Initially  a large stunt double was used as a stand in for the role  but Ifans insisted on portraying the transformed character  to which Webb agreed  Commenting on the technology used to bring his character to life  Ifans continued  I had a green suit on  and then this cardboard head  and these big claws    Each and every time you see the Lizard  the technology is so advanced now that when the Lizard s eyes move  they re my eyes  If I frown or show any emotion  they re my emotions  That s how spectacularly advanced technology is   23  Ifans also said that he voiced the Lizard as well explaining   I m sure the voice will be toyed with in the eventual edits  but when I was shooting the CGI moments  when I wasn t actually human  when I was Lizard  I looked like a crash test dummy in a green leotard thing  There were many moments when I had to speak to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as the Lizard   24  Martin Sheen as Ben Parker Peter Parker s uncle  25  Sheen admitted that he didn t have a clue of Spider Man other than watching Tobey Maguire s portrayal in Spider Man 2  He also didn t know much about the character that he played except for knowing that Cliff Robertson previously played the part  26  Martin Sheen described his character as being a surrogate father saying   I m dealing with this adolescent who is having problems with changes  with hormones changing and his getting out of hand  I have to give him the marching orders and so forth   27  Sally Field as May Parker Ben Parker s wife  and Peter Parker s aunt  28  29  Denis Leary as Captain George Stacy Gwen s father and a New York City Police Department captain  30  Leary explained that he did not know much about Spider Man in the comics explaining   I m more of a Batman guy  Not the  60s   but the really dark Batman  But my wife was a Spider Man nut  which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones   Another thing he liked to note that before he was ever cast as George Stacy his good friend  Jeff Garlin  who happens to be a Spider Man fan said to him   The first time I met you  I thought you were George Stacy   31  Chris Zylka as Flash Thompson Zylka first tweeted that he was involved with the film  32  On November 2010  he was revealed to be playing Flash Thompson  33  When asked what it was like to play Flash Thompson he answered   You just try to focus  As an artist or as an actor  you just try to focus and stay in that world and block it all out   He also continued that he enjoyed working with Marc complimenting his work as director describing him as comforting and calm  34  Irrfan Khan as Dr  Ratha 3  35  Khan described his role as a  pivotal role   Khan also said that he got his role after appearing in the drama tv series In Treatment  He said that Marc Webb has seen his work and approaching him saying he wants to work with Khan  36  37  Khan admitted though that he wasn t really interested in the project at first but that both of his sons were excited about it and insisted that he go  38 The Hollywood Reporter originally reported Khan to play the comic book character  Van Adder  35  39  Campbell Scott and Julianne Nicholson were originally reported to play Peter s parents  Richard and Mary Parker  respectively  39 Embeth Davidtz later replaced Nicholson in the role  40 Annie Parisse was reported to play  the villain s wife   39 C  Thomas Howell portrays Ray  a construction worker whose son is saved by Spider Man  41 Hannah Marks portrays Missy Kallenback  an unpopular girl who has a crush on Peter Parker  42  Miles Elliot portrays Billy Connors  the son of Dr  Connors  20 Kelsey Chow has a small role as Sally Avril  a girl who goes to Peter Parker s high school  43  Unlike the original films it was reported that J  Jonah Jameson would not appear in this film  44 Spider Man co creator Stan Lee has a cameo appearance  as he did in the previous films  which will involve him in an action scene and which he referred to as his  best  most unusual one yet   45  At the 2011 Dallas Comic Con  Lee enthusiastically talked about his cameo  He will play a librarian listening to music on his headphones while stamping books and dancing at the same time  despite the on going fight between Spider Man and the Lizard  46   edit  Production  edit  Development Further information  Spider Man in film Simultaneous with the cancellation of Spider Man 4  Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that the franchise would be rebooted with a new director and new cast  The Amazing Spider Man is scheduled to be released on July 3  2012 in 3 D and focuses on Peter Parker developing his abilities in high school  47  48 Avi Arad  Laura Ziskin and Matt Tolmach  who were always involved with the franchise  continued on as producers of the film  47  Sony confirmed that Vanderbilt would write the script for the new film  Entertainment Weekly called Vanderbilt s script  gritty  contemporary  and referenced Batman Begins  Christopher Nolan s reboot of the Batman film series  which also reinvented the tone of the series  49 Alvin Sargent was then hired to fine tune the script  50  Webb  whose previous film  500  Days of Summer was his directorial debut  was confirmed to direct the reboot  51 Amy Pascal and Matt Tolmach of Sony Entertainment stated that  the key for us as we sought a new director was to identify filmmakers who could give sharp focus to Peter Parker s life  We wanted someone who could capture the awe of being in Peter s shoes so the audience could experience his sense of discovery while giving real heart to the emotion  anxiety  and recklessness of that age and coupling all of that with the adrenaline of Spider Man s adventure  We believe Marc Webb is the perfect choice to bring us on that journey   51  Webb stated that he was first hesitant about directing the film but then he said to himself  How could I walk away from this  What an opportunity  What better cinematic character is there than Spidey   52  Webb commented on comparisons of his and Sam Raimi s work as director of a Spider Man film  Sam Raimi s virtuoso rendering of Spider Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon  The first three films are beloved for good reason  But I think the Spider Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well  I am signing on not to  take over  from Sam  That would be impossible  Not to mention arrogant  I m here because there s an opportunity for ideas  stories  and histories that will add a new dimension  canvas  and creative voice to Spider Man  51   edit  Pre production Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone promoting the film at the San Diego Comic Con  In May 2010  The Hollywood Reporter said the actors who met with director Marc Webb to be considered for the lead role included Jamie Bell  Alden Ehrenreich  Frank Dillane  Andrew Garfield  and Josh Hutcherson  53  and in June 2010 the Los Angeles Times reported that the shortlist had expanded to include Aaron Johnson and Anton Yelchin  54  At least Bell  Ehrenreich  Garfield  Yelchin Logan Lerman and Michael Angarano had screen tests  55  On July 1  2010  it was confirmed that the role would go to Garfield  6  Webb felt that  he has a rare combination of intelligence  wit  and humanity   6  Garfield was 27 when being cast as Spider Man  which raised concerns about his ability to play a high school student  The website HitFix reported that Sony realized this and thus the new movie may instead focus on Peter s college life  56  this was disputed by Entertainment Weekly  which reported that the film is still set in high school  57  Sony held auditions for the role of a young Peter Parker  somebody who would resemble Garfield in looks  58  It was reported originally that the film would feature both Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy as love interests  57  but the website The Wrap later reported that only Gwen Stacy will appear in the film  59  In August 2010  the list of actresses to play the love interest included Imogen Poots  Ophelia Lovibond  Lily Collins  Teresa Palmer  and Emma Roberts  60  and in September 2010 Variety reported that the shortlist had expanded to include Stone and Mia Wasikowska  61  The shortlist was reported to then include Dianna Agron  Georgina Haig  and Dominique McElligott  62  On October 5  2010  it was confirmed that the role of Gwen Stacy would go to Stone  14  Tolmach said that her on screen spark is perfect for the role  Webb also said that the chemistry between Emma and Garfield is what made her the clear choice   At the heart of the story of Peter Parker is not only the amazing Spider Man  but also an ordinary teenager who is wondering what he has to do to get the girl  Andrew and Emma will bring everything audiences expect to these roles  but also make them their own  14  Ifans promoting the film at San Diego  Reportedly Sony was interested in casting Christoph Waltz as the villain of the film  63  however Waltz s representatives denied his involvement  64 Michael Fassbender was even linked to the villain role before signing on to play Magneto in X Men  First Class  65  On October 11  2010  Rhys Ifans was confirmed to be the unnamed villain in the film  19  On October 13  2010  it was reported that Ifans will be playing Dr  Curt Connors  a k a  the Lizard  66  The producer Avi Arad has admitted to Empire interviewers that the Lizard is his favorite Spider Man villain and that he has always wanted to do the Lizard as the villain of the film and that it was a dream come true that he was the chosen villain  18  Long before the villain was commited to the script  Avi already had conceptual drawings prepared for the Lizard to be the villain  18  Webb explains why he s the best villain for the film   He s the literal embodiment of the theme of the movie  which is we all have a missing piece  He has no arm  Peter has no parents  and he fills that void with Spider Man  Curt is not as strong as Spider Man on the inside  but he wants to get back his arm and fill that void  and essentially he becomes a big bully   67  Steve Kloves  a screenwriter that was commonly involved with the Harry Potter film series and who originally turned down the role  decided to be involved with tuning up the script with Sargent since he knew Sargent and the producer Ziskin  who died during the production of the film  and would decide to do them a favor at making the film good just like they wanted  He also wanted to write for Stone  Steve mostly focused on character and dialogue concentrating on Emma s character as Gwen Stacy and some of Garfield s character as well  68   edit  Filming Marc Webb hosting the film at the San Diego Comic Con  The film began shooting on December 6  2010 in Los Angeles  69  70  The 90 day film shoot also includes two weeks in New York City  while the bulk of filming occurred in and around Los Angeles  including such locations as the Henry Fonda Theater in Hollywood  St  John Bosco High School s Gym  Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Mid Wilshire  and various locations around South Pasadena  San Pedro  and Woodland Hills  71  Sony Entertainment spokesman Steve Elzer says  this is the fourth Spider Man production we have shot primarily in Los Angeles and for good reason  the crews here are the best in the world but there is a comfort level in producing a project of this size and scope on your own backlot   He continued   Basing the film on the lot also makes it easier for producers to interact with Sony s in house visual effects team  and gives the studios greater control of quality and security   71  When you walk out of the theater  I want the world you see to resemble what you saw on the screen  Part of the joy of cinema  is that  you make the impossible look real  I wanted it to be more grounded and more realistic and that went for the emotion of the scenes  the physical action and wardrobe  It s less based in Steve Ditko world and probably closer visually and more influenced by  Ultimate Spider Man  but it is also very much a world of our own devising  Marc Webb in a interview with the Los Angeles Times  72  The film will also be the first Hollywood production to be filmed with the RED Epic camera  and is being shot in 3 D at 5K resolution  70  Cinematographer  John Schwartzman had this to say about the camera   Today was Epic  Monday December 6 marks the first day the Red Epic camera was used to shoot a major studio motion picture  I can say for certainty the camera does exist and boy is it ready for primetime  as a matter of fact it s a true game changer   70  Schwartzman also felt that the 3D of the film would have been more impossible without it  He said  I can tell you without these cameras it would be impossible to move a 3D rig in the ways that THIS story demands  if Jim and the crew hadn t made these cameras available to us I don t think we could have shot this movie the way our director envisioned it in 3D   70  The stunt performers of the film included the Armstrong family  72 Vic Armstrong 73  and Andy Armstrong  74  Garfield was reported to be involved with some of the stunts as well  The actor was even reported to have a tissue in his nose suffering a nosebleed from his swinging in New York City  75  While filming in New York the crew built a whole rig hundreds of feet long over Riverside Drive in Harlem  While there they swung a man through traffic down the street  Andy Armstrong built a car rig with a series of wires to help with effects which required an incredible wealth of acrobatics  74  Webb feels a responsibility to reinvent Spider Man on the big screen stating that he and the crew tried to keep the stunts more grounded physically which he said was a huge challenge for a film that stars a character whose abilities are superhuman  72  The crew spent many months developing rigs so he could swing in a way that wasn t computer generated  72  Webb stated   Obviously there s going to be enhancements and CG  sequences   but it s based in a physical reality and that s a new technique  for this film brand    72  One of the biggest changes of the franchise to reinvent the hero for the film was to go back to the original source material in the mainstream comics of Spider Man having artificial web shooters  76  Webb stated   the web shooters were able to dramatize Peter s intellect   Webb explained   We paid attention to the question of  How would a kid make it   And obviously we took some license with it   76  Webb explained that he and the crew  wanted a design that would make the body longer and more lithe  more of an acrobat  someone incredibly agile  and the legs of the spider  symbol on the chest  were something we used to emphasize that   76  He also explained that the crew made a bunch of different suits for different lighting conditions even using something that would work in the night a little better  76  They also paid attention to making the webbing on the costume a little bit darker  76  Webb confessed   With the costume and the web shooters we wanted to emphasize that these are things that Peter Parker made and that he is special himself even if he feels like he s an outsider   76  In 2011  actor and stuntman Richard Norton  who had a four week role playing a SWAT team member  told a journalist that the film was  a  220 million budget movie   77   edit  Post production On April 2011  Stone revealed that cinematography had wrapped and that post production began in May although some reshooting took place in New York City in November 2011 and in Los Angeles in December 2011  78  79  80  Webb explained that he wanted to create a new 3D experience for Spider Man   Because we re shooting in 3D  I wanted to conceive of certain things very specifically for 3D  There s an experimental component to 3D that s fascinating and we re experimenting with generating that point of view   so you feel what Peter Parker feels  you feel what Spider Man feels when he s jumping over buildings and over the streets  that sort of thing  But we made a very  and Andrew had to pay the price for this  very conscious effort to ground stunts    74  He felt that if there ever should be a 3D film it should be about Spider Man   When we first talked about it  it was in the heyday of 3D and there was a lot of craziness about it  But it was never forced upon us  I thought if there s ever a movie that should be in 3D  it s Spider Man for crying out loud    81  Webb elaborated that he shot the film in stereo so it was native 3D while nothing was ever converted  Webb felt that when you get that scope  the film will gradually expand  81  In February 2012  the film was reported to be getting a digital touch up in Vancouver by Sony Pictures Imageworks  82   edit  Marketing Hard Rock Hotel in San Diego promoting the film for Comic con  In February 2011  after the launch of the official website and the title of the film  the first official image of Garfield as Spider Man was originally revealed in the website  83  Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times agreed  that the suit lives up to the challenge of being different from the Sam Raimi films but not too different from the classic suit that stands as one of the great comic book costumes ever   He was also skeptical with the introduction with the web shooters of the film feeling that it s too hard to believe that a financially strapped young man to conceive a wrist worn device that can instantly produce a strand of synthetic webbing  84  A teaser trailer was leaked on the Internet and aired at San Diego s Comic Con International in July 2011  attached to the superhero film Captain America  The First Avenger  85  Rob Keyes of Screen Rant felt that  it takes on a noticeably different tone from that of Raimi trilogy of Spider Man movies  and presents itself in a similar fashion to what Christopher Nolan did with Batman Begins   86  Germain Lussier of  Film felt that the trailer makes it feel like a small film when judging with all the leaked photos of filming going on that it is going to be a big film  He commented that the trailer makes it look more like  a superhero Twilight   He states that  this is a big action movie with massive practical effects all shot in painstaking 3D with a hefty price tag  This trailer really doesn t sell that   87  Some writers have observed that the trailer closely resembles the 2008 video game Mirror s Edge  when Spider Man is running along the rooftops and swinging in the city in a point of view shot  88  89  90  Also revealed at the Comic Con was the first display of a Spider Man action figure by Hasbro and also a first look of a Spider Man and Lizard PEZ dispenser with the first look of the Lizard  91  92  Soon after the leak of the Lizard in PEZ dispenser and the unconfirmed concept art of the Lizard  the reaction of the Lizard designs was reported to be mixed with many news writers comparing the design of the character to other fictional characters instead of looking like the character from the comic books  93  94  95  96  Mega Brands has obtained the rights to produce construction sets based on the film  97  98  A Marvel Select action figure of the film version of Spider Man with building wall base by Diamond Select Toys has been announced  Being the fifth Marvel Select Spider Man figure  but the first based on a film  99  A  sneak peek screening  of The Amazing Spider Man was held on February 6  2012 in 13 cities internationally  Berlin  London  Los Angeles  Madrid  Mexico City  Moscow  New York City  Paris  Rio de Janeiro  Rome  Seoul  Sydney  and Tokyo  100  On January 8  2012  the Spider Man logo has also appeared on some of the world s most iconic buildings such as the Sydney Opera House  the Colosseum of Rome  the Kremlin in Moscow and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris  101  102  The screening revealed a second trailer for the film screened in 3D  which thereafter appeared online  Glen Levy of Time magazine said of this trailer that the  dialogue goes hand in hand with the action  rather than be dominated by it   and that the action scenes from the film looked  polished and slick   103  Additionally in the special screening there was a eight and a half minute extended trailer which Webb walked the fans to  104  Peter Sciretta of  Film said the trailers had left him  impressed  and had captured a feeling of dark naturalism alongside Spider Man s trademark wisecracking  105  With the trailer and sizzle reel Webb felt that it was important to give the audience a more specific idea of what the film would look like such as showcasing Peter and Gwen s relationship along with showcasing a lot of the visual effects just to display the attitude of the film that he and the crew were trying to create  106  on February 7  2012 it was reported that the latest official trailer revealed a link of a viral marketing internet site for the film  107   edit  Video game Main article  The Amazing Spider Man  2012 video game  A video game based on the film was announced at the 2011 New York Comic Con  The game will be developed by
