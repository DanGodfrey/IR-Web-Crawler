United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject  Please improve this article and discuss the issue on the talk page   December 2010  In broadcasting  syndication is the sale of the right to broadcast radio shows and television shows by multiple radio stations and television stations  without going through a broadcast network  though the process of syndication may conjure up structures like those of a network itself  by its very nature  It is common in countries where broadcast programming is scheduled by television networks with local independent affiliates  particularly in the United States  In the rest of the world  however  most countries have centralized networks and or TV stations without local affiliates and syndication is less common  although shows can also be syndicated internationally  In the film industry  film distribution is handled by film distributors  Contents 1 Types of syndication 2 First run syndication in the U S  2 1 The 1970s and 1980s 2 1 1

least first so offered in a given country  programs originally created and broadcast outside of the United States  first presented on a network in their country of origin  have often been syndicated in the U S  and in some other countries   Off network syndication involves the sale of a program that was originally run on network television or in some cases first run syndication  a rerun  Public broadcasting syndication has arisen in the U S  as a parallel service to stations in the Public Broadcasting Service  PBS  and the handful of independent public broadcasting stations  When syndicating a show  the production company  or a distribution company or  syndicator   usually attempts to sell the show to one station in each media market or area  in the country and around the world  If successful  this can be lucrative  but the syndicator may only be able to sell the show in a small percentage of the markets  Syndication differs from selling the show to a television network  once a network picks up a show  it is usually guaranteed to run on most or all the network s affiliates  on the same day of the week and at the same time  in a given timezone  in countries where this is a concern   Some production companies create their shows and sell them to networks at a loss  at least at first  hoping that the series will succeed and that eventual off network syndication will turn a profit for the show  citation needed  A syndicated program is sold to stations for  cash   the stations purchase rights to insert some or all of the ads at their level   given to stations for access to airtime  wherein the syndicators get the ad revenue   or the combination of both  The trade of program for airtime is called  barter   While market penetration can vary widely and revenues can be unreliable  the producers often enjoy more content freedom in the absence of network standards and practice officials  frequently  some innovative ideas are explored by first run syndicated programming  which the networks are leery of giving airtime to  Meanwhile  top rated syndicated shows in the United States usually have a domestic market reach of 98   Very often  series that are aired in syndication are cut  For example a standard American sitcom runs twenty two minutes  but in syndication it may be cut back to twenty minutes to make room for more commercials  Syndication can take the form of either weekly or daily syndication  The game shows  some  tabloid  and entertainment news shows  and stripped talk shows are broadcast daily or week daily  while most other first run syndicated shows are broadcast weekly   edit  First run syndication in the U S  As with radio in the U S   television networks  particularly in their early years  did not offer a full day s worth of programming for their affiliates  even in the evening or  prime time  hours  Some stations were not affiliated with any network  Both groups sought to supplement their locally produced programming and whatever network feeds there were with content that could be flexibly scheduled  The development of videotape and  much later  enhanced satellite downlink access furthered these options  While most past first run syndicated shows were shown only in syndication  some canceled network shows continued to be produced for first run syndication or were revived for syndication several years after their original cancellation  Ziv Television Programs  Inc   after establishing itself as a major radio syndicator  was the first major first run television syndicator  creating several long lived series in the 1950s and selling them directly to regional sponsors  who in turn sold the shows to local stations  Among the most famous and widely watched Ziv offerings were Sea Hunt and Highway Patrol  Some first run syndicated series were picked up by networks in the 1950s and early  60s  notably The Adventures of Superman and Mr  Ed  The networks started syndicating their reruns in the late 1950s  and first run syndication shrank sharply  for a decade  Some stalwart series continued  notably Death Valley Days  other ambitious projects were also to flourish  however briefly  such as The Play of the Week  1959 1961   produced by David Susskind  of the syndicated talk show Open End and also producer of such network fare as NYPD   However  FCC rulings in the late 1960s curtailed the U S  networks  ability to schedule programming in what has become known as the  early fringe   notably the 7 8pm  ET PT  hour of  prime time   with the stated hope that this might encourage more local programming of social and cultural relevance to communities  off network syndie repeats were also banned   some projects of this sort came to fruition  though usually relatively commercial and slick ones such as the Group W Evening Magazine PM Magazine franchise  and such pre existing national projects as the brief commercial television run of William F  Buckley  Jr  s interview debate series Firing Line  The more obvious result was an increase in Canadian produced syndicated dramatic series  such as Dusty s Trail and the Colgate sponsored Dr  Simon Locke  Game shows  often evening editions of network afternoon series  flourished  and a few odd items such as Wild Kingdom  cancelled by NBC in 1971  had a continuing life as syndicated programming tailor made for the early fringe   edit  The 1970s and 1980s Into the 1970s  first run syndication continued to be an odd mix  cheaply produced  but not always poor quality   filler  programming  These included the dance music show Soul Train  and 20th Century Fox s That s Hollywood  a television variation on the popular That s Entertainment  theatrically released collections of film clips from the MGM library  There were also many imported programs distributed this way  These include the documentary series Wild  Wild World of Animals  repackaged by Time Life with narration by William Conrad  and Thames Television s sober and necessarily grim The World at War  The Starlost  1973  was a Canadian series  apparently modified from the vision of science fiction writers Harlan Ellison and Ben Bova  UFO  1970  and Space  1999  1975  came from British producer Gerry Anderson and his partner Lew Grade  previously best known for Supermarionation  puppet animation  series such as Thunderbirds  The most successful syndicated show in the US in the 1970s was probably The Muppet Show  also from Lew Grade  Game shows thrived in syndication in the decade  Five day a week versions of What s My Line  and To Tell the Truth premiered in the late  60s and found loyal audiences until 1975 and 1978  respectively  Several daytime network games began producing once a week night time versions for the early evening hours  usually with bigger prizes and often featuring different hosts  emcees were limited to appearing on one network and one syndicated game simultaneously  and modified titles  Match Game PM  The  100 000 Name That Tune or The  25 000 Pyramid  for example   Of these shows  Let s Make a Deal and Hollywood Squares were the first to jump to twice a week syndicated versions around 1973  Another popular daytime show to have a weekly syndicated version was The Price Is Right hosted at first by Dennis James and later by daytime host Bob Barker  The night time version of Family Feud  1977  quickly jumped from once weekly to twice  and finally to five days a week  and its massive popularity  along with that of new five a day entries like Jack Barry s The Joker s Wild  1977  and Tic Tac Dough  1978  and Chuck Barris s increasingly raunchy remakes of his  60s hits The Newlywed Game and The Dating Game  brought an end  with rare exceptions  to the era of once a week games  Also popular in first run syndication and daytime was The Gong Show  hosted by Barris throughout most of its run  Wait Till Your Father Gets Home  1973  was a Hanna Barbera cartoon series attempting to ape the All in the Family style sitcoms  Skippy the Bush Kangaroo  1969  was an Australian children s series in the manner of Flipper or Gentle Ben  a decade later  the decidedly not for children Australian Prisoner  Cell Block H would have a brief US syndicated run   and a Canadian sketch comedy series began appearing on U S  television stations in 1977 Second City Television would eventually find a home  for two seasons  on NBC  as SCTV Network 90  and on cable station Cinemax later   The Universal   Paramount produced package of original programming  Operation Prime Time  began appearing on ad hoc quasi networks of  almost by necessity  non network stations in the U S  in 1978  with a mini series adaptation of John Jakes s The Bastard  From the latter  60s into the late  70s  Westinghouse also found considerable success with The Mike Douglas Show  a variety talk show hosted by a singer with an easygoing interview style  which played in afternoons in most markets  similar programs soon followed featuring Merv Griffin  who had been the host of CBS s most sustained late night answer to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson previously  and another network veteran  Dinah Shore  Also notable was the growing success of audience participation talk shows  particularly that of the innovator of the format  Phil Donahue  First run syndication in the 1970s also made it possible for some shows no longer wanted by network television to remain on the air  In 1971  ABC cancelled The Lawrence Welk Show  which went on to produce new episodes in syndication for another 11 years  and currently continues to much success in weekend reruns  with new segments featuring Welk cast members inserted within the episodes  distributed to PBS stations by the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority  Also in 1971  CBS dropped Lassie and Hee Haw  the latter show s run ending as part of the network s cancellation of all of its rural oriented shows  see The Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres   Lassie entered first run syndication for two years  while Hee Haw continued to produce new episodes until 1992  Throughout the mid to late 1980s  sitcoms continued to enter first run syndication after being canceled by the networks  the most successful of which were Mama s Family and Charles In Charge  Other sitcoms during this time to enter first run syndication after network cancellation included Silver Spoons  Punky Brewster  Webster  It s a Living  Too Close for Comfort  9 to 5 and What s Happening    retitled as What s Happening Now     Many of these sitcoms produced new shows in syndication mainly to have enough episodes for a profitable run in rerun syndication  Other sitcoms  such as Small Wonder  enjoyed success in syndication throughout the entire run   edit  Dramatic first run syndicated programs The broadcast networks aired many action adventure programs from the 1950s to the 1980s  By the late 1980s  however  increasing production costs made them less attractive to the networks  Studios found that reruns of one hour dramas did not sell as well as sitcoms  so were unable to fully recoup the shows  costs using the traditional deficit financing model  1  Such shows instead moved to syndication  starting with Star Trek  The Next Generation  which debuted in 1987 and became one of the most watched syndicated shows throughout its seven year run  Its great success caused many others to appear  by 1994 there were more than 20 one hour syndicated shows  2 Friday the 13th  The Series  a horror series which shared its title with the successful movie franchise  also debuted in 1987  The next syndicated shows that debuted in 1988 were War of the Worlds and Freddy s Nightmares  Baywatch  which debuted in 1989 on NBC and was cancelled after one season also became one of the most watched syndicated shows throughout its ten year run  garnering a worldwide audience  Another series to be one of the few shows to nearly match Baywatch would be the television series Renegade  Star Trek  Deep Space Nine was also syndicated  Hercules  The Legendary Journeys and its spin off series Xena  Warrior Princess helped build the audiences for such shows  Babylon 5 and Forever Knight drew devoted  cult  audiences  Psi Factor and Poltergeist  The Legacy attempted to draw on the audience for the FOX series The X Files  as did  even less probably  the short lived spinoff Baywatch Nights   Among the other series were Relic Hunter and VIP  She Spies and Once a Thief  In 1997  Earth  Final Conflict  based on ideas from Gene Roddenberry  premiered in syndication  Three years later  a second Gene Roddenberry series  Andromeda also premiered in syndication  In 2008  Disney ABC Domestic Television and ABC Studios teamed up with Sam Raimi to launch a new first run syndicated TV series Legend of the Seeker  based on Terry Goodkind s Sword of Truth novel series  Shows featuring competition in one form or another  such as Star Search and American Gladiators  also enjoyed popularity in syndication around this time   edit  Animated series Main articles  List of animated series created for syndication and Weekday cartoon In the 1980s  independent stations signed on in medium and many small markets  The market for made for television cartoons grew as a result to include a branch for such stations  It usually had a greater artistic freedom  and looser standards  not mandated by a network   The older Bugs Bunny and Popeye cartoons made way for first run syndicated cartoons such as He Man and the Masters of the Universe  Rambo  The Force of Freedom  ThunderCats  Dennis the Menace  My Little Pony  The Transformers  G I  Joe  Voltron  and reruns of Scooby Doo  Garfield and Friends  and The Pink Panther  among many others  In 1987  The Walt Disney Company tried its luck at syndication  DuckTales went on the air that September and lasted 100 episodes  The success of DuckTales paved the way for a second series two years later  Chip  n Dale Rescue Rangers  The following year  the two shows aired together under the umbrella title The Disney Afternoon  In 1991  Disney added another hour  the block aired in syndication until 1999  These cartoons initially competed with the nationally broadcast ones  In the  80s  National TV only aired Saturday mornings  not competing with the weekday and Sunday blocks of syndication aired by local independent stations but  however  by the  90s  Fox and then WB started airing weekday afternoon blocks  By the end of the  90s both syndicated and national TV ended up losing most of its children s market to the rise of cable TV channels like Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network which provided appealing children s entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours   edit  News programming and late night talk shows Also in the 1980s  news programming of various sorts began to be offered widely to stations  Independent Network News  which was produced at WPIX studios in New York City  was a half hour weekdaily program that ran for several years on independent stations  CNN would offer a package of its Headline News to broadcast stations later  though it was used mainly to fill overnight time periods and was effectively discontinued in syndication with the 2006 launch of their  Prime  talk show block  Entertainment Tonight began its long and continuing run as a  soft  news daily strip  with a number of imitations following  and  tabloid  television  in the wake of ABC s 20 20 and  more immediately  FOX s A Current Affair  would become a syndication staple with such series as Extra and Real TV  Another area where network dominance was challenged by syndicated programming in the 1980s was in late night talk shows  The Arsenio Hall Show was the only very successful one  but Alan Thicke s earlier short lived Thicke of the Night  Lauren Hutton s innovatively shot Lauren Hutton and     and Dennis Miller  Whoopi Goldberg  David Brenner and Keenan Ivory Wayans attempted similar programs  Magic Johnson s The Magic Hour was seen as a massive flop  The popularity of syndicated talk shows fell dramatically in the mid 1990s as network and cable offerings expanded in the wake of Johnny Carson s retirement   edit  Reality and live action children s shows As UPN and the WB began offering their affiliates ever more nights of prime time programming  less call has been felt for first run drama  at least  in the U S   much as with the closing of windows that provided opportunity for Ziv in the  50s and various producers in the early  70s  The more expensive dramatic projects are less attractive to syndicators  particularly when they might be sold  with somewhat less risk  to cable channels    reality  series such as Cheaters and Maximum Exposure and several series about dating stunts began to be more common in the early 2000s  Some of the more low key programs in this category were designed to appeal to children  such as Beakman s World  Animal Rescue and Jack Hanna s Animal Adventures  They were able to get significant clearance because of stricter Federal Communications Commission  FCC  enforcement of rules on children s television series programming   edit  Game shows Several game shows are currently syndicated  the most popular by far are Wheel of Fortune and the late version of Jeopardy   both created by television personality Merv Griffin  premiering in 1983 and 1984 respectively  The shows have been 1 2 or 1 3 in the syndication ratings consistently since at least the late 1980s  In fact  according to the Guinness Book of World Records  Wheel is the most popular syndicated television program not only in the United States  but worldwide as well  Family Feud ended its first syndication run in 1985  a revival was a moderate hit from 1988 to 1995 and still another revival has been airing since 1999  A Hollywood Squares revival also thrived beginning in 1998  running six seasons until its 2004 cancellation  By far the most successful entry into the market in the 2000s has been the daily version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire  premiering in 2002  Because game shows are very inexpensive to produce  with many episodes completed each day of production  successful ones are very profitable  for example  in 1988 Jeopardy  cost an estimated  5 million to produce but earned almost  50 million in revenue  3  New game show concepts  that is  not based on an existing or pre existing format  are rarely tried and usually unsuccessful in syndication  Street Smarts was somewhat of an exception  Between 2003 and 2007  no new games debuted in syndication  marking four consecutive seasons where no new game show debuted  a syndication first  The Fall 2007 debuts of Temptation and Merv Griffin s Crosswords helped stop that streak  bringing the daytime tally to six game shows  both ended production after one year  though Crosswords aired in reruns during the 2008 09 season before those reruns moved exclusively to cable  More new shows were added for Fall 2008  including a daytime run of Deal or No Deal and an adaptation of the popular board game Trivial Pursuit  While Deal caught on and was renewed for the 2009 2010 season  Trivial Pursuit  America Plays suffered low ratings throughout its run and was canceled  For the 2009 2010 season  the Fox game show Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader  moved to syndication with a new  less expensive format  Don t Forget the Lyrics  will follow for 2010 2011  Deal  suffering from falling ratings  was canceled in February 2010  with the final episodes airing in late May of that same year  Reruns of the popular Discovery Channel show Cash Cab begain airing in syndication January 2011  The dating game show Baggage had a syndicated test run in early 2011   edit  Stripped talk shows The dominant form of first run syndication in the U S  for the last three decades has been the stripped talk show  such as Donahue  Oprah Winfrey  The Tyra Banks Show  and The Jerry Springer Show  As with game shows  talk shows are inexpensive to produce and very profitable if successful  3  In many markets  a stripped show will be seen twice daily  usually with different episodes  Sometimes  station groups with more than one station in a market  or a  duopoly   will run one episode of a strip on one of their stations in the morning  and the other available episode on another of their stations that night  Meanwhile  the popularity of some of the audience participation talk shows continues to encourage new participants  some of whom  such as Morton Downey  Jr  and Rosie O Donnell  have brief periods of impressive ratings and influence  others  such as Oprah Winfrey and Maury Povich  have a sustained run  A notable scheduling decision was made by KRON TV in San Francisco  A 2000 dispute with NBC led to their disaffiliation from that network after 52 years  and since all the other larger networks were already represented in San Francisco  KRON decided to become one of the largest market independent commercial stations on the VHF band in the U S   and soon tried running Dr  Phil  a popular new stripped series hosted by Winfrey associate Phil McGraw  in primetime  with impressive ratings results  While in earlier times  independent TV stations thrived on syndicated programming  including some venerable and quite profitable stations such as KMSP in the Minneapolis St  Paul market   with the loosening of FCC regulations and the creation of new additional TV networks  Fox  The CW  MyNetworkTV and ION Television   most of these independents have joined one or another of these or smaller  religious or low budget  networks  In another case  like those of KCAL in Los Angeles  KMCI of Lawrence  Kansas Kansas City and WMLW CA in Milwaukee  those independent stations are used to compliment their network affiliate sister station  KCBS  KSHB and WDJT  respectively  by allowing a duopoly control of more syndicated programming than would be possible on one station  and to spread it throughout the schedule of the two stations  often several times a day   or to air news programming in times unavailable on the larger network station  A duopoly of a network independent station also allows a network station to move a low rated syndicated program to their sister independent channel to stem revenue losses   edit  The 2000s Main article  First run syndication in the United States  2000s  edit  Off network syndication It is commonly said in the U S  industry that  syndication is where the real money is  when producing a TV show  In other words  while the initial run of any particular television series may theoretically lose money for its producing studio  the ensuing syndication will generate enough profit to balance out any losses  Off network syndication occurs when a network television show is syndicated in packages containing some or all episodes  and sold to as many television stations and markets as possible  In this manner  sitcoms are preferred and more successful because they are non Serial  and can be run non sequentially  which is more beneficial and less costly for the network  In the United States  local stations now rarely broadcast reruns of primetime dramas  instead  they usually air on basic cable channels  which may air each episode 30 to 60 times  4  Syndication has been known to spur the popularity of a series that only experienced moderate success during its original network run  The most notable example of this is Star Trek  which ran for three seasons on NBC from 1966 to 1969  but became a worldwide cult phenomenon after it entered off network syndication  Its success in syndication led to the Star Trek film series  Star Trek  The Next Generation  and several other series  5  91 92 Another example is The Brady Bunch  In recent years  more and more fee plugs have appeared during off network syndication non game shows  Some of these fees charged pay for the distribution and editing of these shows for syndication  while others pay for closed captioning and promotional consideration  In any event  the number of stations airing syndicated shows depends on which station in a particular market airs a particular show  Sometimes  how a program is acquired for syndication varies  In the case of shows syndicated by one company  stations loyal to the company generally have first choice on any program it offers  For other shows syndicated by other companies  the syndication rights may be auctioned off to the highest bidder in a particular market  It is common for long running series to have early seasons syndicated while the series itself is still in production  In order to differentiate between new and rebroadcast content  up until the 1980s it was not uncommon for series to be syndicated under a different title than originally broadcast  Examples include Bonanza  syndicated as Ponderosa   Gunsmoke  as Marshall Dillon   Emergency   as Emergency One   Happy Days  as Happy Days Again   etc  The rise in popularity of infomercials in the 1980s  1990s and into the 2000s has resulted in a marked decrease in the number of older off network syndicated series being aired by American and Canadian broadcasters  many of which now air paid programming such as infomercials during the weekend morning and afternoon or overnight hours  timeslots formerly occupied by old series reruns  children s programming  televised theatrical films  TV specials  documentaries  or holiday programs  A number of  classic television  channels for cable and for digital subchannels have cropped up in recent years to pick up the large number of series that either no longer have a life in syndication  most sitcoms  some older dramas  children s programming  or never did  game shows  sporting events    edit  Strip daily syndication Off network syndication can take several forms  The most common form is known as strip syndication or daily syndication  when episodes of a television series are shown daily five times a week  Typically  this means that enough episodes must exist  88 episodes  or four seasons  is the usual minimum  4  though many syndicators prefer a fully rounded 100 episodes  to allow for continual strip syndication to take place over the course of several months  without episodes being shown again  However  there are exceptions  such as the 65 episode block  common in children s programming   which allows for a 13 week cycle of daily showings  so there will only be four repeats in a year  In some cases  more than one episode is shown daily  Half hour sitcoms are sometimes syndicated in groups of two or four episodes  taking up one or two hours of broadcast time  If a series is not strip syndicated  it may be aired once a week  instead of five times a week  This allows shows with fewer episodes to last long in syndication  but it also may mean viewers will tire of waiting a week for the next episode of a show they have already seen and stop watching  More often  hourlong dramas in their first several runs in syndication are offered weekly  sitcoms are more likely to get stripped  In recent years there has been something of a trend toward showing two consecutive episodes of a program on Saturday and Sunday nights after prime time  generally following the local news   This pattern has been particularly prominent for shows which are still in production but have run long enough to have many episodes  As with commercial stations  not all the air time nor all the perceived audience are met by the productions offered U S  public broadcasting stations by PBS  additionally  there are some independent public stations in the U S  which take no programming from that  somewhat  decentralized network  As a result  there are several syndicators of programming for the non profit stations  several of which are descendants of the regional station groups which combined some  not all  of their functions into the creation of PBS in 1969  American Public Television  APT  is the largest of these  nearly matched by NETA  the National Educational Telecommunications Association  similarly  the recently defunct Continental Program Marketing was another of the syndicator descendants  of the Northeastern  Southeastern  and Rocky Mountain educational networks  respectively  of the pre PBS era  Among the other notable organizations in the U S  are Westlink Satellite Operations  based at Albuquerque s KNME   BBC Worldwide Americas  which often works with other distributors and individual stations  since it has no satellite access of its own in the U S    Deutsche Welle  Executive Program Services  the Program Resource Group and its member station WLIW  Long Island  NY s PBS station  which is  with the arguable exception of KNME  the most prolific contributor of any individual station of syndicated programming  most obviously the BBC World News  Doctor Who and Monty Python s Flying Circus in the U S   edit  Radio syndication Radio syndication generally works the same way as television syndication  except that radio stations usually are not organized into strict affiliate only networks  Radio networks generally are only distributors of radio shows  and individual stations  though often owned by large conglomerates  decide which shows to carry from a wide variety of networks and independent radio providers  As a result  radio networks such as Westwood One or Premiere Radio Networks  despite their influence in broadcasting  are not as recognized among the general public as television networks like CBS or ABC  Some examples of widely syndicated commercial broadcasting music programs include weekly countdowns like Rick Dees  Weekly Top 40  the American Top 40  American Country Countdown with Kix Brooks  Canada s Top 20 Countdown  the Canadian Hit 30 Countdown and the nightly program  Delilah  heard on many U S  stations  Syndication is particularly popular in talk radio  While syndicated music shows  with the exception of some evening and overnight shows such as Delilah mentioned above  tend to air once a week and mostly recorded  most popular talk radio programs are syndicated daily and live  Also  with relatively few 24 hour live talk radio networks  though this  in recent times  has been changing   most radio stations are free to assemble their own lineup of talk show hosts as they so choose  Examples of syndicated talk programs are Premiere Radio Networks  The Bob  amp  Tom Show  Westwood One s The Jim Bohannon Show  and Citadel Media s Imus in the Morning   More recently  talk networks such as Talk Radio Network have been marketing and packaging all day lineups  marking a departure from the syndication model  As such  popular shows such as The Savage Nation and Premiere s The Rush Limbaugh Show now air as part of a broader network lineup in many markets  particularly in Premiere owned and operated stations  though they continue to be syndicated to non network stations as well   Talk syndication tends to be more prevalent because voice tracking  a practice used by many music stations to have disc jockeys host multiple supposedly local shows at once  is not feasible with live talk radio  National Public Radio  Public Radio International  and American Public Media all sell programming to local public radio member stations in the U S   in contrast to true public radio networks like Canada s CBC  which owns all of its stations   The United States has strict anti propaganda laws that prohibit broadcasting government owned networks  such as Voice of America  to American audiences   Two independently produced  non commercial syndicated programs  heard on hundreds of community radio and indie radio stations  are Alternative Radio and Pacifica s Democracy Now   Some radio programs are also offered on a barter system usually at no charge to the radio station  The system is used for live programming or preproduced programs and include a mixture of ad time sold by the program producer as well as time set aside for the radio station to sell   edit  History Before radio networks matured in the United States  some early radio shows were reproduced on transcription disks and mailed to individual stations  An example of syndication using this method was RadiOzark Enterprises  Inc  based in Springfield  Missouri  co owned with KWTO  The Assembly of God  with national headquarters in Springfield  sponsored a half hour program on the station called Sermons in Song  RadiOzark began transcribing the show for other stations in the 1940s  and eventually 200 stations carried the program  The company later produced country music programs starring among others  Smiley Burnette  George Morgan  Bill Ring and Tennessee Ernie Ford  260 15 minute episodes of The Tennessee Ernie Show were distributed   and more than 1 200 U S  and Canadian stations aired the programs  6  Many syndicated radio programs were distributed through the US mail or other delivery service  although the medium changed as technology developed  going from transcription disks to phonograph records  tape recordings  cassette tapes and eventually CDs  Many smaller weekend programs still use this method to this day  though with the rise of the Internet  many stations have since opted to distribute programs via CD quality MP3s through FTP downloads  It was not until the advent of satellite communications in the 1980s that live syndication became popular  though it could be transmitted through network lines  it was not particularly common   Since then  most syndicated radio programs are distributed using satellite subcarrier audio technology  Shortly after satellite networks such as RKO  Transtar and SMN began  the Fairness Doctrine was repealed  which is credited with helping Rush Limbaugh become the first national talk radio superstar  At the same time  the FCC began issuing more FM radio licenses to suburban and rural areas in the late 1980s  which allowed more room for music stations on the FM dial  radio formats such as country music that were traditionally AM fixtures even after most pop and rock music moved to FM were now moving to FM as well  leaving much more room for talk formats on the AM dial  As the 1990s went on  Dr  Laura and Howard Stern began their national shows  rising to become national icons  The Telecommunications Act of 1996  which led to significant concentration of media ownership  facilitated the rapid deployment of both existing and new syndicated programs in the late 1990s  putting syndication on par with  and eventually surpassing  the network radio format  After the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks  syndicated talk radio saw a notably rapid rise in popularity  as networks rushed hosts such as Laura Ingraham  Bill O Reilly  Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck into syndication around this time  Syndicated radio is not as popular in other parts of the world  Canada has a few independently syndicated shows  but the bulk of syndicated content there comes from the United States  and the sum total of syndicated programming is far less than most American stations  as Canadian stations rely more heavily on local content  Most other countries still follow the network radio model   edit  International syndication Syndication also applies to international markets  Same language countries often syndicate programs to each other  such as programs from the United Kingdom being syndicated to Australia and vice versa  Another example would be programs from the United Kingdom  Mexico  Brazil  and Argentina being syndicated to local TV stations in the United States  and programs from the United States being syndicated elsewhere in the world  One of the best known internationally syndicated television series has been The Muppet Show  which was produced in the United Kingdom and shown on ITV  and appeared around the world  including the United States  where it aired in syndication  and Canada  where CBC Television aired the show  The 1970s was a time when many British comedies  including The Benny Hill Show and Monty Python s Flying Circus were syndicated to the United States and worldwide  Many soaps  and long running series are also successfully syndicated around the globe  The hit television show CSI earned  1 6 million per episode in its first round of cable syndication  There were many different versions of the show making it an international success  It was already popular in the U S   so becoming a success internationally as well as within the U S  made syndication sensible  Whether a series is produced in the U S  or not is based on the economic value and potential viability of its sales internationally with the possibility of syndication  7  Economic factors that influence production outside the U S  play a major role in deciding if a television show will be syndicated  internally and internationally  International syndication has sustained a growing of prosperity and monetary value amongst the distributors who sell to them  Due to a rise in competition  syndicators have upheld high standards for different countries to buy the rights to distribute shows  During the 1990s poor ratings were popular amongst syndicated shows  but distributors still made it possible for international competition to happen and buy U S  shows  8  Colombian  Brazilian  Mexican and Venezuelan telenovelas are programmed throughout the Portuguese and Spanish speaking world  and in many parts of India  China and Europe   edit  U S  style syndication internationally Because of the structural differences discussed above  there are presently very few areas where a true U S  style syndication model operates  whereby programs are sold on a per area basis  within a single country  to local or regional stations with differing  or no  network affiliations  Canada was historically one of the few exceptions  Until the mid 1990s  TV stations in Canada  like those in the U S   were typically run as separate local operations  with a small number of moderately sized ownership groups such as Baton  CanWest  WIC  and CHUM  Those stations that were affiliated with a national network  i e  CBC or CTV  did not always receive a full schedule of programming from that network  At this time  it was not uncommon for U S  syndicators to treat Canada as an extension of their domestic syndication operations  for both their first run and off network offerings  However  an alternate form of first run syndication was performed by some domestic broadcasters  as the Canadian rights to U S  primetime series were often acquired by individual station groups  as opposed to full fledged national networks   they would in turn resell local rights for those programs to stations in areas where they didn t operate  Since the late 1990s  as most stations have been consolidated into national networks consisting almost entirely of owned and operated stations and with full day network schedules  both types of syndication have largely disappeared from the Canadian broadcast landscape  Programs that are sold in syndication in the U S  are now generally sold to national Canadian networks to air across all their stations  with per market sales now being very rare  The Oprah Winfrey Show appears to have been the last significant holdout to this model  prior to its 2011 conclusion   having aired primarily on CTV stations  but in some markets airing instead on a Global station  and even some CBC affiliates   edit  Regional syndication There are three key reasons why a radio station will decide to pick up a syndicated show  unique and difficult to replicate content  ratings track record  and celebrity host  New developing radio programs are generally able to claim one of these attributes  but not all three  Regional syndication attempts to replace these benchmark attributes with other benefits that are generally recognized by the industry as also being important  Given the financial downturn within the industry  the need for quality cost effective locally relevant programming is greater than ever before  Programs that offer regionally specific content while providing the economic benefits of syndication can be especially appealing to potential affiliates  Regional syndication can also be more attractive to area advertisers who share a common regional trading area versus assembling a radio network of stations that hopscotch across the USA   edit  See also 100 episodes Rerun Syndication exclusivity Flagship  radio  Flagship
