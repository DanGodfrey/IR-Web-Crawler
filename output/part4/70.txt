the Mississippi River  Michigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas  The Lower Peninsula  to which the name Michigan was originally applied  is often noted to be shaped like a mitten  The Upper Peninsula  often referred to as  The U P    is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac  a five mile  8 km  wide channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan  The two peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge  The Upper Peninsula is economically important due to its status as a tourist destination  There is also a variety of natural resources to be found there  including a sizable amount of iron ore  Contents 1 History 1 1 17th century 1 2 18th century 1 3 19th century 1 4 20th and 21st centuries 2 Government 2 1 State government 2 2 Law 2 3 Politics

needed   When the first European explorers arrived  the most populous and influential tribes were Algonquian peoples  specifically  the Ottawa  the Anishnabe  called Chippewa in French  after their language Ojibwe   and the Potawatomi  The Anishnabe  whose numbers are estimated to have been between 25 000 and 35 000  were the most populous  The Anishnabe were well established in Michigan s Upper Peninsula and northern Michigan  and also inhabited northern Ontario  northern Wisconsin  southern Manitoba  and northern and north central Minnesota  The Ottawa lived primarily south of the Straits of Mackinac in northern and western Michigan  while the Potawatomi were primarily in the southwest  The three nations co existed peacefully as part of a loose confederation called the Council of Three Fires  Other tribes in Michigan  in the south and east  were the Mascouten  the Menominee  the Miami  and the Wyandot  who are better known by their French name  Huron   edit  17th century P re Marquette and the Indians  1869   Wilhelm Lamprecht French voyageurs and coureurs des bois explored and settled in Michigan in the 17th century  The first Europeans to reach what later became Michigan were those of  tienne Br l  s expedition in 1622  The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1668 on the site where P re Jacques Marquette established Sault Ste  Marie  Michigan as a base for Catholic missions  11  Missionaries in 1671 75 founded outlying stations at Saint Ignace and Marquette  Jesuit missionaries were well received by the Indian populations in the area  with relatively few difficulties or hostilities  In 1679  Robert Cavelier  Sieur de la Salle built Fort Miami at present day St  Joseph   edit  18th century Approximate area of Michigan highlighted in Guillaume de L Isle s 1718 map  In 1701  French explorer and army officer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du D troit or  Fort Pontchartrain on the Strait  on the strait  known as the Detroit River  between lakes Saint Clair and Erie  Cadillac had convinced King Louis XIV s chief minister  Louis Ph lypeaux  Comte de Pontchartrain  that a permanent community there would strengthen French control over the upper Great Lakes and discourage British aspirations  The hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied Cadillac built a fort enclosing one arpent 12  13   about 0 85 acres  3 400 m2   the equivalent of just under 200 feet  61 m  per side  and named it Fort Pontchartrain  Cadillac s wife  Marie Th r se Guyon  soon moved to Detroit  becoming one of the first European women to settle in the Michigan wilderness  The town quickly became a major fur trading and shipping post  The  glise de Saint Anne  Church of Saint Ann  was founded the same year  While the original building does not survive  the congregation of that name continues to be active today  Cadillac later departed to serve as the French governor of Louisiana from 1710 to 1716  At the same time  the French strengthened Fort Michilimackinac at the Straits of Mackinac to better control their lucrative fur trading empire  By the mid 18th century  the French also occupied forts at present day Niles and Sault Ste  Marie  though most of the rest of the region remained unsettled by Europeans  From 1660 to the end of French rule  Michigan was part of the Royal Province of New France  14  In 1759  following the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in the French and Indian War  1754 1763   Qu bec City fell to British forces  This marked Britain s victory in the Seven Years War  Under the 1763 Treaty of Paris  Michigan and the rest of New France east of the Mississippi River passed to Great Britain  15  During the American Revolutionary War  Detroit was an important British supply center  Most of the inhabitants were French Canadians or Native Americans  many of whom had been allied with the French  Because of imprecise cartography and unclear language defining the boundaries in the 1783 Treaty of Paris  the British retained control of Detroit and Michigan after the American Revolution  When Quebec split into Lower and Upper Canada in 1790  Michigan was part of Kent County  Upper Canada  It held its first democratic elections in August 1792 to send delegates to the new provincial parliament at Newark  now Niagara on the Lake   16  Under terms negotiated in the 1794 Jay Treaty  Britain withdrew from Detroit and Michilimackinac in 1796  Questions remained over the boundary for many years  and the United States did not have uncontested control of the Upper Peninsula and Drummond Island until 1818 and 1847  respectively   edit  19th century During the War of 1812  Michigan Territory  effectively consisting of Detroit and the surrounding area  was surrendered after a nearly bloodless siege in 1812  An attempt to retake Detroit resulted in a severe American defeat in the River Raisin Massacre  This battle is still the bloodiest ever fought in the state and had the highest number of American casualties of any battle in the war  Ultimately  Michigan was recaptured by Americans in 1813 after the Battle of Lake Erie  An invasion of Canada which culminated in the Battle of the Thames was then launched from Michigan  The more northern areas were held by the British until the peace treaty restored the old boundaries  A number of forts  including Fort Wayne were built in Michigan during the 19th century out of fears of renewed fighting with Britain  Lumbering pines in the late 1800s The population grew slowly until the opening in 1825 of the Erie Canal connecting the Great Lakes and the Hudson River and New York City  The new route brought a large influx of settlers  who became farmers and merchants and shipped out grain  lumber  and iron ore  By the 1830s  Michigan had 80 000 residents  more than enough to apply and qualify for statehood  In October 1835 the people approved the Constitution of 1835  thereby forming a state government  although Congressional recognition was delayed pending resolution of a boundary dispute with Ohio known as the Toledo War  Congress awarded the  Toledo Strip  to Ohio  Michigan received the western part of the Upper Peninsula as a concession and formally entered the Union on January 26  1837  The Upper Peninsula proved to be a rich source of lumber  iron  and copper  Michigan led the nation in lumber production from the 1850s to the 1880s  Railroads became a major engine of growth from the 1850s onward  with Detroit the chief hub  The first statewide meeting of the Republican Party took place July 6  1854 in Jackson  Michigan  where the party adopted its platform  The state was heavily Republican until the 1930s  Michigan made a significant contribution to the Union in the American Civil War and sent more than forty regiments of volunteers to the federal armies  Modernizers and boosters especially Yankees set up systems for public education  including founding the University of Michigan  1817  moved to Ann Arbor in 1841   for a classical academic education  and Michigan State Normal School   1849  now Eastern Michigan University  for the training of teachers  In 1899  it became the first normal college in the nation to offer a four year curriculum  Michigan Agricultural College  1855   now Michigan State University in East Lansing  was founded as the pioneer land grant college  a model for those authorized under the Morrill Act  1862   Many other private colleges were founded as well  and the smaller cities formed high schools late in the century  17   edit  20th and 21st centuries See also  History of Ford Motor Company Michigan s economy underwent a transformation at the turn of the 20th century  Many individuals  including Ransom E  Olds  John and Horace Dodge  Henry Leland  David Dunbar Buick  Henry Joy  Charles King  and Henry Ford  provided the concentration of engineering know how and technological enthusiasm to start the birth of the automotive industry  18  Ford s development of the moving assembly line in Highland Park marked the beginning of a new era in transportation  Like the steamship and railroad  it was a far reaching development  More than the forms of public transportation  the automobile transformed private life  It became the major industry of Detroit and Michigan  and permanently altered the socio economic life of the United States and much of the world  With the growth  the auto industry created jobs in Detroit that attracted immigrants from Europe and migrants from across the U S   including those from the South  By 1920  Detroit was the fourth largest city in the U S  Residential housing was in short supply  and it took years for the market to catch up with the population boom  By the 1930s  so many immigrants had arrived that more than 30 languages were spoken in the public schools  and ethnic communities celebrated in annual heritage festivals  Over the years immigrants and migrants contributed greatly to Detroit s diverse urban culture  including popular music trends  such as the influential Motown Sound of the 1960s led by a variety of individual singers and groups  Skyscrapers in downtown Detroit Grand Rapids  the second largest city in Michigan  is also an important center of manufacturing  Since 1838  the city has also been noted for its furniture industry and is home to five of the world s leading office furniture companies  Grand Rapids is home to a number of major companies including Steelcase  Amway  and Meijer  Grand Rapids is also an important center for GE Aviation Systems  Michigan held its first United States presidential primary election in 1910  With its rapid growth in industry  it was an important center of union industry wide organizing  such as the rise of the United Auto Workers  In 1920 WWJ  AM  in Detroit became the first radio station in the United States to regularly broadcast commercial programs  Throughout that decade  some of the country s largest and most ornate skyscrapers were built in the city  Particularly noteworthy are the Fisher Building  Cadillac Place  and the Guardian Building  each of which is a National Historic Landmark  NHL   Detroit continued to expand through the 1950s  at one point doubling its population in a decade  After World War II  housing was developed in suburban areas outside city cores  newly constructed U S  Interstate Highways allowed commuters to navigate the region more easily  Modern advances in the auto industry have resulted in increased automation  high tech industry  and increased suburban growth since 1960  Michigan is the leading auto producing state in the U S   with the industry primarily located throughout the Midwestern United States  Ontario  Canada  and the Southern United States  19  With almost ten million residents  Michigan is a large and influential state  ranking eighth in population among the fifty states  Detroit is the centrally located metropolitan area of the Great Lakes Megalopolis and the second largest metropolitan area in the U S  linking the Great Lakes system  The Metro Detroit area in Southeast Michigan is the largest metropolitan area in the state  roughly 50  of the population resides there  and the eleventh largest in the USA  The Grand Rapids metropolitan area in Western Michigan is the fastest growing metro area in the state  with over 1 3 million residents as of 2006  Metro Detroit receives more than 15 million visitors each year  Michigan has many popular tourist destinations which include areas such as Traverse City on the Grand Traverse Bay in Northern Michigan  Tourists spend about  17 billion annually in Michigan supporting 193 000 jobs  20  Michigan typically ranks third or fourth in overall Research  amp  development  R amp D  expenditures in the U S  21  22  The state s leading research institutions include the University of Michigan  Michigan State University and Wayne State University which are important partners in the state s economy and the state s University Research Corridor  23  Michigan s public universities attract more than  1 5 B in research and development grants each year  24

2008  Barack Obama carried the state over John McCain  winning Michigan s 17 electoral votes with 57  of the vote  Democrats have won each of the last three  nine of the last ten  and 15 of the last 18 U S  Senate elections in Michigan with confidence on national economic issues posing a challenge  Republican strength is greatest in the western  northern  and rural parts of the state  especially in the Grand Rapids area  Republicans also perform well in select areas of suburban Detroit  namely in affluent suburbs like the Grosse Pointe communities  Bloomfield Township  Northville Township  and Novi  as well as in communities with large upper middle class populations like Rochester Hills  Democrats have performed strongest in urban parts of the state  in cities like Detroit  Ann Arbor  Flint  and Lansing  they have also performed strongly in areas of suburban Detroit  namely in inner  working class suburbs like Lincoln Park and Eastpointe  African American majority suburbs like Southfield  Oak Park  and River Rouge  and other suburbs like West Bloomfield Township and Farmington Hills  which both have large Jewish and African American populations  and suburbs of the Woodward Corridor  like Royal Oak  Berkley  Ferndale  and Huntington Woods are heavily Democratic voting blocs  Other suburbs  like middle class Sterling Heights  lower middle  to middle class St  Clair Shores  and Allen Park  are politically competitive for members of both parties  30  Metropolitan Detroit  with approximately one half of the state s population  remains a substantial factor in affecting its elections and political culture more broadly  Overall  Wayne County  where Detroit is located  remains heavily Democratic and voted 74  for Barack Obama and 25  for John McCain  Oakland County  with a moderate political culture  has increasingly shifted towards support for Democratic presidential candidates  and Macomb County  once a bastion of support for Democratic New Deal politics  has shifted towards becoming an intense political battleground  31  Historically  the first county level meeting of the Republican Party took place in Jackson on July 6  1854  32  and the party thereafter dominated Michigan until the Great Depression  In the 1912 election  Michigan was one of the six states to support progressive Republican and third party candidate Theodore Roosevelt for president after he lost the Republican nomination to William Howard Taft  Michigan remained fairly reliably Republican at the presidential level for much of the 20th century  It was part of Greater New England  the northern tier of states settled chiefly by migrants from New England who carried their culture with them  The state was one of only a handful to back Wendell Willkie over Franklin Roosevelt in 1940  and supported Thomas E  Dewey in his losing bid against Harry S  Truman in 1948  Michigan went to the Democrats in presidential elections during the 1960s  and voted for Republican Richard Nixon in 1972  Michigan was the home of Gerald Ford  the 38th President of the United States  He was born in Nebraska and moved as an infant to Grand Rapids and grew up there  33  34  The Gerald R  Ford Museum is located in Grand Rapids  and the Gerald R  Ford Presidential Library is located on the campus of his alma mater  the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor   edit  Administrative divisions Main article  Administrative divisions of Michigan See also  List of Michigan county seats  List of counties in Michigan  and List of municipalities in Michigan  by population  State government is decentralized among three tiers   statewide  county and township  Counties are administrative divisions of the state  and townships are administrative divisions of a county  Both of them exercise state government authority  localized to meet the particular needs of their jurisdictions  as provided by state law  There are 83 counties in Michigan  Cities  state universities  and villages are vested with home rule powers of varying degrees  Home rule cities can generally do anything that is not prohibited by law  The fifteen state universities have broad power and can do anything within the parameters of their status as educational institutions that is not prohibited by the state constitution  Villages  by contrast  have limited home rule and are not completely autonomous from the county and township in which they are located  There are two types of township in Michigan  general law township and charter  Charter township status was created by the Legislature in 1947 and grants additional powers and stream lined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation by a city  As of April 2001  there were 127 charter townships in Michigan  In general  charter townships have many of the same powers as a city but without the same level of obligations  For example  a charter township can have its own fire department  water and sewer department  police department  and so on just like a city but it is not required to have those things  whereas cities must provide those services  Charter townships can opt to use county wide services instead  such as deputies from the county sheriff s office instead of a home based force of ordinance officers   edit  Geography Further information  Geography of Michigan  Protected areas of Michigan  and List of Michigan state parks Marquette Park on Mackinac Island  Michigan consists of two peninsulas that lie between 82 30  to about 90 30  west longitude  and are separated by the Straits of Mackinac  The 45th parallel north runs through the state marked by highway signs and the Polar Equator Trail 35  along a line including Mission Point Light near Traverse City  the towns of Gaylord and Alpena in the Lower Peninsula and Menominee in the Upper Peninsula  With the exception of two small areas that are drained by the Mississippi River by way of the Wisconsin River in the Upper Peninsula and by way of the Kankakee Illinois River in the Lower Peninsula  Michigan is drained by the Great Lakes St  Lawrence watershed and is the only state with the majority of its land thus drained  Aerial view of Sleeping Bear Dunes  The Great Lakes that border Michigan from east to west are Lake Erie  Lake Huron  Lake Michigan and Lake Superior  It has more lighthouses than any other state  The state is bounded on the south by the states of Ohio and Indiana  sharing land and water boundaries with both  Michigan s western boundaries are almost entirely water boundaries  from south to north  with Illinois and Wisconsin in Lake Michigan  then a land boundary with Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula  that is principally demarcated by the Menominee and Montreal Rivers  then water boundaries again  in Lake Superior  with Wisconsin and Minnesota to the west  capped around by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north and east  Tahquamenon Falls in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan The heavily forested Upper Peninsula is relatively mountainous in the west  The Porcupine Mountains  which are part of one of the oldest mountain chains in the world  36  rise to an altitude of almost 2 000 feet  610 m  above sea level and form the watershed between the streams flowing into Lake Superior and Lake Michigan  The surface on either side of this range is rugged  The state s highest point  in the Huron Mountains northwest of Marquette  is Mount Arvon at 1 979 feet  603 m   The peninsula is as large as Connecticut  Delaware  Massachusetts  and Rhode Island combined but has fewer than 330 000 inhabitants  They are sometimes called  Yoopers   from  U P  ers    and their speech  the  Yooper dialect   has been heavily influenced by the numerous Scandinavian and Canadian immigrants who settled the area during the lumbering and mining boom of the late 19th century  The Pointe Mouillee State Game Area The Lower Peninsula is shaped like a mitten and many residents hold up a hand to depict where they are from  37  It is 277 miles  446 km  long from north to south and 195 miles  314 km  from east to west and occupies nearly two thirds of the state s land area  The surface of the peninsula is generally level  broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually not more than a few hundred feet tall  It is divided by a low water divide running north and south  The larger portion of the state is on the west of this and gradually slopes toward Lake Michigan  The highest point in the Lower Peninsula is either Briar Hill at 1 705 feet  520 m   or one of several points nearby in the vicinity of Cadillac  The lowest point is the surface of Lake Erie at 571 feet  174 m   The geographic orientation of Michigan s peninsulas makes for a long distance between the ends of the state  Ironwood  in the far western Upper Peninsula  lies 630 highway miles  1 015 km  from Lambertville in the Lower Peninsula s southeastern corner  The geographic isolation of the Upper Peninsula from Michigan s political and population centers makes the U P  culturally and economically distinct  Occasionally U P  residents have called for secession from Michigan and establishment as a new state to be called  Superior   A feature of Michigan that gives it the distinct shape of a mitten is the Thumb  This peninsula projects out into Lake Huron and the Saginaw Bay  The geography of the Thumb is mainly flat with a few rolling hills  Other peninsulas of Michigan include the Keweenaw Peninsula  making up the Copper Country region of the state  The Leelanau Peninsula lies in the Northern Lower Michigan region  See Also Michigan Regions Little Sable Point Light south of Pentwater  Michigan  Numerous lakes and marshes mark both peninsulas  and the coast is much indented  Keweenaw Bay  Whitefish Bay  and the Big and Little Bays De Noc are the principal indentations on the Upper Peninsula  The Grand and Little Traverse  Thunder  and Saginaw bays indent the Lower Peninsula  Michigan has the second longest shoreline of any state 3 288 miles  5 292 km   38  including 1 056 miles  1 699 km  of island shoreline  39  Michigan map  including territorial waters The state has numerous large islands  the principal ones being the North Manitou and South Manitou  Beaver  and Fox groups in Lake Michigan  Isle Royale and Grande Isle in Lake Superior  Marquette  Bois Blanc  and Mackinac islands in Lake Huron  and Neebish  Sugar  and Drummond islands in St  Mary s River  Michigan has about 150 lighthouses  the most of any U S  state  The first lighthouses in Michigan were built between 1818 and 1822  They were built to project light at night and to serve as a landmark during the day to safely guide the passenger ships and freighters traveling the Great Lakes  See Lighthouses in the United States  The state s rivers are generally small  short and shallow  and few are navigable  The principal ones include the Detroit River  St  Marys River  and St  Clair River which connect the Great Lakes  the Au Sable  Cheboygan  and Saginaw  which flow into Lake Huron  the Ontonagon  and Tahquamenon  which flow into Lake Superior  and the St  Joseph  Kalamazoo  Grand  Muskegon  Manistee  and Escanaba  which flow into Lake Michigan  The state has 11 037 inland lakes  totaling 1 305 square miles  3 380 km2  of inland water  in addition to 38 575 square miles  99 910 km2  of Great Lakes waters  No point in Michigan is more than six miles  10 km  from an inland lake or more than 85 miles  137 km  from one of the Great Lakes  40  The state is home to a number of areas maintained by the National Park Service including  Isle Royale National Park  located in Lake Superior  about 30 miles  48 km  southeast of Thunder Bay  Ontario  Other national protected areas in the state include  Keweenaw National Historical Park  Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore  Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore  Huron National Forest  Manistee National

  and the University of Michigan takes the wolverine as its mascot  The association is well and long established  for example  many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War and George Armstrong Custer  who led the Michigan Brigade  called them the  Wolverines   The origins of this association are obscure  it may derive from a busy trade in wolverine furs in Sault Ste  Marie in the 18th century or may recall a disparagement intended to compare early settlers in Michigan with the vicious mammal  Wolverines are  however  extremely rare in Michigan  A sighting in February 2004 near Ubly was the first confirmed sighting in Michigan in 200 years  112  The animal was found dead in 2010  113  State nicknames  Wolverine State  Great Lakes State  Mitten State  Water Winter
