Technological and industrial history Inventions by date  before 1890   1890 1945   1946 1991   after 1991  A timeline of United States inventions  1890 1945  encompasses the ingenuity and innovative advancements of the United States within a historical context  dating from the Progressive Era to the end of World War II  which have been achieved by inventors who are either native born or naturalized citizens of the United States  Copyright protection secures a person s right to his or her first to invent claim of the original invention in question  highlighted in Article I  Section 8  Clause 8 of the United States Constitution which gives the following enumerated power to the United States Congress    To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts  by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries    In 1641  the first patent in North America was issued to Samuel Winslow by the General Court of Massachusetts for a new method of making salt  3  4  5  On April 10  1790  President George Washington signed the Patent Act of 1790  1 Stat  109  into law which proclaimed that patents were to be authorized for  any useful art  manufacture  engine  machine  or device  or any improvement therein not before known or used   6  On July 31  1790  Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford  Vermont became the first person in the United States to file and to be granted a patent for an improved method of  Making Pot and Pearl Ashes   7  The Patent Act of 1836  Ch  357  5 Stat  117  further clarified United States patent law to the extent of establishing a patent office where patent applications are filed  processed  and granted  contingent upon the language and scope of the claimant s invention  for a patent term of 14 years with an extension of up to an additional 7 years  6  However  the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994  URAA  changed the patent term in the United States to a total of 20 years  effective for patent applications filed on or after June 8  1995  thus bringing United States patent law further into conformity with international patent law  8  The modern day provisions of the law applied to inventions are laid out in Title 35 of the United States Code  Ch  950  sec  1  66 Stat  792   From 1836 to 2011  the United States Patent and Trademark Office  USPTO  has granted a total of 7 861 317 patents 9  relating to several well known inventions appearing throughout the timeline below  Some examples of patented inventions between the years 1890 and 1991 include John

usually erected at road junctions such as a four way intersection  that instructs drivers to stop and then to proceed only if the way ahead is clear  The idea of placing stop signs at road junctions was first conceived in 1890 when William Phelps Eno of Saugatuck  Connecticut proposed and devised the first set of traffic laws in an article published in Rider and Driver  However  the first use of stop signs did not appear until 1915 when officials in Detroit  Michigan installed a stop sign with black letters on a white background  Throughout the years and with many alterations made to the stop sign  the current version with white block lettering on a red background that is used in the United States as well as emulated in many other countries around the world today  did not come into use until the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted the design in 1954  14  1890 Tabulating machine The tabulating machine is an electrical device designed to assist in summarizing information and  later  accounting  The results of a tabulation are electrically coupled with a sorter while displayed on clock like dials  The concept of automated data processing had been born  In 1890  Herman Hollerith invented the mechanical tabulating machine  a design used during the 1890 Census which stored and processed demographic and statistical information on punched cards  15  16  1890 Shredded wheat Shredded wheat is a type of breakfast cereal made from whole wheat  Shredded wheat also comes in a frosted variety  which has one side coated with sugar and usually gelatin  Shredded wheat was invented in 1890 by Henry Perky of Watertown  New York  17  1890 Babcock test The Babcock test was the first inexpensive and practical test which were used to determine the fat content of milk  Invented by Stephen Moulton Babcock in 1890  the test was developed to prevent dishonest farmers who could  until the 1890s  water down their milk or remove some cream before selling it to the factories because milk was paid by volume  18  1890 Smoke detector A smoke detector is a device that detects smoke and issues a signal  Most smoke detectors work either by optical detection or by physical process  but some of them use both detection methods to increase sensitivity to smoke  Smoke detectors are usually powered by battery while some are connected directly to power mains  often having a battery as a power supply backup in case the mains power fails  The first automatic electric fire alarm was co invented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton and Fernando J  Dibble  Upton and Dibble were issued U S  patent  436 961  Upton was an associate of Thomas Alva Edison  although there is no evidence that Edison contributed to this invention  19  1891 Ferris wheel The first Ferris wheel at the 1893 World s Columbian Exposition in Chicago The Ferris wheel is a non building structure  consisting of an upright wheel with passenger gondolas attached to the rim  Opened on June 21  1893 at the Chicago World s Fair  the Ferris wheel was invented two years earlier by the Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania bridge builder George Washington Gale Ferris in 1891  20  1891 Dow process The Dow process is the electrolytic method of bromine extraction from brine  and was Herbert Henry Dow s second revolutionary process for generating bromine commercially in 1891  21  1891 Tesla coil A Tesla coil is a type of resonant transformer circuit invented by Nikola Tesla around 1891  Nikola Tesla used these coils to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting  phosphorescence  x ray generation  high frequency alternating current phenomena  electrotherapy  and the transmission of electrical energy without wires for point to point telecommunications  broadcasting  and the transmission of electrical power  22  1891 Rotary dial The rotary dial is a device mounted on or in a telephone or switchboard that is designed to send electrical pulses  known as pulse dialing  corresponding to the number dialed  The early form of the rotary dial used lugs on a finger plate instead of holes  The rotary dial was invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891  23  Strowger filed U S  patent 486 909 on December 21  1891 that was later issued on November 29  1892  24  25  1891 Pastry fork A pastry fork  also known as a  pie fork   is a fork designed for eating pastries and other desserts while holding a plate  The fork has 3 or 4 tines  The 3 tine fork has a larger  flattened and beveled tine on the side while the 4 tine fork has the 1st and 2nd tine connected or bridged together and beveled  On July 7  1891  Anna M  Mangin of Queens  a borough of New York City  filed the first patent for the pastry fork  U S  patent  470 005 was later issued on March 1  1892  26  1891 Zipper Three zippers  Metal  plastic  and nylon The zipper is a popular device for temporarily joining two edges of fabric  Zippers are found on trousers  jeans  jackets  and luggage  Whitcomb L  Judson was an American mechanical engineer from Chicago who was the first to invent  conceive of the idea  and to construct a zipper  Using a hook and eye device  Judson intended for this earliest form of the zipper to be used on shoes  He also conceived the idea of the slide fastener mechanism in conjunction with the invention of the zipper  Patents were issued to Judson for the zipper in 1891  1894  and 1905  27  28  1891 Schrader valve A Schrader valve consists of a hollow cylindrical metal tube  typically brass  with the exterior end threaded  The interior end takes a variety of forms depending on its application  In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube  the pin s end is flush with the end of the valve body  Generally  all Schrader valves are used on tires  They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end  so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires  Also  pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires  In 1891  George Schrader  the son of German American immigrant August Schrader  invented the Schrader valve  A patent was issued on April 11  1893  29  1892 Bottle cap Bottle caps  or closures  are used to seal the openings of bottles of many types  They can be small circular pieces of metal  usually steel  with plastic backings  and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead  Caps can also be plastic  sometimes with a pour spout  Flip Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products  The crown cork  the first form of a bottle cap  possessed flanges bent over a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside  It was invented and patented in 1892 by William Painter of Baltimore  Maryland  30  31  1892 Dimmer Dimmers are devices used to vary the brightness of a light  By decreasing or increasing the RMS voltage and hence the mean power to the lamp it is possible to vary the intensity of the light output  Although variable voltage devices are used for various purposes  the term dimmer is generally reserved for those intended to control lighting  Dimmers are popularly used in venues such as movie theatres  stages  dining rooms  restaurants  and auditoriums where the need or absence of light during activities requires constant change  The dimmer was invented in 1892 by Granville Woods  32  1892 Bicycle seat  padded  A bicycle seat  unlike a bicycle saddle  is designed to support the rider s buttocks and back  usually in a semi reclined position  First known as the  Garford Saddle   the padded bicycle seat was invented in 1892 by Arthur Lovett Garford of Elyria  Ohio  33  1892 Tractor An Oliver 60 Row Crop  circa 1944 A tractor is a vehicle specifically designed to deliver a high tractive effort at slow speeds  for the purposes of hauling a trailer or machinery used in agriculture or construction  The term is used to describe the distinctive farm vehicle  Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor  and the tractor may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanized  In 1892  John Froelich invented and built the first gasoline petrol powered tractor in Clayton County  Iowa  10  10  34  35  36  37  1893 Laxative Laxatives are compounds or drugs taken to induce bowel movements or to loosen the stool  most often taken to alleviate constipation  Administered orally or in suppository form  laxatives also serve to evacuate the colon before a colonoscopy  and may be supplemented by enemas in that circumstance  Laxatives were invented by Charles Browne Fleet in 1893  38  1893 Spectroheliograph The spectroheliograph is an instrument used in astronomy that captures a photographic image of the Sun at a single wavelength of light  a monochromatic image  The spectroheliograph was invented in 1893 by George Ellery Hale and independently later by Henri Alexandre Deslandres in 1894  39  1893 Pinking shears Pinking shears are a type of scissors that have blades of which are sawtoothed instead of straight  Used to cut woven cloth  pinking shears leave a zigzag pattern instead of a straight edge  The earliest patent for pinking shears was U S  patent  489 406 which was issued to Louise Austin of Whatcomb  Washington on January 3  1893  40  1894 Stadimeter Quartermaster 3rd Class Jaren Briggs uses a stadimeter to measure range during an underway replenishment aboard the guided missile cruiser USS Leyte Gulf A stadimeter  a type of optical rangefinder  is an optical device for estimating the range to an object of known height by measuring the angle between the top and bottom of the object as observed at the device  It is similar to a sextant  in that the device is using mirrors to measure an angle between two objects but differs in that one dials in the height of the object  The stadimeter was invented in 1894 by Bradley Allen Fiske  a Rear Admiral in the United States Navy  41  The first sea tests  conducted in 1895  showed that it was equally useful for fleet sailing and for navigation  42  Likewise  the stadimeter proved useful during the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish American War  U S  patent  523 721 was issued to Fiske on July 31  1894  43  1894 Mousetrap A mousetrap is a specialized type of animal trap designed primarily to catch mice  However  it may also trap other small animals  Mousetraps are usually set in an indoor location where there is a suspected infestation of rodents  The first mouse trap was invented by William C  Hooker of Abingdon  Illinois  exactly three years before James Henry Atkinson developed a prototype called the  Little Nipper   who Atkinson himself probably saw the Hooker trap in shops or in advertisements  thus copying it as the basis for his own model  44  Hooker received US patent  528671 for his invention  the mousetrap  in 1894  45  46  1894 Medical glove A disposal surgical glove Medical gloves are disposable gloves used during medical examinations and procedures that help prevent contamination between caregivers and patients  Medical gloves are made of different polymers including latex  nitrile rubber  vinyl and neoprene  they come unpowdered  or powdered with cornstarch to lubricate the gloves  making them easier to put on the hands  In 1894  William Stewart Halsted  the Surgeon in Chief of Johns Hopkins Hospital  invented the medical glove in an effort to make medical care safer and more sterile for patients and health care workers  47  1895 Cyclocomputer A cyclocomputer or cyclometer is a device mounted on a bicycle that calculates and displays trip information  similar to the instruments in the dashboard of a car  The computer with display  or head unit  usually is attached to the handlebar for easy viewing  In 1895  Curtis Hussey Veeder invented the cyclometer  48  1895 Clipless pedal Clipless pedals are bicycle pedals that require a special cycling shoe with a cleat fitted to the sole  which locks into a mechanism in the pedal and thus holds the shoe firmly to the pedal  Most clipless pedals lock onto the cleat when stepped on firmly and unlock when the heel is twisted outward  although in some cases the locking mechanism is built into the cleat instead of the pedal  The clipless pedal was invented in 1895 by Charles Hanson of Peace Dale  Rhode Island  49  1895 Volleyball Three volleyball players performing a block Volleyball is an Olympic sport in which two teams of 6 active players are separated by a net  Each team tries to score points against one another by grounding a ball on the other team s court under organized rules  William G  Morgan invented the sport first known as  Mintonnette  in 1895 while studying at a YMCA in Holyoke  Massachusetts  It was later re named volleyball by Alfred S  Halstead  50  1897 Cotton candy Cotton candy is a soft confection made from sugar that is heated and spun into slim threads that look like a mass of cotton  It was co invented in 1897 by William Morrison and John C  Wharton  candy makers from Nashville  Tennessee  51  1897 Muffler A muffler is a device for reducing the amount of noise emitted by a machine  On internal combustion engines  the engine exhaust blows out through the muffler  The internal combustion engine muffler was invented by Milton O  Reeves 52  who received a patent in 1897  53  1897 Tapered roller bearing Tapered roller bearings are bearings that can take large axial forces as well as being able to sustain large radial forces  They were co invented by German American Henry Timken and Reginald Heinzelman  54  On August 27  1897  Timken and Heizelman filed U S  patent  606 635 which was issued to them jointly on June 28  1898  55  1897 Ice cream scoop An ice cream scoop is any specialized spoon used to dish and serve ice cream  Most ice cream scoops are hemispherical shaped and contain a mechanical device to force the ice cream out of the scoop  The ice cream scoop was invented by African American Alfred L  Cralle who was issued U S  patent  576 395 on February 2  1897  56  1897 Charcoal briquette A charcoal briquette  or briquet is a block of flammable charcoal matter which is used as fuel to start and maintain a fire  mainly used for food preparation over an open fire or a barbecue  Charcoal briquettes are made by using a process which consists of compressing charcoal  typically made from sawdust and other wood by products  with a binder and other additives  The binder is usually starch  Some charcoal briquettes may also include brown coal  mineral carbon  borax  sodium nitrate  limestone  raw sawdust  and other additives like paraffin or petroleum solvents to aid in ignition  The design of the charcoal briquette was invented and patented by Ellsworth B  A  Zwoyer in 1897  57  1897 Billiards cue chalk Cue chalk is a calcite or carbonate base applied to the tip of the cue stick used in billards in order for players to reduce friction between the cue and bridge hand during shooting  as well as for a smoother stroke  Cue tip chalk was co invented in its modern form by straight rail billiard pro William A  Spinks and chemist William Hoskins in 1897  58  U S  patent  578 514 for cue chalk was issued to Spinks and Hoskins on March 9  1897  59  1898 Candy corn Candy corn is a popular treat for American children during Halloween Candy corn is a confection in the United States and Canada  popular primarily in autumn around Halloween  that mimics the shape and coloration of corn kernels a broad yellow end  a tapered orange center  and a pointed white tip  Candy corn is made primarily from sugar  corn syrup  artificial coloring and binders  It is generally thought that George Renninger  an employee of the Wunderlee Candy Company  invented candy corn in the 1880s  60  However  the earliest references credit the Goelitz Confectionery Company  now known as the Jelly Belly Candy Company  for introducing candy corn or  chicken feed  to the American public in 1898  61  1898 Remote control A remote control is an electronic device used to operate any machine  such as a television  remotely  Many of these remotes communicate to their respective devices through infrared signals and radio control  In Madison Square Garden  at the Electrical Exhibition  Nikola Tesla gave the first demonstration of a boat propelling in water  controlled by his remote control which he designed using radio signals  Tesla received a patent for his invention in 1898  62  1898 Semi automatic shotgun A semi automatic  or self loading shot gun is a firearm that requires only a trigger pull for each round that is fired  unlike a single action revolver  a pump action firearm  a bolt action firearm  or a lever action firearm  which all require the shooter to chamber each successive round manually  In 1898  John Moses Browning invented the first semi sutomatic shot gun  later patenting it in 1900  Naming it the Auto 5  Browning s semi automatic relied on long recoil operation  This design remained the dominant form in semi automatic shotguns for approximately 50 years  being widely used and the preferred weapon of choice among soldiers fighting in World War One  Production of the Auto 5 ceased in 1999  63  1898 Filing cabinet  vertical  A filing cabinet is a piece of office furniture usually used to store paper documents in file folders  In the most simple sense  it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored  A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side  typically 15 inches  of the cabinet  The vertical filing cabinet was invented by Edwin G  Seibels in 1898  thus revolutionizing efficient record keeping and archiving by creating space for offices  schools  and businesses  64  1898 Installer bit Installer bits are a type of twist drill bit for use with a hand portable power tool  Installer bits are also known as bell hanger bits or fishing bits  The key distinguishing feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip  Once the bit has penetrated a wall  a wire can be threaded through this transverse hole  and the bit pulled back through the drilled hole  The installer bit was invented and patented by Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn  New York in 1898  65  1898 Sousaphone The sousaphone  sometimes referred to as a marching tuba  is a wearable tuba descended from the h licon  It was designed such that it fits around the body of the wearer and so it can be easily played while being worn  The sousaphone is named after John Philip Sousa but was invented by C G  Conn in 1898  66  1899 Wing warping Diagram of the Wright brothers  1899 kite  showing wing bracing and strings attached to hand held sticks used for warping the wing while in flight Wing warping consists of the twisting motion of the wings of an aircraft to produce lateral control  The entire wing structure twists slightly in a helical motion in the desired direction  The concept of wing warping is attributed to Wilbur Wright who in 1899  came up with the idea and with the conclusion that the roll of an aircraft could be controlled by the motion of that aircraft s wings  Exemplified by the twisting of a long  narrow box  the Wright brothers incorporated wing warping on their 1899 glider that used ropes to pull on the wings  Later on  the young French engineer Robert Esnault Pelterie replaced wing warping in 1904 with the aileron on a copy he made of a 19th century Wright glider  However  it was Henry Farman  a French aviator  who was the first to use the aileron as an integral part of the wing structure in place of wing warping in 1908  67  1899 Flash lamp The electric flash lamp is a device that uses an electrical circuit to trigger a fuse to ignite explosive powder such as magnesium  for a brief sudden burst of bright light  flash  from a chemical reaction of flash powder burning  It was principally used for flash photography in the early 20th century  but had other uses as well  The flash lamp was invented and patented on November 7  1899 by New York City resident Joshua Lionel Cowen  68  1900 Duckpin bowling Duckpin bowling is a variation of bowling that uses balls which are significantly smaller than those used in ten pin bowling  weighing 1 2 kilograms  2 4 pounds  each  which are devoid of finger holes  The pins are correspondingly shorter and lighter than their ten pin equivalents  Hence  when the pins are knocked down  they resemble a  flock of flying ducks   While the rules remained almost identical to those of the Ten pin game  one rule change was made  A bowler is allowed to use three bowls on each turn  Strikes would still be strikes and spares still spares  but when all pins were knocked down on the third ball  it counts as a score of ten  During the summer of 1900  some bowlers at Diamond Alleys in Baltimore  Maryland thought it might be interesting to resize the pins to match the 6 inch ball  Thus  the inventor of duckpin bowling  John Van Sant  used a wood turner to do exactly that  69  1900 Nickel zinc battery A nickel zinc battery is a type of rechargeable battery that may be used in cordless power tools  cordless telephone  digital cameras  battery operated lawn and garden tools  professional photography  flashlights  electric bike  and light electric vehicle sectors  In 1900  Thomas Alva Edison filed U S  Patent  684 204 for the nickel zinc battery  It was issued on October 8  1901  70  1900 Merrill Crowe process The Merrill Crowe process is a separation technique for removing gold from a cyanide solution  The basic process was conceptualized and patented by Charles Washington Merrill around 1900  then later refined by Thomas B  Crowe  working for the Merrill Company  71  1900 Carbide lamp Carbide lamps  also known as acetylene gas lamps  are simple lamps that produce and burn acetylene which is created by the reaction of calcium carbide with water  The first carbide lamp was invented and patented in New York City on August 28  1900 by Frederick Baldwin  72  1900 Thumbtack A thumbtack is a short nail or pin with a large  slightly rounded head made of metal which is used to fasten documents to a background for public display and which can easily be inserted or removed by hand  The thumbtack was invented by Edwin Moore around 1900  the year in which he founded the Moore Push Pin Company  73  1901 Key punch A keypunch is a device for manually entering data into punched cards by precisely punching holes at locations designated by the keys struck by the operator  Early keypunches were manual devices  Later keypunches were mechanized  often resembling a small desk  with a keyboard similar to a typewriter  and with hoppers for blank cards and stackers for punched cards  In 1901  Herman Hollerith invented and patented the mechanical key punch that was operated by keys  like a typewriter  and that advanced the card automatically to the next column after each punch  Later models would be motor driven with rudimentary programming features  74  1901 Mercury vapor lamp A mercury vapor lamp is a gas discharge lamp which uses mercury in an excited state to produce light  The arc discharge is generally confined to a small fused quartz arc tube mounted within a larger borosilicate glass bulb  The outer bulb may be clear or coated with a phosphor  In either case  the outer bulb provides thermal insulation  protection from ultraviolet radiation  and a convenient mounting for the fused quartz arc tube  In 1901  Peter Cooper Hewitt invented and patented the mercury vapor lamp  75  1901 Assembly line 1913 Ford Model T assembly line production  Used globally around the world  an assembly line is a manufacturing process in which interchangeable parts are added to a product in a sequential manner in order to create a finished product more quickly than with older methods  This type of manufacturing greatly reduces the amount of time taken to assemble a product thus reducing production  material  and labor costs so that an affordable product cost can be passed onto consumers  According to a book entitled Michigan Yesterday  amp  Today authored by Robert W  Domm  the assembly line and its basic concept is credited to Ransom Olds  who used it to build the first mass produced automobile  the Oldsmobile Curved Dash  76  Olds patented the assembly line concept  which he put to work in his Olds Motor Vehicle Company factory in 1901  77  This development is often overshadowed by Henry Ford  who perfected the assembly line by installing driven conveyor belts that could produce a Model T in ninety three minutes  76  1901 Safety razor  disposable  A safety razor protects the skin from all but the edge of the blade while shaving skin  King Camp Gillette  a traveling hardware salesman of Fond du Lac  Michigan invented the double edged  disposable safety razor attached to a re usable razor handle  Beforehand  dull razors were taken to barbers for sharpening  With Gillette s double edged and disposable blades  a uniform shave on a man s face could be achieved with a fresh blade and disposed after it was used  Gillette applied for a patent in 1901  It was granted in 1904  78  1901 Windowed envelope An example of a windowed envelope A windowed envelope is a conventional envelope with a plastic window to allow the recipient s address to be printed on the paper contained within  Windowed envelopes save the expense of printing or labor of addressing  and in addition save time in preparing the message for dispatch when the customary addresses are already on the letter paper itself  Calling it the  outlook envelope   Americus F  Callahan of Chicago was the first to patent the windowed envelope  79  U S  patent  701 839 was filed on December 9  1901 and issued on June 10  1902  80  1901 Radio direction finder A radio direction finder  RDF  is a device for finding the direction to a radio source  Due to radio s ability to travel very long distances and  over the horizon   it makes a particularly good navigation system for ships  small boats  and aircraft that might be some distance from their destination  The radio direction finder is the earliest form of radio navigation  It was first patented by American physicist John Stone Stone  He filed on January 23  1901 and was granted the patent  U S  Patent 716 134  on December 16  1902  81  1902 Hearing aid A hearing aid is an electroacoustic body worn apparatus which typically fits in or behind the wearer s ear  and is designed to amplify and modulate sounds for the wearer  Although hearing aids in some form or fashion such as the ear trumpet were developed in previous years  the first electric hearing aid was invented by Miller Reese Hutchison in 1902  82  1902 Postage meter A postage meter is a mechanical device used to create and apply physical evidence of postage  or franking  to mailed matter  Postage meters are regulated by a country s postal authority  for example  in the United States  the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation  support  and use of postage meters  A postage meter imprints an amount of postage  functioning as a postage stamp  a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one  The postage meter was invented by Chicago inventor Arthur Pitney  receiving a patent for the invention on October 14  1902  83  1902 Teddy bear A teddy bear is a stuffed toy bear  They are usually stuffed with soft cotton and have smooth and soft fur  It is an enduring form of a stuffed animal that has become a collector s item  The first teddy bear was invented in 1902 by Morris Michtom  owner of a Brooklyn toy store  who was inspired by Clifford Berryman s political cartoon Drawing the Line in Mississippi that depicted President Theodore  Teddy  Roosevelt on a hunting trip in Mississippi who spared the life of a Louisiana black bear cub  Michtom asked for and received President Roosevelt s permission to use his name for the hand sewn bears called  Teddy bears  that he invented and his wife helped construct  84  1902 Periscope  collapsible  A periscope is an instrument for observation from a concealed position  known for use in submarines  In a simple form  it is a tube in each end of which are mirrors set parallel to each other and at an angle of 45 with a line between them  Periscopes allow a submarine  submerged at a shallow depth  to search for targets and threats in the surrounding sea and air  When not in use  the periscope is retracted into the hull  A sub commander in tactical conditions must exercise discretion when using his periscope  since it creates an observable wake and may be detectable to radar  giving away the sub s position  The invention of the collapsible periscope for use in submarine warfare is credited to Simon Lake in 1902  who called his device the omniscope or skalomniscope  Later  it was made to be raised and turned by hand  85  1902 Mercury arc valve A mercury arc valve is a type of electrical rectifier which converts alternating current into direct current  Rectifiers of this type were used in electric motor power supplies for industry  in electric railways  streetcars  and diesel electric locomotives  They also found use in static inverter stations and as rectifiers for high voltage direct current power transmission  Mercury arc rectifiers were invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1902  86  1902 Air conditioning Air conditioning units outside a classroom building Air conditioning is the cooling and de humidification of indoor air for thermal comfort  Using a system of coils as a solution to cool and remove moisture from muggy air in a printing plant that was wrinkling magazine pages  Willis Carrier invented and manufactured the world s first mechanical air conditioning unit in 1902  87  Carrier s invention   encompassing the first system to provide man made control over temperature  humidity  ventilation and air quality  was first installed as a solution to the quality problems experienced at a Brooklyn printing plant  Sackett Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company  Air conditioning not only spawned a company and an industry  but also brought about profound economic  social and cultural changes  12  1903 Tea bag A tea bag is a small  porous paper  silk or nylon sealed bag containing tea leaves for brewing tea  Tea bags were invented by Thomas Sullivan around 1903  The first tea bags were made from silk  Sullivan was a tea and coffee merchant in New York who began packaging tea samples in tiny silk bags  but many customers brewed the tea in them  88  1903 Offset printing press Offset printing is a commonly used printing technique where the inked image is transferred from a plate to a rubber blanket  then to the printing surface  Ira Washington Rubel invented the first offset printing press in 1903  89  1903 Airplane The Wright Flyer II flying almost four circles over Huffman Prairie  about 2 and 3 4 miles in 5 minutes and 4 seconds on November 9  1904  A fixed wing aircraft  or airplane  is a heavier than air craft whose lift is generated by air pressure differential between the upper and lower wing surfaces  The Wright brothers  Wilbur and Orville Wright of Dayton  Ohio  made the first powered and sustained airplane flights under control of the pilot in the Wright Flyer I on December 17  1903 in Kitty Hawk  North Carolina  90  91  92  In the two years afterward  they developed their flying machine into the world s first practical fixed wing aircraft  93  By October 1905  the Wright Flyer III was capable and proven to circle in the air 30 times in 39 minutes for a total distance of 24 5 miles  94  The brothers  fundamental breakthrough was their invention of  three axis control   which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium  This required method has become standard on all fixed wing aircraft  From the beginning of their aeronautical work  the Wright brothers focused on unlocking the secrets of control to conquer  the flying problem   rather than on developing more powerful engines as some other experimenters did  Charles Edward Taylor built the first aircraft engine and was a vital contributor of mechanical aspects in the building and maintaining of early Wright engines and airplanes  95  Although there were many earlier attempts at heavier than air powered flight  some of which achieved successful short hops  96  and disputed earlier claims of sustained flight  97  the Wright brothers are officially credited by the F d ration A ronautique Internationale  the international record setting body for aeronautics and astronautics  as achieving  the first sustained and controlled heavier than air powered flight   98  In addition  U S  patent number  821393 for the airplane  was filed by Orville Wright on March 23  1903 and was issued in May 1906  99  1903 Windshield wipers A windshield wiper with motorized arm The windshield wiper is a bladed device used to wipe rain and dirt from a windshield  In 1903  Mary Anderson is credited with inventing the first operational windshield wiper  100  101  In Anderson s patent  she called her invention a window cleaning device for electric cars and other vehicles  Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle  her version of windshield wipers closely resembles the windshield wiper found on many early car models  Anderson had a model of her design manufactured  She then filed a patent  U S  patent number 743 801  on June 18  1903 that was issued to her by the U S  Patent Office on November 10  1903  102  103  1903 Wood s glass Wood s glass is a light filter used in communications during World War I  An  invisible radiation  technique which worked both in infrared daylight communication and ultraviolet night communications  it does not transmit visible light  leaving the  invisible radiation  as a signal beam  Wood s glass was invented by Robert Williams Wood in 1903  104  1903 Wood s lamp A Wood s lamp is a diagnostic tool used in dermatology which shines ultraviolet light onto the skin of the patient  a technician then observes any subsequent fluorescence  Though the technique for producing a source of ultraviolet light was devised by Robert Williams Wood in 1903 using  Wood s glass   not until 1925 was the technique used in dermatology by Margarot and Deveze for the detection of fungal infection of hair  105  1903 Baler  round  Round hay bales near Elbl g Canal  Poland A baler is a piece of farm machinery used to compress a cut and raked crop  such as hay  straw  or silage  into compact bales that are easy to handle  transport and store  Several different types of balers are commonly used  each producing a different type of bales   rectangular or cylindrical  round   of various sizes  bound with twine  netting  or wire  The round hay baler was invented by Ummo F  Luebben of Sutton  Nebraska  which he conceived with his brother Melchior in 1903  and then patented in 1910  The invention of the round hay baler revolutionized the laborious task of haying into a one man  low cost operation with a machine that automatically gathered the hay  rolled into a round bale  and ejected it  106  1904 Automatic transmission An automatic transmission is an automobile gearbox that changes gear ratios automatically as the vehicle moves  freeing the driver from having to shift gears manually  Modern automatic transmissions trace their origins to an early  horseless carriage  gearbox that was developed in 1904 by the Sturtevant brothers of Boston  Massachusetts  107  1904 AC power plugs and sockets An electric plug is a male electrical connector with contact prongs to connect mechanically and electrically to slots in the matching female socket  Wall sockets  are female electrical connectors that have slots or holes which accept and deliver current to the prongs of inserted plugs  Sockets are designed to accept only matching plugs and reject all others  The original two blade electrical plug and socket were invented by Harvey Hubbell and patented in 1904  108  The three prong plug was invented by Philip F  Labre in 1928  109  1904 Banana split A banana split is an ice cream based dessert  In its classic form it is served in a long dish called a boat  A banana is cut in half lengthwise  hence the split  and laid in the dish  There are many variations  but the classic banana split is made with scoops of vanilla  chocolate and strawberry ice cream served in a row between the split banana  Although the banana as an exotic fruit was introduced to the American public in the 1880s  it was later in 1904  that the banana split was invented in the town of Latrobe  Pennsylvania by 23 year old pharmacy apprentice David Strickler  who was inspired to create a new sundae after seeing a soda jerk during a visit to Atlantic City  According to The Food Chronology  written in 1995 by James Trager  Strickler concocted his sundae to include three scoops of ice cream on a split banana  topped with chocolate syrup  marshmallow  nuts  whipped cream  and a cherry that sold for a dime  Other soda jerks soon imitated Strickler s banana split  albeit in other forms  110  1904 Pantograph  diamond shaped  A pantograph is a device that collects electric current from overhead lines for electric trains or trams  The term stems from the resemblance to pantograph devices for copying writing and drawings  In 1904  the diamond shaped roller pantograph was invented by John Q  Brown of the Key System shops for their commuter trains which ran between San Francisco and the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay Area in California  A patent was issued on July 5  1904  111  1904 Dragline excavator Dragline excavation systems are heavy equipment used in civil engineering and surface mining  In civil engineering the smaller types are used for road and port construction  The larger types are used in strip mining operations to move overburden above coal  and for tar sand mining  A dragline bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom  a large truss like structure  with wire ropes  The bucket is manoeuvred by means of a number of ropes and chains  The hoist rope  powered by large diesel or electric motors  supports the bucket and hoist coupler assembly from the boom  The dragrope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally  By skillful manoeuvre of the hoist and the dragropes the bucket is controlled for various operations  The dragline excavator was invented in 1904 by John W  Page  112  1905 Batting helmet A batter wearing a batting helmet A batting helmet is the protective headgear worn by batters in the game of baseball or softball  It is meant to protect the batter s head from errant pitches thrown by the pitcher  A batter who is  hit by pitch   due to an inadvertent wild pitch or a pitcher s purposeful attempt to hit him  may be seriously  even fatally  injured  In 1905  a New York Giants  the team now known as the San Francisco Giants  baseball player named Roger Bresnahan  after missing thirty days of the baseball season and lying in a hospital bed due to a head injury  or beaning   created  with assistance from the A J  Reach Company  a crude  leather  vertically sliced football helmet over his cap that is considered to be the first batting helmet  The headgear was unpopular  even with Bresnahan at the time  and it wasn t until the mid 1950s that his idea was accepted  113  1905 Fly swatter A fly swatter is a hand held device for swatting flies and other insects  Samuel Crumbine  a member of the Kansas board of health  wanted to raise public awareness of the threat of flies  He was inspired by a chant at a Topeka softball game   swat the ball   In a health bulletin published soon afterwards  he exhorted Kansans to  swat the fly   In response  a schoolteacher named Frank H  Rose created the  fly bat   a device consisting of a yardstick attached to a piece of screen  Crumbine invented the device now commonly known as the fly swatter  114  1905 Liquid ring pump A liquid ring pump is a rotating positive displacement pump that is powered by an induction motor and is typically used as a vacuum pump or as a gas compressor  The liquid ring pump was invented in 1905 by Lewis H  Nash  Production soon began thereafter at the Nash Engineering Company  115  Nash filed U S  patent  1 091 529 on February 24  1910 and was issued to him on March 31  1914  116  1905 Outboard motor An outboard motor is a propulsion system for boats  consisting of a self contained unit that includes engine  gearbox and propeller or jet drive  designed to be affixed to the outside of the transom and are the most common motorized method of propelling small watercraft  As well as providing propulsion  outboards provide steering control  as they are designed to pivot over their mountings and thus control the direction of thrust  The outboard motor was invented in 1905 by Yale University student Cameron Waterman who used a dismounted motorcycle engine  Waterman applied for a patent in 1905 on the motor  which was granted in 1907  117  1905 Ice pop An ice pop is a frozen water based dessert on a stick  It is made by freezing a colored  flavored liquid around a stick  Once the liquid freezes solid  the stick can be used as a handle to hold the ice pop  The ice pop was invented by 11 year old Frank Epperson in 1905  Living in San Francisco  California  Epperson had left a fruit drink out overnight  with a stirrer in it  thus making it freeze  In 1923  Epperson got a patent on his  frozen ice on a stick   Epperson also invented the twin ice pop  with two sticks so it could be shared by two children  The most famous brand name associated with the ice pop is Popsicle  118  1906 Typesetting Typesetting is the retrieval of the stored letters and the ordering of them according to a language s orthography for visual display  Typesetting was invented by John Raphael Rogers of Brooklyn  New York who filed U S  patent  837127 on October 8  1906 and issued to him on November 27  1906  119  120  1906 Flushometer A flushometer  or royal flushometer is a water pressure system that uses an inline handle to flush toilets and urinals  By using pressurized water directly from the supply line  there is a faster recycle time between flushes  The flushometer is still in use today in homes and public restrooms around the world  The flushometer was invented in 1906 by American businessman and inventor William Elvis Sloan  121  122  1906 Audion tube The Audion is an electronic amplifier device and was the forerunner of the triode  in which the current from the filament to the plate was controlled by a third element  the grid  A small amount of power applied to the grid could control a larger current from the filament to the plate  allowing the Audion to both detect radio signals and to provide amplification  The Audion tube was invented by Lee De Forest in 1906  123  1907 Curtain rod A curtain rod or traverse rod is a device used to suspend curtains  usually above windows or along the edges of showers  though also wherever curtains might be used  The flat  telescoping curtain rod was invented by Charles W  Kirsch of Sturgis  Michigan  in 1907  However  they were not in use until the 1920s  Kirsch also invented the traverse curtain rod in 1928  124  1907 Electrostatic precipitator An electrostatic precipitator  ESP   or electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas  such as air  using the force of an induced electrostatic charge  Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device  and can easily remove fine particulate matter such as dust and smoke from the air stream  In 1907  the California physicist Frederick G  Cottrell invented and received a patent for the electrostatic precipitator  125  1907 Paper towel A paper towel has the same purposes as conventional towels such as drying hands  wiping windows  dusting  cleaning up spills  However  paper towels can only be used once after they blot wet surfaces  A school teacher in Ashland  Ohio  named Kurt Klier  gave students individual paper squares  so that the single towel in the bathroom would not be infected with germs  When Arthur Scott  head of the Scott Paper Company heard about it  he decided to try and sell a load of paper that had been made too thick to use as toilet paper  126  1908 Candy apple A candy apple Candy apples  also known as toffee apples outside of North America  are whole apples covered in a hard sugar candy coating  While the topping varies from place to place  they are almost always served with a wooden stick of sorts in the middle making them easier to eat  Toffee apples are a common treat at autumn festivals in Western culture in the Northern Hemisphere  such as Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night because these festivals fall in the wake of the annual apple harvest  Dipping fruits into a sugar syrup is an ancient tradition  However  the origin of the red candy apple is attributed to Newark  New Jersey candymaker who conceived the idea of dipping apples into a red cinnamon candy mixture he had on hand  In addition  dipping apples in hot caramel a 1950s American invention attributed to Kraft salesman Dan Walker  127  1908 Mixer  electric  An electric mixer is a kitchen appliance used for whipping  beating  and folding food ingredients  It typically consists of a handle mounted over a large enclosure containing the motor  which drives one or two beaters  The beaters are immersed in the food to be mixed  The first electric mixer was invented by Herbert Johnston in 1908 and sold by the KitchenAid division of the Hobart Manufacturing Company  128  1909 Skee ball Skee ball is a common game found in arcades and one of the first redemption games  Skee ball is similar to bowling except it is played on an inclined lane and the player aims to get the ball to fall into a hole rather than knock down pins  The object of the game is to collect as many points as possible by rolling balls up an incline and into the designated point value holes  Skee ball was invented and patented in 1909 by J D  Estes of Philadelphia  129  1909 Paper shredder Paper shredders are used to cut paper into chad  typically either strips or fine particles  Government organizations  businesses  and private individuals use shredders to destroy private  confidential  or otherwise sensitive documents  The first paper shredder is credited to prolific inventor Abbot Augustus Low of Horseshoe  New York  His patent for a  waste paper receptacle  to offer an improved method of disposing of waste paper received a U S  patent on August 31  1909  130  1909 Suppressor A suppressor or silencer is a device either attached to or part of the barrel of a firearm to reduce the amount of noise and flash generated by firing the weapon  It generally takes the form of a cylindrically shaped metal tube with various internal mechanisms to reduce the sound of firing by slowing the escaping propellant gas  and sometimes by reducing the velocity of the bullet  Hiram Percy Maxim  the son of famous machine gun inventor Hiram Stevens Maxim  is credited with inventing the suppressor in 1909  131  1909 Gin rummy Gin rummy  or Gin for short  is a simple and popular two player card game with a standard 52 card pack  The objective of Gin Rummy is to score more points than your opponent improving one s hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood  Gin rummy was invented by Elwood T  Baker and his son  C  Graham Baker in 1909  132  1910 Headset A headset is a headphone combined with a microphone  Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands free operation  They are used in call centers and by people in telephone intensive jobs  The first ever headset was invented in 1910  by a Stanford University student named Nathaniel Baldwin  133  1911 Fifth wheel coupling The fifth wheel coupling provides a pivoting link between a semi trailer and the towing truck  tractor unit  leading trailer or dolly  Some recreational vehicles have a fifth wheel configuration  requiring the coupling to be installed in the bed of a pickup truck as a towing vehicle  The coupling consists of a coupling pin  or kingpin  on the front of the semi trailer  and a horseshoe shaped coupling device called a fifth wheel on the rear of the towing vehicle  In 1911  Charles Martin invented the fifth wheel coupler consisting of a round plate with a hole in it  attached to a frame mounted on his tractor  134  1911 Erector set An Erector Set is a toy construction set that consists of collections of small metal beams with regular holes for nuts  bolts  screws  and mechanical parts such as pulleys  gears  and small electric motors  Popular in the United States  the brand name is currently used for Meccano sets  The erector set was invented in 1911 by Alfred Carlton Gilbert and was manufactured by the A  C  Gilbert Company at the Erector Square factory in New Haven  Connecticut  The first sets were called by A C  Gilbert  The Erector   Structural Steel  amp  Electro Mechanical Builder   Accessory sets were also available to allow children to upgrade basic sets  135  1911 Binder clip A single  large sized binder clip A binder clip  or a banker s clip or foldback clip  is a simple device for binding sheets of paper together  It leaves the paper intact and can be removed quickly and easily unlike the staple  The binder clip was invented in 1911 by Washington D C  resident Louis E  Baltzley who was motivated by a desire to help his father  Edwin  a prolific writer and inventor  keep manuscripts in order  The original design was modified five times  but the essential mechanism has never changed  136  1911 Automobile self starter An automobile self starter is an electric motor that initiates rotational motion in an internal combustion engine before it can power itself  therefore eliminating the hand crank used to start engines  In 1911  Charles F  Kettering invented the automobile self starter while working at National Cash Register and then sold them for installation on cars at the Cadillac company  There had been many attempts at producing an electric starter before  but none of them were successful  Most designs at that time called for the use of an electric motor attached to the engine s flywheel  However  in order to fit in the car s engine compartment  the device would have to be small  and therefore it would be unable to produce a sufficient enough amount of torque  137  138  1911 Road surface marking Dead Man s Curve along the Marquette Negaunee Road in Michigan shown in 1917 with the first hand painted centerline A road surface marking is any kind of device or material that is used on a road surface in order to convey official information for drivers and pedestrians  Edward N  Hines originated the concept of painting a line down the center of a road to separate traffic in opposing directions  They were first used in Wayne County  Michigan in 1911  139  1912 Autopilot An autopilot is a mechanical  electrical  or hydraulic system used to guide a vehicle without assistance from a human being  Most people understand an autopilot to refer specifically to aircraft  but self steering gear for ships  boats  space craft and missiles is sometimes also called by this term  The first aircraft autopilot was invented by Lawrence Sperry in 1912  Sperry demonstrated it in 1914  and proved the credibility of the invention by flying the aircraft with his hands away from the controls and visible to onlookers  140  1912 Electric blanket An electric blanket is a blanket with an integrated electrical heating device usually placed above the top bed sheet  The first electric blanket was invented in 1912 by American physician Sidney I  Russell  This earliest form of an electric blanket was an  underblanket  under the bed that covered and heated from below  In 1937  Electric  overblankets which lie on top of the sleeping person were introduced in the United States  141  142  1912 Traffic light  electric  Traffic lights in Spain The traffic light  also known as traffic signal  is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection  pedestrian crossing  or other location  Its purpose is to indicate  using a series of colors  the correct moment to stop  drive  ride or walk  using a universal color code  The color of the traffic lights representing stop and go are likely derived from those used to identify port  red  and starboard  green  in maritime rules governing right of way  where the vessel on the left must stop for the one crossing on the right  In Salt Lake City  Utah  policeman Lester Wire invented the first red green electric traffic lights  143  1913 Formica  plastic  Formica is a hard durable plastic laminate used for countertops  cupboard doors  and other surfaces which are heat resistant and easy to clean  Formica was invented in 1913 by Herbert A Faber and Daniel J  O Connor of Westinghouse Electric  144  1914 Regenerative circuit The regenerative circuit allows an electronic signal to be amplified many times by the same vacuum tube or other active component such as a field effect transistor  A regenerative circuit is often an AM detector  converting the RF signal on the antenna to an audio waveform  Their use of positive feedback greatly increases both the selectivity and sensitivity of a simple receiver  Positive feedback builds up the input signal to very high levels  Edwin Armstrong  invented and patented the regenerative circuit while he was a junior in college  in 1914  145  1914 Traffic cone Traffic cones  also called toddlers  road cones  safety cones  construction cones  pylons  or Witches  Hats  are usually cone shaped markers that are placed on roads or sidewalks to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner  Traffic cones were invented in 1914 by Charles P  Rudabaker  146  1914 Fortune cookie A fortune cookie is a crisp cookie usually made from flour  sugar  vanilla  and oil with a  fortune  wrapped inside  A  fortune  is a piece of paper with words of faux wisdom or a vague prophecy  In the United States  it is usually served with Chinese food in Chinese restaurants as a dessert  The message inside may also include a list of lucky numbers and a Chinese phrase with translation  Contrary to belief  the fortune cookie associated as a Chinese invention is a fallacy  In 1914  the Japanese American named Makoto Hagiwara of the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco  California introduced the fortune cookie and is thus recognized as its inventor  147  1915 Skeet shooting Skeet shooting is an Olympic sport where participants attempt to break clay disks flung into the air at high speed from a variety of angles  The firearm of choice for this task is usually a high quality  double barreled over and under shotgun with 28 30 inch barrels and open chokes  The event is in part meant to simulate the action of bird hunting  The shooter shoots from eight positions on a semicircle with a radius of 21 yards  19 m   and an 8th position halfway between stations 1 and 7  There are two houses that hold devices known as  traps  that launch the targets  one at each corner of the semicircle  Skeet shooting began in Andover  Massachusetts in 1915  when grouse hunter Charles Davis invented a game he called  shooting around the clock  to improve his wingshooting  148  1915 Single sideband modulation Single sideband modulation  SSB  is a refinement of amplitude modulation that more efficiently uses electrical power and bandwidth  Single sideband modulation produces a modulated output signal that has twice the bandwidth of the original baseband signal  Although John Renshaw Carson invented SBB in 1915  his patent was not granted until March 27  1923  149  1916 Hamburger bun A hamburger bun is a bread roll sliced horizontally containing a hamburger  usually a patty consisting of ground meat that also typically contains lettuce  bacon  tomato  onion  pickles  cheese and condiments such as mustard  mayonnaise  ketchup and relish  The hamburger bun was invented in 1916 by a fry cook named Walter Anderson  who co founded White Castle in 1921  150  1916 Lincoln Logs Lincoln Logs is the name of a children s toy consisting of notched miniature wooden logs  used to build miniature forts  cabins  and buildings  Lincoln Logs were invented in 1916 by John L  Wright  son of famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright  151  1916 Supermarket The interior of a supermarket in Toronto  Canada A supermarket is a self service store offering a wide variety of food and household merchandise  organized into departments  It is larger in size and has a wider selection than a traditional grocery store  The concept of a  self service  grocery store was invented by American entrepreneur Clarence Saunders and his Piggly Wiggly stores  Beforehand  customers would shop at a general store where a clerk behind a counter would fetch inventory in limited quantity for customers to purchase  With Saunders  new innovation of self service  customers would be able to choose a wider selection of goods at competitive prices  Saunders  first store opened in Memphis  Tennessee  in 1916  152  1916 Cloverleaf interchange A cloverleaf interchange is a two level interchange in which left turns  in countries that drive on the right  are handled by loop roads  To go left  in right hand traffic  vehicles first pass either over or under the other road  then turn right onto a one way three fourths loop ramp  270   and merge onto the intersecting road  The cloverleaf was first patented in the United States by Arthur Hale  a civil engineer in Maryland  on February 29  1916  153  1916 Tow truck A tow truck is a vehicle used to transport motor vehicles to another location  generally a repair garage  or to recover vehicles which are no longer on a drivable surface  Vehicles are often towed in the case of breakdowns or collisions  or may be impounded for legal reasons  The tow truck was invented in 1916 by Ernest Holmes  Sr   of Chattanooga  Tennessee  He was a garage worker who was inspired to create the invention after he was forced to pull a car out of a creek using blocks  ropes  and six men  An improved design led him to manufacture wreckers  154  1916 Condenser microphone A condenser microphone  also called a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone  is a microphone containing a capacitor that has two plates with a voltage between them  In the condenser microphone  one of these plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm  The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves  changing the distance between the two plates and therefore changing the capacitance  Specifically  when the plates are closer together  capacitance increases and a charge current occurs  When the plates are further apart  capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs  A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work  This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power  The condenser microphone was invented in 1916 at Bell Laboratories by Edward Christopher  E C   Wente  which became possible with the advent of the vacuum tube  valve  to act as an amplifier of the low signal output  155  1916 Light switch  toggle  An example of on off toggle light switches mounted on a wall A toggle light switch is a switch  most commonly used to operate electric lights  permanently connected equipment  or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly  but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers  The toggle light switch is safe  reliable  and durable  but produces a loud  snap  or  click  noise when a person s finger manually flips the toggle light switch into the on off position  The design for the toggle light switch was patented in 1916 by William J  Newton and Morris Goldberg of Lynbrook  New York  156  1917 Stream cipher In cryptography  a stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext bits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream  typically by an exclusive or  xor  operation  In a stream cipher the plaintext digits are encrypted one at a time  and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption  Also known as a state cipher  the stream cipher was invented in 1917 by Gilbert Sandford Vernam at Bell Labs  157  1918 Superheterodyne receiver In electronics  a superheterodyne receiver uses frequency mixing or heterodyning to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency  which can be more conveniently processed than the original radio carrier frequency  Virtually all modern radio and television receivers use the superheterodyne principle  The superheterodyne receiver was invented in 1918 by Edwin Armstrong  It was introduced to the market place in the late 1920s  158  1918 French dip sandwich A French dip sandwich  also known as a beef dip  is a hot sandwich consisting of thinly sliced roast beef  or  sometimes  other meats  on a  French roll  or baguette  It is usually served au jus   with juice    that is  with beef juice from the cooking process  Beef broth or beef consomm  is sometimes substituted  Despite the sandwich s name  the French dip sandwich was not invented in France  but in the United States  Both Philippe the Original s and Cole s Pacific Electric Buffet  two restaurants in Los Angeles  claim to have invented the French dip sandwich  Philippe Mathieu may have possibly invented the sandwich by accident around the year 1918  who according to one story  accidentally dropped a sandwich in a pan of au jus   Another story is that a fireman to Philippe s restaurant found his roast beef sandwich roll to be too hard  Thus  Philippe had it dipped in juice  Whatever the origin  Cole s Pacific Electric Buffet also claims to have invented the French dip sandwich as well  159  1918 Torque wrench A torque wrench is a tool used to precisely apply a specific torque to a fastener such as a nut or bolt  It is usually in the form of a socket wrench with special internal mechanisms  It was invented by Conrad Charles Bahr in 1918  160  However  it wasn t until much later on March 16  1937  that Bahr received U S  patent  2 074 079 for the invention of the torque wrench  161  1918 Crystal oscillator A crystal oscillator is an electronic circuit that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency  This frequency is commonly used to keep track of time as used in quartz wristwatches  to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits  and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers  The first crystal controlled oscillator  using a crystal of Rochelle Salt  was invented by Alexander M  Nicholson  However  it is generally accepted that Dr  Walter Guyton Cady was the first to use a quartz to control the frequency of an oscillator circuit  Nevertheless  Nicholson is still regarded as the inventor of the crystal oscillator  162  1918 Grocery bag Shopping bags are medium sized bags  typically around 10 20 litres  2 5 to 5 gallons  in volume  that are often used by grocery shoppers to carry home their purchases  They can be single use  disposable   used for other purposes or designed as reusable shopping bags  The grocery bag with handles was invented in 1918 by Walter Deubener of St  Paul Minnesota  163  U S  patent  1 305 198 was issued to Deubener on May 27  1919  164  1918 Hydraulic brake The hydraulic
