meaning  mountain  or more broadly   mountainous country   9 Monta a del Norte was the name given by early Spanish explorers to describe the entire mountainous region of the west  9  Historians believe General and former Kansas Territory Governor James W  Denver was aware of this when asked by Senate chairman of the Committee on Territories Stephen A  Douglas for a name of one of the several territories he was planning on proposing  9  Though Douglas never did introduce a bill with the name Montana  he is credited with at least introducing the name  9  The name was eventually added to a bill by the United States House Committee on Territories  which was chaired at the time by Rep  James Ashley of Ohio  for the territory that would become Idaho Territory  9  The name was successfully changed by Representatives Henry Wilson  Massachusetts  and Benjamin F  Harding  Oregon  both complained that Montana had  no meaning   9  When Ashley presented a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864  for a new territory to be carved out of Idaho  he again chose Montana Territory  10  This time Rep  Samuel Cox  also of Ohio  objected to the name  10  He complained that the name was a misnomer given that most of the territory was not at all mountainous and that an Indian name would be more appropriate than a Spanish one  10  To this Rep  Elihu Washburne of Illinois jokingly suggested Abyssinia  10  Cox suggested Shoshone  but its translated meaning of  snake  elicited laughter and a remark that the bill had progressed too far to have the territory s name changed without unanimous consent  10  Cox then suggested that the new territory be called  Jefferson   to which Ashley responded   Oh  well  we are opposed to that   10  This astounded Cox   Opposed to Jefferson  I propose that we name the new territory  by unanimous consent   Douglas Territory   I think the gentleman opposite will agree to that   to which Ashley replied   Oh  no  we cannot do that   10  Rep  John Pruyn then commented that the Governor Lyon of Idaho Territory said he thought the names for the two territories should be reversed given Idaho was more mountainous than Montana  10  Finally  Rep  Edwin Webster of Maryland stepped in and suggested that every father has the right to name his own child  and since the bill was the progeny of the Committee on Territories  the committee could name it whatever they wanted  10  After more laughter the name was settled  10   edit  Geography See also  Regional designations of Montana  Ecological systems of Montana  List of mountain ranges in Montana  and List of Forests in Montana Map of Montana With a land area of 147 046 square miles  380 850 km2   Montana is slightly larger than Japan and slightly smaller than Paraguay  It is the fourth largest state in the United States  after Alaska  Texas  and California   the largest landlocked U S  state  and the 56th largest national state province subdivision in the world  To the north  Montana shares a 545 mile  877 km  border with three Canadian provinces  British Columbia  Alberta  and Saskatchewan  To the east  the state borders North Dakota and South Dakota  To the south lies Wyoming and to the west and southwest is Idaho   edit  Topography The topography of the state is diverse and roughly defined by the Continental Divide  which runs on an approximate diagonal line through the state from northwest to south central  splitting it into two distinct eastern and western regions  Montana is well known for its mountainous western region  most of which is geologically and geographically part of the Northern Rocky Mountains  The Absaroka and Beartooth ranges in the south are technically part of the Central Rocky Mountains  About 60  of the state is prairie  part of the northern Great Plains  Nonetheless  even east of the Continental Divide and the Rocky Mountain Front  there are a number of isolated  island ranges  that dot the prairie landscape  This island range region covers most of the central third of the state  The Bitterroot Mountains one of the longest continuous ranges in the entire Rocky Mountain chain from Alaska to Mexico divide the state from Idaho to the west  with the southern third of the range blending into the Continental Divide  Mountain ranges between the Bitterroots and the top of the Continental Divide include the Cabinet Mountains  the Anaconda Range  informally called the  Pintlars    the Missions  the Garnet Range  Sapphire Mountains  and Flint Creek Range  Montana terrain The northern section of the Divide  where the mountains give way rapidly to prairie  is known collectively as the Rocky Mountain Front  The front is most pronounced in the Lewis Range  located primarily in Glacier National Park  Due to the configuration of mountain ranges in Glacier National Park  the Northern Divide  which begins in Alaska s Seward Peninsula  crosses this region and turns east in Montana at Triple Divide Peak  It causes the Waterton River  Belly  and Saint Mary rivers to flow north into Alberta  Canada  There they join the Saskatchewan River  which ultimately empties into Hudson Bay  East of the divide  several parallel ranges march across the southern half of the state  including the Gravelly Range  the Tobacco Roots  the Madison Range  Gallatin Range  Big Belt Mountains  Bridger Mountains  Absaroka Mountains  and the Beartooth Mountains  The Beartooth Plateau is the largest continuous land mass over 10 000 feet  3 000 m  high in the continental United States  It contains the highest point in the state  Granite Peak  12 799 feet  3 901 m  high  St  Mary Lake in Glacier National Park Between the mountain ranges are many scenic valleys  rich in agricultural resources and rivers  and possessing multiple opportunities for tourism and recreation  Among the best known areas are the Big Hole Valley  Bitterroot Valley  Gallatin Valley  Flathead Valley  and Paradise Valley  East and north of this transition zone are expansive  sparsely populated Northern Plains  with rolling tableland prairies   island  mountain ranges  and scenic badlands extending into the Dakotas and Wyoming  as well as Alberta and Saskatchewan  Canada  The isolated island ranges east of the Divide include the Bear Paw Mountains  Castle Mountains  Crazy Mountains  Highwood Mountains  Judith Mountains  Little Belt Mountains  Little Rocky Mountains  Snowy Mountains  Sweet Grass Hills  Bull Mountains  the Pryor Mountains south of Billings  and in the southeastern corner of the state near Ekalaka the Long Pines  The area east of the divide in the north central portion of the state is known for the Missouri Breaks and other significant rock formations  Three stately buttes south of Great Falls are familiar landmarks  The three  Square  Shaw  and Crown buttes  are made of igneous rock  which is dense and has withstood weathering for many years  The underlying surface consists of shale  Many areas around these buttes are covered with clay surface soils  which have been derived from the weathering of the Colorado Formation  Farther east  areas such as Makoshika State Park near Glendive and Medicine Rocks State Park near Ekalaka also highlight some of the most scenic badlands regions in the state  The Hell Creek Formation is a major source of dinosaur fossils  Paleontologist Jack Horner  of the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman  brought this formation to the world s attention with several major finds   edit  Rivers See also  List of rivers of Montana and List of lakes in Montana Montana also contains numerous rivers  many of which are known for  blue ribbon  trout fishing  while also providing most of the water needed by residents of the state  and hydropower  Montana is one of few geographic areas in the world whose rivers form parts of three major watersheds  i e  where two continental divides intersect   Its rivers feed the Pacific Ocean  the Gulf of Mexico  and Hudson Bay  and the watershed areas are divided atop Triple Divide Peak in Glacier National Park  Missouri Breaks region in central Montana West of the divide  the Clark Fork of the Columbia  not to be confused with the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River  rises in the Rocky Mountains near Butte and flows northwest to Missoula  where it is joined by the Blackfoot River and Bitterroot River  and further downstream by the Flathead River  before entering Idaho near Lake Pend Oreille  exiting it by the Pend Oreille River which flows west  then north through Washington into Canada  Just over the border  it meets the Columbia River  which flows to the Pacific Ocean  The Clark Fork discharges the greatest volume of water of any river exiting the state  The Flathead and Kootenai rivers also drain major portions of the western half of the state  East of the divide  the Missouri River formed by the confluence of the Jefferson  Madison  and Gallatin rivers crosses the central part of the state  flows through the Missouri breaks and enters North Dakota  The Yellowstone River rises in Yellowstone Park in Wyoming  flows north to Livingston  Montana  where it then turns east and flows through Billings  continuing across the state until it joins the Missouri River a few miles east of the North Dakota boundary  The Yellowstone River is the longest undammed  free flowing river in the contiguous United States  Other major Montana tributaries of the Missouri include the Milk  Marias  Tongue  and Musselshell rivers  Montana claims the disputed title of possessing the  world s shortest river   the Roe River  just outside Great Falls  Montana  Through the Missouri  these rivers ultimately join the Mississippi River and flow into the Gulf of Mexico  The Northern Divide turns east in Montana at Triple Divide Peak  It causes the Waterton River  Belly  and Saint Mary rivers to flow north into Alberta  Canada  There they join the Saskatchewan River  which ultimately empties into Hudson Bay  In addition to its rivers  the state is home to Flathead Lake  the largest natural fresh water lake in the western United States  Man made reservoirs dot Montana s rivers  the largest of which is Fort Peck Reservoir  on the Missouri river  contained by the largest earthen dam in the world  Pompey s Pillar National Monument  edit  Flora and fauna See also  Monocotyledons of Montana  Coniferous

bitterroots  daisies  lupins  poppies  primroses  columbine  lilies  orchids  and dryads  Several species of sagebrush and cactus and many species of grasses are common  Many species of mushrooms and lichens are also found in the state  Montana is home to a diverse array of fauna that includes 15 amphibian  85 fish  110 mammal  17 reptile and 420 bird species  11  Additionally  there are over 10 000 invertebrate species  including 180 mollusks and 30 crustaceans  Montana has the largest grizzly bear population in the lower 48 states  citation needed   edit  Parks See also  List of Montana

considerable variation in geography  and the climate is  therefore  equally varied  The state spans from  below  the 45th parallel  the halfway line between the equator and the north pole  to the 49th parallel  and elevations range from under 2 000 feet  610 m  to nearly 13 000 feet  4 000 m  above sea level  The western half is mountainous  interrupted by numerous large valleys  Eastern Montana comprises plains and badlands  broken by hills and isolated mountain ranges  and has a semi arid  continental climate  K ppen climate classification BSk   The Continental Divide runs north south through the western mountainous half  and has a great effect on the climate  It restricts the flow of warmer air from the Pacific from moving east  and cooler  drier continental moving west  West of the divide  the climate is described as modified northern Pacific coast climate  with milder winters  cooler summers  less wind  and a longer growing season  13  In the winter  valley fog and low clouds often form in the valleys west of the divide  but this is rarely seen in the east  14  Average daytime temperatures vary from 28  F   2  C  in January to 84 5  F  29 2  C  in July  15  The variation in geography leads to great variation in temperature  Hot weather occurs in the eastern plains on occasion  the highest observed being 117  F  47  C  at Glendive on July 20  1893  and Medicine Lake on July 5  1937  Throughout the state  summer nights are generally cool and pleasant  Temperatures decrease as altitude increases  and hot weather is unknown above 4 000 ft  1 200 m   Snowfall is not unknown in any month of the year in the central part of Montana  but is rare in July and August  13  The Big Drift covering the Going to the Sun Road in Glacier National Park as photographed on March 23  2006  The coldest temperature on record for Montana is also the coldest temperature for the entire contiguous U S  On January 20  1954   70  F   57  C  was recorded at a gold mining camp near Rogers Pass  Temperatures vary greatly on such cold nights  and Helena  40 miles  64 km  to the southeast had a low of only  36  F   38  C   13  Winter cold spells last a week or so  and are usually the result of cold continental air coming south from Canada  The front is often well defined  causing a large temperature drop in a 24 hour period  Conversely  air flow from the southwest results in  Chinooks   These steady 25 50 mph  or more  winds can suddenly warm parts of Montana  especially areas just to the east of the mountains  where temperatures sometimes rise up to 50  F  10  C    60  F  15  C   13  Loma  Montana is the location of the most extreme recorded temperature change in a 24 hour period in the United States  On January 15  1972  the temperature rose from  54  F   48  C  to 49  F  9  C   16  The Grinnell Glacier receives 105 inches  2 700 mm  of precipitation per year  Average annual precipitation is 15 inches  380 mm   but great variations are seen  The mountain ranges block the moist Pacific air  holding moisture in the western valleys  and creating rain shadows to the east  Heron  in the west  receives the most precipitation  34 70 inches  881 mm   On the eastern  leeward  side of a mountain range  the valleys are much drier  Lonepine averages 11 45 inches  291 mm   and Deer Lodge 11 00 inches  279 mm  of precipitation  The mountains themselves can receive over 100 inches  2 500 mm   for example the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park gets 105 inches  2 700 mm   14  Perhaps the driest is an area southwest of Belfry that averaged only 6 59 inches  167 mm  over a sixteen year period  Most of the larger cities get 30 to 50 inches  760 to 1 300 mm  of snow each year  Mountain ranges themselves can accumulate 300 inches  7 600 mm  of snow during a winter  Heavy snowstorms may occur as early as September or as late as May  though most snow falls from November to March  13  The climate has become warmer in Montana and continues to do so  17  The glaciers in Glacier National Park have receded and are predicted to melt away completely in a few decades  18  Many Montana cities set heat records during July 2007  the hottest month ever recorded in Montana  17  19  Winters are warmer  too  and have fewer cold spells  Previously these cold spells had killed off bark beetles which are now attacking the forests of western Montana  20  21  The combination of warmer weather  attack by beetles  and mismanagement during past years has led to a substantial increase in the severity of forest fires in Montana  17  21  According to a study done for the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science  portions of Montana will experience a 200  increase in area burned by wildland fires  and an 80  increase in air pollution from those fires  22  23   edit  History Main article  History of Montana Assiniboine family  Montana  1890 91 The headwaters of the Sun River  just below Gibson Reservoir Various indigenous peoples lived in the territory of the present day state of Montana for thousands of years  Historic tribes encountered by Europeans and settlers from the United States included the Crow in the south central area  the Cheyenne in the southeast  the Blackfeet  Assiniboine and Gros Ventres in the central and north central area  and the Kootenai and Salish in the west  The smaller Pend d Oreille and Kalispel tribes lived near Flathead Lake and the western mountains  respectively  The land in Montana east of the continental divide was part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803  Subsequent to the Lewis and Clark Expedition and after the finding of gold and copper  see the Copper Kings  in the area in the late 1850s  Montana became a United States territory  Montana Territory  on May 26  1864  Prior to the creation of Montana Territory  1864 1889   various parts of what is now Montana were parts of Oregon Territory  1848 1859   Washington Territory  1853 1863   Idaho Territory  1863 1864   and Dakota Territory  1861 1864   The Army established a series of posts in the late 1860s  including Fort Shaw  Camp Cooke on the Judith River and Fort C F  Smith on the Bozeman Trail  Montana was the scene of warfare as the Native Americans struggled to maintain control of their land  The Battle of the Little Bighorn was fought near the present day town of Hardin  Montana was also the location of the final battles of the Nez Perce Wars  A series of major mining discoveries in the western third of the state starting in 1862 found gold  silver  copper lead  coal  and later oil  that attracted tens of thousands of miners to the area  The richest of all gold placer diggings was discovered at Alder Gulch  where the town of Virginia City was established  Other rich placer deposits were found at Last Chance Gulch  where the city of Helena now stands  Confederate Gulch  Silver Bow  Emigrant Gulch  and Cooke City  Gold output from 1862 through 1876 reached  144 million  silver then became even more important  The largest mining operations were in the city of Butte  which had important silver deposits and gigantic copper deposits  Cattle ranching has been central to Montana s history and economy since the late 19th century  The Grant Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site in Deer Lodge Valley is maintained as a link to the ranching style of the late 19th century  Operated by the National Park Service  it is a 1 900 acres  7 7 km2  working ranch  The railroads arrived in the 1880s  including the Great Northern Railroad  1889  and its rival  the Northern Pacific Railroad  1883  from Minneapolis  and the Union Pacific Railroad  1881  from Denver  Montana railroading  with two transcontinentals to the Pacific coast and extensive operations to the mines  became a major industry  with centers in Billings and Havre  Montana became a state in 1889 in an omnibus package together with North Dakota  South Dakota and Washington  In 1888  Helena  the current state capital  had more millionaires per capita than any other city in the world  citation needed  The revised Homestead Act of 1909 greatly affected the settlement of Montana  This act expanded the amount of free land from 160 acres  0 6 km2  to 320 acres  1 3 km2  per family  Tens of thousands of inexperienced homesteaders arrived  lured by free land and high wheat prices  but they were unprepared for the climate  which usually had little rainfall and required special dry farming techniques  The droughts of 1917 1919 proved devastating  as many left  and half the banks in the state went bankrupt after providing mortgages that could not be repaid  The Great Depression caused further hardship for farmers and ranchers and miners  but the economy bounced back in the 1940s  The wheat farms in eastern Montana make the state a major producer  the wheat has a relatively high protein content and thus commands premium prices  After 1940 tourism became the state s third largest industry with Yellowstone and Glacier national parks as the largest tourist attractions  The planned battleship USS Montana was named in honor of the state  However  the battleship was never completed  making Montana the only one of the 48 states during World War II not to have a battleship named after it  Additionally  Alaska and Hawaii have both had nuclear submarines named after them  As such Montana is the only state in the union without a modern naval ship named in its honor  However  in August 2007 Senator Jon Tester made a request to the Navy that a submarine be christened USS Montana  24  Politics in the state has been competitive  with the Democrats usually holding an edge  thanks to the support among unionized miners and railroad workers  Large scale battles revolved around the giant Anaconda Copper company  based in Butte and controlled by Rockefeller interests  until it closed in the 1970s  Until 1959  the company owned five of the state s six largest newspapers   edit  American Indian reservations Seven Indian reservations in Montana  borders are not exact   Seven American Indian reservations are located in Montana  Fort Peck

increase since the 2010 United States Census  32  On January 3  2012  Governor Schweitzer announced that the Census and Economic Information Center  CEIC  at the Montana Department of Commerce estimated Montana had hit the one million mark sometime between November and December  2011  33  The 2010 census put Montana s population at 989 415 which is an increase of 87 220 people  or 9 7 percent  since the year 2000  Growth is mainly concentrated in Montana s seven largest counties  with the heaviest percentile growth in Gallatin County  which saw a 32  34  increase in its population since 2000  The city seeing the largest percentile growth was Kalispell with 40 1   35  The city with the largest actual growth was Billings with an increase in population of 14 323 since 2000  35

sizable American Indian population  nearly 90  of its residents are of European descent  with a large numbers of German  Irish  British  Slavic  Italian  and Scandinavian immigrants arriving 1890 1910  About 2000 3000 Chinese miners were in Montana by 1870  and 2500 in 1890  They were strongly opposed by labor unions  and public opinion grew increasingly negative in the 1890s and nearly half left the state by 1900  40  While German ancestry is the largest reported European American ancestry in Montana as a whole  residents of Scandinavian ancestry are prevalent in some of the farming dominated northern and eastern prairie regions  parallel to nearby regions of North Dakota and Minnesota  Irish and English are the second and third largest European ancestral groups in the state  There are also several predominantly Native American counties  mainly around each of the seven Indian reservations  The state has a larger Native American population  and percentage  than most US states  The seven reservations are actually made of more than twelve distinct Native American ethnolinguistic groups  The historically mining oriented communities of western Montana such as Butte have a wider range of ethnic groups  and are particularly rich in European American ethnicity  Finns  Eastern Europeans and especially Irish settlers left an indelible mark on the city  as well as people originally from British mining regions such as Cornwall  Devon  and Wales  The nearby city of Helena  also founded as a mining camp  had a similar mix in addition to a small Chinatown  and the Chinese in Montana  while a low percentage today  have historically been an important presence  Montanans who claim Filipino ancestry amount to almost 3 000  making them the largest Asian American group in the state  41  Throughout the nineteenth century  many farmers of German  Scandinavian  Irish  Scots  and English roots settled in Montana  In addition  the Hutterites  originally from Central Europe  settled here  and today Montana is second only to South Dakota in U S  Hutterite population with several colonies spread across the state  Many of Montana s historic logging communities originally attracted people of Scottish  Scandinavian  Slavic  English and Scots Irish descent  Montana s Hispanic population is concentrated around the Billings area in south central Montana  where many of

one of the first states to give women voting rights  see suffrage    edit  Politics Historically  Montana is a swing state of cross ticket voters who tend to fill elected offices with individuals from both parties  Through the mid 20th century  the state had a tradition of  sending the liberals to Washington and the conservatives to Helena   However  beginning in the 1980s  the pattern flipped  with voters more likely to elect conservatives to federal offices  There have also been long term shifts of party control  During the 1970s  the state was dominated by the Democratic Party  with Democratic governors for a 20 year period  and a Democratic majority of both the national congressional delegation and during many sessions of the state legislature  This pattern shifted  beginning with the 1988 election  when Montana elected a Republican governor and sent a Republican to the U S  Senate for the first time since the 1940s  This shift continued with the reapportionment of the state s legislative districts that took effect in 1994  when the Republican Party took control of both chambers of the state legislature  consolidating a Republican party dominance that lasted until 2004  In presidential elections  Montana was long classified as a swing state  though in recent years  Montana has been classified as a Republican leaning state  as the state supported Republican presidential candidates in every election from 1996 to the present  The state last supported a Democrat for president in 1992  when Bill Clinton won a plurality victory  Overall  since 1889 the state has voted for Democratic governors 60 percent of the time and Democratic presidents 40 percent of the time  with these numbers being 40 60 for Republican candidates  In the 2008 presidential election  Montana was considered a swing state and was ultimately won by Republican John McCain  albeit by a narrow margin of two percent  48  However  at the state level  the pattern of split ticket voting and divided government holds  Democrats currently hold both U S  Senate seats  as well as four of the five statewide offices  Governor  Attorney General  Secretary of State and State Auditor   The Legislative branch had split party control between the house and senate most years between 2004 and 2010  when the mid term elections returned both branches to Republican control  The state Senate is  as of 2010  controlled by the Republicans 28 to 22  and the State House of Representatives at 68 to 32  Montana is an Alcoholic beverage control state  Further information  Political party strength in
