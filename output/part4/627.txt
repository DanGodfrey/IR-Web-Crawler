literary work produced in the area of the United States and its preceding colonies  For more specific discussions of poetry and theater  see Poetry of the United States and Theater in the United States  During its early history  America was a series of British colonies on the eastern coast of the present day United States  Therefore  its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature  However  unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition  Contents 1 Colonial

Further reading  edit  Colonial literature Owing to the large immigration to Boston in the 1630s  the high articulation of Puritan cultural ideals  and the early establishment of a college and a printing press in Cambridge  the New England colonies have often been regarded as the center of early American literature  However  the first European settlements in North America had been founded elsewhere many years earlier  Towns older than Boston include the Spanish settlements at Saint Augustine and Santa Fe  the Dutch settlements at Albany and New Amsterdam  as well as the English colony of Jamestown in present day Virginia  During the colonial period  the printing press was active in many areas  from Cambridge and Boston to New York  Philadelphia  and Annapolis  The dominance of the English language was hardly inevitable  1  The first item printed in Pennsylvania was in German and was the largest book printed in any of the colonies before the American Revolution  1  Spanish and French had two of the strongest colonial literary traditions in the areas that now comprise the United States  and discussions of early American literature commonly include texts by  lvar N  ez Cabeza de Vaca and Samuel de Champlain alongside English language texts by Thomas Harriot and John Smith  Moreover  we are now aware of the wealth of oral literary traditions already existing on the continent among the numerous different Native American groups  Political events  however  would eventually make English the lingua franca for the colonies at large as well as the literary language of choice  For instance  when the English conquered New Amsterdam in 1664  they renamed it New York and changed the administrative language from Dutch to English  From 1696 to 1700  only about 250 separate items were issued from the major printing presses in the American colonies  This is a small number compared to the output of the printers in London at the time  However  printing was established in the American colonies before it was allowed in most of England  In England restrictive laws had long confined printing to four locations  London  York  Oxford  and Cambridge  Because of this  the colonies ventured into the modern world earlier than their provincial English counterparts  1  Back then  some of the American literature were pamphlets and writings extolling the benefits of the colonies to both a European and colonist audience  Captain John Smith could be considered the first American author with his works  A True Relation of Such Occurrences and Accidents of Noate as Hath Happened in Virginia     1608  and The Generall Historie of Virginia  New England  and the Summer Isles  1624   Other writers of this manner included Daniel Denton  Thomas Ashe  William Penn  George Percy  William Strachey  Daniel Coxe  Gabriel Thomas  and John Lawson  The religious disputes that prompted settlement in America were also topics of early writing  A journal written by John Winthrop  The History of New England  discussed the religious foundations of the Massachusetts Bay Colony  Edward Winslow also recorded a diary of the first years after the Mayflower s arrival  Other religiously influenced writers included Increase Mather and William Bradford  author of the journal published as a History of Plymouth Plantation  1620 47  Others like Roger Williams and Nathaniel Ward more fiercely argued state and church separation  And still others  like Thomas Morton  cared little for the church  Morton s The New English Canaan mocked the religious settlers and declared that the Native Americans were actually better people than the British  2  Puritan poetry was highly religious in nature  and one of the earliest books of poetry published was the Bay Psalm Book  a set of translations of the biblical Psalms  however  the translators  intention was not to create great literature but to create hymns that could be used in worship  2  Among lyric poets  the most important figures are Anne Bradstreet  who wrote personal poems about her family and homelife  pastor Edward Taylor  whose best poems  the Preparatory Meditations  were written to help him prepare for leading worship  and Michael Wigglesworth  whose best selling poem  The Day of Doom  describes the time of judgment  Nicholas Noyes was also known for his doggerel verse  Other late writings described conflicts and interaction with the Indians  as seen in writings by Daniel Gookin  Alexander Whitaker  John Mason  Benjamin Church  and Mary Rowlandson  John Eliot translated the Bible into the Algonquin language  Of the second generation of New England settlers  Cotton Mather stands out as a theologian and historian  who wrote the history of the colonies with a view to God s activity in their midst and to connecting the Puritan leaders with the great heroes of the Christian faith  His best known works include the Magnalia Christi Americana  the Wonders of the Invisible World and The Biblia Americana  Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield represented the Great Awakening  a religious revival in the early 18th century that asserted strict Calvinism  Other Puritan and religious writers include Thomas Hooker  Thomas Shepard  John Wise  and Samuel Willard  Less strict and serious writers included Samuel Sewall  who wrote a diary revealing the daily life of the late 17th century   2  and Sarah Kemble Knight  New England was not the only area in the colonies  southern literature is represented by the diary of William Byrd of Virginia  as well as by The History of the Dividing Line  which detailed the expedition to survey the swamp between Virginia and North Carolina but which also comments on the different lifestyles of the Native Americans and the white settlers in the area  2  In a similar book  Travels through North and South Carolina  Georgia  East and West  William Bartram described in great detail the Southern landscape and the Native American peoples whom he encountered  Bartram s book was very popular in Europe  being translated into German  French and Dutch  2  As the colonies moved towards their break with England  perhaps one of the most important discussions of American culture and identity came from the French immigrant J  Hector St  John de Cr vec ur  whose Letters from an American Farmer addresses the question what is an American by moving between praise for the opportunities and peace offered in the new society and recognition that the solid life of the farmer must rest uneasily between the oppressive aspects of the urban life  with its luxuries built on slavery  and the lawless aspects of the frontier  where the lack of social structures leads to the loss of civilized living  2  This same period saw the birth of African American literature  through the poetry of Phillis Wheatley and  shortly after the Revolution  the slave narrative of Olaudah Equiano  The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano  This era also saw the birth of Native American literature  through the two published works of Samson Occom  A Sermon Preached at the Execution of Moses Paul and a popular hymnbook  Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs   the first Indian best seller   3  The revolutionary period also contained political writings  including those by colonists Samuel Adams  Josiah Quincy  John Dickinson  and Joseph Galloway  a loyalist to the crown  Two key figures were Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine  Franklin s Poor Richard s Almanac and The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin are esteemed works with their wit and influence toward the formation of a budding American identity  Paine s pamphlet Common Sense and The American Crisis writings are seen as playing a key role in influencing the political tone of the period  During the revolution itself  poems and songs such as  Yankee Doodle  and  Nathan Hale  were popular  Major satirists included John Trumbull and Francis Hopkinson  Philip Morin Freneau also wrote poems about the war s course  During the 18th century  writing shifted focus from the Puritanical ideals of Winthrop and Bradford to the power of the human mind and rational thought  The belief that human and natural occurrences were messages from God no longer fit with the new human centered world  Many intellectuals believed that the human mind could comprehend the universe through the laws of physics as described by Isaac Newton  The enormous scientific  economic  social  and philosophical  changes of the 18th century  called the Enlightenment  impacted the authority of clergyman and scripture  making way for democratic principles  The increase in population helped account for the greater diversity of opinion in religious and political life as seen in the literature of this time  In 1670  the population of the colonies numbered approximately 111 000  Thirty years later it was more than 250 000  By 1760  it reached 1 600 000  1  The growth of communities and therefore social life led people to become more interested in the progress of individuals and their shared experience on the colonies  These new ideals are accounted for in the widespread popularity of Benjamin Franklin s Autobiography   edit  Post independence In the post war period  Thomas Jefferson s United States Declaration of Independence  his influence on the United States Constitution  his autobiography  the Notes on the State of Virginia  and his many letters solidify his spot as one of the most talented early American writers  The Federalist essays by Alexander Hamilton  James Madison  and John Jay presented a significant historical discussion of American government organization and republican values  Fisher Ames  James Otis  and Patrick Henry are also valued for their political writings and orations  Much of the early literature of the new nation struggled to find a uniquely American voice in existing literary genre  and this tendency was also reflected in novels  European forms and styles were often transferred to new locales and critics often saw them as inferior   edit  First American novels It was in the late 18th and early 19th centuries that the nation s first novels were published  These fictions were too lengthy to be printed as manuscript or public reading  Publishers took a chance on these works in hopes they would become steady sellers and need to be reprinted  This was a good bet as literacy rates soared in this period among both men and women  The first American novel is William Hill Brown s The Power of Sympathy published in 1791  1  It depicts a tragic love story between siblings who fell in love without knowing they were related  This epistolary novel belongs to the Sentimental novel tradition  as do the two following  In the next decade important women writers also published novels  Susanna Rowson is best known for her novel  Charlotte  A Tale of Truth  published in London in 1791  4  In 1794 the novel was reissued in Philadelphia under the title  Charlotte Temple  Charlotte Temple is a seduction tale  written in the third person  which warns against listening to the voice of love and counsels resistance  In addition to this best selling novel  she wrote nine novels  six theatrical works  two collections of poetry  six textbooks  and countless songs  4  Reaching more than a million and a half readers over a century and a half  Charlotte Temple was the biggest seller of the 19th century before Stowe s Uncle Tom s Cabin  Although Rowson was extremely popular in her time and is often acknowledged in accounts of the development of the early American novel  Charlotte Temple is often criticized as a sentimental novel of seduction  Hannah Webster Foster s The Coquette  Or  the History of Eliza Wharton was published in 1797 and was also extremely popular  5  Told from Foster s point of view and based on the real life of Eliza Whitman  this epistolary novel is about a woman who is seduced and abandoned  Eliza is a  coquette  who is courted by two very different men  a clergyman who offers her the comfort and regularity of domestic life  and a noted libertine  She fails to choose between them and finds herself single when both men get married  She eventually yields to the artful libertine and gives birth to an illegitimate stillborn child at an inn  The Coquette is praised for its demonstration of this era s contradictory ideals of womanhood  6  Both The Coquette and Charlotte Temple are novels that treat the right of women to live as equals as the new democratic experiment  These novels are of the Sentimental genre  characterized by overindulgence in emotion  an invitation to listen to the voice of reason against misleading passions  as well as an optimistic overemphasis on the essential goodness of humanity  Sentimentalism is often thought to be a reaction against the Calvinistic belief in the depravity of human nature  7  While many of these novels were popular  the economic infrastructure of the time did not allow these writers to make a living through their writing alone  8  The first author to be able to support himself through the income generated by his publications alone was Washington Irving  He completed his first major book in 1809 entitled A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty  9 Charles Brockden Brown is another early American novelist  publishing Wieland in 1798  Ormond in 1799  and Edgar Huntly in 1799  These novels are of the Gothic genre  Of the Picturesque genre  Hugh Henry Brackenridge published Modern Chivalry in 1792 1815  Tabitha Gilman Tenney wrote Female Quixotism  Exhibited in the Romantic Opinions and Extravagant Adventure of Dorcasina Sheldon in 1801  Charlotte Lennox wrote The Female Quixote in 1752  and Royall Tyler wrote The Algerine Captive in 1797  7  Other notable authors include William Gilmore Simms  who wrote Martin Faber in 1833  Guy Rivers in 1834  and The Yemassee in 1835  Lydia Maria Child wrote Hobomok in 1824 and The Rebels in 1825  John Neal wrote Logan  A Family History in 1822  Rachel Dyer in 1828  and The Down Eaters in 1833  Catherine Maria Sedgwick wrote A New England Tale in 1822  Redwood in 1824  Hope Leslie in 1827  and The Linwoods in 1835  James Kirke Paulding wrote The Lion of the West in 1830  The Dutchman s Fireside in 1831  and Westward Ho  in 1832  Robert Montgomery Bird wrote Calavar in 1834 Niguel Miller and Tacoya Hughes and Nick of the Woods in 1837  James Fenimore Cooper was also a notable author best known for his novel  The Last of the Mohicans written in 1826  7   edit  Unique American style With the War of 1812 and an increasing desire to produce uniquely American literature and culture  a number of key new literary figures emerged  perhaps most prominently Washington Irving  William Cullen Bryant  James Fenimore Cooper  and Edgar Allan Poe  Irving  often considered the first writer to develop a unique American style citation needed   although this has been debated  wrote humorous works in Salmagundi and the satire A History of New York  by Diedrich Knickerbocker  1809   Bryant wrote early romantic and nature inspired poetry  which evolved away from their European origins  In 1832  Poe began writing short stories   including  The Masque of the Red Death    The Pit and the Pendulum    The Fall of the House of Usher   and  The Murders in the Rue Morgue    that explore previously hidden levels of human psychology and push the boundaries of fiction toward mystery and fantasy  Cooper s Leatherstocking Tales about Natty Bumppo  which includes The Last of the Mohicans  were popular both in the new country and abroad  Humorous writers were also popular and included Seba Smith and Benjamin P  Shillaber in New England and Davy Crockett  Augustus Baldwin Longstreet  Johnson J  Hooper  Thomas Bangs Thorpe  and George Washington Harris writing about the American frontier  The New England Brahmins were a group of writers connected to Harvard University and its seat in Cambridge  Massachusetts  The core included James Russell Lowell  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow  and Oliver Wendell Holmes  Sr  Ralph Waldo Emerson  In 1836  Ralph Waldo Emerson  1803 1882   an ex minister  published a startling nonfiction work called Nature  in which he claimed it was possible to dispense with organized religion and reach a lofty spiritual state by studying and responding to the natural world  His work influenced not only the writers who gathered around him  forming a movement known as Transcendentalism  but also the public  who heard him lecture  Emerson s most gifted fellow thinker was perhaps Henry David Thoreau  1817 1862   a resolute nonconformist  After living mostly by himself for two years in a cabin by a wooded pond  Thoreau wrote Walden  a book length memoir that urges resistance to the meddlesome dictates of organized society  His radical writings express a deep rooted tendency toward individualism in the American character  Other writers influenced by Transcendentalism were Bronson Alcott  Margaret Fuller  George Ripley  Orestes Brownson  and Jones Very  10  Just as one of the great works of the Revolutionary period was written by a Frenchman  so too was one of the great works about America from this generation  viz   Alexis de Tocqueville s two volume Democracy in America  which  like the colonial explorers  described his travels through the young country  making observations about the relations between democracy  liberty  equality  individualism and community  The political conflict surrounding Abolitionism inspired the writings of William Lloyd Garrison and his paper The Liberator  along with poet John Greenleaf Whittier and Harriet Beecher Stowe in her world famous Uncle Tom s Cabin  These efforts were supported by the continuation of the slave narrative autobiography  of which the best known examples from this period include Frederick Douglass s Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass  an American Slave  Harriet Jacobs s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl  At the same time  Native American autobiography develops  most notably in William Apess s A Son of the Forest and George Copway s The Life  History and Travels of Kah ge ga gah bowh  Moreover  minority authors were beginning to publish fiction  as in William Wells Brown s Clotel  or  The President s Daughter  Martin Delany s Blake  or  The Huts of America and Harriet E  Wilson s Our Nig as early African American novels  and John Rollin Ridge s The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta  The Celebrated California Bandit  which is considered the first Native American novel but which also is an early story about Mexican American issues  Nathaniel Hawthorne  In 1837  the young Nathaniel Hawthorne  1804 1864  collected some of his stories as Twice Told Tales  a volume rich in symbolism and occult incidents  Hawthorne went on to write full length  romances   quasi allegorical novels that explore such themes as guilt  pride  and emotional repression in his native New England  His masterpiece  The Scarlet Letter  is the stark drama of a woman cast out of her community for committing adultery  Hawthorne s fiction had a profound impact on his friend Herman Melville  1819 1891   who first made a name for himself by turning material from his seafaring days into exotic and sensational sea narrative novels  Inspired by Hawthorne s focus on allegories and dark psychology  Melville went on to write romances replete with philosophical speculation  In Moby Dick  an adventurous whaling voyage becomes the vehicle for examining such themes as obsession  the nature of evil  and human struggle against the elements  In another fine work  the short novel Billy Budd  Melville dramatizes the conflicting claims of duty and compassion on board a ship in time of war  His more profound books sold poorly  and he had been long forgotten by the time of his death  He was rediscovered in the early decades of the 20th century  Anti transcendental works from Melville  Hawthorne  and Poe all comprise the Dark Romanticism subgenre of literature popular during this time  American dramatic literature  by contrast  remained dependent on European models  although many playwrights did attempt to apply these forms to American topics and themes  such as immigrants  westward expansion  temperance  etc  At the same time  American playwrights created several long lasting American character types  especially the  Yankee   the  Negro  and the  Indian   exemplified by the characters of Jonathan  Sambo and Metamora  In addition  new dramatic forms were created in the Tom Shows  the showboat theater and the minstrel show  Among the best plays of the period are James Nelson Barker s Superstition  or  the Fanatic Father  Anna Cora Mowatt s Fashion  or  Life in New York  Nathaniel Bannister s Putnam  the Iron Son of  76  Dion Boucicault s The Octoroon  or  Life in Louisiana  and Cornelius Mathews s Witchcraft  or  the Martyrs of Salem  History of modern literature The early modern period 16th century in literature   17th century in

Early American poetry Walt Whitman  1856  See also  American poetry America s two greatest 19th century poets could hardly have been more different in temperament and style  Walt Whitman  1819 1892  was a working man  a traveler  a self appointed nurse during the American Civil War  1861 1865   and a poetic innovator  His magnum opus was Leaves of Grass  in which he uses a free flowing verse and lines of irregular length to depict the all inclusiveness of American democracy  Taking that motif one step further  the poet equates the vast range of American experience with himself without being egotistical  For example  in Song of Myself  the long  central poem in Leaves of Grass  Whitman writes   These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands  they are not original with me      Whitman was also a poet of the body    the body electric   as he called it  In Studies in Classic American Literature  the English novelist D  H  Lawrence wrote that Whitman  was the first to smash the old moral conception that the soul of man is something  superior  and  above  the flesh   Emily Dickinson  1830 1886   on the other hand  lived the sheltered life of a genteel unmarried woman in small town Amherst  Massachusetts  Within its formal structure  her poetry is ingenious  witty  exquisitely wrought  and psychologically penetrating  Her work was unconventional for its day  and little of it was published during her lifetime  Many of her poems dwell on death  often with a mischievous twist  One   Because I could not stop for Death   begins   He kindly stopped for me   The opening of another Dickinson poem toys with her position as a woman in a male dominated society and an unrecognized poet   I m nobody  Who are you    Are you nobody too   American poetry arguably reached its peak in the early to mid 20th century  with such noted writers as Wallace Stevens and his Harmonium  1923  and The Auroras of Autumn  1950   T  S  Eliot and his The Waste Land  1922   Robert Frost and his North of Boston  1914  and New Hampshire  1923   Hart Crane and his White Buildings  1926  and the epic cycle  The Bridge  1930   Ezra Pound  William Carlos Williams and his epic poem about his New Jersey hometown  Paterson  Marianne Moore  E  E  Cummings  Edna St  Vincent Millay and Langston Hughes  in addition to many others   edit  Realism  Twain and James Mark Twain  1907  Mark Twain  the pen name used by Samuel Langhorne Clemens  1835 1910  was the first major American writer to be born away from the East Coast   in the border state of Missouri  His regional masterpieces were the memoir Life on the Mississippi and the novels Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  Twain s style   influenced by journalism  wedded to the vernacular  direct and unadorned but also highly evocative and irreverently humorous   changed the way Americans write their language  His characters speak like real people and sound distinctively American  using local dialects  newly invented words  and regional accents  Other writers interested in regional differences and dialect were George W  Cable  Thomas Nelson Page  Joel Chandler Harris  Mary Noailles Murfree  Charles Egbert Craddock   Sarah Orne Jewett  Mary E  Wilkins Freeman  Henry Cuyler Bunner  and William Sydney Porter  O  Henry   A version of local color regionalism that focused on minority experiences can be seen in the works of Charles W  Chesnutt  African American   of Mar a Ruiz de Burton  one of the earliest Mexican American novelists to write in English  and in the Yiddish inflected works of Abraham Cahan  William Dean Howells also represented the realist tradition through his novels  including The Rise of Silas Lapham and his work as editor of the Atlantic Monthly  Henry James  1843 1916  confronted the Old World New World dilemma by writing directly about it  Although born in New York City  he spent most of his adult years in England  Many of his novels center on Americans who live in or travel to Europe  With its intricate  highly qualified sentences and dissection of emotional and psychological nuance  James s fiction can be daunting  Among his more accessible works are the novellas Daisy Miller  about an enchanting American girl in Europe  and The Turn of the Screw  an enigmatic ghost story  Realism also influenced American drama of the period  in part through the works of Howells but also through the works of such Europeans as Ibsen and Zola  Although realism was most influential in terms of set design and staging audiences loved the special effects offered up by the popular melodramas and in the growth of local color plays  it also showed up in the more subdued  less romantic tone that reflected the effects of the Civil War and continued social turmoil on the American psyche  The most ambitious attempt at bring modern realism into the drama was James Herne s Margaret Fleming  which addressed issues of social determinism through realistic dialogue  psychological insight and symbolism  the play was not a success  as critics and audiences alike felt it dwelt too much on unseemly topics and included improper scenes  such as the main character nursing her husband s illegitimate child onstage   edit  Turn of the 20th century Ernest Hemingway in World War I uniform  At the beginning of the 20th century  American novelists were expanding fiction s social spectrum to encompass both high and low life and sometimes connected to the naturalist school of realism  In her stories and novels  Edith Wharton  1862 1937  scrutinized the upper class  Eastern seaboard society in which she had grown up  One of her finest books  The Age of Innocence  centers on a man who chooses to marry a conventional  socially acceptable woman rather than a fascinating outsider  At about the same time  Stephen Crane  1871 1900   best known for his Civil War novel The Red Badge of Courage  depicted the life of New York City prostitutes in Maggie  A Girl of the Streets  And in Sister Carrie  Theodore Dreiser  1871 1945  portrayed a country girl who moves to Chicago and becomes a kept woman  Hamlin Garland and Frank Norris wrote about the problems of American farmers and other social issues from a naturalist perspective  More directly political writings discussed social issues and power of corporations  Some like Edward Bellamy in Looking Backward outlined other possible political and social frameworks  Upton Sinclair  most famous for his muck raking novel The Jungle  advocated socialism  Other political writers of the period included Edwin Markham  William Vaughn Moody  Journalistic critics  including Ida M  Tarbell and Lincoln Steffens were labeled The Muckrakers  Henry Brooks Adams  literate autobiography  The Education of Henry Adams also depicted a stinging description of the education system and modern life  Experimentation in style and form soon joined the new freedom in subject matter  In 1909  Gertrude Stein  1874 1946   by then an expatriate in Paris  published Three Lives  an innovative work of fiction influenced by her familiarity with cubism  jazz  and other movements in contemporary art and music  Stein labeled a group of American literary notables who lived in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s as the  Lost Generation   The poet Ezra Pound  1885 1972  was born in Idaho but spent much of his adult life in Europe  His work is complex  sometimes obscure  with multiple references to other art forms and to a vast range of literature  both Western and Eastern  He influenced many other poets  notably T  S  Eliot  1888 1965   another expatriate  Eliot wrote spare  cerebral poetry  carried by a dense structure of symbols  In The Waste Land  he embodied a jaundiced vision of post World War I society in fragmented  haunted images  Like Pound s  Eliot s poetry could be highly allusive  and some editions of The Waste Land come with footnotes supplied by the poet  In 1948  Eliot won the Nobel Prize in Literature  Stein  Pound and Eliot  along with Henry James before them  demonstrate the growth of an international perspective in American literature  and not simply because they spend long periods of time overseas  American writers had long looked to European models for inspiration  but whereas the literary breakthroughs of the mid 19th century came from finding distinctly American styles and themes  writers from this period were finding ways of contributing to a flourishing international literary scene  not as imitators but as equals  Something similar was happening back in the States  as Jewish writers  such as Abraham Cahan  used the English language to reach an international Jewish audience  And a small group of Arab American writers known as the Al Rabitah al Qalamiyah  a k a  the  New York Pen League   and under the leadership of Khalil Gibran  were absorbing modernist European influences and thereby introduced innovative forms and themes into Arabic language literature  American writers also expressed the disillusionment following upon the war  The stories and novels of F  Scott Fitzgerald  1896 1940  capture the restless  pleasure hungry  defiant mood of the 1920s  Fitzgerald s characteristic theme  expressed poignantly in The Great Gatsby  is the tendency of youth s golden dreams to dissolve in failure and disappointment  Fitzgerald also elucidates the collapse of some key American Ideals  set out in the Declaration of Independence  such as liberty  social unity  good governance and peace  features which were severely threatened by the pressures of modern early 20th century society  Sinclair Lewis and Sherwood Anderson also wrote novels with critical depictions of American life  John Dos Passos wrote about the war and also the U S A  trilogy which extended into the Depression  F  Scott Fitzgerald  photographed by Carl van Vechten  1937  Ernest Hemingway  1899 1961  saw violence and death first hand as an ambulance driver in World War I  and the carnage persuaded him that abstract language was mostly empty and misleading  He cut out unnecessary words from his writing  simplified the sentence structure  and concentrated on concrete objects and actions  He adhered to a moral code that emphasized grace under pressure  and his protagonists were strong  silent men who often dealt awkwardly with women  The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms are generally considered his best novels  in 1953  he won the Nobel Prize in Literature  Five years before Hemingway  another American novelist had won the Nobel Prize  William Faulkner  1897 1962   Faulkner managed to encompass an enormous range of humanity in Yoknapatawpha County  a Mississippian region of his own invention  He recorded his characters  seemingly unedited ramblings in order to represent their inner states  a technique called  stream of consciousness    In fact  these passages are carefully crafted  and their seemingly chaotic structure conceals multiple layers of meaning   He also jumbled time sequences to show how the past   especially the slave holding era of the Deep South   endures in the present  Among his great works are Absalom  Absalom   As I Lay Dying  The Sound and the Fury  and Light in August   edit  The rise of American drama See also  Theater of the United States Although the United States  theatrical tradition can be traced back to the arrival of Lewis Hallam s troupe in the mid 18th century and was very active in the 19th century  as seen by the popularity of minstrel shows and of adaptations of Uncle Tom s Cabin  American drama attained international status only in the 1920s and 1930s  with the works of Eugene O Neill  who won three Pulitzer Prizes and the Nobel Prize  In the middle of the 20th century  American drama was dominated by the work of playwrights Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller  as well as by the maturation of the American musical  which had found a way to integrate script  music and dance in such works as Oklahoma  and West Side Story  Later American playwrights of importance include Edward Albee  Sam Shepard  David Mamet  Wendy Wasserstein and August Wilson   edit  Depression era literature Depression era literature was blunt and direct in its social criticism  John Steinbeck  1902 1968  was born in Salinas  California  where he set many of his stories  His style was simple and evocative  winning him the favor of the readers but not of the critics  Steinbeck often wrote about poor  working class people and their struggle to lead a decent and honest life  The Grapes of Wrath  considered his masterpiece  is a strong  socially oriented novel that tells the story of the Joads  a poor family from Oklahoma and their journey to California in search of a better life  Other popular novels include Tortilla Flat  Of Mice and Men  Cannery Row  and East of Eden  He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962  Steinbeck s contemporary  Nathanael West s two most famous short novels  Miss Lonelyhearts  which plumbs the life of its eponymous antihero  a reluctant  and  to comic effect  male  advice columnist  and the effects the tragic letters exert on it  and The Day of the Locust  which introduces a cast of Hollywood stereotypes and explores the ironies of the movies  have come to be avowed classics of American literature  Henry Miller assumed a unique place in American Literature in the 1930s when his semi autobiographical novels  written and published in Paris  were banned from the US  Although his major works  including Tropic of Cancer and Black Spring  would not be free of the label of obscenity until 1962  their themes and stylistic innovations had already exerted a major influence on succeeding generations of American writers  and paved the way for sexually frank 1960s novels by John Updike  Philip Roth  Gore Vidal  John Rechy and William Styron   edit  Post World War II  edit  The postwar novel Norman Mailer  photographed by Carl Van Vechten  1948 The period in time from the end of World War II up until  roughly  the late 1960s and early 1970s saw the publication of some of the most popular works in American history such as To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee  The last few of the more realistic modernists along with the wildly Romantic beatniks largely dominated the period  while the direct respondents to America s involvement in World War II contributed in their notable influence  Though born in Canada  Chicago raised Saul Bellow would become one of the most influential novelists in America in the decades directly following World War II  In works like The Adventures of Augie March and Herzog  Bellow painted vivid portraits of the American city and the distinctive characters that peopled it  Bellow went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1976  From J D  Salinger s Nine Stories and The Catcher in the Rye to Sylvia Plath s The Bell Jar  the perceived madness of the state of affairs in America was brought to the forefront of the nation s literary expression  Immigrant authors such as Vladimir Nabokov  with Lolita  forged on with the theme  and  at almost the same time  the beatniks took a concerted step away from their Lost Generation predecessors  developing a style and tone of their own by drawing on Eastern theology and experimenting with recreational drugs  The poetry and fiction of the  Beat Generation   largely born of a circle of intellects formed in New York City around Columbia University and established more officially some time later in San Francisco  came of age  The term Beat referred  all at the same time  to the countercultural rhythm of the Jazz scene  to a sense of rebellion regarding the conservative stress of post war society  and to an interest in new forms of spiritual experience through drugs  alcohol  philosophy  and religion  and specifically through Zen Buddhism  Allen Ginsberg set the tone of the movement in his poem Howl  a Whitmanesque work that began   I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness     Among the most representative achievements of the Beats in the novel are Jack Kerouac s On the Road  1957   the chronicle of a soul searching travel through the continent  and William S  Burroughs s Naked Lunch  1959   a more experimental work structured as a series of vignettes relating  among other things  the narrator s travels and experiments with hard drugs  Regarding the war novel specifically  there was a literary explosion in America during the post World War II era  Some of the best known of the works produced included Norman Mailer s The Naked and the Dead  1948   Joseph Heller s Catch 22  1961  and Kurt Vonnegut Jr  s Slaughterhouse Five  1969   The Moviegoer  1962   by Southern author Walker Percy  winner of the National Book Award  was his attempt at exploring  the dislocation of man in the modern age   11  John Updike In contrast  John Updike approached American life from a more reflective but no less subversive perspective  His 1960 novel Rabbit  Run  the first of four chronicling the rising and falling fortunes of Harry  Rabbit  Angstrom over the course of four decades against the backdrop of the major events of the second half of the 20th century  broke new ground on its release in its characterization and detail of the American middle class and frank discussion of taboo topics such as adultery  Notable among Updike s characteristic innovations was his use of present tense narration  his rich  stylized language  and his attention to sensual detail  His work is also deeply imbued with Christian themes  The two final installments of the Rabbit series  Rabbit is Rich  1981  and Rabbit at Rest  1990   were both awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction  Other notable works include the Henry Bech novels  1970 98   The Witches of Eastwick  1984   Roger s Version  1986  and In the Beauty of the Lilies  1996   which literary critic Michiko Kakutani called  arguably his finest   12  Frequently linked with Updike is the novelist Philip Roth  Roth vigorously explores Jewish identity in American society  especially in the postwar era and the early 21st century  Frequently set in Newark  New Jersey  Roth s work is known to be highly autobiographical  and many of Roth s main characters  most famously the Jewish novelist Nathan Zuckerman  are thought to be alter egos of Roth  With these techniques  and armed with his articulate and fast paced style  Roth explores the distinction between reality and fiction in literature while provocatively examining American culture  His most famous work includes the Zuckerman novels  the controversial Portnoy s Complaint  1969   and Goodbye  Columbus  1959   Among the most decorated American writers of his generation  he has won every major American literary award  including the Pulitzer Prize for his major novel American Pastoral  1997   In the realm of African American literature  Ralph Ellison s 1952 novel Invisible Man was instantly recognized as among the most powerful and important works of the immediate post war years  The story of a black Underground Man in the urban north  the novel laid bare the often repressed racial tension that still prevailed while also succeeding as an existential character study  Richard Wright was catapulted to fame by the publication in subsequent years of his now widely studied short story   The Man Who Was Almost a Man   1939   and his controversial second novel  Native Son  1940   and his legacy was cemented by the 1945 publication of Black Boy  a work in which Wright drew on his childhood and mostly autodidactic education in the segregated South  fictionalizing and exaggerating some elements as he saw fit  Because of its polemical themes and Wright s involvement with the Communist Party  the novel s final part   American Hunger   was not published until 1977  Perhaps the most ambitious and challenging post war American novelist was William Gaddis  whose uncompromising  satiric  and gargantuan novels  such as The Recognitions  1955  and J R  1975  are presented largely in terms of unattributed dialog that requires almost unexampled reader participation  Gaddis s primary themes include forgery  capitalism  religious zealotry  and the legal system  constituting a sustained polyphonic critique of the chaos and chicanery of modern American life  Gaddis s work  though largely ignored for years  anticipated and influenced the development of such ambitious  postmodern  fiction writers as Thomas Pynchon  Joseph McElroy  and Don DeLillo  Another neglected and challenging postwar American novelist  albeit one who writes much shorter works  was John Hawkes  whose often surreal  visionary fiction addresses themes of violence and eroticism and experiments audaciously with narrative voice and style  Among his most important works is the short nightmarish novel The Lime Twig  1961    edit  Short fiction and poetry In the postwar period  the art of the short story again flourished  Among its most respected practitioners was Flannery O Connor  b  March 25  1925 in Georgia   d  August 3  1964 in Georgia   who renewed the fascination of such giants as Faulkner and Twain with the American south  developing a distinctive Southern gothic esthetic wherein characters acted at one level as people and at another as symbols  A devout Catholic  O Connor often imbued her stories  among them the widely studied  A Good Man is Hard to Find  and  Everything That Rises Must Converge   and two novels  Wise Blood  1952   The Violent Bear It Away  1960   with deeply religious themes  focusing particularly on the search for truth and religious skepticism against the backdrop of the nuclear age  Other important practitioners of the form include Katherine Anne Porter  Eudora Welty  John Cheever  Raymond Carver  Tobias Wolff  and the more experimental Donald Barthelme  Among the most respected of the postwar American poets are John Ashbery  the key figure of the surrealistic New York School of poetry  and his celebrated Self portrait in a Convex Mirror  Pulitzer Prize for Poetry  1976   Elizabeth Bishop and her North  amp  South  Pulitzer Prize for Poetry  1956  and  Geography III   National Book Award  1970   Richard Wilbur and his Things of This World  winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for Poetry in 1957  John Berryman and his The Dream Songs   Pulitzer Prize for Poetry  1964  National Book Award  1968   A R  Ammons  whose Collected Poems 1951 1971 won a National Book Award in 1973 and whose long poem Garbage earned him another in 1993  Theodore Roethke and his The Waking  Pulitzer Prize for Poetry  1954   James Merrill and his epic poem of communication with the dead  The Changing Light at Sandover  Pulitzer Prize for Poetry  1977   Louise Gl ck for her The Wild Iris  Pulitzer Prize for Poetry  1993   W S  Merwin for his The Carrier of Ladders  Pulitzer Prize for Poetry  1971  and The Shadow of Sirius  Pulitzer Prize for Poetry  2009   Mark Strand for Blizzard of One  Pulitzer Prize for Poetry  1999   Robert Hass for his Time and Materials  which won both the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award for Poetry in 2008 and 2007 respectively  and Rita Dove for her Thomas and Beulah  Pulitzer Prize for Poetry  1987   In addition  in this same period the confessional  whose origin is often traced to the publication in 1959 of Robert Lowell s Life Studies  13  and beat schools of poetry enjoyed popular and academic success  producing such widely anthologized voices as Allen Ginsberg  Charles Bukowski  Gary Snyder  Anne Sexton  and Sylvia Plath  among many others   edit  Contemporary American literature Though its exact parameters remain debatable  from the early 1970s to the present day the most salient literary movement has been postmodernism  Thomas Pynchon  a seminal practitioner of the form  drew in his work on modernist fixtures such as temporal distortion  unreliable narrators  and internal monologue and coupled them with distinctly postmodern techniques such as metafiction  ideogrammatic characterization  unrealistic names  Oedipa Maas  Benny Profane  etc    absurdist plot elements and hyperbolic humor  deliberate use of anachronisms and archaisms  a strong focus on postcolonial themes  and a subversive commingling of high and low culture  In 1973  he published Gravity s Rainbow  a leading work in this genre  which won the National Book Award and was unanimously nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction that year  His other major works include his debut  V   1963   The Crying of Lot 49  1966   Mason  amp  Dixon  1997   and Against the Day  2006   Toni Morrison at the Miami Book Fair International of 1986 Toni Morrison  the most recent American recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature  writing in a distinctive lyrical prose style  published her controversial debut novel  The Bluest Eye  to widespread critical acclaim in 1970  Coming on the heels of the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1965  the novel  widely studied in American schools  includes an elaborate description of incestuous rape and explores the conventions of beauty established by a historically racist society  painting a portrait of a self immolating black family in search of beauty in whiteness  Since then  Morrison has experimented with lyric fantasy  as in her two best known later works  Song of Solomon  1977  and Beloved  1987   for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction  along these lines  critic Harold Bloom has drawn favorable comparisons to Virginia Woolf  14  and the Nobel committee to  Faulkner and to the Latin American tradition  of magical realism    15 Beloved was chosen in a 2006 survey conducted by the New York Times as the most important work of fiction of the last 25 years  16  Writing in a lyrical  flowing style that eschews excessive use of the comma and semicolon  recalling William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway in equal measure  Cormac McCarthy s body of work seizes on the literary traditions of several regions of the United States and spans multiple genres  He writes in the Southern Gothic aesthetic in his distinctly Faulknerian 1965 debut  The Orchard Keeper  and Suttree  1979   in the Epic Western tradition  with grotesquely drawn characters and symbolic narrative turns reminiscent of Melville  in Blood Meridian  1985   which Harold Bloom styled  the greatest single book since Faulkner s As I Lay Dying   calling the character of Judge Holden  short of Moby Dick  the most monstrous apparition in all of American literature   17  in a much more pastoral tone in his celebrated Border Trilogy  1992 98  of bildungsromans  including All the Pretty Horses  1992   winner of the National Book Award  and in the post apocalyptic genre in the Pulitzer Prize winning The Road  2007   His novels are noted for achieving both commercial and critical success  several of his works having been adapted to film  Don DeLillo  who rose to literary prominence with the publication of his 1985 novel  White Noise  a work broaching the subjects of death and consumerism and doubling as a piece of comic social criticism  began his writing career in 1971 with Americana  He is listed by Harold Bloom as being among the preeminent contemporary American writers  in the company of such giants as Philip Roth  Cormac McCarthy  and Thomas Pynchon  18  His 1997 novel Underworld  a gargantuan work chronicling American life through and immediately after the Cold War and examining with equal depth subjects as various as baseball and nuclear weapons  is generally agreed upon to be his masterpiece and was the runner up in a survey asking writers to identify the most important work of fiction of the last 25 years  16  Among his other important novels are Libra  1988   Mao II  1991  and Falling Man  2007   Jonathan Franzen at the 2008 Brooklyn Book Festival  Seizing on the distinctly postmodern techniques of digression  narrative fragmentation and elaborate symbolism  and strongly influenced by the works of Thomas Pynchon  David Foster Wallace began his writing career with The Broom of the System  published to moderate acclaim in 1987  His second and final novel  Infinite Jest  1997   a futuristic portrait of America and a playful critique of the media saturated nature of American life  has been consistently ranked among the most important works of the 20th century  19  In addition to his novels  he also authored three acclaimed short story collections  Girl with Curious Hair  1989   Brief Interviews with Hideous Men  1999  and Oblivion  2004   Jonathan Franzen  Wallace s friend and contemporary  rose to prominence after the 2001 publication of his National Book Award winning third novel  The Corrections  He began his writing career in 1988 with the well received The Twenty Seventh City  a novel centering on his native St  Louis  but did not gain national attention until the publication of his essay   Perchance to Dream   in Harper s Magazine  discussing the cultural role of the writer in the new millennium through the prism of his own frustrations  The Corrections  a tragicomedy about the disintegrating Lambert family  has been called  the literary phenomenon of  its  decade  20  and was ranked as one of the greatest novels of the past century  19  In 2010  he published Freedom to great critical acclaim  20  21  22  Other notable writers of the turn of the 20th century include Michael Chabon  whose Pulitzer Prize winning The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier  amp  Clay  2000  tells the story of two friends  Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay  as they rise through the ranks of the comics industry in its heyday  Denis Johnson  whose 2007 novel Tree of Smoke about falsified intelligence during Vietnam both won the National Book Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was called by critic Michiko Kakutani  one of the classic works of literature produced by  the Vietnam War    23  and Louise Erdrich  whose 2008 novel The Plague of Doves  a distinctly Faulknerian  polyphonic examination of the tribal experience set against the backdrop of murder in the fictional town of Pluto  ND  was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize   edit  Minority literatures One of the key developments in late 20th century American literature was the rise to prominence of literature written by and about ethnic minorities beyond African Americans and Jewish Americans  who had already established their literary inheritances  This development came alongside the growth of the Civil Rights movements and its corollary  the Ethnic Pride movement  which led to the creation of Ethnic Studies programs in most major universities  These programs helped establish the new ethnic literature as worthy objects of academic study  alongside such other new areas of literary study as women s literature  gay and lesbian literature  working class literature  postcolonial literature  and the rise of literary theory as a key component of academic literary study  After being relegated to cookbooks and autobiographies for most of the 20th century  Asian American literature achieved widespread notice through Maxine Hong Kingston s fictional memoir  The Woman Warrior  1976   and her novels China Men  1980  and Tripmaster Monkey  His Fake Book  Chinese American author Ha Jin in 1999 won the National Book Award for his second novel  Waiting  about a Chinese soldier in the Revolutionary Army who has to wait 18 years to divorce his wife for another woman  all the while having to worry about persecution for his protracted affair  and twice won the PEN Faulkner Award  in 2000 for Waiting and in 2005 for War Trash  Indian American author Jhumpa Lahiri won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her debut collection of short stories  Interpreter of Maladies  1999   and went on to write a well received novel  The Namesake  2003   which was shortly adapted to film in 2007  In her second collection of stories  Unaccustomed Earth  released to widespread commercial and critical success  Lahiri shifts focus and treats the experiences of the second and third generation  Other notable Asian American  but not immigrant  novelists include Amy Tan  best known for her novel  The Joy Luck Club  1989   tracing the lives of four immigrant families brought together by the game of Mahjong  and Korean American novelist Chang Rae Lee  who has published Native Speaker  A Gesture Life  and Aloft  Such poets as Marilyn Chin and Li Young Lee  Kimiko Hahn and Janice Mirikitani have also achieved prominence  as has playwright David Henry Hwang  Equally important has been the effort to recover earlier Asian American authors  started by Frank Chin and his colleagues  this effort has brought Sui Sin Far  Toshio Mori  Carlos Bulosan  John Okada  Hisaye Yamamoto and others to prominence  Latina o literature also became important during this period  starting with acclaimed novels by Tom s Rivera     y no se lo trag  la tierra  and Rudolfo Anaya  Bless Me  Ultima   and the emergence of Chicano theater with Luis Valdez and Teatro Campesino  Latina writing became important thanks to authors such as Sandra Cisneros  an icon of an emerging Chicano literature whose 1984 bildungsroman The House on Mango Street is taught in schools across the United States  Denise Chavez s The Last of the Menu Girls and Gloria Anzald a s Borderlands La Frontera  The New Mestiza  Dominican American author Junot D az  received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his 2007 novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao  which tells the story of an overweight Dominican boy growing up

Nicholasa Mohr  playwright Jos  Rivera  poet Judith Ortiz Cofer  and the Nuyorican Poets Caf   Spurred by the success of N  Scott Momaday s Pulitzer Prize winning House Made of Dawn  Native American literature showed explosive growth during this period  known as the Native American Renaissance  through such novelists as Leslie Marmon Silko  e g   Ceremony   Gerald Vizenor  e g   Bearheart  The Heirship Chronicles and numerous essays on Native American literature   Louise Erdrich  Love Medicine and several other novels that use a recurring set of characters and locations in the manner of William Faulkner   James Welch  e g   Winter in the Blood   Sherman Alexie  e g   The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven   and poets Simon Ortiz and Joy Harjo  The success of these authors has brought renewed attention to earlier generations  including Zitkala Sa  John Joseph Mathews  D Arcy McNickle and Mourning Dove  More recently  Arab American literature  largely unnoticed since the New York Pen League of the 1920s  has become more prominent through the work of Diana Abu Jaber  whose novels include Arabian Jazz and Crescent and the memoir The Language of Baklava  Other important
