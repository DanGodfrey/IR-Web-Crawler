world  led by the United States and its NATO allies  and the communist world  led by the Soviet Union  its satellite states and allies  This began after the success of their temporary wartime alliance against Nazi Germany  leaving the USSR and the US as two superpowers with profound economic and political differences  The Soviet Union created the Eastern Bloc with the eastern European countries it occupied  maintaining these as satellite states  The post war recovery of Western Europe was facilitated by the United States  Marshall Plan  while the Soviet Union  wary of the conditions attached  declined and set up COMECON with its Eastern allies  The United States forged NATO  a military alliance using containment of communism as a main strategy through the Truman Doctrine  in 1949  while the Soviet bloc formed the Warsaw Pact in 1955  Some countries aligned with either of the two powers  whilst others chose to remain neutral with the Non Aligned Movement  The Cold War was so named as it never featured direct military action  since both sides possessed nuclear weapons  and because their use would probably guarantee their mutual assured destruction  Cycles of relative calm would be followed by high tension which could have led to war  The most tense involved the Berlin Blockade  1948 1949   the Korean War  1950 1953   the Berlin Crisis of 1961  the Vietnam War  1959 1975   the Cuban Missile Crisis  1962   the Soviet war in Afghanistan  1979 1989   and the Able Archer 83 NATO exercises in November 1983  The conflict was instead expressed through military coalitions  strategic conventional force deployments  extensive aid to states  espionage  propaganda  conventional and nuclear arms races  appeals to neutral nations  rivalry at sports events  and technological competitions such as the Space Race  The US and USSR fought proxy wars of various types  in Latin America and Southeast Asia  the USSR assisted and helped foster communist revolutions  opposed by several Western countries and their regional allies  some they attempted to roll back through subversion and warfare  with mixed results  To alleviate the risk of a potential nuclear war  both sides sought d tente in the 1970s to relieve political tensions  In the 1980s  the United States increased diplomatic  military  and economic pressures on the Soviet Union  at a time when the nation was already suffering economic stagnation  In the late 1980s  Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the liberalizing reforms of perestroika   reconstruction    reorganization   1987  and glasnost   openness   ca  1985   This opened the country and its satellite states to a mostly peaceful wave of revolutions which culminated in the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991  leaving the United States as the dominant military power  The Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy  and it is often referred to in popular culture  especially in media featuring themes of espionage and the threat of nuclear warfare  Contents 1 Origins of the term 2 Background 3 End of World War II and post war  1945 47  3 1 Wartime conferences regarding post war Europe 3 2 Potsdam Conference and defeat

External links Origins of the term At the end of World War II  English author and journalist George Orwell used cold war  as a general term  in his essay  You and the Atomic Bomb   published October 19  1945  in the British newspaper Tribune  Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of nuclear warfare  Orwell wrote   For forty or fifty years past  Mr  H  G  Wells and others have been warning us that man is in danger of destroying himself with his own weapons  leaving the ants or some other gregarious species to take over  Anyone who has seen the ruined cities of Germany will find this notion at least thinkable  Nevertheless  looking at the world as a whole  the drift for many decades has been not towards anarchy but towards the reimposition of slavery  We may be heading not for general breakdown but for an epoch as horribly stable as the slave empires of antiquity  James Burnham s theory has been much discussed  but few people have yet considered its ideological implications that is  the kind of world view  the kind of beliefs  and the social structure that would probably prevail in a state which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of  cold war  with its neighbors   1  In The Observer of March 10  1946  Orwell wrote that   a fter the Moscow conference last December  Russia began to make a  cold war  on Britain and the British Empire   2  The first use of the term to describe the post World War II geopolitical tensions between the USSR and its satellites and the United States and its western European allies is attributed to Bernard Baruch  an American financier and presidential advisor  3  In South Carolina  on April 16  1947  he delivered a speech  by journalist Herbert Bayard Swope  4  saying   Let us not be deceived  we are today in the midst of a cold war   5  Newspaper reporter columnist Walter Lippmann gave the term wide currency  with the book The Cold War  when asked in 1947 about the source of the term  he referred it to a French term from the 1930s  la guerre froide  6  Background Main article  Origins of the Cold War Further information  Red Scare American troops in Vladivostok  August 1918  during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War  There is disagreement among historians regarding the starting point of the Cold War  While most historians trace its origins to the period immediately following World War II  others argue that it began towards the end of World War I  although tensions between the Russian Empire  other European countries and the United States date back to the middle of the 19th century  7  As a result of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia  followed by its withdrawal from World War I   Soviet Russia found itself isolated in international diplomacy  8  Leader Vladimir Lenin stated that the Soviet Union was surrounded by a  hostile capitalist encirclement   and he viewed diplomacy as a weapon to keep Soviet enemies divided  beginning with the establishment of the Soviet Comintern  which called for revolutionary upheavals abroad  9  Subsequent leader Joseph Stalin  who viewed the Soviet Union as a  socialist island   stated that the Soviet Union must see that  the present capitalist encirclement is replaced by a socialist encirclement   10  As early as 1925  Stalin stated that he viewed international politics as a bipolar world in which the Soviet Union would attract countries gravitating to socialism and capitalist countries would attract states gravitating toward capitalism  while the world was in a period of  temporary stabilization of capitalism  preceding its eventual collapse  11  Various events before the Second World War demonstrated the mutual distrust and suspicion between the Western powers and the Soviet Union  apart from the general philosophical challenge the Bolsheviks made towards capitalism  12  There was Western support of the anti Bolshevik White movement in the Russian Civil War  7  the 1926 Soviet funding of a British general workers strike causing Britain to break relations with the Soviet Union  13  Stalin s 1927 declaration of peaceful coexistence with capitalist countries  receding into the past   14  conspiratorial allegations during the 1928 Shakhty show trial of a planned British  and French led coup d  tat  15  the American refusal to recognize the Soviet Union until 1933 16  and the Stalinist Moscow Trials of the Great Purge  with allegations of British  French  Japanese and Nazi German espionage  17  When the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941  the Allies took advantage of a new front and decided to help the Soviet Union  Britain signed a formal alliance and the United States made an informal agreement  In wartime  the United States supplied both Britain and the Soviets through its Lend Lease Program  18  However  Stalin remained highly suspicious and believed that the British and the Americans had conspired to ensure the Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting against Nazi Germany  According to this view  the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti German front in order to step in at the last moment and shape the peace settlement  Thus  Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers  19  End of World War II and post war  1945 47  Wartime conferences regarding post war Europe The  Big Three  at the Yalta Conference  Winston Churchill  Franklin D  Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin  1945  Further information  Tehran Conference and Yalta Conference The Allies disagreed about how the European map should look  and how borders would be drawn  following the war  20  Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post war security  20  The western Allies desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible  permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through international organizations  21  Given the Russian historical experiences of frequent invasions 22  and the immense death toll  estimated at 27 million  and the destruction the Soviet Union sustained during World War II  23  the Soviet Union sought to increase security by dominating the internal affairs of countries that bordered it  20  24  The Western Allies were themselves deeply divided in their vision of the new post war world  Roosevelt s goals   military victory in both Europe and Asia  the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the British Empire  and the creation of a world peace organization   were more global than Churchill s  which were mainly centered on securing control over the Mediterranean  ensuring the survival of the British Empire  and the independence of Eastern European countries as a buffer between the Soviets and the United Kingdom  25  In the American view  Stalin seemed a potential ally in accomplishing their goals  whereas in the British approach Stalin appeared as the greatest threat to the fulfillment of their agenda  With the Soviets already occupying most of Eastern Europe  Stalin was at an advantage and the two western leaders vied for his favors  The differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets  In October 1944  Churchill traveled to Moscow and agreed to divide the Balkans into respective spheres of influence  and at Yalta Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin in regard of Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and the Reparations  25  Post war Allied occupation zones in Germany  Further Allied negotiations concerning the post war balance took place at the Yalta Conference in February 1945  albeit this conference also failed to reach a firm consensus on the framework for a post war settlement in Europe  26  In April 1945  both Churchill and new United States President Harry S  Truman opposed  among other things  the Soviets  decision to prop up the Lublin government  the Soviet controlled rival to the Polish government in exile  whose relations with the Soviets were severed  27  Following the Allies  May 1945 victory  the Soviets effectively occupied Eastern Europe  26  while strong US and Western allied forces remained in Western Europe  In Allied occupied Germany  the Soviet Union  United States  Britain and France established zones of occupation and a loose framework for four power control  28  The 1945 Allied conference in San Francisco established the multi national United Nations  UN  for the maintenance of world peace  but the enforcement capacity of its Security Council was effectively paralyzed by individual members  ability to use veto power  29  Accordingly  the UN was essentially converted into an inactive forum for exchanging polemical rhetoric  and the Soviets regarded it almost exclusively as a propaganda tribune  30  Potsdam Conference and defeat of Japan Winston Churchill  Harry S  Truman and Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam Conference  1945  Further information  Potsdam Conference and Surrender of Japan At the Potsdam Conference  which started in late July after Germany s surrender  serious differences emerged over the future development of Germany and eastern Europe  31  Moreover  the participants  mounting antipathy and bellicose language served to confirm their suspicions about each others  hostile intentions and entrench their positions  32  At this conference Truman informed Stalin that the United States possessed a powerful new weapon  33  Stalin was aware that the Americans were working on the atomic bomb and  given that the Soviets  own rival program was in place  he reacted to the news calmly  The Soviet leader said he was pleased by the news and expressed the hope that the weapon would be used against Japan  33  One week after the end of the Potsdam Conference  the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki  Shortly after the attacks  Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan  34  Beginnings of the Eastern Bloc Further information  Eastern Bloc Post war territorial changes in Eastern Europe and the formation of the Eastern Bloc  the so called  Iron Curtain   During the final stages of World War II  the Soviet Union laid the foundation for the Eastern Bloc by directly annexing several countries as Soviet Socialist Republics that were initially  and effectively  ceded to it by Nazi Germany in the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact  These included eastern Poland  incorporated into two different SSRs   35 Latvia  which became the Latvian SSR   36  37 Estonia  which became the Estonian SSR   36  37 Lithuania  which became the Lithuanian SSR   36  37  part of eastern Finland  which became the Karelo Finnish SSR  and eastern Romania  which became the Moldavian SSR   38  39  The Eastern European territories liberated from the Nazis and occupied by the Soviet armed forces were added to the Eastern Bloc by converting them into satellite states  40  such as East Germany  41  the People s Republic of Poland  the People s Republic of Bulgaria  the People s Republic of Hungary  42  the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  43  the People s Republic of Romania and the People s Republic of Albania  44  The Soviet style regimes that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced Soviet command economies  but also adopted the brutal methods employed by Joseph Stalin and Soviet secret police to suppress real and potential opposition  45  In Asia  the Red Army had overrun Manchuria in the last month of the war  and went on to occupy the large swathe of Korean territory located north of the 38th parallel  46  As part of consolidating Stalin s control over the Eastern Bloc  the NKVD  led by Lavrentiy Beria  supervised the establishment of Soviet style secret police systems in the Bloc that were supposed to crush anti communist resistance  47  When the slightest stirrings of independence emerged in the Bloc  Stalin s strategy matched that of dealing with domestic pre war rivals  they were removed from power  put on trial  imprisoned  and in several instances  executed  48  British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was concerned that  given the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe at the end of the war  and the perception that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unreliable  there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe  49  In April May 1945  the British War Cabinet s Joint Planning Staff Committee developed Operation Unthinkable  a plan  to impose upon Russia the will of the United States and the British Empire   50  The plan  however  was rejected by the British Chiefs of Staff Committee as militarily unfeasible  49  Tensions build Further information  Long Telegram  Iron Curtain  and Restatement of Policy on Germany In February 1946  George F  Kennan s  Long Telegram  from Moscow helped to articulate the US government s increasingly hard line against the Soviets  and became the basis for US strategy toward the Soviet Union for the duration of the Cold War  51  That September  the Soviet side produced the Novikov telegram  sent by the Soviet ambassador to the US but commissioned and  co authored  by Vyacheslav Molotov  it portrayed the US as being in the grip of monopoly capitalists who were building up military capability  to prepare the conditions for winning world supremacy in a new war   52  On September 6  1946  James F  Byrnes delivered a speech in Germany repudiating the Morgenthau Plan  a proposal to partition and de industrialize post war Germany  and warning the Soviets that the US intended to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely  53  As Byrnes admitted a month later   The nub of our program was to win the German people       it was a battle between us and Russia over minds        54  A few weeks after the release of this  Long Telegram   former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill delivered his famous  Iron Curtain  speech in Fulton  Missouri  55  The speech called for an Anglo American alliance against the Soviets  whom he accused of establishing an  iron curtain  from  Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic   40  56  In 1952  Stalin repeatedly proposed a plan to unify East and West Germany under a single government chosen in elections supervised by the United Nations if the new Germany were to stay out of Western military alliances  but this proposal was turned down by the Western powers  Containment through the Korean War  1947 53  Main article  Cold War  1947 1953  Cominform and the Tito Stalin split Further information  Cominform and Tito Stalin split In September 1947  the Soviets created Cominform  the purpose of which was to enforce orthodoxy within the international communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet satellites through coordination of communist parties in the Eastern Bloc  57  Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June  when the Tito Stalin split obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia  which remained Communist but adopted a non aligned position  58  Containment and the Truman Doctrine European military alliances  Main articles  Containment and Truman Doctrine By 1947  US president Harry S  Truman s advisers urged him to take immediate steps to counter the Soviet Union s influence  citing Stalin s efforts  amid post war confusion and collapse  to undermine the US by encouraging rivalries among capitalists that could precipitate another war  59  In February 1947  the British government announced that it could no longer afford to finance the Greek monarchical military regime in its civil war against communist led insurgents  The American government s response to this announcement was the adoption of containment  60  the goal of which was to stop the spread of communism  Truman delivered a speech that called for the allocation of  400 million to intervene in the war and unveiled the Truman Doctrine  which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes  60  Even though the insurgents were helped by Josip Broz Tito s Yugoslavia  16  US policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to expand Soviet influence  61  Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine marked the beginning of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between Republicans and Democrats focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War  but ultimately held steady  62  63  Moderate and conservative parties in Europe  as well as social democrats  gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance  64  while European and American Communists  paid by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations  65  adhered to Moscow s line  although dissent began to appear after 1956  Other critiques of consensus politics came from anti Vietnam War activists  the CND and the nuclear freeze movement  66  Marshall Plan and Czechoslovak coup d  tat Map of Cold War era Europe and the Near East showing countries that received Marshall Plan aid  The red columns show the relative amount of total aid received per nation  European economic alliances Main articles  Marshall Plan and Czechoslovak coup d  tat of 1948 In early 1947  Britain  France and the United States unsuccessfully attempted to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self sufficient Germany  including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants  goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets  67  In June 1947  in accordance with the Truman Doctrine  the United States enacted the Marshall Plan  a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate  including the Soviet Union  67  The plan s aim was to rebuild the democratic and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to Europe s balance of power  such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections  68  The plan also stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery  69  One month later  Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947  creating a unified Department of Defense  the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA   and the National Security Council  These would become the main bureaucracies for US policy in the Cold War  70  Stalin believed that economic integration with the West would allow Eastern Bloc countries to escape Soviet control  and that the US was trying to buy a pro US re alignment of Europe  57  Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid  57  The Soviet Union s alternative to the Marshall plan  which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with eastern Europe  became known as the Molotov Plan  later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Comecon   16  Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany  his vision of a post war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union  71  In early 1948  following reports of strengthening  reactionary elements   Soviet operatives executed a coup d  tat in Czechoslovakia  the only Eastern Bloc state that the Soviets had permitted to retain democratic structures  72  73  The public brutality of the coup shocked Western powers more than any event up to that point  set in a motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress  74  The twin policies of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan led to billions in economic and military aid for Western Europe  Greece  and Turkey  With US assistance  the Greek military won its civil war  70  The Italian Christian Democrats defeated the powerful Communist Socialist alliance in the elections of 1948  75  At the same time there was increased intelligence and espionage activity  Eastern Bloc defections and diplomatic expulsions  76  Berlin Blockade and airlift C 47s unloading at Tempelhof Airport in Berlin during the Berlin Blockade  Main article  Berlin Blockade The United States and Britain merged their western German occupation zones into  Bizonia   January 1  1947  later  Trizonia  with the addition of France s zone  April 1949   77  As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany  in early 1948  representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system  78  In addition  in accordance with the Marshall Plan  they began to re industrialize and rebuild the German economy  including the introduction of a new Deutsche Mark currency to replace the old Reichsmark currency that the Soviets had debased  79  Shortly thereafter  Stalin instituted the Berlin Blockade  June 24  1948   May 12  1949   one of the first major crises of the Cold War  preventing food  materials and supplies from arriving in West Berlin  80  The United States  Britain  France  Canada  Australia  New Zealand and several other countries began the massive  Berlin airlift   supplying West Berlin with food and other provisions  81  The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the policy change  Once again the East Berlin communists attempted to disrupt the Berlin municipal elections  as they had done in the 1946 elections   77  which were held on December 5  1948 and produced a turnout of 86 3  and an overwhelming victory for the non Communist parties  82  The results effectively divided the city into East and West versions of its former self  300 000 Berliners demonstrated and urged the international airlift to continue  83  and the US accidentally created  Operation Vittles   which supplied candy to German children  84  In May 1949  Stalin backed down and lifted the blockade  47  85  NATO beginnings and Radio Free Europe Main articles  NATO  Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty  and Eastern Bloc information dissemination President Truman signs the National Security Act Amendment of 1949 with guests in the Oval Office  Britain  France  the United States  Canada and eight other western European countries signed the North Atlantic Treaty of April 1949  establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO   47  That August  the first Soviet atomic device was detonated in Semipalatinsk  Kazakh SSR  16  Following Soviet refusals to participate in a German rebuilding effort set forth by western European countries in 1948  78  86  the US  Britain and France spearheaded the establishment of West Germany from the three Western zones of occupation in April 1949  31  87  The Soviet Union proclaimed its zone of occupation in Germany the German Democratic Republic that October  31  Media in the Eastern Bloc was an organ of the state  completely reliant on and subservient to the communist party  with radio and television organizations being state owned  while print media was usually owned by political organizations  mostly by the local communist party  88  Soviet propaganda used Marxist philosophy to attack capitalism  claiming labor exploitation and war mongering imperialism were inherent in the system  89  Along with the broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Voice of America to Eastern Europe  90  a major propaganda effort begun in 1949 was Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty  dedicated to bringing about the peaceful demise of the Communist system in the Eastern Bloc  91  Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station  an alternative to the controlled and party dominated domestic press  91  Radio Free Europe was a product of some of the most prominent architects of America s early Cold War strategy  especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means  such as George F  Kennan  92  American policymakers  including Kennan and John Foster Dulles  acknowledged that the Cold War was in its essence a war of ideas  92  The United States  acting through the CIA  funded a long list of projects to counter the Communist appeal among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world  93  In the early 1950s  the US worked for the rearmament of West Germany and  in 1955  secured its full membership of NATO  31  In May 1953  Beria  by then in a government post  had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow the reunification of a neutral Germany to prevent West Germany s incorporation into NATO  94  Chinese Civil War and SEATO Further information  Chinese Civil War and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization In 1949  Mao Zedong s People s Liberation Army defeated Chiang Kai shek s United States backed Kuomintang  KMT  Nationalist Government in China  and the Soviet Union promptly created an alliance with the newly formed People s Republic of China  95  Chiang and his KMT government retreated to the island of Taiwan  Confronted with the communist revolution in China and the end of the American atomic monopoly in 1949  the Truman administration quickly moved to escalate and expand the containment policy  16  In NSC 68  a secret 1950 document  96  the National Security Council proposed to reinforce pro Western alliance systems and quadruple spending on defense  16  United States officials moved thereafter to expand containment into Asia  Africa  and Latin America  in order to counter revolutionary nationalist movements  often led by communist parties financed by the USSR  fighting against the restoration of Europe s colonial empires in South East Asia and elsewhere  97  In the early 1950s  a period sometimes known as the  Pactomania    the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan  Australia  New Zealand  Thailand and the Philippines  notably ANZUS in 1951 and SEATO in 1954   thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long term military bases  31  Korean War Main article  Korean War One of the more significant impacts of containment was the outbreak of the Korean War  In June 1950  Kim Il Sung s North Korean People s Army invaded South Korea  98  To Joseph Stalin s surprise  16  the UN Security Council backed the defense of South Korea  though the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest that Taiwan and not Communist China held a permanent seat on the Council  99  A UN force of personnel from South Korea  the United States  the United Kingdom  Turkey  Canada  Australia  France  South Africa  the Philippines  the Netherlands  Belgium  New Zealand and other countries joined to stop the invasion  100  General Douglas MacArthur  UN Command CiC  seated   observes the naval shelling of Incheon from the USS Mt  McKinley  September 15  1950  Among other effects  the Korean War galvanised NATO to develop a military structure  101  Public opinion in countries involved  such as Great Britain  was divided for and against the war  Many feared an escalation into a general war with Communist China  and even nuclear war  The strong opposition to the war often strained Anglo American relations  For these reasons British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict  hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and withdrawal of all foreign forces  102  Even though the Chinese and North Koreans were exhausted by the war and were prepared to end it by late 1952  Stalin insisted that they continue fighting  and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953  after Stalin s death  31  North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized and brutal dictatorship  according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable cult of personality  103  104  In the South  the corrupt American backed strongman Syngman Rhee pursued a comparable system of totalitarian rule  105  Albeit Rhee was overthrown after popular protests against his rigged re election victory in 1960  South Korea subsequently fell under a period of military rule that lasted until the re establishment of a multi party system in 1987  Crisis and escalation  1953 62  Main article  Cold War  1953 1962  Khrushchev  Eisenhower and De Stalinization In 1953  changes in political leadership on both sides shifted the dynamic of the Cold War  70 Dwight D  Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January  During the last 18 months of the Truman administration  the American defense budget had quadrupled  and Eisenhower moved to reduce military spending by a third while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively  16  After the death of Joseph Stalin  Nikita Khrushchev became the Soviet leader following the deposition and execution of Lavrentiy Beria and the pushing aside of rivals Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov  On February 25  1956  Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin s crimes  106  As part of a campaign of de Stalinization  he declared that the only way to reform and move away from Stalin s policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past  70  On November 18  1956  while addressing Western ambassadors at a reception at the Polish embassy in Moscow  Khrushchev used his famous  Whether you like it or not  history is on our side  We will bury you  expression  shocking everyone present  107  He later claimed that he had not been talking about nuclear war  but rather about the historically determined victory of communism over capitalism  108  In 1961  Khrushchev declared that even if the USSR was behind the West  within a decade its housing shortage would disappear  consumer goods would be abundant  and within two decades  the  construction of a communist society  in the USSR would be completed  in the main   109  Eisenhower s secretary of state  John Foster Dulles  initiated a  New Look  for the containment strategy  calling for a greater reliance on nuclear weapons against US enemies in wartime  70  Dulles also enunciated the doctrine of  massive retaliation   threatening a severe US response to any Soviet aggression  Possessing nuclear superiority  for example  allowed Eisenhower to face down Soviet threats to intervene in the Middle East during the 1956 Suez Crisis  16  Warsaw Pact and Hungarian Revolution Main articles  Warsaw Pact and Hungarian Revolution of 1956 Map of the Warsaw Pact countries While Stalin s death in 1953 slightly relaxed tensions  the situation in Europe remained an uneasy armed truce  110  The Soviets  who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949  111  established a formal alliance therein  the Warsaw Pact  in 1955  31  The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 occurred shortly after Khrushchev arranged the removal of Hungary s Stalinist leader M ty s R kosi  112  In response to a popular uprising  113  the new regime formally disbanded the secret police  declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and pledged to re establish free elections  The Soviet army invaded  114  Thousands of Hungarians were arrested  imprisoned and deported to the Soviet Union  115  and approximately 200 000 Hungarians fled Hungary in the chaos  116  Hungarian leader Imre Nagy and others were executed following secret trials  117  From 1957 through 1961  Khrushchev openly and repeatedly threatened the West with nuclear annihilation  He claimed that Soviet missile capabilities were far superior to those of the United States  capable of wiping out any American or European city  However  Khrushchev rejected Stalin s belief in the inevitability of war  and declared his new goal was to be  peaceful coexistence   118  This formulation modified the Stalin era Soviet stance  where international class struggle meant the two opposing camps were on an inevitable collision course where communism would triumph through global war  now  peace would allow capitalism to collapse on its own  119  as well as giving the Soviets time to boost their military capabilities  120  which remained for decades until Gorbachev s later  new thinking  envisioning peaceful coexistence as an end in itself rather than a form of class struggle  121  The events in Hungary produced ideological fractures within the Communist parties of the world  particularly in Western Europe  with great decline in membership as many in both western and communist countries felt disillusioned by the brutal Soviet response  122  The communist parties in the west would never recover from the effect the Hungarian Revolution had on their membership  a fact that was immediately recognized by some  such as the Yugoslavian politician Milovan Djilas who shortly after the revolution was crushed said that  The wound which the Hungarian Revolution inflicted on communism can never be completely healed   122  America s pronouncements concentrated on American strength abroad and the success of liberal capitalism  123  However  by the late 1960s  the  battle for men s minds  between two systems of social organization that Kennedy spoke of in 1961 was largely over  with tensions henceforth based primarily on clashing geopolitical objectives rather than ideology  124  Berlin Ultimatum and European integration Main article  Berlin Crisis of 1961   Berlin Ultimatum The maximum territorial extent of countries in the world under Soviet influence  after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 and before the official Sino Soviet split of 1961 During November 1958  Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of Berlin into an independent  demilitarized  free city   giving the United States  Great Britain  and France a six month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin  or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the East Germans  Khrushchev earlier explained to Mao Zedong that  Berlin is the testicles of the West  Every time I want to make the West scream  I squeeze on Berlin   125  NATO formally rejected the ultimatum in mid December and Khrushchev withdrew it in return for a Geneva conference on the German question  126  More broadly  one hallmark of the 1950s was the beginning of European integration a fundamental by product of the Cold War that Truman and Eisenhower promoted politically  economically  and militarily  but which later administrations viewed ambivalently  fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate d tente with the Soviet Union  which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity  127  Worldwide competition Main articles  1953 Iranian coup d  tat  1954 Guatemalan coup d  tat  Congo Crisis  Decolonization  and Wars of national liberation 1961 Soviet postage stamp demanding freedom for African nations  1961 Soviet stamp commemorating Patrice Lumumba  prime minister of the Republic of the Congo  Nationalist movements in some countries and regions  notably Guatemala  Indonesia and Indochina were often allied with communist groups  or perceived in the West to be allied with communists  70  In this context  the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s  128  additionally  the Soviets saw continuing losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology  129  Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence  130  The United States made use of the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  to do away with a string of unfriendly Third World governments and to support allied ones  70  In 1953  President Eisenhower s Central Intelligence Agency implemented Operation Ajax  a covert operation aimed at the overthrow of the Iranian prime minister  Mohammad Mosaddegh  The popularly elected and non aligned Mosaddegh had been a Middle Eastern nemesis of Britain since nationalizing the British owned Anglo Iranian Oil Company in 1951  Churchill told the United States that Mosaddegh was  increasingly turning towards communism  and was moving Iran towards the Soviet sphere  131  132  133  134  The pro Western shah  Mohammad Reza Pahlavi  assumed control as an autocratic monarch  135  The shah s policies included the banning of the communist Tudeh Party and general suppression of political dissent by SAVAK  the shah s domestic security and intelligence agency  In Guatemala  a CIA backed military coup ousted the left wing President Jacobo Arbenz Guzm n in 1954  136  The post Arbenz government  a military junta headed by Carlos Castillo Armas  returned nationalized American property  set up a National Committee of Defense Against Communism  and decreed a Preventive Penal Law Against Communism at the request of the United States  137  In the Republic of the Congo  newly independent from Belgium since June 1960  the CIA cultivated President Joseph Kasa Vubu ordered the dismissal of the democratically elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the Lumumba cabinet in September  Lumumba called for Kasa Vubu s dismissal instead  138  In the ensuing Congo Crisis  the CIA backed Colonel Mobutu quickly mobilized his forces to seize power through a military coup d  tat  138  In British Guiana  the leftist People s Progressive Party  PPP  candidate Cheddi Jagan won the position of chief minister in a colonially administered election in 1953  but was quickly forced to resign from power after Britain s suspension of the still dependent nation s constitution  139  Embarrassed by the landslide electoral victory of Jagan s allegedly Marxist party  the British imprisoned the PPP s leadership and maneuvered the organization into a divisive rupture in 1955  engineering a split between Jagan and his PPP colleagues  140  Jagan again won the colonial elections in 1957 and 1961  despite Britain s shift to a reconsideration of its view of the left wing Jagan as a Soviet style communist at this time  the United States pressured the British to withhold Guyana s independence until an alternative to Jagan could be identified  supported  and brought into office  141  Worn down by the communist guerrilla war for Vietnamese independence and handed a watershed defeat by communist Vietminh rebels at the 1954 Battle of  i n Bi n Ph   the French accepted a negotiated abandonment of their colonial stake in Vietnam  Peace accords signed in Geneva left Vietnam divided between a pro Soviet administration in North Vietnam and a pro Western administration in South Vietnam at the 17th parallel north  Between 1954 and 1961  Eisenhower s United States sent economic aid and military advisers to strengthen South Vietnam s pro Western regime against communist efforts to destabilize it  16  Many emerging nations of Asia  Africa  and Latin America rejected the pressure to choose sides in the East West competition  In 1955  at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia  dozens of Third World governments resolved to stay out of the Cold War  142  The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the Belgrade headquartered Non Aligned Movement in 1961  70  Meanwhile  Khrushchev broadened Moscow s policy to establish ties with India and other key neutral states  Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America  16  Sino Soviet split  space race  ICBMs Charting the progress of the Space Race in 1957 1975  Main articles  Sino Soviet split and Space Race The period after 1956 was marked by serious setbacks for the Soviet Union  most notably the breakdown of the Sino Soviet alliance  beginning the Sino Soviet split  Mao had defended Stalin when Khrushchev attacked him after his death in 1956  and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart  accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge  143  For his part  Khrushchev  disturbed by Mao s glib attitude toward nuclear war  referred to the Chinese leader as a  lunatic on a throne   144  After this  Khrushchev made many desperate attempts to reconstitute the Sino Soviet alliance  but Mao considered it useless and denied any proposal  143  The Chinese Soviet animosity spilled out in an intra communist propaganda war  145  Further on  the Soviets focused on a bitter rivalry with Mao s China for leadership of the global communist movement  146  On the nuclear weapons front  the United States and the USSR pursued nuclear rearmament and developed long range weapons with which they could strike the territory of the other  31  In August 1957  the Soviets successfully launched the world s first intercontinental ballistic missile  ICBM  147  and in October  launched the first Earth satellite  Sputnik  148  The launch of Sputnik inaugurated the Space Race  This culminated in the Apollo Moon landings  which astronaut Frank Borman later described as  just a battle in the Cold War   149  Cuban Revolution and the Bay of Pigs Invasion Main articles  Cuban Revolution and Bay of Pigs Invasion Flag of the July 26 Movement  In Cuba  the July 26 Movement seized power in January 1959  toppling President Fulgencio Batista  whose unpopular regime had been denied arms by the Eisenhower administration  150  Diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States continued for some time after Batista s fall  but President Eisenhower deliberately left the capital to avoid meeting Cuba s young revolutionary leader Fidel Castro during the latter s trip to Washington in April  leaving Vice President Richard Nixon to conduct the meeting in his place  151  Eisenhower s officials were not sure as to whether Castro was a communist  but hostile toward the Cubans  efforts to decrease their economic reliance on the United States  152  In January 1961  just prior to leaving office  Eisenhower formally severed relations with the Cuban government  In April 1961  the administration of newly elected American President John F  Kennedy mounted an unsuccessful CIA organized ship borne invasion of the island at Playa Gir n and Playa Larga in Las Villas Province   a failure that publicly humiliated the United States  152  Castro responded by embracing Marxism Leninism  and the Soviet Union pledged to provide support  152  Berlin Crisis of 1961 Soviet tanks face US tanks at Checkpoint Charlie  on October 27  during the Berlin Crisis of 1961 Main articles  Berlin Crisis of 1961  Berlin Wall  and Eastern Bloc emigration and defection The Berlin Crisis of 1961 was the last major incident in the Cold War regarding the status of Berlin and post World War II Germany  By the early 1950s  the Soviet approach to restricting emigration movement was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc  153  However  hundreds of thousands of East Germans annually emigrated to West Germany through a  loophole  in the system that existed between East and West Berlin  where the four occupying World War II powers governed movement  154  The emigration resulted in a massive  brain drain  from East Germany to West Germany of younger educated professionals  such that nearly 20  of East Germany s population had migrated to West Germany by 1961  155  That June  the Soviet Union issued a new ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of Allied forces from West Berlin  156  The request was rebuffed  and on August 13  East Germany erected a barbed wire barrier that would eventually be expanded through construction into the Berlin Wall  effectively closing the loophole  157  Cuban Missile Crisis and Khrushchev ouster Main articles  Cuban Project and Cuban Missile Crisis A U S  Navy P 2 of VP 18 flying over a Soviet freighter during the Cuban Missile Crisis  Continuing to seek ways to oust Castro following the Bay of Pigs Invasion  Kennedy and his administration experimented with various ways of covertly facilitating the overthrow of the Cuban government  Significant hopes were pinned on a covert program named the Cuban Project  devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961  In February 1962  Khrushchev learned of the American plans regarding Cuba  a  Cuban project    approved by the CIA and stipulating the overthrow of the Cuban government in October  possibly involving the American military   and yet one more Kennedy ordered operation to assassinate Castro  158  Preparations to install Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba were undertaken in response  158  Alarmed  Kennedy considered various reactions  and ultimately responded to the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba with a naval blockade and presented an ultimatum to the Soviets  Khrushchev backed down from a confrontation  and the Soviet Union removed the missiles in return for an American pledge not to invade Cuba again  159  The Cuban Missile Crisis  October November 1962  brought the world closer to nuclear war than ever before  160  It further demonstrated the concept of mutually assured destruction  that neither nuclear power was prepared to use nuclear weapons fearing total destruction via nuclear retaliation  161  The aftermath of the crisis led to the first efforts in the nuclear arms race at nuclear disarmament and improving relations  110  although the Cold War s first arms control agreement  the Antarctic Treaty  had come into force in 1961  162  In 1964  Khrushchev s Kremlin colleagues managed to oust him  but allowed him a peaceful retirement  163  Accused of rudeness and incompetence  he was also credited with ruining Soviet agriculture and bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war  163  Khrushchev had become an international embarrassment when he authorized construction of the Berlin Wall  a public humiliation for Marxism Leninism  163  Confrontation through d tente

the early 1970s In the course of the 1960s and 1970s  Cold War participants struggled to adjust to a new  more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs  70  From the beginning of the post war period  Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s  with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States  while Eastern Bloc economies stagnated  70  164  As a result of the 1973 oil crisis  combined with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  and the Non Aligned Movement  less powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower  97  Meanwhile  Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union s deep seated domestic economic problems  70  During this period  Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of d tente  70  French NATO withdrawal Main article  NATO French withdrawal from NATO command The unity of NATO was breached early in its history  with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle s presidency of France from 1958 onwards  De Gaulle protested at the United States  strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom  In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D  Eisenhower and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on September 17  1958  he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the United States and the United Kingdom  and also for the expansion of NATO s coverage to include geographical areas of interest to France  most notably French Algeria  where France was waging a counter insurgency and sought NATO assistance  165  Considering the response given to be unsatisfactory  de Gaulle began the development of an independent French nuclear deterrent and in 1966 withdrew from NATO s military structures and expelled NATO troops from French soil  166  Czechoslovakia invasion Main articles  Prague Spring and Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia In 1968  a period of political liberalization in Czechoslovakia called the Prague Spring took place that included  Action Program  of liberalizations  which described increasing freedom of the press  freedom of speech and freedom of movement  along with an economic emphasis on consumer goods  the possibility of a multiparty government  limiting the power of the secret police 167  168  and potentially withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact  169  In answer to the Prague Spring  the Soviet army  together with most of their Warsaw Pact allies  invaded Czechoslovakia  170  The invasion was followed by a wave of emigration  including an estimated 70 000 Czechs initially fleeing  with the total eventually reaching 300 000  171  The invasion sparked intense protests from Yugoslavia  Romania and China  and from Western European communist parties  172  Brezhnev Doctrine Leonid Brezhnev and Richard Nixon during Brezhnev s June 1973 visit to Washington  this was a high water mark in d tente between the United States and the Soviet Union  Main article  Brezhnev Doctrine In September 1968  during a speech at the Fifth Congress of the Polish United Workers  Party one month after the invasion of Czechoslovakia  Brezhnev outlined the Brezhnev Doctrine  in which he claimed the right to violate the sovereignty of any country attempting to replace Marxism Leninism with capitalism  During the speech  Brezhnev stated  169  When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism  it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned  but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries  The doctrine found its origins in the failures of Marxism Leninism in states like Poland  Hungary and East Germany  which were facing a declining standard of living contrasting with the prosperity of West Germany and the rest of Western Europe  173  Third World escalations See also  United States occupation of the Dominican Republic  1965 1966   Indonesian killings of 1965 1966  Vietnam War  1973 Chilean coup

an invasion codenamed Operation Power Pack  citing the threat of the emergence of a Cuban style revolution in Latin America  16  Presidential elections held in 1966  during the occupation  handed victory to the conservative Joaqu n Balaguer  Although Balaguer enjoyed a real base of support from sectors of the elites as well as peasants  his formally running Dominican Revolutionary Party  PRD  opponent  former President Juan Bosch  did not actively campaign  174  The PRD s activists were violently harassed by the Dominican police and armed forces  174  In Indonesia  the hardline anti communist General Suharto wrested control of the state from his predecessor Sukarno in an attempt to establish a  New Order   From 1965 to 1966  the military orchestrated the mass killing of an estimated half million members and sympathizers of the Indonesian Communist Party and other leftist organizations  175  Escalating the scale of American intervention in the ongoing conflict between Ng    nh Di m s South Vietnamese government and the communist National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam  NLF  insurgents opposing it  Johnson stationed some 575 000 troops in Southeast Asia to defeat the NLF and their North Vietnamese allies in the Vietnam War  but his costly policy weakened the US economy and  by 1975  ultimately culminated in what most of the world saw as a humiliating defeat of the world s most powerful superpower at the hands of one of the world s poorest nations  16  In Chile  the Socialist Party candidate Salvador Allende won the presidential election of 1970  becoming the first democratically elected Marxist to become president of a country in the Americas  176  Backed by the CIA  General Augusto Pinochet carried out a violent coup against the government on September 11  1973 and quickly consolidated all political power as a military dictator  Allende s reforms of the economy were rolled back and leftist opponents were killed or detained in internment camps under the Direcci n de Inteligencia Nacional  DINA   Additionally  the continent wide South American Operation Condor   employed by dictators in Argentina  Brazil  Bolivia  Chile  Uruguay  and Paraguay to suppress leftist dissent   was backed by the United States  which  sometimes accurately  perceived Soviet or Cuban support behind these opposition movements  177  Displeasing the United States  Jamaica began pursuing closer relations with the Cuban government as a result of Michael Manley s election in 1972  178  The United States  covert response included financing Manley s political opponents  the instigation of mutiny in the Jamaican army  and the fitting out of a private mercenary army against the Manley government  140 Violence ensued  Moreover  the Middle East continued to be a source of contention  Egypt  which received the bulk of its arms and economic assistance from the USSR  was a troublesome client  with a reluctant Soviet Union feeling obliged to assist in both the 1967 Six Day War  with advisers and technicians  and the War of Attrition  with pilots and aircraft  against pro Western Israel  179  Despite the beginning of an Egyptian shift from a pro Soviet to a pro American orientation in 1972  under Egypt s new leader Anwar El Sadat   180  rumors of imminent Soviet intervention on the Egyptians  behalf during the 1973 Yom Kippur War brought about a massive American mobilization that threatened to wreck d tente  181  Although pre Sadat Egypt had been the largest recipient of Soviet aid in the Middle East  the Soviets were also successful in establishing close relations with communist South Yemen  as well as the nationalist governments of Algeria and Iraq  180  Indirect Soviet assistance to the Palestinian side of the Israeli Palestinian conflict included support for Yasser Arafat s Palestine Liberation Organization  PLO   182  In Africa  Somali army officers led by Mohamed Siad Barre carried out a bloodless coup in 1969  creating the socialist Somali Democratic Republic  The Soviet Union vowed to support Somalia  Four years later  the pro American Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in a 1974 coup by the Derg  a radical group of Ethiopian army officers led by the pro Soviet Mengistu Haile Mariam  who built up relations with the Cubans and Soviets  183  When fighting between the Somalis and Ethiopians broke out in the 1977 1978 Somali Ethiopian Ogaden War  Barre lost his Soviet support and allied with the United States  Cuban troops took part in the war on the side of the Ethiopians  183  The 1974 Portuguese Carnation Revolution against the authoritarian Estado Novo returned Portugal to a multi party system and facilitated the independence of the Portuguese colonies Angola and East Timor  In Africa  where Angolan rebels had waged a multi faction independence war against Portuguese rule since 1961  a two decade civil war replaced the anti colonial struggle as fighting erupted between the communist People s Movement for the Liberation of Angola  MPLA   backed by the Cubans and Soviets  and the National Liberation Front of Angola  FNLA   backed by the United States  the People s Republic of China  and Mobutu s government in Zaire  The United States  the apartheid government of South Africa  and several other African governments also supported a third faction  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  UNITA   Without bothering to consult the Soviets in advance  the Cuban government sent its troops to fight alongside the MPLA  183  Apartheid South Africa sent troops to support the UNITA  but the MPLA  bolstered by Cuban personnel and Soviet assistance  eventually gained the upper hand  183  In southeast Asia  the colony of East Timor

1972  As a result of the Sino Soviet split  tensions along the Chinese Soviet border reached their peak in 1969  and United States President Richard Nixon decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War  185  The Chinese had sought improved relations with the Americans in order to gain advantage over the Soviets as well  In February 1972  Nixon announced a stunning rapprochement with Mao s China 186  by traveling to Beijing and meeting with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai  At this time  the USSR achieved rough nuclear parity with the United States  meanwhile  the Vietnam War both weakened America s influence in the Third World and cooled relations with Western Europe  187  Although indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s  tensions were beginning to ease  110  Nixon  Brezhnev  and d tente Leonid Brezhnev and Jimmy Carter sign SALT II treaty  June 18  1979  in Vienna Main articles  Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  Helsinki Accords  and Organization for Security and Co operation in Europe Following his China visit  Nixon met with Soviet leaders  including Brezhnev in Moscow  188  These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks resulted in two landmark arms control treaties  SALT I  the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers  189  and the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty  which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles  These aimed to limit the development of costly anti ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles  70  Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of  peaceful coexistence  and established the groundbreaking new policy of d tente  or cooperation  between the two superpowers  Meanwhile  Brezhnev attempted to revive the Soviet economy  which was declining in part because of heavy military expenditures  16  Between 1972 and 1974  the two sides also agreed to strengthen their economic ties  16  including agreements for increased trade  As a result of their meetings  d tente would replace the hostility of the Cold War and the two countries would live mutually  188  Meanwhile  these developments coincided with the  Ostpolitik  of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt  172  Other agreements were concluded to stabilize the situation in Europe  culminating in the Helsinki Accords signed at the Conference on Security and Co operation in Europe in 1975  190  Late 1970s deterioration of relations In the 1970s  the KGB  led by Yuri Andropov  continued to persecute distinguished Soviet personalities such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov  who were criticising the Soviet leadership in harsh terms  191  Indirect conflict between the superpowers continued through this period of d tente in the Third World  particularly during political crises in the Middle East  Chile  Ethiopia  and Angola  192  Although President Jimmy Carter tried to place another limit on the arms race with a SALT II agreement in 1979  193  his efforts were undermined by the other events that year  including the Iranian Revolution and the Nicaraguan Revolution  which both ousted pro US regimes  and his retaliation against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December  16  Second Cold War  1979 85  Main article  Cold War  1979 1985  The term second Cold War has been used by some historians to refer to the period of intensive reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts in the late 1970s and early 1980s  Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militaristic  12  Soviet war in Afghanistan Main article  Soviet war in Afghanistan During December 1979  approximately 75 000 Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in order to support the Marxist government formed by ex Prime minister Nur Muhammad Taraki  assassinated that September by one of his party rivals  194  In a post Afghan War interview conducted by French weekly newsmagazine Le Nouvel Observateur  President Jimmy Carter s National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski stated that the president had already signed a directive to provide aid to the anti communist mujahideen insurgency against the pro Soviet PDPA government of Afghanistan in July  some six months prior to the Soviet military intervention  195  Asked by the interviewer if he had regrets  given that  the Soviets justified their intervention by asserting that they intended to fight against a secret involvement of the United States in Afghanistan  and that  people didn t believe them   Brzezinski responded    Regret what  The secret operation was an excellent idea  It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it  The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border  I wrote to President Carter  we now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam    196    Carter responded to the Soviet intervention by withdrawing the SALT II treaty from the Senate  imposing embargoes on grain and technology shipments to the USSR  and demanding a significant increase in military spending  and further announced that the United States would boycott the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics  He described the Soviet incursion as  the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War   197  Reagan and Thatcher Further information  Reagan Doctrine Thatcher s Ministry meets with Reagan s Cabinet at the White House  1981 In January 1977  four years prior to becoming president  Ronald Reagan bluntly stated  in a conversation with Richard V  Allen  his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War   My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple  and some would say simplistic   he said   It is this  We win and they lose  What do you think of that   198  In 1980  Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election  vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere  199  Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology  Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an  evil empire  and predicted that Communism would be left on the  ash heap of history   200  Despite anti American sentiment in Iran as a result of the 1979 Iranian Revolution against the pro American shah and an accompanying breakdown in relations with the new Ayatollah Khomeini government over the Iran hostage crisis  the Reagan administration reached out to the anti communist Khomeini in an effort to recruit the theocracy into the American camp in the early 1980s  Then CIA director William Casey described the Khomeini government as  faltering and  possibly  moving toward a moment of truth    The U S  has almost no cards to play  the USSR has many   201  One mode of American support for the Iranians consisted of secret arms sales  In 1983  the CIA passed an extensive list of Iranian communists and other leftists secretly working in the Iranian government to Khomeini s administration  202  A Tower Commission report later observed that the list was utilized to take  measures  including mass executions  that virtually eliminated the pro Soviet infrastructure in Iran   202  By early 1985  Reagan s anti communist position had developed into a stance known as the new Reagan Doctrine   which  in addition to containment  formulated an additional right to subvert existing communist governments  203  Besides continuing Carters  policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of the Soviet Union and the Soviet backed PDPA government in Afghanistan  the CIA also sought to weaken the Soviet Union itself by promoting political Islam in the majority Muslim Central Asian Soviet Union  204  Additionally  the CIA encouraged anti communist Pakistan s Inter Services Intelligence  ISI  agency to train Muslims from around the world to participate in the jihad against the Soviet Union  204  Polish Solidarity movement and martial law Main articles  Solidarity  Polish trade union  and Martial law in Poland Further information  Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980 1981 Pope John Paul II provided a moral focus for anti communism  a visit to his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious

Jaruzelski reacted to the crisis by imposing a period of martial law  Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response  206 Mikhail Suslov  the Kremlin s top ideologist  advised Soviet leaders not to intervene if Poland fell under the control of Solidarity  for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions  representing a catastrophe for the Soviet economy  206  Soviet and US military and

problems in the Soviet system  208  which saw at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years  Soviet investment in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity  but in large part by the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges  209  The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in the world in terms of the numbers and types of weapons they possessed  in the number of troops in their ranks  and in the sheer size of their military industrial base  210  However  the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas which   where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West  211  After ten year old American Samantha Smith wrote a letter to Yuri Andropov expressing her fear of nuclear war  Andropov invited Smith to the Soviet Union  By the early 1980s  the USSR had built up a military arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States  Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  president Carter began massively building up the United States military  This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration  which increased the military spending from 5 3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6 5 percent in 1986  212  the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history  213  Tensions continued intensifying in the early 1980s when Reagan revived the B 1 Lancer program that was canceled by the Carter administration  produced LGM 118 Peacekeepers  214  installed US cruise missiles in Europe  and announced his experimental Strategic Defense Initiative  dubbed  Star Wars  by the media  a defense program to shoot down missiles in mid flight  215  With the background of a buildup in tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States  and the deployment of Soviet RSD 10 Pioneer ballistic missiles targeting Western Europe  NATO decided  under the impetus of the Carter presidency  to deploy MGM 31 Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe  primarily West Germany  216  This deployment would have placed missiles just 10 minutes  striking distance from Moscow  217  After Reagan s military buildup  the Soviet Union did not respond by further building its military 218  because the enormous military expenses  along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture  were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy  219  At the same time  Saudi Arabia increased oil production  220  even as other non OPEC nations were increasing production  221  These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut  which affected the Soviet Union  as oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues  207  219  Issues with command economics  222  oil prices decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation  219  On September 1  1983  the Soviet Union shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007  a Boeing 747 with 269 people aboard  including sitting Congressman Larry McDonald  when it violated Soviet airspace just past the west coast of Sakhalin Island near Moneron Island  an act which Reagan characterized as a  massacre   This act increased support for military deployment  overseen by Reagan  which stood in place until the later accords between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev  223  The Able Archer 83 exercise in November 1983  a realistic simulation of a coordinated NATO nuclear release  has been called most dangerous moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis  as the Soviet leadership keeping a close watch on it considered a nuclear attack to be imminent  224  US domestic public concerns about intervening in foreign conflicts persisted from the end of the Vietnam War  225  The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick  low cost counter insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts  225  In 1983  the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War  invaded Grenada  bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras  anti communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua  97  While Reagan s interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States  his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy  226  Meanwhile  the Soviets incurred high costs for their own foreign interventions  Although Brezhnev was convinced in 1979 that the Soviet war in Afghanistan would be brief  Muslim guerrillas  aided by the US and other countries  waged a fierce resistance against the invasion  227  The Kremlin sent nearly 100 000 troops to support its puppet regime in Afghanistan  leading many outside observers to dub the war  the Soviets  Vietnam   227  However  Moscow s quagmire in Afghanistan was far more disastrous for the Soviets than Vietnam had been for the Americans because the conflict coincided with a period of internal decay and domestic crisis in the Soviet system  A senior US State Department official predicted such an outcome as early as 1980  positing that the invasion resulted in part from a  domestic crisis within the Soviet system      It may be that the thermodynamic law of entropy has     caught up with the Soviet system  which now seems to expend more energy on simply maintaining its equilibrium than on improving itself  We could be seeing a period of foreign movement at a time of internal decay   228  229  Final years  1985 91  Main article  Cold War  1985 1991  Further information  Reagan Doctrine Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan sign the INF Treaty at the White House  1987 Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1988  Gorbachev reforms Further information  Mikhail Gorbachev  perestroika  and glasnost By the time the comparatively youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985  200  the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s  230  These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state  230  An ineffectual start led to the conclusion that deeper structural changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called perestroika  or restructuring  231  Perestroika relaxed the production quota system  allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment  These measures were intended to redirect the country s resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector  231  Despite initial skepticism in the West  the new Soviet leader proved to be committed to reversing the Soviet Union s deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West  110  232  Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms  Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost  or openness  which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions  233 Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption at the top of the Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee  234  Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world  particularly with the United States  contributing to the accelerating d tente between the two nations  235  Thaw in relations Further information  Reykjav k Summit  Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty  START I  and Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany In response to the Kremlin s military and political concessions  Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling back of the arms race  236  The first was held in November 1985 in Geneva  Switzerland  236  At one stage the two men  accompanied only by an interpreter  agreed in principle to reduce each country s nuclear arsenal by 50 percent  237  A second Reykjav k Summit was held in Iceland  Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan s proposed Strategic Defense Initiative  which Gorbachev wanted eliminated  Reagan refused  238  The negotiations failed  but the third summit in 1987 led to a breakthrough with the signing of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty  INF   The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear armed  ground launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5 500 kilometers  300 to 3 400 miles  and their infrastructure  239  East West tensions rapidly subsided through the mid to late 1980s  culminating with the final summit in Moscow in 1989  when Gorbachev and George H  W  Bush signed the START I arms control treaty  240  During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies  along with the cost of maintaining massive troops levels  represented a substantial economic drain  241  In addition  the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of allied states in Eastern Europe  242  In 1989  Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan 243  and by 1990 Gorbachev consented to German reunification  241  the only alternative being a Tiananmen scenario  244  When the Berlin Wall came down  Gorbachev s  Common European Home  concept began to take shape  245  On December 3  1989  Gorbachev and Reagan s successor  George H  W  Bush  declared the Cold War over at the Malta Summit  246  a year later  the two former rivals were partners in the Gulf War against Iraq  247  Faltering Soviet system Further information  Economy of the Soviet Union  Revolutions of 1989  and Baltic Way The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989  By 1989  the Soviet alliance system was on the brink of collapse  and  deprived of Soviet military support  the Communist leaders of the Warsaw Pact states were losing power  243  In the USSR itself  glasnost weakened the bonds that held the Soviet Union together 242  and by February 1990  with the dissolution of the USSR looming  the Communist Party was forced to surrender its 73 year old monopoly on state power  248  At the same time freedom of press and dissent allowed by glasnost and the festering  nationalities question  increasingly led the Union s component republics to declare their autonomy from Moscow  with the Baltic states withdrawing from the Union entirely  249  The 1989 revolutionary wave that swept across Central and Eastern Europe overthrew the Soviet style communist states  such as Poland  Hungary  Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria  250  Romania being the only Eastern bloc country to

Union  1982 1991   and Dissolution of the Soviet Union Commonwealth of Independent States  the official end of the Soviet Union Gorbachev s permissive attitude toward Eastern Europe did not initially extend to Soviet territory  even Bush  who strove to maintain friendly relations  condemned the January 1991 killings in Latvia and Lithuania  privately warning that economic ties would be frozen if the violence continued  252  The USSR was fatally weakened by a failed coup and a growing number of Soviet republics  particularly Russia  who threatened to secede from the USSR  The Commonwealth of Independent States  created on December 21  1991  is viewed as a successor entity to the Soviet Union but  according to Russia s leaders  its purpose was to  allow a civilized divorce  between the Soviet Republics and is comparable to a loose confederation  253  The USSR was declared officially dissolved on December 25  1991  254  Aftermath Main article  Effects of the Cold War NATO CSTO NATO has expanded eastwards into the former Warsaw Pact and parts of the former Soviet Union since the end of the Cold War  Following the Cold War  Russia cut military spending dramatically  creating a wrenching adjustment as the military industrial sector had previously employed one of every five Soviet adults  255  meaning its dismantling left millions throughout the former Soviet Union unemployed  255  After Russia embarked on capitalist economic reforms in the 1990s  it suffered a financial crisis and a recession more severe than the US and Germany had experienced during the Great Depression  256  Russian living standards have worsened overall in the post Cold War years  although the economy has resumed growth since 1999  256  The aftermath of the Cold War continues to influence world affairs  12  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union  the post Cold War world is widely considered as unipolar  with the United States the sole remaining superpower  257  258  259  The Cold War defined the political role of the United States in the post World War II world  by 1989 the US held military alliances with 50 countries  and had 526 000 260  troops posted abroad in dozens of countries  with 326 000 in Europe  two thirds of which in west Germany  261  and about 130 000 in Asia  mainly Japan and South Korea   260  The Cold War also marked the apex of peacetime military industrial complexes  especially in the USA  and large scale military funding of science  262  These complexes  though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century  have grown considerably during the Cold War  The military industrial complexes have great impact on their countries and help shape their society  policy and foreign relations  263  Military expenditures by the US during the Cold War years were estimated to have been  8 trillion  while nearly 100 000 Americans lost their lives in the Korean War and Vietnam War  264  Although the loss of life among Soviet soldiers is difficult to estimate  as a share of their gross national product the financial cost for the Soviet Union was far higher than that incurred by the United States  265  In addition to the loss of life by uniformed soldiers  millions died in the superpowers  proxy wars around the globe  most notably in Southeast Asia  266  Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War  interstate wars  ethnic wars  revolutionary wars  as well as refugee and displaced persons crises have declined sharply in the post Cold War years  267  The aftermath of Cold War conflict  however  is not always easily erased  as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute  12  The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by Communist governments has produced new civil and ethnic conflicts  particularly in the former Yugoslavia  12  In Eastern Europe  the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies  while in other parts of the world  such as Afghanistan  independence was accompanied by state failure  12  Historiography Main article  Historiography of the Cold War As soon as the term  Cold War  was popularized to refer to post war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union  interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians  political scientists  and journalists  268  In particular  historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet US relations after the Second World War  and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable  or could have been avoided  269  Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was  what the sources of the conflict were  and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides  12  Although explanations of the origins of the conflict in academic discussions are complex and diverse  several general schools of thought on the subject can be identified  Historians commonly speak of three differing approaches to the study of the Cold War   orthodox  accounts   revisionism   and  post revisionism   262   Orthodox  accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion into Eastern Europe  262   Revisionist  writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post war peace on the United States  citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II  262   Post revisionists  see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced  and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War  262  Much of the historiography on the Cold War weaves together two or even all three of these broad categories  31  See also conservatism portal Cold War portal American imperialism Canada in
