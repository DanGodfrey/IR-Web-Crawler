2  3  with inventing and building the world s first successful airplane and making the first controlled  powered and sustained heavier than air human flight  on December 17  1903  In the two years afterward  the brothers developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed wing aircraft  Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft  the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed wing powered flight possible  The brothers  fundamental breakthrough was their invention of three axis control  which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium  4  This method became standard and remains standard on fixed wing aircraft of all kinds  5  6  From the beginning of their aeronautical work  the Wright brothers focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving  the flying problem   This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines  7  Using a small homebuilt wind tunnel  the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before  enabling them to design and build wings and propellers that were more efficient than any before  8  9  Their first U S  patent  821 393  did not claim invention of a flying machine  but rather  the invention of a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine s surfaces  10  They gained the mechanical skills essential for their success by working for years in their shop with printing presses  bicycles  motors  and other machinery  Their work with bicycles in particular influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle like a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice  11  From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903  they conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots  Their bicycle shop employee Charlie Taylor became an important part of the team  building their first aircraft engine in close collaboration with the brothers  The Wright brothers  status as inventors of the airplane has been subject to counter claims by various parties  Much controversy persists over the many competing claims of early aviators  Contents 1 Childhood 2 Early career and research 2 1 Ideas about control 3 Flights 3 1 Toward flight 3 2 Gliders 3 2 1 1900

External links Childhood Orville  left  and Wilbur  right  in 1876  The Wright brothers were two of seven children born to Milton Wright  1828 1917  of English and Dutch descent and Susan Catherine Koerner  1831 1889  of German Swiss descent  12  Wilbur was born near Millville  Indiana  in 1867  Orville in Dayton  Ohio  in 1871  The brothers never married  The other Wright siblings were named Reuchlin  1861 1920   Lorin  1862 1939   Katharine  1874 1929   and twins Otis and Ida  born 1870  died in infancy   In elementary school  Orville was given to mischief and was once expelled  13  In 1878 their father  who traveled often as a bishop in the Church of the United Brethren in Christ  brought home a toy  helicopter  for his two younger sons  The device was based on an invention of French aeronautical pioneer Alphonse P naud  Made of paper  bamboo and cork with a rubber band to twirl its rotor  it was about a foot long  Wilbur and Orville played with it until it broke  and then built their own  14  In later years  they pointed to their experience with the toy as the initial spark of their interest in flying  15  Early career and research Wright brothers  home at 7 Hawthorn Street  Dayton about 1900  Wilbur and Orville built the covered wrap around porch in the 1890s  Both brothers attended high school  but did not receive diplomas  The family s abrupt move in 1884 from Richmond  Indiana to Dayton  where the family had lived during the 1870s  prevented Wilbur from receiving his diploma after finishing four years of high school  In the winter of 1885 86 Wilbur was accidentally struck in the face by a hockey stick while playing an ice skating game with friends  resulting in the loss of his front teeth  He had been vigorous and athletic until then  and although his injuries did not appear especially severe  he became withdrawn  and did not attend Yale as planned  Instead  he spent the next few years largely housebound  caring for his mother who was terminally ill with tuberculosis and reading extensively in his father s library  He ably assisted his father during times of controversy within the Brethren Church  16  but also expressed unease over his own lack of ambition  17  Orville dropped out of high school after his junior year to start a printing business in 1889  having designed and built his own printing press with Wilbur s help  Wilbur shook off the lingering depression caused by his accident and joined the print shop  serving as editor while Orville was publisher of the weekly newspaper the West Side News  followed for only a few months by the daily Evening Item  One of their clients for printing jobs was Orville s friend and classmate in high school  Paul Laurence Dunbar  who rose to international acclaim as a ground breaking African American poet and writer  The Wrights printed the Dayton Tattler  a weekly newspaper that Dunbar edited for a brief period  18  Wright brothers  bicycle at the National Air and Space Museum Capitalizing on the national bicycle craze  spurred by the invention of the safety bicycle and its substantial advantages over the penny farthing design   the brothers opened a repair and sales shop in 1892  the Wright Cycle Exchange  later the Wright Cycle Company  and began manufacturing their own brand 19  in 1896  They used this endeavor to fund their growing interest in flight  In the early or mid 1890s they saw newspaper or magazine articles and probably photographs of the dramatic glides by Otto Lilienthal in Germany  The year 1896 brought three important aeronautical events  In May  Smithsonian Institution Secretary Samuel Langley successfully flew an unmanned steam powered model aircraft  In the summer  Chicago engineer and aviation authority Octave Chanute brought together several men who tested various types of gliders over the sand dunes along the shore of Lake Michigan  In August  Lilienthal was killed in the plunge of his glider  20  These events lodged in the consciousness of the brothers  In May 1899 Wilbur wrote a letter 21  to the Smithsonian Institution requesting information and publications about aeronautics  22  Drawing on the work of Sir George Cayley  Chanute  Lilienthal  Leonardo da Vinci  and Langley  they began their mechanical aeronautical experimentation that year  The Wright brothers always presented a unified image to the public  sharing equally in the credit for their invention  Biographers note  however  that Wilbur took the initiative in 1899 1900  writing of  my  machine and  my  plans before Orville became deeply involved when the first person singular became the plural  we  and  our   Author James Tobin asserts   it is impossible to imagine Orville  bright as he was  supplying the driving force that started their work and kept it going from the back room of a store in Ohio to conferences with capitalists  presidents  and kings  Will did that  He was the leader  from the beginning to the end   23  Ideas about control Despite Lilienthal s fate  the brothers favored his strategy  to practice gliding in order to master the art of control before attempting motor driven flight  The death of British aeronaut Percy Pilcher in another hang gliding crash in 1899 only reinforced their opinion that a reliable method of pilot control was the key to successful and safe flight  At the outset of their experiments they regarded control as the unsolved third part of  the flying problem   They believed sufficiently promising knowledge of the other two issues wings and engines already existed  24  The Wright brothers thus differed sharply from more experienced practitioners of the day  notably Ader  Maxim and Langley who built powerful engines  attached them to airframes equipped with unproven control devices  and expected to take to the air with no previous flying experience  Although agreeing with Lilienthal s idea of practice  the Wrights saw that his method of balance and control shifting his body weight was fatally inadequate  25  They were determined to find something better  Wright 1899 kite  front and side views  with control sticks  Wing warping is shown in lower view   Wright Brothers drawing in Library of Congress  On the basis of observation  Wilbur concluded that birds changed the angle of the ends of their wings to make their bodies roll right or left  26  The brothers decided this would also be a good way for a flying machine to turn to  bank  or  lean  into the turn just like a bird and just like a person riding a bicycle  an experience with which they were thoroughly familiar  Equally important  they hoped this method would enable recovery when the wind tilted the machine to one side  lateral balance   They puzzled over how to achieve the same effect with man made wings and eventually discovered wing warping when Wilbur idly twisted a long inner tube box at the bicycle shop  27  Other aeronautical investigators regarded flight as if it were not so different from surface locomotion  except the surface would be elevated  They thought in terms of a ship s rudder for steering  while the flying machine remained essentially level in the air  as did a train or an automobile or a ship at the surface  The idea of deliberately leaning  or rolling  to one side seemed either undesirable or did not enter their thinking  28  Some of these other investigators  including Langley and Chanute  sought the elusive ideal of  inherent stability   believing the pilot of a flying machine would not be able to react quickly enough to wind disturbances to use mechanical controls effectively  The Wright brothers  on the other hand  wanted the pilot to have absolute control  29  For that reason  their early designs made no concessions toward built in stability  such as dihedral wings   They deliberately designed their 1903 first powered flyer with anhedral  drooping  wings  which are inherently unstable  but less susceptible to upset by gusty sidewinds  Flights Toward flight Park Ranger Tom White demonstrates a replica of the Wright brothers 1899 box kite at the Wright Brothers Memorial In July 1899 Wilbur put wing warping to the test by building and flying a biplane kite that had a five foot wingspan  When the wings were warped  or twisted  one end of the wings produced more lift and the other end  less lift  Unequal lift made the wings tilt  or bank  the end with more lift rose  while the other end dropped  causing a turn in the direction of the lower end  Warping was controlled by four cords attached to the kite  The cords led to two sticks held by the kite flyer  who tilted them in opposite directions to twist the wings  In 1900 the brothers journeyed to Kitty Hawk  North Carolina to begin their manned gliding experiments  In a reply to Wilbur s first letter  Octave Chanute had suggested the mid Atlantic coast for its regular breezes and soft sandy landing surface  Wilbur also requested and scrutinized U S  Weather Bureau data  and decided on Kitty Hawk after receiving information from the government meteorologist stationed there  The location  although remote  was closer to Dayton than other places Chanute had suggested  including California and Florida  The spot also gave them privacy from reporters  who had turned the 1896 Chanute experiments at Lake Michigan into something of a circus  Chanute visited them in camp each season from 1901 to 1903 and saw gliding experiments  but not the powered flights  Gliders Main article  Wright Glider Chanute s hang glider of 1896  The pilot may be Augustus Herring  The Wrights based the design of their kite and full size gliders on work done in the 1890s by other aviation pioneers  They adopted the basic design of the Chanute Herring biplane hang glider   double decker  as the Wrights called it   which flew well in the 1896 experiments near Chicago  and used aeronautical data on lift that Lilienthal had published  The Wrights designed the wings with camber  a curvature of the top surface  The brothers did not discover this principle  but took advantage of it  The better lift of a cambered surface compared to a flat one was first discussed scientifically by Sir George Cayley  Lilienthal  whose work the Wrights carefully studied  used cambered wings in his gliders  proving in flight the advantage over flat surfaces  The wooden uprights between the wings of the Wright glider were braced by wires in their own version of Chanute s modified  Pratt truss   a bridge building design he used for his biplane glider  initially built as a triplane   The Wrights mounted the horizontal elevator in front of the wings rather than behind  apparently believing this feature would help to avoid  or protect them  from a nosedive and crash like the one that killed Lilienthal  30  When Brazilian aviation pioneer Santos Dumont flew his 14 bis in Paris in 1906  French newspapers dubbed the tail first arrangement a  canard   because of the supposed resemblance to a duck in flight  31  Wilbur incorrectly believed a tail was not necessary  32  and their first two gliders did not have one  According to some Wright biographers  Wilbur probably did all the gliding until 1902  perhaps to exercise his authority as older brother and to protect Orville from harm  33  34  Glider Vital Statistics 35  Wingspan Wing area Chord Camber Aspect

site   1900 Glider The brothers flew the glider only a few days in the early autumn of 1900 at Kitty Hawk  In the first tests  probably October 3  Wilbur was aboard while the glider flew as a kite not far above the ground with men below holding tether ropes  36  Most of the kite tests were unpiloted with sandbags or chains  and even a local boy  as onboard ballast  The 1900 glider  No photo was taken with a pilot aboard  They tested wing warping using control ropes from the ground  The glider was also tested unmanned while suspended from a small homemade tower  Wilbur  but not Orville  made about a dozen free glides on only a single day  For those tests  the brothers trekked four miles  6 km  south to the Kill Devil Hills  a group of sand dunes up to 100 feet  30 m  high  where they made camp in each of the next three years   Although the glider s lift was less than expected  causing most tests to be unmanned   the brothers were encouraged because the craft s front elevator worked well and they had no accidents  However  the small number of free glides meant they were not able to give wing warping a true test  The pilot lay flat on the lower wing  as planned  to reduce aerodynamic drag  As a glide ended  the pilot was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through an opening in the wing and land on his feet with his arms wrapped over the framework  Within a few glides  however  they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing  headfirst  without undue danger when landing  They made all their flights in that position for the next five years  1901 Glider Orville at Kitty Hawk with the 1901 glider  its nose pointed skyward  it had no tail  Wilbur just after landing the 1901 glider  Glider skid marks are visible behind it  and marks from a previous landing are seen in front  Kitty Hawk  North Carolina  Hoping to improve lift  they built the 1901 glider with a much larger wing area and made 50 to 100 flights in July and August for distances of 20 to 400 ft  6 to 122 m   37  The glider stalled a few times  but the parachute effect of the forward elevator allowed Wilbur to make a safe flat or  pancake  landing  instead of a nose dive  These incidents wedded the Wrights even more strongly to the canard design  which they did not give up until 1910  The glider  however  delivered two major disappointments  It produced only about one third the lift calculated and sometimes failed to respond properly to wing warping  turning opposite the direction intended a problem later known as adverse yaw  On the trip home after their second season  Wilbur  stung with disappointment  remarked to Orville that man would fly  but not in their lifetimes  The poor lift of the gliders led the Wrights to question the accuracy of Lilienthal s data  as well as the  Smeaton coefficient  of air pressure  which had been in existence for over 100 years and was part of the accepted equation for lift  The Lift Equation L   lift in

varies with wing shape  Replica of the Wright brothers  wind tunnel at the Virginia Air and Space Center The Wrights and Lilienthal used the equation to calculate the amount of lift that wings of various sizes would produce  On the basis of measurements of lift and wind during the 1901 glider s kite and free flights  Wilbur believed  correctly  as tests later showed  that the Smeaton number was very close to 0 0033  not the traditionally used 60 percent larger 0 0054  which would exaggerate predicted lift  Back home  furiously pedaling a strange looking bicycle on neighborhood streets  they conducted makeshift open air tests with a miniature Lilienthal airfoil and a counter acting flat plate  which were both attached to a freely rotating third bicycle wheel mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars  Because the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as the calculations predicted  the Wrights confirmed their suspicion that published data on lift were unreliable  and they decided to expand their investigation  They also realized that trial and error with different wings on full size gliders was too costly and time consuming  Putting aside the three wheel bicycle  they built a six foot wind tunnel in their shop and conducted systematic tests on miniature wings from October to December 1901  38  The  balances  they devised and mounted inside the tunnel to hold the wings looked crude  made of bicycle spokes and scrap metal  but were  as critical to the ultimate success of the Wright brothers as were the gliders   39  The devices allowed the brothers to balance lift against drag and accurately calculate the performance of each wing  40  They could also see which wings worked well as they looked through the viewing window in the top of the tunnel  Prior to beginning their wind tunnel experiments  Wilbur  at Chanute s invitation  traveled to Chicago to give a speech to the Western Society of Engineers on September 18  1901  Wilbur s speech consisted of detailed accounts of his and Orville s glider experiments at Kitty Hawk up to the fall of 1901 and was complemented by a lantern slide show of photographs  Wilbur s speech was the first public account of the brothers  experiments  1902 Glider A Big Improvement At left  1901 glider flown by Wilbur  left  and Orville  At right  1902 glider flown by Wilbur  right  and Dan Tate  their helper  Dramatic improvement in performance is apparent  The 1901 glider flies at a steep angle of attack due to poor lift and high drag  In contrast  the 1902 glider flies at a much flatter angle and holds up its tether lines almost vertically  clearly demonstrating a much better lift to drag ratio  Lilienthal had made  whirling arm  tests on only a few wing shapes  and the Wrights mistakenly assumed the data would apply to their wings  which had a different shape  The Wrights took a huge step forward and made basic wind tunnel tests on 200 wings of many shapes and airfoil curves  followed by detailed tests on 38 of them  The tests  according to biographer Howard   were the most crucial and fruitful aeronautical experiments ever conducted in so short a time with so few materials and at so little expense   41  An important discovery was the benefit of longer narrower wings  in aeronautical terms  wings with a larger aspect ratio  wingspan divided by chord the wing s front to back dimension   Such shapes offered much better lift to drag ratio than the broader wings the brothers had tried so far  With this knowledge  and a more accurate Smeaton number  the Wrights designed their 1902 glider  Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel  they made the airfoil flatter  reducing the camber  the depth of the wing s curvature divided by its chord   The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature  a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal  Fully confident in their new wind tunnel results  the Wrights discarded Lilienthal s data  now basing their designs on their own calculations  Wilbur Wright pilots the 1902 glider over the Kill Devil Hills  October 10  1902  The single rear rudder is steerable  it replaced the original fixed double rudder  With characteristic caution  the brothers first flew the 1902 glider as an unmanned kite  as they had done with their two previous versions  Rewarding their wind tunnel work  the glider produced the expected lift  It also had a new structural feature  a fixed  rear vertical rudder  which the brothers hoped would eliminate turning problems  By 1902 they realized that wing warping created  differential drag  at the wingtips  Greater lift at one end of the wing also increased drag  which slowed that end of the wing  making the aircraft swivel or  yaw  so the nose pointed away from the turn  That was how the tailless 1901 glider behaved  The improved wing design enabled consistently longer glides  and the rear rudder prevented adverse yaw so effectively that it introduced a new problem  Sometimes when the pilot attempted to level off from a turn  the glider failed to respond to corrective wing warping and persisted into a tighter turn  The glider would slide toward the lower wing  which hit the ground  spinning the aircraft around  The Wrights called this  well digging   Orville apparently visualized that the fixed rudder resisted the effect of corrective wing warping when attempting to level off from a turn  He wrote in his diary that on the night of October 2   I studied out a new vertical rudder   The brothers then decided to make the rear rudder movable to solve the problem  42  They hinged the rudder and connected it to the pilot s warping  cradle   so a single movement by the pilot simultaneously controlled wing warping and rudder deflection  Tests while gliding proved that the trailing edge of the rudder should be turned away from whichever end of the wings had more drag  and lift  due to warping  The opposing pressure produced by turning the rudder enabled corrective wing warping to reliably restore level flight after a turn or a wind disturbance  Furthermore  when the glider banked into a turn  rudder pressure overcame the effect of differential drag and pointed the nose of the aircraft in the direction of the turn  eliminating adverse yaw  In short  the Wrights discovered the true purpose of the movable vertical rudder  Its role was not to change the direction of flight  but rather  to aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking turns and when leveling off from turns and wind disturbances  43  The actual turn the change in direction was done with roll control using wing warping  The principles remained the same when ailerons superseded wing warping  Wilbur makes a turn using wing warping and the movable rudder  October 24  1902  With their new method the Wrights achieved true control in turns for the first time on October 8  1902  a major milestone  During September and October they made between 700 and 1 000 glides  the longest lasting 26 seconds and covering 622 5 feet  189 7 m   Hundreds of well controlled glides after they made the rudder steerable convinced them they were ready to build a powered flying machine  Thus did three axis control evolve  wing warping for roll  lateral motion   forward elevator for pitch  up and down  and rear rudder for yaw  side to side   On March 23  1903  the Wrights applied for their famous patent for a  Flying Machine   based on their successful 1902 glider  Some aviation historians believe that applying the system of three axis flight control on the 1902 glider was equal to  or even more significant  than the addition of power to the 1903 Flyer  Peter Jakab of the Smithsonian asserts that perfection of the 1902 glider essentially represents invention of the airplane  44  45  Adding power First flight of the Wright Flyer I  December 17  1903  Orville piloting  Wilbur running at wingtip  In 1903 the brothers built the powered Wright Flyer I  using their preferred material for construction  spruce  46  a strong and lightweight wood  and Pride of the West muslin for surface coverings  They also designed and carved their own wooden propellers  and had a purpose built gasoline engine fabricated in their bicycle shop  They thought propeller design would be a simple matter and intended to adapt data from shipbuilding  However  their library research disclosed no established formulas for either marine or air propellers  and they found themselves with no sure starting point  They discussed and argued the question  sometimes heatedly  until they concluded that an aeronautical propeller is essentially a wing rotating in the vertical plane  47  On that basis  they used data from more wind tunnel tests to design their propellers  The finished blades were just over eight feet long  made of three laminations of glued spruce  The Wrights decided on twin  pusher  propellers  counter rotating to cancel torque   which would act on a greater quantity of air than a single relatively slow propeller and not disturb airflow over the leading edge of the wings  Wilbur made a March 1903 entry in his notebook indicating the prototype propeller was 66  efficient  Modern wind tunnel tests on reproduction 1903 propellers show they were more than 75  efficient under the conditions of the first flights  and actually had a peak efficiency of 82   This is a remarkable achievement  considering that modern wooden propellers have a maximum efficiency of 85   48  A Wright engine  serial number 17  circa 1910  is on display at the New England Air Museum in Windsor Locks  Connecticut  The Wrights wrote to several engine manufacturers  but none met their need for a sufficiently lightweight powerplant  They turned to their shop mechanic  Charlie Taylor  who built an engine in just six weeks in close consultation with the brothers  To keep the weight low enough  the engine block was cast from aluminum  a rare practice for the time  The Wright Taylor engine was a primitive version of modern fuel injection systems  having no carburetor or fuel pump  Gasoline was gravity fed into the crankcase through a rubber tube from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut  The propeller drive chains  resembling those of bicycles  were actually supplied by a manufacturer of heavy duty automobile chain drives  49  The Flyer cost less than a thousand dollars  in contrast to more than  50 000 in government funds given to Samuel Langley for his man carrying Great Aerodrome  50  The Flyer had a wingspan of 40 3 ft  12 3 m   weighed 605 lb  274 kg  51  and sported a 12 horsepower  8 9 kW  180 lb  82 kg  engine  52  In camp at Kill Devil Hills  they suffered weeks of delays caused by broken propeller shafts during engine tests  After the shafts were replaced  requiring two trips back to Dayton   Wilbur won a coin toss and made a three second flight attempt on December 14  1903  stalling after takeoff and causing minor damage to the Flyer   Because December 13  1903  was a Sunday  the brothers did not make any attempts that day  even though the weather was good   In a message to their family  Wilbur referred to the trial as having  only partial success   stating  the power is ample  and but for a trifling error due to lack of experience with this machine and this method of starting  the machine would undoubtedly have flown beautifully   53  Following repairs  the Wrights finally took to the air on December 17  1903  making two flights each from level ground into a freezing headwind gusting to 27 miles per hour  43 km h   The first flight  by Orville  of 120 feet  37 m  in 12 seconds  at a speed of only 6 8 miles per hour  10 9 km h  over the ground  was recorded in a famous photograph  The next two flights covered approximately 175 feet  53 m  and 200 feet  61 m   by Wilbur and Orville respectively  Their altitude was about 10 feet  3 0 m  above the ground  54  The following is Orville Wright s account of the final flight of the day  Wilbur started the fourth and last flight at just about 12 o clock  The first few hundred feet were up and down  as before  but by the time three hundred ft had been covered  the machine was under much better control  The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation  However  when out about eight hundred feet the machine began pitching again  and  in one of its darts downward  struck the ground  The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet  the time of the flight was 59 seconds  The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken  but the main part of the machine was not injured at all  We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two  55  Orville s notebook entry of December 17  1903 Five people witnessed the flights  Adam Etheridge  John T  Daniels  who snapped the famous  first flight  photo using Orville s pre positioned camera  and Will Dough  all of the U S  government coastal lifesaving crew  area businessman W C  Brinkley  and Johnny Moore  a teenaged boy who lived in the area  After the men hauled the Flyer back from its fourth flight  a powerful gust of wind flipped it over several times  despite the crew s attempt to hold it down  Severely damaged  the airplane never flew again  The brothers shipped it home  and years later Orville restored it  lending it to several U S  locations for display  then to a British museum  see Smithsonian dispute below   before it was finally installed in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington  D C  in 1948  its current residence  The Wrights sent a telegram about the flights to their father  requesting that he  inform press   However  the Dayton Journal refused to publish the story  saying the flights were too short to be important  Meanwhile  against the brothers  wishes  a telegraph operator leaked their message to a Virginia newspaper  which concocted a highly inaccurate news article that was reprinted the next day in several newspapers elsewhere  including Dayton  56  The Wrights issued their own factual statement to the press in January  Nevertheless  the flights did not create public excitement if people even knew about them and the news soon faded   In Paris  however  Aero Club of France members  already stimulated by Chanute s reports of Wright gliding successes  took the news more seriously and increased their efforts to catch up to the brothers   Modern analysis by Professor Fred E  C  Culick and Henry R  Jex  in 1985  has demonstrated that the 1903 Wright Flyer was so unstable as to be almost unmanageable by anyone but the Wrights  who had trained themselves in the 1902 glider  57  Trouble establishing legitimacy Orville in flight over Huffman Prairie in Wright Flyer II  Flight  85  approximately 1 760 feet  536 m  in 40 1 5 seconds  November 16  1904  In 1904 the Wrights built the Flyer II  They decided to avoid the expense of travel and bringing supplies to the Outer Banks and set up an airfield at Huffman Prairie  a cow pasture eight miles  13 km  northeast of Dayton  They received permission to use the field rent free from owner and bank president Torrance Huffman  They invited reporters to their first flight attempt of the year on May 23  on the condition that no photographs be taken  Engine troubles and slack winds prevented any flying  and they could manage only a very short hop a few days later with fewer reporters present  Some scholars of the Wrights speculate the brothers may have intentionally failed to fly in order to cause reporters to lose interest in their experiments  58  Whether that is true is not known  but after their poor showing local newspapers virtually ignored them for the next year and a half  The Wrights were glad to be free from the distraction of reporters  The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods  After the Kitty Hawk powered flights  the Wrights made a decision to begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could devote themselves to creating and marketing a practical airplane  59  The decision was financially risky  since they were neither wealthy nor government funded  unlike other experimenters such as Ader  Maxim  Langley and Santos Dumont   The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of giving away their invention  it was to be their livelihood  Thus  their secrecy intensified  encouraged by advice from their patent attorney  Henry Toulmin  not to reveal details of their machine  Wilbur flying almost four circles of Huffman Prairie  about 2 and 3 4 miles in 5 minutes 4 seconds  flight  82  November 9  1904  Wilbur s logbook showing diagram and data for first circle flight on September 20  1904 At Huffman Prairie  lighter winds and lower air density than in Kitty Hawk  because of Ohio s higher altitude and higher temperatures  made takeoffs very difficult  and they had to use a much longer starting rail  stretching to hundreds of feet  compared to the 60 foot  18 m  rail at Kitty Hawk  During the spring and summer they suffered many hard landings  real crackups  repeated Flyer damage  and bodily bumps and bruises  On August 13  making an unassisted takeoff  Wilbur finally exceeded their best Kitty Hawk effort with a flight of 1 300 feet  400 m   Then they decided to use a weight powered catapult to make takeoffs easier and tried it for the first time on September 7  On September 20  1904  Wilbur flew the first complete circle in history by a manned heavier than air powered machine  covering 4 080 feet  1 244 m  in about a minute and a half  Their two best flights were November 9 by Wilbur and December 1 by Orville  each exceeding five minutes and covering nearly three miles in almost four circles  By the end of the year the brothers had accumulated about 50 minutes in the air in 105 flights over the rather soggy 85 acre  340 000 m2  pasture  which  remarkably  is virtually unchanged today from its original condition and is now part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park  adjacent to Wright Patterson Air Force Base  Despite progress in 1904  the Flyer was still frequently out of control  60  The Wrights scrapped the battered and much repaired airplane  but saved the engine  and in 1905 built a new Flyer III  which included an important design change  The brothers installed a separate control for the rear rudder instead of linking the rudder to the wing warping  cradle  as before  Each of the three axes pitch  roll and yaw now had its own independent control  Nevertheless  this Flyer offered the same marginal performance as the first two  Its maiden flight was June 23 and the first several flights were no longer than 10 seconds  61  After Orville suffered a bone jarring and potentially fatal crash on July 14  they rebuilt the Flyer with the forward elevator and rear rudder both enlarged and placed several feet farther away from the wings  These modifications greatly improved stability and control  setting the stage for a series of six dramatic  long flights  ranging from 17 to 38 minutes and 11 to 24 miles  39 km  around the three quarter mile course over Huffman Prairie between September 26 and October 5  Wilbur made the last and longest flight  24 5 miles  39 4 km  in 38 minutes and 3 seconds  ending with a safe landing when the fuel ran out  The flight was seen by a number of people  including several invited friends  their father Milton  and neighboring farmers  N 1  Wright Flyer III piloted by Orville over Huffman Prairie  October 4  1905  Flight  46  covering 20 and 3 4 miles in 33 minutes 17 seconds  last photographed flight of the year Reporters showed up the next day  only their second appearance at the field since May the previous year   but the brothers declined to fly  The long flights convinced the Wrights they had achieved their goal of creating a flying machine of  practical utility  which they could offer to sell  The only photos of the flights of 1904 1905 were taken by the brothers   A few photos were damaged in the Great Dayton Flood of 1913  but most survived intact   In 1904 Ohio beekeeping businessman Amos Root  a technology enthusiast  saw a few flights including the first circle  Articles he wrote for his beekeeping magazine were the only published eyewitness reports of the Huffman Prairie flights  except for the unimpressive early hop local newsmen saw  Root offered a report to Scientific American magazine  but the editor turned it down  As a result  the news was not widely known outside of Ohio  and was often met with skepticism  The Paris edition of the Herald Tribune headlined a 1906 article on the Wrights  FLYERS OR LIARS   In years to come Dayton newspapers would proudly celebrate the hometown Wright brothers as national heroes  but the local reporters somehow missed one of the most important stories in history as it was happening a few miles from their doorstep  James M  Cox  publisher at that time of the Dayton Daily News  later governor of Ohio and Democratic presidential nominee in 1920   expressed the attitude of newspapermen and the public in those days when he admitted years later   Frankly  none of us believed it   63  The Dayton Daily News reported the October 5 flight on page 9  with agriculture and business news  N 2  A few newspapers published articles about the long flights  but no reporters or photographers had been there  The lack of splashy eyewitness press coverage was a major reason for disbelief in Washington  D C  and Europe and in journals like Scientific American  whose editors doubted the  alleged experiments  and asked how U S  newspapers   alert as they are  allowed these sensational performances to escape their notice   65  The Wright brothers were certainly complicit in the lack of attention they received  Fearful of competitors stealing their ideas  and still without a patent  they flew on only one more day after October 5  From then on  they refused to fly anywhere unless they had a firm contract to sell their aircraft  They wrote to the U S  government  then to Britain  France and Germany with an offer to sell a flying machine  but were rebuffed because they insisted on a signed contract before giving a demonstration  They were unwilling even to show their photographs of the airborne Flyer  The American military  having recently spent  50 000 on the Langley Aerodrome a product of the nation s foremost scientist only to see it plunge twice into the Potomac River  like a handful of mortar   was particularly unreceptive to the claims of two unknown bicycle makers from Ohio  66  Thus  doubted or scorned  the Wright brothers continued their work in semi obscurity  while other aviation pioneers like Brazilian Alberto Santos Dumont  Henri Farman  Leon Delagrange and American Glenn Curtiss entered the limelight  European skepticism In 1906  skeptics in the European aviation community had converted the press to an anti Wright brothers stance  European newspapers  especially in France  were openly derisive  calling them bluffeurs  bluffers   67 Ernest Archdeacon  founder of the A ro Club de France  was publicly scornful of the brother s claims in spite of published reports  specifically  he wrote several articles and in 1906  stated that  the French would make the first public demonstration of powered flight   68  The Paris edition of the New York Herald summed up Europe s opinion of the Wright brothers in an editorial on February 10  1906  The Wrights have flown or they have not flown  They possess a machine or they do not possess one  They are in fact either fliers or liars  It is difficult to fly  It s easy to say   We have flown   67  Alberto Santos Dumont s public flight in October 1906 was the first certified by the A ro Club de France and the F d ration A ronautique Internationale  FAI   N 3  In 1908  after the Wrights  first flights in France  Archdeacon publicly admitted that he had done them an injustice  68  Contracts and return to Kitty Hawk The Wright brothers made no flights at all in 1906 and 1907  They spent the time attempting to persuade the U S  and European governments that they had invented a successful flying machine and were prepared to negotiate a contract to sell such machines  They also experimented with a pontoon and engine setup on the Miami River  Ohio  in hopes of flying their airplane from the water  These experiments proved unsuccessful  In May 1906 they were finally granted a patent for their flying machine  The modified 1905 Flyer at the Kill Devil Hills in 1908  ready for practice flights   Note there is no catapult derrick  all takeoffs were used with the monorail alone  Replying to the Wrights  letters  the U S  military expressed virtually no interest in their claims  The brothers turned their attention to Europe  especially France where enthusiasm for aviation ran high  and journeyed there for the first time in 1907 for face to face talks with government officials and businessmen  They also met with aviation representatives in Germany and Britain  Before traveling  Orville shipped a newly built Model A Flyer to France in anticipation of demonstration flights  In France Wilbur met Frank P  Lahm  a lieutenant in the U S  Army Aeronautical Division  Writing to his superiors  Lahm smoothed the way for Wilbur to give an in person presentation to the U S  Board of Ordnance and Fortification in Washington  D C  when he returned to the U S  This time  the Board was favorably impressed  in contrast to its previous indifference  With further input from the Wrights  the U S  Army Signal Corps issued Specification  486 in December 1907  inviting bids for construction of an airplane under military contract  70  The Wrights submitted their bid in January  N 4  In early 1908 the brothers also agreed to a contract with a French company  In May they went back to Kitty Hawk with their 1905 Flyer to practice in private for their all important public demonstration flights  as required by both contracts  Their privacy was lost when New York newspapers heard about the tests and sent several reporters to the scene  Soaring flight  Kitty Hawk  Oct   1911  Arrows indicate 50 Mile Wind  Showing How Machine Was Sustained in a Stationary Position  71  Their contracts required them to fly with a passenger  so they modified the 1905 Flyer by installing two seats and adding upright control levers  After tests with sandbags in the passenger seat  Charlie Furnas  a helper from Dayton  became the first fixed wing aircraft passenger on a few short flights May 14  For safety  and as a promise to their father  Wilbur and Orville did not fly together  However  several newspaper accounts at the time mistakenly took Orville s flight with Furnas as both brothers flying together  Later that day after flying solo seven minutes  Wilbur suffered his worst crash when still not well acquainted with the two new control levers he apparently moved one the wrong way and slammed the Flyer into the sand between 40 miles  64 km  and 50 miles  80 km  an hour  He emerged with only bruises and a cut nose  but the accident ended the practice flights and the aircraft s flying career  Return to Glider Flights In October 1911  Orville Wright returned to the Outer Banks again  to improve the aircraft and conduct tests for safety and stabilization with a new glider  On October 24  he soared for nine minutes and 45 seconds  a record that held for almost 10 years  when Gliding as a sport began in the 1920s  72  Public showing Orville demonstrating the flyer to the U S  Army  Fort Myer  Virginia September 1908  Photo  by C H  Claudy  Hart O  Berg  left   the Wrights  business agent  and Wilbur at the flying field near Le Mans  The brothers  contracts with the U S  Army and a French syndicate depended on successful public flight demonstrations that met certain conditions  The brothers had to divide their efforts  Wilbur sailed for Europe  Orville would fly near Washington  D C  Facing a lot of skepticism in the French aeronautical community and outright scorn by some newspapers that called him a  bluffeur   Wilbur began official public demonstrations on August 8  1908 at the Hunaudi res horse racing track near the town of Le Mans  France  His first flight lasted only one minute 45 seconds  but his ability to effortlessly make banking turns and fly a circle amazed and stunned onlookers  including several pioneer French aviators  among them Louis Bleriot  In the following days  Wilbur made a series of technically challenging flights  including figure eights  demonstrating his skills as a pilot and the capability of his flying machine  which far surpassed those of all other pilot pioneers  The French public was thrilled by Wilbur s feats and flocked to the field by the thousands  The Wright brothers catapulted to world fame overnight  Former doubters issued apologies and effusive praise  L A rophile editor Georges Besan on wrote that the flights  have completely dissipated all doubts  Not one of the former detractors of the Wrights dare question  today  the previous experiments of the men who were truly the first to fly      73  Leading French aviation promoter Ernest Archdeacon wrote   For a long time  the Wright brothers have been accused in Europe of bluff    They are today hallowed in France  and I feel an intense pleasure   to make amends   74  On October 7  1908  Edith Berg  the wife of the brothers  European business agent  became the first American woman passenger when she flew with Wilbur  one of many passengers who rode with him that autumn  75  N 5  Wilbur also became acquainted with L on Boll e and his family  Bollee was the owner of an automobile factory where Wilbur would assemble the Flyer and where he would be provided with hired assistance  Bollee would fly that autumn with Wilbur  Madame Bollee had been in the latter stages of pregnancy when Wilbur arrived in LeMans in June 1908 to assemble the Flyer  Wilbur promised her that he would make his first European flight the day her baby was born which he did  August 8  1908  76  Orville followed his brother s success by demonstrating another nearly identical Flyer to the United States Army at Fort Myer  Virginia  starting on September 3  1908  On September 9  he made the first hour long flight  lasting 62 minutes and 15 seconds  Fort Myer crash  Photo by C H  Claudy  Wikisource has original text related to this article  Fatal fall of Wright airship On September 17  Army lieutenant Thomas Selfridge rode along as his passenger  serving as an official observer  A few minutes into the flight at an altitude of about 100 feet  30 m   a propeller split and shattered  sending the aircraft out of control  Selfridge suffered a fractured skull in the crash and died that evening in the nearby Army hospital  becoming the first airplane crash fatality  Orville was badly injured  suffering a broken left leg and four broken ribs  Twelve years later  after he suffered increasingly severe pains  X rays revealed the accident had also caused three hip bone fractures and a dislocated hip  77  The brothers  sister Katharine  a school teacher  rushed from Dayton to Virginia and stayed by Orville s side for the seven weeks of his hospitalization  She helped negotiate a one year extension of the Army contract  A friend visiting Orville in the hospital asked   Has it got your nerve    Nerve   repeated Orville  slightly puzzled   Oh  do you mean will I be afraid to fly again  The only thing I m afraid of is that I can t get well soon enough to finish those tests next year   78  Deeply shocked by the accident  Wilbur determined to make even more impressive flight demonstrations  in the ensuing days and weeks he set new records for altitude and duration  In January 1909 Orville and Katharine joined him in France  and for a time they were the three most famous people in the world  sought after by royalty  the rich  reporters and the public  The kings of England  Spain and Italy came to see Wilbur fly  Wright Model A Flyer flown by Wilbur 1908 1909 and launching derrick  France  1909 The Wrights traveled to Pau  in the south of France  where Wilbur made many more public flights  giving rides to a procession of officers  journalists and statesmen and his sister Katharine on February 15  He trained two French pilots  then transferred the airplane to the French company  In April the Wrights went to Italy where Wilbur assembled another Flyer  giving demonstrations and training more pilots  An Italian cameraman Federico Valle climbed aboard and filmed the first motion picture from an aircraft  After their return to the U S   the brothers and Katharine were invited to the White House where President Taft bestowed awards upon them  Dayton followed up with a lavish two day homecoming celebration  In July 1909 Orville  with Wilbur assisting  completed the proving flights for the U S  Army  meeting the requirements of a two seater able to fly with a passenger for an hour at an average of speed of 40 miles an hour  64 km h  and land undamaged  They sold the aircraft to the Army s Aeronautical Division  U S  Signal Corps for  30 000  which included a  5 000 bonus for exceeding the speed specification   Wilbur climaxed an extraordinary year in early October when he flew at New York City s Hudson Fulton celebrations  circling the Statue of Liberty and making a 33 minute flight up and down the Hudson River alongside Manhattan in view of up to one million New Yorkers  These flights solidly established the fame of the Wright brothers in America  Family flights On May 25  1910 back at Huffman Prairie  Orville piloted two unique flights  First  he took off on a six minute flight with Wilbur as his passenger  the only time the Wright brothers ever flew together  They received permission from their father to make the flight  They had always promised Milton they would never fly together to avoid the chance of a double tragedy and to ensure one brother would remain to continue their experiments  Next  Orville took his 82 year old father on a nearly seven minute flight  the first and only one of Milton Wright s life  The airplane rose to about 350 feet  107 m  while the elderly Wright called to his son   Higher  Orville  higher   79  Patent war See also  The Wright brothers patent war The Wright brothers wrote their 1903 patent application themselves  but it was rejected  In January 1904 they hired Ohio patent attorney Henry Toulmin  and on May 22  1906  they were granted U S  Patent 821393 10  for a  Flying Machine   U S  Patent and Trademark Office archive The patent illustrates a non powered flying machine namely  the 1902 glider  The patent s importance lies in its claim of a new and useful method of controlling a flying machine  powered or not  The technique of wing warping is described  but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine s wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral  roll  control  The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips  by any suitable method  is central to the patent  The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing warping  enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn  a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw  the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider  Finally  the patent describes the forward elevator  used for ascending and descending  Lawsuits begin Attempting to circumvent the patent  Glenn Curtiss and other early aviators devised ailerons to emulate lateral control described in the patent and demonstrated by the Wrights in their public flights  Soon after the historic July 4  1908 one kilometer flight by Curtiss in the June Bug  the Wrights warned him not to infringe their patent by profiting from flying or selling aircraft that used ailerons  Curtiss refused to pay license fees to the Wrights and sold an aircraft equipped with ailerons to the Aeronautic Society of New York in 1909  The Wrights filed a lawsuit  beginning a years long legal conflict  They also sued foreign aviators who flew at U S  exhibitions  including the leading French aviator Louis Paulhan  The Curtiss people derisively suggested that if someone jumped in the air and waved his arms  the Wrights would sue  80  European companies which bought foreign patents the Wrights had received sued other manufacturers in their countries  Those lawsuits were only partly successful  Despite a pro Wright ruling in France  legal maneuvering dragged on until the patent expired in 1917  A German court ruled the patent not valid because of prior disclosure in speeches by Wilbur Wright in 1901 and Octave Chanute in 1903  In the U S  the Wrights made an agreement with the Aero Club of America to license airshows which the Club approved  freeing participating pilots from a legal threat  Promoters of approved shows paid fees to the Wrights  81  The Wright brothers won their initial case against Curtiss in February 1913 when a judge ruled that ailerons were covered under the patent  The Curtiss company appealed the decision  From 1910 until his death from typhoid fever in 1912  Wilbur took the leading role in the patent struggle  traveling incessantly to consult with lawyers and testify in what he felt was a moral cause  particularly against Curtiss  who was creating a large company to manufacture aircraft  The Wrights  preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on new designs  and by 1911 Wright aircraft were considered inferior to those of European makers  Indeed  aviation development in the U S  was suppressed to such an extent that when the U S  entered World War I no acceptable American designed aircraft were available  and U S  forces were compelled to use French machines  Orville and Katharine Wright believed Curtiss was partly responsible for Wilbur s premature death  which occurred in the wake of his exhausting travels and the stress of the legal battle  Victory and cooperation In January 1914  a U S  Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict against the Curtiss company  which continued to avoid penalties through legal tactics  Orville apparently felt vindicated by the decision  and much to the frustration of company executives  he did not push vigorously for further legal action to ensure a manufacturing monopoly  In fact  he was planning to sell the company and departed in 1915  In 1917  with World War I underway  the U S  government pressured the industry to form a cross licensing organization  the Manufacturers Aircraft Association  to which member companies paid a blanket fee for the use of aviation patents  including the original and subsequent Wright patents  82  N 6  The Wright Martin company  successor to the Wright company  and the Curtiss company  which held a number of its own patents  each received a  2 million payment  83  N 7  84  The  patent war  ended  although side issues lingered in the courts until the 1920s  In a twist of irony  the Wright Aeronautical Corporation  another successor  and the Curtiss Aeroplane company merged in 1929 to form the Curtiss Wright corporation  which remains in business today producing high tech components for the aerospace industry  Friendship ends The lawsuits damaged the public image of the Wright brothers  who were generally regarded before this as heroes  Critics said the brothers were greedy and unfair and compared their actions unfavorably to European inventors  who worked more openly  Supporters said the brothers were protecting their interests and were justified in expecting fair compensation for the years of work leading to their successful invention  Their 10 year friendship with Octave Chanute  already strained by tension over how much credit  if any  he might deserve for their success  collapsed after he publicly criticized their actions  In business Wright brothers at the Belmont Park Aviation Meet in 1910 The Wright Company was incorporated on November 22  1909  The brothers sold their patents to the company for  100 000 and also received one third of the shares in a million dollar stock issue and a 10 percent royalty on every airplane sold  85  With Wilbur as president and Orville as vice president  the company set up a factory in Dayton and a flying school test flight field at Huffman Prairie  the headquarters office was in New York City  In mid 1910  the Wrights changed the design of the Wright Flyer  moving the horizontal elevator from the front to the back and adding wheels although keeping the skids as part of the undercarriage unit  It had become apparent by then that a rear elevator would make the airplane easier to control  especially as higher speeds grew more common  This aircraft was designated the  Model B   although the original canard design was never referred to as the  Model A  by the Wrights  However  the US Signal Corps which bought the aircraft did call it  Wright Type A   86  N 8  There were not many customers for aircraft  so in the spring of 1910 the Wrights hired and trained a team of salaried exhibition pilots to show off their machines and win prize money for the company despite Wilbur s disdain for what he called  the mountebank business   The team debuted at the Indianapolis Speedway on June 13  Before the year was over  pilots Ralph Johnstone and Arch Hoxsey died in air show crashes  and in November 1911 the brothers disbanded the team on which nine men had served  four other former team members died in crashes afterward   87  The Wright Company transported the first known commercial air cargo on November 7  1910 by flying two bolts of dress silk 65 miles  105 km  from Dayton to Columbus  Ohio for the Morehouse Martens Department Store  which paid a  5 000 fee  Company pilot Phil Parmelee made the flight which was more an exercise in advertising than a simple delivery in an hour and six minutes with the cargo strapped in the passenger s seat  The silk was cut into small pieces and sold as souvenirs  Between 1910 and 1916 the Wright Company flying school at Huffman Prairie trained 115 pilots who were instructed by Orville and his assistants  Several trainees became famous  including Henry  Hap  Arnold  who rose to Five Star General  commanded U S  Army Air Forces in World War II  and became first head of the U S  Air Force  Calbraith Perry Rodgers  who made the first coast to coast flight in 1911  with many stops and crashes  in a Wright Model EX named the  Vin Fiz  after the sponsor s soft drink  and Eddie Stinson  founder of the Stinson Aircraft Company  Problem airplanes in the Army In 1912 1913 a series of fatal crashes of Wright aircraft bought by the U S  Army called into question their safety and design  The death toll reached 11 by 1913  half of them in the Wright model C  All six model C Army airplanes crashed  They had a tendency to nose dive  88  but Orville insisted that stalls were caused by pilot error  89  He cooperated with the Army to equip the airplane with a rudimentary flight indicator to help the pilot avoid climbing too steeply  A government investigation said the Wright C was  dynamically unsuited for flying   88  and the military ended its use of airplanes with  pusher  type propellers  including models made by both the Wright and Curtiss companies  in which the engine was located behind the pilot and likely to crush him in a crash  Orville resisted the switch to manufacturing  tractor  type propeller airplanes  worried that a design change could threaten the Wright patent infringement case against Curtiss  90  Smithsonian feud Samuel P  Langley  secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from 1887 until his death in 1906  experimented for years with model flying machines and successfully flew unmanned powered model aircraft in 1896 and 1903  Two tests of his manned full size motor driven Aerodrome in October and December 1903  however  were complete failures  Nevertheless  the Smithsonian later proudly displayed the Aerodrome in its museum as the first heavier than air craft  capable  of manned powered flight  relegating the Wright brothers  invention to secondary status and ironically triggering a decades long feud with Orville Wright  whose brother had received help from the Smithsonian when beginning his own quest for flight  Glenn Curtiss or an assistant coaxes the structurally modified Langley Aerodrome into the air above the surface of Keuka Lake near Hammondsport  New York  September 17  1914  The Smithsonian based its claim for the Aerodrome on short test flights Glenn Curtiss and his team made with it in 1914  The Smithsonian allowed Curtiss  in an unsavory alliance  to make major modifications to the craft before attempting to fly it  91  N 9  The Smithsonian hoped to salvage Langley s aeronautical reputation by proving the Aerodrome could fly  Curtiss wanted to prove the same thing to defeat the Wrights  patent lawsuits against him  The tests had no effect on the patent battle  but the Smithsonian made the most of them  honoring the Aerodrome in its museum and publications  The Institution did not reveal the extensive Curtiss modifications  but Orville Wright learned of them from his brother Lorin and a close friend  Griffith Brewer  who both witnessed and photographed some of the tests  92  Orville repeatedly objected to misrepresentation of the Aerodrome  but the Smithsonian was unyielding  Orville responded by loaning the restored 1903 Kitty Hawk Flyer to the London Science Museum in 1928  refusing to donate it to the Smithsonian while the Institution  perverted  the history of the flying machine  93  Subsequently Orville would never see his invention again as he would die before its return to the United States  Charles Lindbergh attempted to mediate the dispute  to no avail  In 1942  after years of bad publicity  and encouraged by Wright biographer Fred C  Kelly  the Smithsonian finally relented by publishing  for the first time  a list of the Aerodrome modifications and recanting misleading statements it had made about the 1914 tests  94  Orville then privately requested the British museum to return the Flyer  but the airplane remained in protective storage for the duration of World War II and finally came home after Orville s death  On November 23  1948  the executors of Orville s estate signed an agreement for the Smithsonian to purchase the Flyer for one dollar  At the insistence of the executors  the agreement also included strict conditions for display of the airplane  Original 1903 Wright Flyer in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington  D C  The agreement reads  in part   Neither the Smithsonian Institution or its successors  nor any museum or other agency  bureau or facilities administered for the United States of America by the Smithsonian Institution or its successors shall publish or permit to be displayed a statement or label in connection with or in respect of any aircraft model or design of earlier date than the 1903 Wright Aeroplane  claiming in effect that such aircraft was capable of carrying a man under its own power in controlled flight   95  N 10  If this agreement is not fulfilled  the Flyer can be reclaimed by the heir of the Wright brothers  Some aviation buffs  particularly those who promote the legacy of Gustave Whitehead  now accuse the Smithsonian of refusing to investigate claims of earlier flights  96  After a ceremony in the Smithsonian museum  the Flyer went on public display on December 17  1948  the 45th anniversary of the only day it was flown successfully  The Wright brothers  nephew Milton  Lorin s son   who had seen gliders and the Flyer under construction in the bicycle shop when he was a boy  gave a brief speech and formally transferred the airplane to the Smithsonian  which displayed it with the accompanying label  The original Wright brothers aeroplane The world s first power driven heavier than air machine

the Wright brothers discovered the principles of human flight As inventors  builders  and flyers they further developed the aeroplane  taught man to fly  and opened the era of aviation Last years Wilbur Neither brother married  Wilbur once quipped that he  did not have time for both a wife and an airplane   97  He became ill on a business trip to Boston in April 1912  After returning to Dayton  he was diagnosed with typhoid fever  He lingered in and out of consciousness for several weeks until he died  at age 45  in the Wright family home on May 30  N 11  His father Milton wrote about Wilbur in his diary   A short life  full of consequences  An unfailing intellect  imperturbable temper  great self reliance and as great modesty  seeing the right clearly  pursuing it steadfastly  he lived and died   99  Orville Orville Wright  1928  Orville succeeded to the presidency of the Wright company upon Wilbur s death  Sharing Wilbur s distaste for business but not his brother s executive skills  Orville sold the company in 1915  He  Katharine and their father Milton moved to a mansion  Hawthorn Hill  Oakwood  Ohio  which the newly wealthy family built  Milton died in his sleep in 1917  Orville made his last flight as a pilot in 1918 in a 1911 Model B  He retired from business and became an elder statesman of aviation  serving on various official boards and committees  including the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  NACA   predecessor agency to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA  and Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce  ACCA   predecessor to the Aerospace Industries Association  AIA   Katharine married Henry Haskell of Kansas City  a former Oberlin classmate  in 1926  which greatly upset Orville  He refused to attend the wedding or even communicate with her  He finally agreed to see her  apparently at Lorin s insistence  just before she died of pneumonia in 1929  Orville Wright served NACA for 28 years  In 1930  he received the first Daniel Guggenheim Medal established in 1928 by the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics  In 1936  he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences   Scipio  was Orville s famed St  Bernard  100  101  On April 19  1944  the second production Lockheed Constellation  piloted by Howard Hughes and TWA president Jack Frye  flew from Burbank  California  to Washington  D C  in 6 hours and 57 minutes  2300 mi   330 9 mph   On the return trip  the aircraft stopped at Wright Field to give Orville Wright his last airplane flight  more than 40 years after his historic first flight  He may even have briefly handled the controls  He commented that the wingspan of the Constellation was longer than the distance of his first flight  102  Perhaps the last major highlight of Orville s life was supervising the reclamation and preservation of the 1905 Wright Flyer III  an aircraft that stands equally in importance with the 1903 Flyer  Orville died on January 30  1948  after his second heart attack  having lived from the horse and buggy age to the dawn of supersonic flight  He was followed a day later by John T  Daniels  the Coast Guardsman who took their famous first flight photo  Both brothers are buried at the family plot at Woodland Cemetery  Dayton  Ohio  103  N 12  Competing claims Further information  Early flying machines First flight claims are made for Ader  Whitehead  Pearse  and Jatho for their variously documented tests in years prior to and including 1903  Claims that the first true flight occurred after 1903 are made for Vuia and Santos Dumont  Supporters of these pre  and post Wright pioneers argue that techniques used by the Wright brothers disqualify them as first to make successful airplane flights  Those techniques were  a launch rail  skids instead of wheels  a headwind at takeoff  and a catapult after 1903  Supporters of the Wright brothers argue that proven  repeated  controlled  and sustained flights by the brothers entitle them to credit as inventors of the airplane  regardless of those techniques  104  Ohio North Carolina rivalry North Carolina 50 State Quarter features the famous first flight photo of the 1903 Wright Flyer I at Kitty Hawk  North Carolina Ohio 50 State Quarter features the 1905 Wright Flyer III built and flown in Ohio  in another famous photo from Huffman Prairie The U S  states of Ohio and North Carolina both take credit for the Wright brothers and their world changing inventions Ohio because the brothers developed and built their design in Dayton  and North Carolina because Kitty Hawk was the site of the first flight  With a spirit of friendly rivalry  citation needed  Ohio adopted the slogan  Birthplace of Aviation   later  Birthplace of Aviation Pioneers   recognizing not only the Wrights  but also astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong  both Ohio natives   The slogan appears on Ohio license plates  North Carolina uses the slogan  First In Flight  on its license plates  The site of the first flights in North Carolina is preserved as Wright Brothers National Memorial  while their Ohio facilities are part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park  As the positions of both states can be factually defended  and each played a significant role in the history of flight  neither state truly has an exclusive claim to the Wrights  accomplishment  Notwithstanding the dispute between those two states  their bicycle shop and home is at the Ford in Dearborn  Michigan  Statuary Hall vote In early 2010  the Wright brothers were proposed by the Ohio Historical Society as finalists in a statewide vote for inclusion in Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol  See also Aviation pioneers Igor Sikorsky  left  and Orville Wright  pose in front of

Italy    Quote   The suit finally ended with the advent of World War I when the aircraft manufacturers established the Manufacturers  Aircraft Association to coordinate wartime aircraft manufacturing in the United States and formed a patent pool with the approval of the U S  government  All patent litigation ceased automatically  Royalties were reduced to one percent and free exchange of inventions and ideas took place among all the airframe builders     Quote   New Organization Is Formed  Under War Pressure  to Interchange Patents     The author obtained information at the Fort Sam

aviator and aeroplane builder  died of typhoid fever at 8 15 am to day  Wright had been lingering for many days and though his condition from time to time gave some hopes to members of his family  the attending physicians  Drs  D B  Conkihn and Levi Spitler  maintained throughout the latter part of his sickness that he could not recover   98    Quote   Dayton  Ohio  October 30  1948  Orville Wright
