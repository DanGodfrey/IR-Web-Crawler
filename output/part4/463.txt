goods and services in an economy over a period of time  1  When the general price level rises  each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services  Consequently  inflation also reflects an erosion in the purchasing power of money   a loss of real value in the internal medium of exchange and unit of account in the economy  2  3  A chief measure of price inflation is the inflation rate  the annualized percentage change in a general price index  normally the Consumer Price Index  over time  4  Inflation s effects on an economy are various and can be simultaneously positive and negative  Negative effects of inflation include a decrease in the real value of money and other monetary items over time  uncertainty over future inflation may discourage investment and savings  and high inflation may lead to shortages of goods if consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future  Positive effects include ensuring central banks can adjust nominal interest rates  intended to mitigate recessions   5  and encouraging investment in non monetary capital projects  Economists generally agree that high rates of inflation and hyperinflation are caused by an excessive growth of the money supply  6  Views on which factors determine low to moderate rates of inflation are more varied  Low or moderate inflation may be attributed to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services  or changes in available supplies such as during scarcities  as well as to growth in the money supply  However  the consensus view is that a long sustained period of inflation is caused by money supply growing faster than the rate of economic growth  7  8  Today  most economists favor a low  steady rate of inflation  9  Low  as opposed to zero or negative  inflation reduces the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn  and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy  10  The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities  Generally  these monetary authorities are the central banks that control monetary policy through the setting of interest rates  through open market operations  and through the setting of banking reserve requirements  11  Contents 1 History 2 Related definitions 3 Measures 3 1 Issues in measuring

debasement of the means of exchange  have occurred in many different societies throughout history  changing with different forms of money used  12  13  For instance  when gold was used as currency  the government could collect gold coins  melt them down  mix them with other metals such as silver  copper or lead  and reissue them at the same nominal value  By diluting the gold with other metals  the government could issue more coins without also needing to increase the amount of gold used to make them  When the cost of each coin is lowered in this way  the government profits from an increase in seigniorage  14  This practice would increase the money supply but at the same time the relative value of each coin would be lowered  As the relative value of the coins becomes lower  consumers would need to give more coins in exchange for the same goods and services as before  These goods and services would experience a price increase as the value of each coin is reduced  15  Historically  infusions of gold or silver into an economy also led to inflation  From the second half of the 15th century to the first half of the 17th  Western Europe experienced a major inflationary cycle referred to as the  price revolution   16  17  with prices on average rising perhaps sixfold over 150 years  This was largely caused by the sudden influx of gold and silver from the New World into Habsburg Spain  18  The silver spread throughout a previously cash starved Europe and caused widespread inflation  19  20  Demographic factors also contributed to upward pressure on prices  with European population growth after depopulation caused by the Black Death pandemic  By the nineteenth century  economists categorized three separate factors that cause a rise or fall in the price of goods  a change in the value or production costs of the good  a change in the price of money which then was usually a fluctuation in the commodity price of the metallic content in the currency  and currency depreciation resulting from an increased supply of currency relative to the quantity of redeemable metal backing the currency  Following the proliferation of private banknote currency printed during the American Civil War  the term  inflation  started to appear as a direct reference to the currency depreciation that occurred as the quantity of redeemable banknotes outstripped the quantity of metal available for their redemption  At that time  the term inflation referred to the devaluation of the currency  and not to a rise in the price of goods  21  This relationship between the over supply of banknotes and a resulting depreciation in their value was noted by earlier classical economists such as David Hume and David Ricardo  who would go on to examine and debate what effect a currency devaluation  later termed monetary inflation  has on the price of goods  later termed price inflation  and eventually just inflation   22  The adoption of fiat currency  paper money  by many countries  from the 18th century onwards  made much larger variations in the supply of money possible  Since then  huge increases in the supply of paper money have taken place in a number of countries  producing hyperinflations    episodes of extreme inflation rates much higher than those observed in earlier periods of commodity money  The hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic of Germany is a notable example   edit  Related definitions The term  inflation  originally referred to increases in the amount of money in circulation  and some economists still use the word in this way  However  most economists today use the term  inflation  to refer to a rise in the price level  An increase in the money supply may be called monetary inflation  to distinguish it from rising prices  which may also for clarity be called  price inflation   23  Economists generally agree that in the long run  inflation is caused by increases in the money supply  However  in the short and medium term  inflation is largely dependent on supply and demand pressures in the economy  24  Other economic concepts related to inflation include  deflation   a fall in the general price level  disinflation   a decrease in the rate of inflation  hyperinflation   an out of control inflationary spiral  stagflation   a combination of inflation  slow economic growth and high unemployment  and reflation   an attempt to raise the general level of prices to counteract deflationary pressures  Since there are many possible measures of the price level  there are many possible measures of price inflation  Most frequently  the term  inflation  refers to a rise in a broad price index representing the overall price level for goods and services in the economy  The Consumer Price Index  CPI   the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index  PCEPI  and the GDP deflator are some examples of broad price indices  However   inflation  may also be used to describe a rising price level within a narrower set of assets  goods or services within the economy  such as commodities  including food  fuel  metals   financial assets  such as stocks  bonds and real estate   services  such as entertainment and health care   or labor  The Reuters CRB Index  CCI   the Producer Price Index  and Employment Cost Index  ECI  are examples of narrow price indices used to measure price inflation in particular sectors of the economy  Core inflation is a measure of inflation for a subset of consumer prices that excludes food and energy prices  which rise and fall more than other prices in the short term  The Federal Reserve Board pays particular attention to the core inflation rate to get a better estimate of long term future inflation trends overall  25   edit  Measures CPI inflation  year on year  in the United States from 1914 to 2010  Inflation is usually estimated by calculating the inflation rate of a price index  usually the Consumer Price Index  26  The Consumer Price Index measures prices of a selection of goods and services purchased by a  typical consumer   4  The inflation rate is the percentage rate of change of a price index over time  For instance  in January 2007  the U S  Consumer Price Index was 202 416  and in January 2008 it was 211 080  The formula for calculating the annual percentage rate inflation in the CPI over the course of 2007 is The resulting inflation rate for the CPI in this one year period is 4 28   meaning the general level of prices for typical U S  consumers rose by approximately four percent in 2007  27  Other widely used price indices for calculating price inflation include the following  Producer price indices  PPIs  which measures average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output  This differs from the CPI in that price subsidization  profits  and taxes may cause the amount received by the producer to differ from what the consumer paid  There is also typically a delay between an increase in the PPI and any eventual increase in the CPI  Producer price index measures the pressure being put on producers by the costs of their raw materials  This could be  passed on  to consumers  or it could be absorbed by profits  or offset by increasing productivity  In India and the United States  an earlier version of the PPI was called the Wholesale Price Index  Commodity price indices  which measure the price of a selection of commodities  In the present commodity price indices are weighted by the relative importance of the components to the  all in  cost of an employee  Core price indices  because food and oil prices can change quickly due to changes in supply and demand conditions in the food and oil markets  it can be difficult to detect the long run trend in price levels when those prices are included  Therefore most statistical agencies also report a measure of  core inflation   which removes the most volatile components  such as food and oil  from a broad price index like the CPI  Because core inflation is less affected by short run supply and demand conditions in specific markets  central banks rely on it to better measure the inflationary impact of current monetary policy  Other common measures of inflation are  GDP deflator is a measure of the price of all the goods and services included in gross domestic product  GDP   The US Commerce Department publishes a deflator series for US GDP  defined as its nominal GDP measure divided by its real GDP measure  Regional inflation The Bureau of Labor Statistics breaks down CPI U calculations down to different regions of the US  Historical inflation Before collecting consistent econometric data became standard for governments  and for the purpose of comparing absolute  rather than relative standards of living  various economists have calculated imputed inflation figures  Most inflation data before the early 20th century is imputed based on the known costs of goods  rather than compiled at the time  It is also used to adjust for the differences in real standard of living for the presence of technology  Asset price inflation is an undue increase in the prices of real or financial assets  such as stock  equity  and real estate  While there is no widely accepted index of this type  some central bankers have suggested that it would be better to aim at stabilizing a wider general price level inflation measure that includes some asset prices  instead of stabilizing CPI or core inflation only  The reason is that by raising interest rates when stock prices or real estate prices rise  and lowering them when these asset prices fall  central banks might be more successful in avoiding bubbles and crashes in asset prices  dubious   discuss   edit  Issues in measuring Measuring inflation in an economy requires objective means of differentiating changes in nominal prices on a common set of goods and services  and distinguishing them from those price shifts resulting from changes in value such as volume  quality  or performance  For example  if the price of a 10 oz  can of corn changes from  0 90 to  1 00 over the course of a year  with no change in quality  then this price difference represents inflation  This single price change would not  however  represent general inflation in an overall economy  To measure overall inflation  the price change of a large  basket  of representative goods and services is measured  This is the purpose of a price index  which is the combined price of a  basket  of many goods and services  The combined price is the sum of the weighted average prices of items in the  basket   A weighted price is calculated by multiplying the unit price of an item to the number of those items the average consumer purchases  Weighted pricing is a necessary means to measuring the impact of individual unit price changes on the economy s overall inflation  The Consumer Price Index  for example  uses data collected by surveying households to determine what proportion of the typical consumer s overall spending is spent on specific goods and services  and weights the average prices of those items accordingly  Those weighted average prices are combined to calculate the overall price  To better relate price changes over time  indexes typically choose a  base year  price and assign it a value of 100  Index prices in subsequent years are then expressed in relation to the base year price  11  While comparing inflation measures for various periods one has to take into consideration the base effect as well  Inflation measures are often modified over time  either for the relative weight of goods in the basket  or in the way in which goods and services from the present are compared with goods and services from the past  Over time  adjustments are made to the type of goods and services selected in order to reflect changes in the sorts of goods and services purchased by  typical consumers   New products may be introduced  older products disappear  the quality of existing products may change  and consumer preferences can shift  Both the sorts of goods and services which are included in the  basket  and the weighted price used in inflation measures will be changed over time in order to keep pace with the changing marketplace  citation needed  Inflation numbers are often seasonally adjusted in order to differentiate expected cyclical cost shifts  For example  home heating costs are expected to rise in colder months  and seasonal adjustments are often used when measuring for inflation to compensate for cyclical spikes in energy or fuel demand  Inflation numbers may be averaged or otherwise subjected to statistical techniques in order to remove statistical noise and volatility of individual prices  citation needed  When looking at inflation  economic institutions may focus only on certain kinds of prices  or special indices  such as the core inflation index which is used by central banks to formulate monetary policy  citation needed  Most inflation indices are calculated from weighted averages of selected price changes  This necessarily introduces distortion  and can lead to legitimate disputes about what the true inflation rate is  This problem can be overcome by including all available price changes in the calculation  and then choosing the median value  28   edit  Effects  edit  General An increase in the general level of prices implies a decrease in the purchasing power of the currency  That is  when the general level of prices rises  each monetary unit buys fewer goods and services  The effect of inflation is not distributed evenly in the economy  and as a consequence there are hidden costs to some and benefits to others from this decrease in the purchasing power of money  For example  with inflation  lenders or depositors who are paid a fixed rate of interest on loans or deposits will lose purchasing power from their interest earnings  while their borrowers benefit  Individuals or institutions with cash assets will experience a decline in the purchasing power of their holdings  Increases in payments to workers and pensioners often lag behind inflation  especially for those with fixed payments  Increases in the price level  inflation  erode the real value of money  the functional currency  and other items with an underlying monetary nature  Debtors who have debts with a fixed nominal rate of interest will see a reduction in the  real  interest rate as the inflation rate rises  The real interest on a loan is the nominal rate minus the inflation rate The formula R   N I approximates the correct answer as long as both the nominal interest rate and the inflation rate are small  The correct equation is r   n i where r  n and i are expressed as ratios  e g  1 2 for  20   0 8 for  20    For example if you take a loan where the stated interest rate is 6  and the inflation rate is at 3   the real interest rate that you are paying for the loan is 3   It would also hold true that if you had a loan at a fixed interest rate of 6  and the inflation rate jumped to 20  you would have a real interest rate of  14   Banks and other lenders adjust for this inflation risk either by including an inflation premium in the costs of lending the money by creating a higher initial stated interest rate or by setting the interest at a variable rate  As the rate of inflation decreases  this has the opposite  negative  effect on borrowers  Purchasing power of non monetary items does not change in spite of variation in national currency value   29  Inflation thus has no affect on the real value of non monetary items   edit  Negative High or unpredictable inflation rates are regarded as harmful to an overall economy  They add inefficiencies in the market  and make it difficult for companies to budget or plan long term  Inflation can act as a drag on productivity as companies are forced to shift resources away from products and services in order to focus on profit and losses from currency inflation  11  Uncertainty about the future purchasing power of money discourages investment and saving  30  And inflation can impose hidden tax increases  as inflated earnings push taxpayers into higher income tax rates unless the tax brackets are indexed to inflation  With high inflation  purchasing power is redistributed from those on fixed nominal incomes  such as some pensioners whose pensions are not indexed to the price level  towards those with variable incomes whose earnings may better keep pace with the inflation  11  This redistribution of purchasing power will also occur between international trading partners  Where fixed exchange rates are imposed  higher inflation in one economy than another will cause the first economy s exports to become more expensive and affect the balance of trade  There can also be negative impacts to trade from an increased instability in currency exchange prices caused by unpredictable inflation  Cost push inflation High inflation can prompt employees to demand rapid wage increases  to keep up with consumer prices  In the cost push theory of inflation  rising wages in turn can help fuel inflation  In the case of collective bargaining  wage growth will be set as a function of inflationary expectations  which will be higher when inflation is high  This can cause a wage spiral  31  In a sense  inflation begets further inflationary expectations  which beget further inflation  Hoarding People buy durable and or non perishable commodities and other goods as stores of wealth  to avoid the losses expected from the declining purchasing power of money  creating shortages of the hoarded goods  Social unrest and revolts Inflation can lead to massive demonstrations and revolutions  For example  inflation and in particular food inflation is considered as one of the main reasons that caused the 2010 2011 Tunisian revolution 32  and the 2011 Egyptian revolution  33  according to many observators including Robert Zoellick  34  president of the World Bank  Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was ousted  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was also ousted after only 18 days of demonstrations  and protests soon spread in many countries of North Africa and Middle East  Hyperinflation If inflation gets totally out of control  in the upward direction   it can grossly interfere with the normal workings of the economy  hurting its ability to supply goods  Hyperinflation can lead to the abandonment of the use of the country s currency  leading to the inefficiencies of barter  Allocative efficiency A change in the supply or demand for a good will normally cause its relative price to change  signaling to buyers and sellers that they should re allocate resources in response to the new market conditions  But when prices are constantly changing due to inflation  price changes due to genuine relative price signals are difficult to distinguish from price changes due to general inflation  so agents are slow to respond to them  The result is a loss of allocative efficiency  Shoe leather cost High inflation increases the opportunity cost of holding cash balances and can induce people to hold a greater portion of their assets in interest paying accounts  However  since cash is still needed in order to carry out transactions this means that more  trips to the bank  are necessary in order to make withdrawals  proverbially wearing out the  shoe leather  with each trip  Menu costs With high inflation  firms must change their prices often in order to keep up with economy wide changes  But often changing prices is itself a costly activity whether explicitly  as with the need to print new menus  or implicitly  Business cycles According to the Austrian Business Cycle Theory  inflation sets off the business cycle  Austrian economists hold this to be the most damaging effect of inflation  According to Austrian theory  artificially low interest rates and the associated increase in the money supply lead to reckless  speculative borrowing  resulting in clusters of malinvestments  which eventually have to be liquidated as they become unsustainable  35   edit  Positive Labor market adjustments Keynesians believe that nominal wages are slow to adjust downwards  This can lead to prolonged disequilibrium and high unemployment in the labor market  Since inflation would lower the real wage if nominal wages are kept constant  Keynesians argue that some inflation is good for the economy  as it would allow labor markets to reach equilibrium faster  citation needed  Room to maneuver The primary tools for controlling the money supply are the ability to set the discount rate  the rate at which banks can borrow from the central bank  and open market operations  which are the central bank s interventions into the bonds market with the aim of affecting the nominal interest rate  If an economy finds itself in a recession with already low  or even zero  nominal interest rates  then the bank cannot cut these rates further  since negative nominal interest rates are impossible  in order to stimulate the economy   this situation is known as a liquidity trap  A moderate level of inflation tends to ensure that nominal interest rates stay sufficiently above zero so that if the need arises the bank can cut the nominal interest rate  Mundell Tobin effect The Nobel laureate Robert Mundell noted that moderate inflation would induce savers to substitute lending for some money holding as a means to finance future spending  That substitution would cause market clearing real interest rates to fall  36  The lower real rate of interest would induce more borrowing to finance investment  In a similar vein  Nobel laureate James Tobin noted that such inflation would cause businesses to substitute investment in physical capital  plant  equipment  and inventories  for money balances in their asset portfolios  That substitution would mean choosing the making of investments with lower rates of real return   The rates of return are lower because the investments with higher rates of return were already being made before   37  The two related effects are known as the Mundell Tobin effect  Unless the economy is already overinvesting according to models of economic growth theory  that extra investment resulting from the effect would be seen as positive  Instability with Deflation Economist S C  Tsaing noted that once substantial deflation is expected  two important effects will appear  both a result of money holding substituting for lending as a vehicle for saving  38  The first was that continually falling prices and the resulting incentive to hoard money will cause instability resulting from the likely increasing fear  while money hoards grow in value  that the value of those hoards are at risk  as people realize that a movement to trade those money hoards for real goods and assets will quickly drive those prices up  Any movement to spend those hoards  once started would become a tremendous avalanche  which could rampage for a long time before it would spend itself   39  Thus  a regime of long term deflation is likely to be interrupted by periodic spikes of rapid inflation and consequent real economic disruptions  Moderate and stable inflation would avoid such a seesawing of price movements  Financial Market Inefficiency with Deflation The second effect noted by Tsaing is that when savers have substituted money holding for lending on financial markets  the role of those markets in channeling savings into investment is undermined  With nominal interest rates driven to zero  or near zero  from the competition with a high return money asset  there would be no price mechanism in whatever is left of those markets  With financial markets effectively euthanized  the remaining goods and physical asset prices would move in perverse directions  For example  an increased desire to save could not push interest rates further down  and thereby stimulate investment  but would instead cause additional money hoarding  driving consumer prices further down and making investment in consumer goods production thereby less attractive  Moderate inflation  once its expectation is incorporated into nominal interest rates  would give those interest rates room to go both up and down in response to shifting investment opportunities  or savers  preferences  and thus allow financial markets to function in a more normal fashion   edit  Causes The Bank of England  central bank of the United Kingdom  monitors causes and attempts to control inflation  Historically  a great deal of economic literature was concerned with the question of what causes inflation and what effect it has  There were different schools of thought as to the causes of inflation  Most can be divided into two broad areas  quality theories of inflation and quantity theories of inflation  The quality theory of inflation rests on the expectation of a seller accepting currency to be able to exchange that currency at a later time for goods that are desirable as a buyer  The quantity theory of inflation rests on the quantity equation of money  that relates the money supply  its velocity  and the nominal value of exchanges  Adam Smith and David Hume proposed a quantity theory of inflation for money  and a quality theory of inflation for production  citation needed  Currently  the quantity theory of money is widely accepted as an accurate model of inflation in the long run  Consequently  there is now broad agreement among economists that in the long run  the inflation rate is essentially dependent on the growth rate of money supply  However  in the short and medium term inflation may be affected by supply and demand pressures in the economy  and influenced by the relative elasticity of wages  prices and interest rates  24  The question of whether the short term effects last long enough to be important is the central topic of debate between monetarist and Keynesian economists  In monetarism prices and wages adjust quickly enough to make other factors merely marginal behavior on a general trend line  In the Keynesian view  prices and wages adjust at different rates  and these differences have enough effects on real output to be  long term  in the view of people in an economy   edit  Keynesian view Keynesian economic theory proposes that changes in money supply do not directly affect prices  and that visible inflation is the result of pressures in the economy expressing themselves in prices  There are three major types of inflation  as part of what Robert J  Gordon calls the  triangle model   40  Demand pull inflation is caused by increases in aggregate demand due to increased private and government spending  etc  Demand inflation is constructive to a faster rate of economic growth since the excess demand and favourable market conditions will stimulate investment and expansion  Cost push inflation  also called  supply shock inflation   is caused by a drop in aggregate supply  potential output   This may be due to natural disasters  or increased prices of inputs  For example  a sudden decrease in the supply of oil  leading to increased oil prices  can cause cost push inflation  Producers for whom oil is a part of their costs could then pass this on to consumers in the form of increased prices  Another example stems from unexpectedly high Insured Losses  either legitimate  catastrophes  or fraudulent  which might be particularly prevalent in times of recession   citation needed  Built in inflation is induced by adaptive expectations  and is often linked to the  price wage spiral   It involves workers trying to keep their wages up with prices  above the rate of inflation   and firms passing these higher labor costs on to their customers as higher prices  leading to a  vicious circle   Built in inflation reflects events in the past  and so might be seen as hangover inflation  Demand pull theory states that the rate of inflation accelerates whenever aggregate demand is increased beyond the ability of the economy to produce  its potential output   Hence  any factor that increases aggregate demand can cause inflation  41  However  in the long run  aggregate demand can be held above productive capacity only by increasing the quantity of money in circulation faster than the real growth rate of the economy  Another  although much less common  cause can be a rapid decline in the demand for money  as happened in Europe during the Black Death  or in the Japanese occupied territories just before the defeat of Japan in 1945  The effect of money on inflation is most obvious when governments finance spending in a crisis  such as a civil war  by printing money excessively  This sometimes leads to hyperinflation  a condition where prices can double in a month or less  Money supply is also thought to play a major role in determining moderate levels of inflation  although there are differences of opinion on how important it is  For example  Monetarist economists believe that the link is very strong  Keynesian economists  by contrast  typically emphasize the role of aggregate demand in the economy rather than the money supply in determining inflation  That is  for Keynesians  the money supply is only one determinant of aggregate demand  Some Keynesian economists also disagree with the notion that central banks fully control the money supply  arguing that central banks have little control  since the money supply adapts to the demand for bank credit issued by commercial banks  This is known as the theory of endogenous money  and has been advocated strongly by post Keynesians as far back as the 1960s  It has today become a central focus of Taylor rule advocates  This position is not universally accepted   banks create money by making loans  but the aggregate volume of these loans diminishes as real interest rates increase  Thus  central banks can influence the money supply by making money cheaper or more expensive  thus increasing or decreasing its production  A fundamental concept in inflation analysis is the relationship between inflation and unemployment  called the Phillips curve  This model suggests that there is a trade off between price stability and employment  Therefore  some level of inflation could be considered desirable in order to minimize unemployment  The Phillips curve model described the U S  experience well in the 1960s but failed to describe the combination of rising inflation and economic stagnation  sometimes referred to as stagflation  experienced in the 1970s  Thus  modern macroeconomics describes inflation using a Phillips curve that shifts  so the trade off between inflation and unemployment changes  because of such matters as supply shocks and inflation becoming built into the normal workings of the economy  The former refers to such events as the oil shocks of the 1970s  while the latter refers to the price wage spiral and inflationary expectations implying that the economy  normally  suffers from inflation  Thus  the Phillips curve represents only the demand pull component of the triangle model  Another concept of note is the potential output  sometimes called the  natural gross domestic product    a level of GDP  where the economy is at its optimal level of production given institutional and natural constraints   This level of output corresponds to the Non Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment  NAIRU  or the  natural  rate of unemployment or the full employment unemployment rate   If GDP exceeds its potential  and unemployment is below the NAIRU   the theory says that inflation will accelerate as suppliers increase their prices and built in inflation worsens  If GDP falls below its potential level  and unemployment is above the NAIRU   inflation will decelerate as suppliers attempt to fill excess capacity  cutting prices and undermining built in inflation  42  However  one problem with this theory for policy making purposes is that the exact level of potential output  and of the NAIRU  is generally unknown and tends to change over time  Inflation also seems to act in an asymmetric way  rising more quickly than it falls  Worse  it can change because of policy  for example  high unemployment under British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher might have led to a rise in the NAIRU  and a fall in potential  because many of the unemployed found themselves as structurally unemployed  also see unemployment   unable to find jobs that fit their skills  A rise in structural unemployment implies that a smaller percentage of the labor force can find jobs at the NAIRU  where the economy avoids crossing the threshold into the realm of accelerating inflation   edit  Monetarist view Inflation is closely related to growth in money supply  using the M2 definition  over the long run  For more details on this topic  see Monetarism  Monetarists believe the most significant factor influencing inflation or deflation is how fast the money supply grows or shrinks  They consider fiscal policy  or government spending and taxation  as ineffective in controlling inflation  43  According to the famous monetarist economist Milton Friedman   Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon   44  Some monetarists  however  will qualify this by making an exception for very short term circumstances  Monetarists assert that the empirical study of monetary history shows that inflation has always been a monetary phenomenon  The quantity theory of money  simply stated  says that any change in the amount of money in a system will change the price level  This theory begins with the equation of exchange  where is the nominal quantity of money  is the velocity of money in final expenditures  is the general price level  is an index of the real value of final expenditures  In this formula  the general price level is related to the level of real economic activity  Q   the quantity of money  M  and the velocity of money  V   The formula is an identity because the velocity of money  V  is defined to be the ratio of final nominal expenditure    to the quantity of money  M   Monetarists assume that the velocity of money is unaffected by monetary policy  at least in the long run   and the real value of output is determined in the long run by the productive capacity of the economy  Under these assumptions  the primary driver of the change in the general price level is changes in the quantity of money  With exogenous velocity  that is  velocity being determined externally and not being influenced by monetary policy   the money supply determines the value of nominal output  which equals final expenditure  in the short run  In practice  velocity is not exogenous in the short run  and so the formula does not necessarily imply a stable short run relationship between the money supply and nominal output  However  in the long run  changes in velocity are assumed to be determined by the evolution of the payments mechanism  If velocity is relatively unaffected by monetary policy  the long run rate of increase in prices  the inflation rate  is equal to the long run growth rate of the money supply plus the exogenous long run rate of velocity growth minus the long run growth rate of real output  7   edit  Unemployment A connection between inflation and unemployment has been drawn since the emergence of large scale unemployment in the 19th century  and connections continue to be drawn today  In Marxian economics  the unemployed serve as a reserve army of labour  which restrain wage inflation  In the 20th century  similar concepts in Keynesian economics include the NAIRU  Non Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment  and the Phillips curve   edit  Rational expectations theory For more details on this topic  see Rational expectations theory  Rational expectations theory holds that economic actors look rationally into the future when trying to maximize their well being  and do not respond solely to immediate opportunity costs and pressures  In this view  while generally grounded in monetarism  future expectations and strategies are important for inflation as well  A core assertion of rational expectations theory is that actors will seek to  head off  central bank decisions by acting in ways that fulfill predictions of higher inflation  This means that central banks must establish their credibility in fighting inflation  or economic actors will make bets that the central bank will expand the money supply rapidly enough to prevent recession  even at the expense of exacerbating inflation  Thus  if a central bank has a reputation as being  soft  on inflation  when it announces a new policy of fighting inflation with restrictive monetary growth economic agents will not believe that the policy will persist  their inflationary expectations will remain high  and so will inflation  On the other hand  if the central bank has a reputation of being  tough  on inflation  then such a policy announcement will be believed and inflationary expectations will come down rapidly  thus allowing inflation itself to come down rapidly with minimal economic disruption   edit  Austrian view For more details on this topic  see The Austrian view of inflation and monetary inflation The Austrian School asserts that inflation is an increase in the money supply  rising prices are merely consequences and this semantic difference is important in defining inflation  45  Austrians stress that inflation affects prices in various degree  i e  that prices rise more sharply in some sectors than in other sectors of the economy  The reason for the disparity is that excess money will be concentrated to certain sectors  such as housing  stocks or health care  Because of this disparity  Austrians argue that the aggregate price level can be very misleading when observing the effects of inflation  Austrian economists measure inflation by calculating the growth of new units of money that are available for immediate use in exchange  that have been created over time  46  47  48   edit  Real bills doctrine Main article  Real bills doctrine Within the context of a fixed specie basis for money  one important controversy was between the quantity theory of money and the real bills doctrine  RBD   Within this context  quantity theory applies to the level of fractional reserve accounting allowed against specie  generally gold  held by a bank  Currency and banking schools of economics argue the RBD  that banks should also be able to issue currency against bills of trading  which is  real bills  that they buy from merchants  This theory was important in the 19th century in debates between  Banking  and  Currency  schools of monetary soundness  and in the formation of the Federal Reserve  In the wake of the collapse of the international gold standard post 1913  and the move towards deficit financing of government  RBD has remained a minor topic  primarily of interest in limited contexts  such as currency boards  It is generally held in ill repute today  with Frederic Mishkin  a governor of the Federal Reserve going so far as to say it had been  completely discredited   The debate between currency  or quantity theory  and banking schools in Britain during the 19th century prefigures current questions about the credibility of money in the present  In the 19th century the banking school had greater influence in policy in the United States and Great Britain  while the currency school had more influence  on the continent   that is in non British countries  particularly in the Latin Monetary Union and the earlier Scandinavia monetary union   edit  Anti classical or backing theory Another issue associated with classical political economy is the anti classical hypothesis of money  or  backing theory   The backing theory argues that the value of money is determined by the assets and liabilities of the issuing agency  49  Unlike the Quantity Theory of classical political economy  the backing theory argues that issuing authorities can issue money without causing inflation so long as the money issuer has sufficient assets to cover redemptions  There are very few backing theorists  making quantity theory the dominant theory explaining inflation  citation needed   edit  Controlling inflation A variety of policies have been used to control inflation   edit  Monetary policy The U S  effective federal funds rate charted over fifty years  Main article  Monetary policy Today the primary tool for controlling inflation is monetary policy  Most central banks are tasked with keeping their inter bank lending rates at low levels  normally to a target rate around 2  to 3  per annum  and within a targeted low inflation range  somewhere from about 2  to 6  per annum  A low positive inflation is usually targeted  as deflationary conditions are seen as dangerous for the health of the economy  There are a number of methods that have been suggested to control inflation  Central banks such as the U S  Federal Reserve can affect inflation to a significant extent through setting interest rates and through other operations  High interest rates and slow growth of the money supply are the traditional ways through which central banks fight or prevent inflation  though they have different approaches  For instance  some follow a symmetrical inflation target while others only control inflation when it rises above a target  whether express or implied  Monetarists emphasize keeping the growth rate of money steady  and using monetary policy to control inflation  increasing interest rates  slowing the rise in the money supply   Keynesians emphasize reducing aggregate demand during economic expansions and increasing demand during recessions to keep inflation stable  Control of aggregate demand can be achieved using both monetary policy and fiscal policy  increased taxation or reduced government spending to reduce demand    edit  Fixed exchange rates Main article  Fixed exchange rate Under a fixed exchange rate currency regime  a country s currency is tied in value to another single currency or to a basket of other currencies  or sometimes to another measure of value  such as gold   A fixed exchange rate is usually used to stabilize the value of a currency  vis a vis the currency it is pegged to  It can also be used as a means to control inflation  However  as the value of the reference currency rises and falls  so does the currency pegged to it  This essentially means that the inflation rate in the fixed exchange rate country is determined by the inflation rate of the country the currency is pegged to  In addition  a fixed exchange rate prevents a government from using domestic monetary policy in order to achieve macroeconomic stability  Under the Bretton Woods agreement  most countries around the world had currencies that were fixed to the US dollar  This limited inflation in those countries  but also exposed them to the danger of speculative attacks  After the Bretton Woods agreement broke down in the early 1970s  countries gradually turned to floating exchange rates  However  in the later part of the 20th century  some countries reverted to a fixed exchange rate as part of an attempt to control inflation  This policy of using a fixed exchange rate to control inflation was used in many countries in South America in the later part of the 20th century  e g  Argentina  1991 2002   Bolivia  Brazil  and Chile    edit  Gold standard Main article  Gold standard Under a gold standard  paper notes are convertible into pre set  fixed quantities of gold  The gold standard is a monetary system in which a region s common media of exchange are paper notes that are normally freely convertible into pre set  fixed quantities of gold  The standard specifies how the gold backing would be implemented  including the amount of specie per currency unit  The currency itself has no innate value  but is accepted by traders because it can be redeemed for the equivalent specie  A U S  silver certificate  for example  could be redeemed for an actual piece of silver  The gold standard was partially abandoned via the international adoption of the Bretton Woods System  Under this system all other major currencies were tied at fixed rates to the dollar  which itself was tied to gold at the rate of  35 per ounce  The Bretton Woods system broke down in 1971  causing most countries to switch to fiat money   money backed only by the laws of the country  According to Lawrence H  White  an F  A  Hayek Professor of Economic History  who values the Austrian tradition  50   economies based on the gold standard rarely experience inflation above 2 percent annually  51  However  historically  the U S  saw inflation over 2  several times and a higher peak of inflation under the gold standard when compared to inflation after the gold standard  52  Under a gold standard  the long term rate of inflation  or deflation  would be determined by the growth rate of the supply of gold relative to total output  53  Critics argue that this will cause arbitrary fluctuations in the inflation rate  and that monetary policy would essentially be determined by gold mining  54  55   edit  Wage and price controls Main article  Incomes policies Another method attempted in the past have been wage and price controls   incomes policies    Wage and price controls have been successful in wartime environments in combination with rationing  However  their use in other contexts is far more mixed  Notable failures of their use include the 1972 imposition of wage and price controls by Richard Nixon  More successful examples include the Prices and Incomes Accord in Australia and the Wassenaar Agreement in the Netherlands  In general wage and price controls are regarded as a temporary and exceptional measure  only effective when coupled with policies designed to reduce the underlying causes of inflation during the wage and price control regime  for example  winning the war being fought  They often have perverse effects  due to the distorted signals they send to the market  Artificially low prices often cause rationing and shortages and discourage future investment  resulting in yet further shortages  The usual economic analysis is that any product or service that is under priced is overconsumed  For example  if the official price of bread is too low  there will be too little bread at official prices  and too little investment in bread making by the market to satisfy future needs  thereby exacerbating the problem in the long term  Temporary controls may complement a recession as a way to fight inflation  the controls make the recession more efficient as a way to fight inflation  reducing the need to increase unemployment   while the recession prevents the kinds of distortions that controls cause when demand is high  However  in general the advice of economists is not to impose price controls but to liberalize prices by assuming that the economy will adjust and abandon unprofitable economic activity  The lower activity will place fewer demands on whatever commodities were driving inflation  whether labor or resources  and inflation will fall with total economic output  This often produces a severe recession  as productive capacity is reallocated and is thus often very unpopular with the people whose livelihoods are destroyed  see creative destruction    edit  Cost of living allowance For more details on this topic  see Cost of living  The real purchasing power of fixed payments is eroded by inflation unless they are inflation adjusted to keep their real values constant  In many countries  employment contracts  pension benefits  and government entitlements  such as social security  are tied to a cost of living index  typically to the consumer price index  56  A cost of living allowance  COLA  adjusts salaries based on changes in a cost of living index  Salaries are typically adjusted annually in low inflation economies  During hyperinflation they are adjusted more often  56  They may also be tied to a cost of living index that varies by geographic location if the employee moves  Annual escalation clauses in employment contracts can specify retroactive or future percentage increases in worker pay which are not tied to any index  These negotiated increases in pay are colloquially referred to as cost of living adjustments or cost of living increases because of their similarity to increases tied to externally determined indexes  Many economists and compensation analysts consider the idea of predetermined future  cost of living increases  to be misleading for two reasons   1  For most recent periods in the industrialized world  average wages have increased faster than most calculated cost of living indexes  reflecting the influence of rising productivity and worker bargaining power rather than simply living costs  and  2  most cost of living indexes are not forward looking  but instead compare current or historical data citation required  edit  See also Deflation Inflation hedge List of countries by inflation rate Philips curve Price
