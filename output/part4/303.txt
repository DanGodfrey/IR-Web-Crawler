be the greatest novelist of the Victorian period and responsible for some of English literature s most iconic novels and characters  1  During his lifetime Dickens  works enjoyed unprecedented popularity and fame  and they remain popular today  It was in the twentieth century  however  that his literary genius was fully recognized by critics and scholars  Many of his works were originally published serially in monthly instalments  a format of publication that Dickens himself helped popularise  Unlike other authors who completed novels before serialisation  Dickens often wrote the episodes as they were being serialised  and he often revised his plots and characters on the basis of readers  responses to a published episode  The practice lent his stories a particular rhythm  employing cliffhangers to keep the public looking forward to the next instalment  2  The continuing popularity of his novels and short stories is such that they have never gone out of print  3  Dickens s work has been highly praised by writers such as Leo Tolstoy  George Orwell  and G  K  Chesterton for its realism  comedy  prose style  unique characterisations  and social criticism  though others  such as Henry James and Virginia Woolf  have criticised it as melodramatic  sentimental  and implausible  4  Contents 1 Life 1 1 Early years 1 2 Journalism and early novels 1 3 First visit to

in Portsea  the second of eight children to John and Elizabeth Dickens  His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily on duty in the district  Very soon after the birth of Charles the family moved to Norfolk Street  Bloomsbury  and then  when he was four  to Chatham  Kent  where he spent his formative years until the age of 11  His early years seem to have been idyllic  though he thought himself a  very small and not over particularly taken care of boy   5  Charles spent time outdoors  but also read voraciously  especially the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding  He spoke later in life of his poignant memories of childhood and of his near photographic memory of the people and events  which he used in his writing  His father s brief period as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education at William Giles s School  in Chatham  6  This period came to an abrupt end when the Dickens family  because of financial difficulties  moved from Kent to Camden Town  in London in 1822  John Dickens continually lived beyond his means and was eventually imprisoned in the Marshalsea debtor s prison in Southwark  London in 1824  Shortly afterwards  the rest of his family joined him   except 12 year old Charles  who was boarded with family friend Elizabeth Roylance in Camden Town  7  Mrs  Roylance was  a reduced  impoverished  old lady  long known to our family   whom Dickens later immortalised   with a few alterations and embellishments   as  Mrs  Pipchin   in Dombey and Son  Later  he lived in a  back attic   at the house of an insolvent court agent   in Lant Street in The Borough   he was a fat  good natured  kind old gentleman  with a quiet old wife   and he had a very innocent grown up son  these three were the inspiration for the Garland family in The Old Curiosity Shop  8  The Marshalsea around 1897  after it had closed On Sundays with his sister Frances  free from her studies at the Royal Academy of Music he spent the day at the Marshalsea  9   Dickens later used the prison as a setting in Little Dorrit   To pay for his board and to help his family  Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten hour days at Warren s Blacking Warehouse  on Hungerford Stairs  near the present Charing Cross railway station  where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking  The strenuous and often cruel working conditions deeply impressed Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays  becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio economic and labour conditions  the rigors of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor  He would later write that he wondered  how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age   As told to John Forster  from The Life of Charles Dickens   The blacking warehouse was the last house on the left hand side of the way  at old Hungerford Stairs  It was a crazy  tumble down old house  abutting of course on the river  and literally overrun with rats  Its wainscoted rooms  and its rotten floors and staircase  and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars  and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times  and the dirt and decay of the place  rise up visibly before me  as if I were there again  The counting house was on the first floor  looking over the coal barges and the river  There was a recess in it  in which I was to sit and work  My work was to cover the pots of paste blacking  first with a piece of oil paper  and then with a piece of blue paper  to tie them round with a string  and then to clip the paper close and neat  all round  until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary s shop  When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection  I was to paste on each a printed label  and then go on again with more pots  Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down stairs on similar wages  One of them came up  in a ragged apron and a paper cap  on the first Monday morning  to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot  His name was Bob Fagin  and I took the liberty of using his name  long afterwards  in Oliver Twist  8  After only a few months in Marshalsea  John Dickens s paternal grandmother  Elizabeth Dickens  died and bequeathed him the sum of  450  On the expectation of this legacy  Dickens was granted release from prison  Under the Insolvent Debtors Act  Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors  and he and his family left Marshalsea for the home of Mrs  Roylance  Although Dickens eventually attended the Wellington House Academy in North London  his mother Elizabeth Dickens did not immediately remove him from the boot blacking factory  The incident may have done much to confirm Dickens s view that a father should rule the family  a mother find her proper sphere inside the home   I never afterwards forgot  I never shall forget  I never can forget  that my mother was warm for my being sent back   His mother s failure to request his return was no doubt a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women   9  Righteous anger stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which working class people lived became major themes of his works  and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite  and most autobiographical  novel  David Copperfield  10   I had no advice  no counsel  no encouragement  no consolation  no assistance  no support  of any kind  from anyone  that I can call to mind  as I hope to go to heaven   The Wellington House Academy was not a good school   Much of the haphazard  desultory teaching  poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster s sadistic brutality  the seedy ushers and general run down atmosphere  are embodied in Mr  Creakle s Establishment in David Copperfield   9  Dickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore  attorneys  of Holborn Court  Gray s Inn  as a junior clerk from May 1827 to November 1828  Then  having learned Gurneys system of shorthand in his spare time  he left to become a freelance reporter  A distant relative  Thomas Charlton  was a freelance reporter at Doctors  Commons  and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years  11  This education informed works such as Nicholas Nickleby  Dombey and Son  and especially Bleak House whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public  and was a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens s own views regarding  particularly  the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to  go to law   In 1830  Dickens met his first love  Maria Beadnell  thought to have been the model for the character Dora in David Copperfield  Maria s parents disapproved of the courtship and effectively ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris  Journalism and early novels Catherine Hogarth Dickens by Samuel Lawrence  1838   In 1833 Dickens s first story  A Dinner at Poplar Walk was published in the London periodical  Monthly Magazine  The following year he rented rooms at Furnival s Inn becoming a political journalist  reporting on parliamentary debate and travelling across Britain to cover election campaigns for the Morning Chronicle  His journalism  in the form of sketches in periodicals  formed his first collection of pieces Sketches by Boz  published in 1836  This led to the serialisation of his first novel  The Pickwick Papers  in March 1836  He continued to contribute to and edit journals throughout his literary career  In 1836 Dickens accepted the job of editor of Bentley s Miscellany  a position he held for three years  until he fell out with the owner  At the same time  his success as a novelist continued  producing Oliver Twist  1837 39   Nicholas Nickleby  1838 39   The Old Curiosity Shop and  finally  Barnaby Rudge  A Tale of the Riots of  Eighty as part of the Master Humphrey s Clock series  1840 41  all published in monthly instalments before being made into books  During this period Dickens kept a pet raven named Grip  which he had stuffed when it died in 1841   It is now at the Free Library of Philadelphia   12  An 1839 portrait of a young Charles Dickens by Daniel Maclise On 2 April 1836  he married Catherine Thomson Hogarth  1816 1879   the daughter of George Hogarth  editor of the Evening Chronicle  After a brief honeymoon in Chalk  Kent  they set up home in Bloomsbury  They had ten children  Charles Culliford Boz Dickens  C  C  B  Dickens   later known as Charles Dickens  Jr   Mary Dickens  Kate Macready Dickens  Walter Landor Dickens  Francis Jeffrey Dickens  Alfred D Orsay Tennyson Dickens  Sydney Smith Haldimand Dickens  Sir Henry Fielding Dickens  Dora Annie Dickens  Edward Dickens  13  Dickens and his family lived at 48 Doughty Street  London   on which he had a three year lease at  80 a year  from 25 March 1837 until December 1839  Dickens s younger brother Frederick and Catherine s 17 year old sister Mary moved in with them  Dickens became very attached to Mary  and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837  She became a character in many of his books  and her death is fictionalised as the death of Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop  14  First visit to the United States Sketch of Dickens in 1842 during American Tour  Sketch of Dickens s sister Fanny bottom left In 1842  Dickens and his wife made his first trip to the United States and Canada  a journey which was successful in spite of his support for the abolition of slavery  It is described in the travelogue American Notes for General Circulation and is also the basis of some of the episodes in Martin Chuzzlewit  1843 44   Dickens includes in Notes a powerful condemnation of slavery  15  with  ample proof  of the  atrocities  he found  16  He also called upon President John Tyler at the White House  17  During his visit  Dickens spent a month in New York City  giving lectures  raising support for copyright laws  and recording many of his impressions of America  He met such luminaries as Washington Irving and William Cullen Bryant  On 14 February 1842  a Boz Ball was held in his honour at the Park Theater  with 3 000 guests  Among the neighbourhoods he visited were Five Points  Wall Street  The Bowery  and the prison known as The Tombs  18  At this time Georgina Hogarth  another sister of Catherine  joined the Dickens household  now living at Devonshire Terrace  Marylebone  to care for the young family they had left behind  19  She remained with them as housekeeper  organiser  adviser and friend until Dickens s death in 1870  Shortly thereafter  he began to show interest in Unitarian Christianity  although he remained an Anglican for the rest of his life  20  Soon after his return to England  Dickens began work on the first of his two or three famous Yuletide tales A Christmas Carol written in 1843  which was followed by The Chimes in 1844 and The Cricket on the Hearth in 1845  Of these  A Christmas Carol  was most popular and it did much to rekindle the joy of Christmas in Britain and America when the traditional celebration of Christmas was in decline  The seeds for the story were planted in Dickens s mind during a trip to Manchester to witness conditions of the manufacturing workers there  This  along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane Ragged School  caused Dickens to resolve to  strike a sledge hammer blow  for the poor  As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest  Dickens became engrossed in the book  He wrote that as the tale unfolded he  wept and laughed  and wept again  as he  walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed   After living briefly abroad in Italy  1844  Dickens travelled to Switzerland  1846   it was here he began work on Dombey and Son  1846 48   This and David Copperfield  1849 50  mark a significant artistic break in Dickens s career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works  Philanthropy In May 1846 Angela Burdett Coutts  heir to the Coutts banking fortune  approached Dickens about setting up a home for the redemption of fallen women  Coutts envisioned a home that would differ from existing institutions  which offered harsh and punishing regimes for these women  and instead provide an environment where they could learn to read and write and become proficient in domestic household chores so as to re integrate them into society  After initially resisting  Dickens eventually founded the home  named  Urania Cottage   in the Lime Grove section of Shepherds Bush  He became involved in many aspects of its day to day running  setting the house rules  reviewing the accounts and interviewing prospective residents  some of whom became characters in his books  He would scour prisons and workhouses for potentially suitable candidates and relied on friends  such as the Magistrate John Hardwick  to bring them to his attention  Each potential candidate was given a printed invitation written by Dickens called  An Appeal to Fallen Women   21  which he signed only as  Your friend   If the woman accepted the invitation  Dickens would personally interview her for admission  22  23  All of the women were required to emigrate following their time at Urania Cottage  In research published in 2009  the families of two of these women were identified  one in Canada and one in Australia  It is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and 1859  24  Middle years Ellen Ternan  1858  In late November 1851  Dickens moved into Tavistock House 25  where he would write Bleak House  1852 53   Hard Times  1854  and Little Dorrit  1857   It was here he indulged in the amateur theatricals which are described in Forster s  Life   In 1856  the income he was earning from his writing allowed him to buy Gad s Hill Place in Higham  Kent  As a child  Dickens had walked past the house and dreamed of living in it  The area was also the scene of some of the events of Shakespeare s Henry IV  Part 1 and this literary connection pleased him  In 1857  Dickens hired professional actresses for the play The Frozen Deep  which he and his prot g  Wilkie Collins had written  Dickens formed a bond with one of the actresses  Ellen Ternan  which was to last the rest of his life  He then separated from his wife  Catherine  in 1858   divorce was still unthinkable for someone as famous as he was  During this period  whilst pondering about giving public readings for his own profit  Dickens was approached by Great Ormond Street Hospital to help it survive its first major financial crisis through a charitable appeal  Dickens  whose philanthropy was well known  was asked to preside by his friend  the hospital s founder Charles West and he threw himself into the task  heart and soul 26   a little known fact is that Dickens reported anonymously in the weekly The Examiner in 1849 to help mishandled children and wrote another article to help publicise the hospital s opening in 1852   27  On 9 February 1858  Dickens spoke at the hospital s first annual festival dinner at Freemasons  Hall and later gave a public reading of A Christmas Carol at St  Martin in the Fields church hall  The events raised enough money to enable the hospital to purchase the neighbouring house  No  48 Great Ormond Street  increasing the bed capacity from 20 to 75  28  After separating from his wife in the summer of 1858 29  Dickens undertook his first series of public readings in London  which ended on 22 July  After 10 days rest  he began a gruelling and ambitious tour through the English provinces  Scotland and Ireland  beginning with a performance in Clifton on 2 August and closing in Brighton  more than three months later  on 13 November  Altogether he read eighty seven times  on some days giving both a matin e and an evening performance  30  At his desk in 1858 Major works  A Tale of Two Cities  1859   and Great Expectations  1861  soon followed and would prove resounding successes  During this time he was also the publisher and editor of  and a major contributor to  the journals Household Words  1850 1859  and All the Year Round  1858 1870   31  In early September 1860  in a field behind Gad s Hill  Dickens made a great bonfire of almost his entire correspondence   only those letters on business matters were spared  Since Ellen Ternan also burned all of his letters to her  the extent of the affair between the two was unknown until the publication in 1939 of Dickens and Daughter  a book about Dickens s relationship with his daughter Kate  Kate Dickens worked with author Gladys Storey on the book prior to her death in 1929  and alleged that Dickens and Ternan had a son who died in infancy  although no contemporary evidence exists  32  On his death  Dickens settled an annuity on Ternan which made her a financially independent woman  Claire Tomalin s book  The Invisible Woman  set out to prove that Ternan lived with Dickens secretly for the last 13 years of his life  The book was subsequently turned into a play  Little Nell  by Simon Gray  In the same period  Dickens furthered his interest in the paranormal becoming one of the early members of The Ghost Club  33  Charles Dickens was a friend of the family of Mary Ann Cooper  n e Mitton   and sometimes visited them  they lived in The Cedars  a house on the east side of Hatton Road  Hatton  London  the site of the house is now under the east end of London Heathrow Airport  She was the inspiration for his character Little Dorrit  34  Last years Crash scene after the Staplehurst rail crash On 9 June 1865  35  while returning from Paris with Ternan  Dickens was involved in the Staplehurst rail crash  The first seven carriages of the train plunged off a cast iron bridge under repair  The only first class carriage to remain on the track was the one in which Dickens was travelling  Dickens tried to help the wounded and the dying before rescuers arrived  Before leaving  he remembered the unfinished manuscript for Our Mutual Friend  and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it  Typically  Dickens later used this experience as material for his short ghost story The Signal Man in which the central character has a premonition of his own death in a rail crash  He based the story around several previous rail accidents  such as the Clayton Tunnel rail crash of 1861  Dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the inquest  to avoid disclosing that he had been travelling with Ternan and her mother  which would have caused a scandal  Although physically unharmed  Dickens never really recovered from the trauma of the Staplehurst crash  and his normally prolific writing shrank to completing Our Mutual Friend and starting the unfinished The Mystery of Edwin Drood  Much of his time was taken up with public readings from his best loved novels  Dickens was fascinated by the theatre as an escape from the world  and theatres and theatrical people appear in Nicholas Nickleby  The travelling shows were extremely popular  In 1866  a series of public readings were undertaken in England and Scotland  The following year saw more readings in England and Ireland  Second visit to the United States On 9 November 1867  Dickens sailed from Liverpool for his second American reading tour  Landing at Boston  he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as Ralph Waldo Emerson  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his American publisher James Thomas Fields  In early December  the readings began and Dickens spent the month shuttling between Boston and New York  Although he had started to suffer from what he called the  true American catarrh   he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man  even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in Central Park  Poster promoting a reading by Dickens in Nottingham dated 4 February 1869  two months before he suffered a mild stroke   In New York  he gave twenty two readings at Steinway Hall between 9 December 1867 and 18 April 1868  and four at Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims between 16 and 21 January 1868  During his travels  he saw a significant change in the people and the circumstances of America  His final appearance was at a banquet the American Press held in his honour at Delmonico s on 18 April  when he promised never to denounce America again  By the end of the tour  the author could hardly manage solid food  subsisting on champagne and eggs beaten in sherry  On 23 April  he boarded his ship to return to Britain  barely escaping a Federal Tax Lien against the proceeds of his lecture tour  18  Farewell readings Between 1868 and 1869  Dickens gave a series of  farewell readings  in England  Scotland  and Ireland  until he collapsed on 22 April 1869  at Preston in Lancashire showing symptoms of a mild stroke  36  After further provincial readings were cancelled  he began work on his final novel  The Mystery of Edwin Drood  In an opium den in Shadwell  he witnessed an elderly pusher known as  Opium Sal   who subsequently featured in his mystery novel  When he had regained sufficient strength  Dickens arranged  with medical approval  for a final series of readings at least partially to make up to his sponsors what they had lost due to his illness  There were to be twelve performances  running between 11 January and 15 March 1870  the last taking place at 8 00 pm at St  James s Hall in London  Although in grave health by this time  he read A Christmas Carol and The Trial from Pickwick  On 2 May  he made his last public appearance at a Royal Academy Banquet in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales  paying a special tribute to the passing of his friend  illustrator Daniel Maclise  37  Death Samuel Luke Fildes   The Empty Chair  Fildes was illustrating  Edwin Drood  at the time of Charles Dickens  death  The engraving shows Dickens  empty chair in his study at Gads Hill Place  It appeared in the Christmas 1870 edition of the The Graphic and thousands of prints of it were sold  Vicent van Gogh was an admirer of the print  38  39  On 8 June 1870  Dickens suffered another stroke at his home  after a full day s work on Edwin Drood  He never regained consciousness  and the next day  on 9 June  five years to the day after the Staplehurst rail crash  9 June 1865   he died at Gad s Hill Place  Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral  in an inexpensive  unostentatious  and strictly private manner   he was laid to rest in the Poets  Corner of Westminster Abbey  40  A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads   To the Memory of Charles Dickens  England s most popular author  who died at his residence  Higham  near Rochester  Kent  9 June 1870  aged 58 years  He was a sympathiser with the poor  the suffering  and the oppressed  and by his death  one of England s greatest writers is lost to the world   41  In his obituary published in The Times  Dickens s last words were reported to have been   Be natural my children  For the writer that is natural has fulfilled all the rules of art  42  On Sunday  19 June 1870  five days after Dickens was buried in the Abbey  Dean Arthur Penrhyn Stanley delivered a memorial elegy  lauding  the genial and loving humorist whom we now mourn   for showing by his own example  that even in dealing with the darkest scenes and the most degraded characters  genius could still be clean  and mirth could be innocent   Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelist s grave  Stanley assured those present that  the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old  as that of the representative of literature  not of this island only  but of all who speak our English tongue   43  Dickens s will stipulated that no memorial be erected to honour him  The only life size bronze statue of Dickens  cast in 1891 by Francis Edwin Elwell  is in Clark Park in the Spruce Hill neighbourhood of Philadelphia  Pennsylvania in the United States  The couch on which he died is preserved at the Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth  Literary style Dickens loved the style of the 18th century picturesque or Gothic romance novels  citation needed  although it had already become a target for parody  44  One  character  vividly drawn throughout his novels is London itself  From the coaching inns on the outskirts of the city to the lower reaches of the Thames  all aspects of the capital are described over the course of his body of work   Dickens  Dream  by Robert William Buss  portraying Dickens at his desk at Gads Hill Place surrounded by many of his characters His writing style is florid and poetic  with a strong comic touch  His satires of British aristocratic snobbery he calls one character the  Noble Refrigerator  are often popular  Comparing orphans to stocks and shares  people to tug boats  or dinner party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens s acclaimed flights of fancy  Many of his characters  names provide the reader with a hint as to the roles played in advancing the storyline  such as Mr  Murdstone in the novel David Copperfield  which is clearly a combination of  murder  and stony coldness  His literary style is also a mixture of fantasy and realism  Characters Dickensian characters  especially so because of their typically whimsical names  are amongst the most memorable in English literature  The likes of Ebenezer Scrooge  Tiny Tim  Jacob Marley  Bob Cratchit  Oliver Twist  The Artful Dodger  Fagin  Bill Sikes  Pip  Miss Havisham  Charles Darnay  David Copperfield  Mr  Micawber  Abel Magwitch  Daniel Quilp  Samuel Pickwick  Wackford Squeers  Uriah Heep are so well known as to be part and parcel of British culture  and in some cases have passed into ordinary language  a scrooge  for example  is a miser  The author worked closely with his illustrators supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them  45  He would brief the illustrator on plans for each month s instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them  Marcus Stone  illustrator of Our Mutual Friend  recalled that the author was always  ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics  and     life history of the creations of his fancy   30  This close working relationship is important to readers of Dickens today  The illustrations give us a glimpse of the characters as Dickens described them  Film makers still use the illustrations as a basis for characterisation  costume  and set design  Often these characters were based on people he knew  In a few instances Dickens based the character too closely on the original  as in the case of Harold Skimpole in Bleak House  based on James Henry Leigh Hunt  and Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield  based on his wife s dwarf chiropodist  Indeed  the acquaintances made when reading a Dickens novel are not easily forgotten  The author Virginia Woolf maintained that  we remodel our psychological geography when we read Dickens  as he produces  characters who exist not in detail  not accurately or exactly  but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks   46  Autobiographical elements An original illustration from the novel  David Copperfield  Widely regarded as Dickens s most autobiographical work  Phiz All authors might be said to incorporate autobiographical elements in their fiction  but with Dickens this is very noticeable  even though he took pains to mask what he considered his shameful  lowly past  David Copperfield is one of the most clearly autobiographical but the scenes from Bleak House of interminable court cases and legal arguments are drawn from the author s brief career as a court reporter  Dickens s own father was sent to prison for debt  and this became a common theme in many of his books  with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit resulting from Dickens s own experiences of the institution  Childhood sweethearts in many of his books  such as Little Em ly in David Copperfield  may have been based on Dickens s own childhood infatuation with Lucy Stroughill  47  48  The character of Fagin is believed to be based upon Ikey Solomon  a 19th century Jewish criminal of London and later Australia  It is reported that Dickens  during his time as a journalist  interviewed Solomon after a court appearance and that he was the inspiration for the gang leader in Oliver Twist  When the work was published in 1838 the unpleasant  to modern eyes  49  stereotype of the Jewish character  Fagin  as fence and corrupter of children perpetuated prejudices of the times  the characterisation meanwhile aroused no indignation  or even comment at the time of publication  50  Eliza Davis  whose husband had purchased Dickens s home in 1860 when he had put it up for sale  wrote to Dickens in 1963 in protest at his portrayal of Fagin  arguing that he had  encouraged a vile prejudice against the despised Hebrew   While Dickens pointed out that  all the rest of the wicked dramatis personae are Christians   and that he had  no feeling towards the jews but a friendly one   he took her complaint seriously  49  He halted the printing of Oliver Twist  and changed the text for the parts of the book that had not been set  In his novel  Our Mutual Friend  he created the character of Riah  meaning  friend  in Hebrew   Riah says in the novel   Men say   This is a bad Greek  but there are good Greeks  This is a bad Turk  but there are good Turks   Not so with the Jews     they take the worst of us as samples of the best      Davis sent Dickens a copy of the Hebrew bible in gratitude  49  Dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences  but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor  Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated  Episodic writing As noted above  most of Dickens s major novels were first written in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as Master Humphrey s Clock and Household Words  later reprinted in book form  These instalments made the stories cheap  accessible and the series of regular cliff hangers made each new episode widely anticipated  American fans even waited at the docks in New York  shouting out to the crew of an incoming ship   Is little Nell dead   51  52  53  Part of Dickens s great talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end  The monthly numbers were illustrated by  amongst others   Phiz   a pseudonym for Hablot Browne   Among his who   best known works are Great Expectations  David Copperfield  Oliver Twist  A Tale of Two Cities  Bleak House  Nicholas Nickleby  The Pickwick Papers  and A Christmas Carol   Charles Dickens as he appears when reading   Wood engraving from Harper s Weekly  7 December 1867 Dickens s technique of writing in monthly or weekly instalments  depending on the work  can be understood by analysing his relationship with his illustrators  The several artists who filled this role were privy to the contents and intentions of Dickens s instalments before the general public  Thus  by reading these correspondences between author and illustrator  the intentions behind Dickens s work can be better understood  These also reveal how the interests of the reader and author do not coincide  A great example of that appears in the monthly novel Oliver Twist  At one point in this work  Dickens had Oliver become embroiled in a robbery  That particular monthly instalment concludes with young Oliver being shot  Readers expected that they would be forced to wait only a month to find out the outcome of that gunshot  In fact  Dickens did not reveal what became of young Oliver in the succeeding number  Rather  the reading public was forced to wait two months to discover if the boy lived  Another important impact of Dickens s episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers  Since Dickens did not write the chapters very far ahead of their publication  he was allowed to witness the public reaction and alter the story depending on those public reactions  A fine example of this process can be seen in his weekly serial The Old Curiosity Shop  which is a chase story  In this novel  Nell and her grandfather are fleeing the villain Quilp  The progress of the novel follows the gradual success of that pursuit  As Dickens wrote and published the weekly instalments  his friend John Forster pointed out   You know you re going to have to kill her  don t you   Why this end was necessary can be explained by a brief analysis of the difference between the structures of a comedy versus a tragedy  In a comedy  the action covers a sequence  You think they re going to lose  you think they re going to lose  they win   In tragedy  it is   You think they re going to win  you think they re going to win  they lose   The dramatic conclusion of the story is implicit throughout the novel  So  as Dickens wrote the novel in the form of a tragedy  the sad outcome of the novel was a foregone conclusion  If he had not caused his heroine to lose  he would not have completed his dramatic structure  Dickens admitted that his friend Forster was right and  in the end  Nell died  54  Social commentary Dickens s novels were  among other things  works of social commentary  He was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society  Dickens s second novel  Oliver Twist  1839   shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime and was responsible for the clearing of the actual London slum  Jacob s Island  that was the basis of the story  In addition  with the character of the tragic prostitute  Nancy  Dickens  humanised  such women for the reading public  women who were regarded as  unfortunates   inherently immoral casualties of the Victorian class economic system  Bleak House and Little Dorrit elaborated expansive critiques of the Victorian institutional apparatus  the interminable lawsuits of the Court of Chancery that destroyed people s lives in Bleak House and a dual attack in Little Dorrit on inefficient  corrupt patent offices and unregulated market speculation  Literary techniques Dickens is often described as using  idealised  characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals  The story of Nell Trent in The Old Curiosity Shop  1841  was received as incredibly moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by Oscar Wilde   You would need to have a heart of stone   he declared in one of his famous witticisms   not to laugh at the death of little Nell   55   although her death actually takes place off stage   In 1903 G  K  Chesterton said   It is not the death of little Nell  but the life of little Nell  that I object to   56  In Oliver Twist Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically  good  that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young pickpockets  While later novels also centre on idealised characters  Esther Summerson in Bleak House and Amy Dorrit in Little Dorrit   this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens s goal of poignant social commentary  Many of his novels are concerned with social realism  focusing on mechanisms of social control that direct people s lives  for instance  factory networks in Hard Times and hypocritical exclusionary class codes in Our Mutual Friend   citation needed Dickens also employs incredible coincidences  e g   Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper class family that randomly rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group   Such coincidences are a staple of eighteenth century picaresque novels such as Henry Fielding s Tom Jones that Dickens enjoyed so much  But  to Dickens  these were not just plot devices but an index of the humanism that led him to believe that good wins out in the end and often in unexpected ways  citation needed  Legacy Dickens continues to be one of the best known and most read of English authors  and his works have never gone out of print  3  At least 180 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickens s works help confirm his success  57  Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime and as early as 1913 a silent film of The Pickwick Papers was made  His characters were often so memorable that they took on a life of their own outside his books  Gamp became a slang expression for an umbrella from the character Mrs  Gamp and Pickwickian  Pecksniffian  and Gradgrind all entered dictionaries due to Dickens s original portraits of such characters who were quixotic  hypocritical  or emotionlessly logical  Sam Weller  the carefree and irreverent valet of The Pickwick Papers  was an early superstar  perhaps better known than his author at first  It is likely that A Christmas Carol stands as his best known story  with new adaptations almost every year  It is also the most filmed of Dickens s stories  with many versions dating from the early years of cinema  This simple morality tale with both pathos and its theme of redemption  sums up  for many  the true meaning of Christmas  Indeed  it eclipses all other Yuletide stories in not only popularity  but in adding archetypal figures  Scrooge  Tiny Tim  the Christmas ghosts  to the Western cultural consciousness  A prominent phrase from the tale   Merry Christmas   was popularised following the appearance of the story  58  The term Scrooge became a synonym for miser  with  Bah  Humbug   dismissive of the festive spirit  59  Novelist William Makepeace Thackeray called the book  a national benefit  and to every man and woman who reads it a personal kindness   60  Some historians claim the book significantly redefined the  spirit  and importance of Christmas  61  62  and initiated a rebirth of seasonal merriment after Puritan authorities in 17th century England and America suppressed pagan rituals associated with the holiday  63  According to the historian Ronald Hutton  the current state of the observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid Victorian revival of the holiday spearheaded by A Christmas Carol  Dickens sought to construct Christmas as a family centred festival of generosity  in contrast to the community based and church centred observations  the observance of which had dwindled during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries  64  Superimposing his secular vision of the holiday  Dickens influenced many aspects of Christmas that are celebrated today among Western nations  such as family gatherings  seasonal food and drink  dancing  games  and a festive generosity of spirit  65 A Christmas Carol rejuvenated his career as a renowned author  A Tale of Two Cities is Dickens best selling novel  Since its inaugural publication in 1859  the novel has sold over 200 million copies  and is among the most famous works of fiction  66  At a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world  Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society  Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues such as sanitation and the workhouse but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities  He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist  but flourished as a result  His most strident indictment of this condition is in Hard Times  1854   Dickens s only novel length treatment of the industrial working class  In this work  he uses both vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed  Hands  by the factory owners  that is  not really  people  but rather only appendages of the machines that they operated  His writings inspired others  in particular journalists and political figures  to address such problems of class oppression  For example  the prison scenes in The Pickwick Papers are claimed to have been influential in having the Fleet Prison shut down  As Karl Marx said  Dickens  and the other novelists of Victorian England      issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians  publicists and moralists put together      67  The exceptional popularity of his novels  even those with socially oppositional themes  Bleak House  1853  Little Dorrit  1857  Our Mutual Friend  1865  underscored not only his almost preternatural ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters  but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored  His fiction  with often vivid descriptions of life in nineteenth century England  has inaccurately and anachronistically come to symbolise on a global level Victorian society  1837   1901  as uniformly  Dickensian   when in fact  his novels  time span spanned from the 1770s to the 1860s  In the decade following his death in 1870  a more intense degree of socially and philosophically pessimistic perspectives invested British fiction  such themes stood in marked contrast to the religious faith that ultimately held together even the bleakest of Dickens s novels  Dickens clearly influenced later Victorian novelists such as Thomas Hardy and George Gissing  their works display a greater willingness to confront and challenge the Victorian institution of religion  They also portray characters caught up by social forces  primarily via lower class conditions   but they usually steered them to tragic ends beyond their control  Novelists continue to be influenced by his books  for instance  such disparate current writers as Anne Rice  Tom Wolfe  and John Irving evidence direct Dickensian connections  Humorist James Finn Garner even wrote a tongue in cheek  politically correct  version of A Christmas Carol  and other affectionate parodies include the Radio 4 comedy Bleak Expectations  Matthew Pearl s novel The Last Dickens is a thriller about how Charles Dickens would have ended The Mystery of Edwin Drood  In the UK survey entitled The Big Read carried out by the BBC in 2003  five of Dickens s books were named in the Top 100  featuring alongside Terry Pratchett with the most  68  Although Dickens s life has been the subject of at least two TV miniseries  a television film The Great Inimitable Mr  Dickens in which he was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins  and two famous one man shows  he has never been the subject of a Hollywood big screen biography  69  Actor Simon Cowell has also toured doing one man shows as Charles Dickens doing readings from his novels as Dickens himself often did publicly  in a manner similar to Hal Holbrook s one man shows portraying Mark Twain doing readings from his works  Cowell also played Charles Dickens on an episode of Doctor Who  Controversies over Racism and anti Semitism Main article  Charles Dickens  Racism and anti Semitism Fagin waits to be hanged  Although Charles Dickens is best known as a writer of coming of age novels about children and adolescents and as a champion of the downtrodden poor  it has often been noted that both in his journalism and fiction he expresses attitudes that are profoundly racist and xenophobic  The best known instance of this is the deeply anti Semitic portrait of Fagin in one of his most widely read early novels Oliver Twist  Dickens  attacked John Rae s report on the fate of the Franklin expedition  based on Inuit testimonies  calling the Inuit evidence unreliable  and attacking their character as covetous and cruel  He co authorized the play The Frozen Deep  as an allegorical attack on Rae  Dickens advocated genocide against the Indian race  in response to the Indian Rebellion of 1857  writing the allegorical The Perils of Certain English Prisoners  In his essay The Noble Savage  Dickens  attitude towards Native Americans is one of condescending pity  tempered  in the interpretation of Grace Moore  70  by a counter balancing concern with the arrogance of European colonialism  This essay was Dickens  rejection of painter George Catlin s positive portrayal of Native Americans  The term  Noble Savage  was in circulation since the 17th century  but Dickens regards it as an absurd oxymoron  He advocated that savages be civilised  off the face of the earth   Dickens is sometimes thought of as a champion of the oppressed  but his humanitarian impulse often seems to extend only to other Europeans  Questions have been raised as to whether Dickens believed in racial superiority or was instead a cultural chauvinist  71  Dickens scholar Grace Moore sees Dickens  racism as having abated in his later years  while cultural historian Patrick Brantlinger and journalist William Oddie see it as having intensified  72  Moore acknowledges that while Dickens later in life became far more sensitive to the unethical character of British colonialism and came to plead mitigation of cruelties to natives  he never lost his disdain for the life style of those he regarded as  primitive   The role of Fagin in Oliver Twist continues to be a challenge for actors who struggle with questions as to how to interpret the role in a post Nazi era  Various Jewish writers  directors  and actors have searched for ways to  salvage  Fagin  Late in life  Dickens developed close friendships with Jews and unambiguously retracted his earlier anti Semitic views and created a sympathetic Jewish character in his novel Our Mutual Friend  However  Dickens  expressions of revulsion at non European peoples and his advocacy of civilizing savages remains a subject in controversy  Names   Dickens  and  Boz  Frontispiece  Sketches by Boz  written by Dickens with illustrations by George Cruikshank  1837  Charles Dickens had  as a contemporary critic put it  a  queer name   73  The name Dickens was used in interjective exclamations like  What the Dickens   as a substitute for  devil   It was recorded in the OED as originating from Shakespeare s The Merry Wives of Windsor  It was also used in the phrase  to play the Dickens  in the meaning  to play havoc mischief   74   Boz  was Dickens s occasional pen name  but was a familiar name in the Dickens household long before Charles became a famous author  It was actually taken from his youngest brother Augustus Dickens  family nickname  Moses   given to him in honour of one of the brothers in The Vicar of Wakefield  one of the most widely read novels during the early 19th century   When playfully pronounced through the nose  Moses  became  Boses   and was later shortened to  Boz    pronounced through the nose with a long vowel  o   75  Siblings Frances  Fanny  Elizabeth Dickens 1810 1848 Letitia Dickens 1816 1893 Harriet
