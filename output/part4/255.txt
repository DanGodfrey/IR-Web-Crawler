and H  G  Peter  She first appeared in All Star Comics  8  December 1941   The Wonder Woman title has been published by DC Comics almost continuously except for a brief hiatus in 1986  1  Wonder Woman is a warrior Princess of the Amazons  based on the Amazons of Greek mythology  and was created by Marston  an American  as a  distinctly feminist role model whose mission was to bring the Amazon ideals of love  peace  and sexual equality to a world torn by the hatred of men    2  Known in her homeland as Diana of Themyscira  her powers include superhuman strength  flight  even though the original Wonder Woman did not have this ability   super speed  super stamina  and super agility  She is highly proficient in hand to hand combat and in the art of tactical warfare  She also possesses animal like cunning skills and a natural rapport with animals  which has been presented as an actual ability to communicate with the animal kingdom  She uses her Lasso of Truth  which forces those bound by it to tell the truth  a pair of indestructible bracelets  a tiara which serves as a projectile  and  in some stories  an invisible airplane  Created during World War II  the character was initially depicted fighting the Axis military forces  as well as an assortment of supervillains  In later decades  some writers maintained the World War II setting  with many of its themes and story arcs  while others updated the series to reflect the present day  Wonder Woman has also regularly appeared in comic books featuring the superhero teams Justice Society  from 1941  and Justice League  from 1960   Arguably the most popular and iconic female superhero in comics  Wonder Woman is also considered a feminist icon  2  She was named the 20th greatest comic book character by Empire magazine  3  She was ranked sixth in Comics Buyer s Guide s  100 Sexiest Women in Comics  list  4  In addition to the comics  the character has appeared in other media  most notably  the 1975 1979 Wonder Woman TV series starring Lynda Carter  as well as animated series such as the Super Friends and Justice League  Although a number of attempts have been made to adapt the character to live action film  none has yet emerged from development hell  An animated film was released in 2009  with Keri Russell voicing the title role  In 2011  Adrianne Palicki starred in a failed pilot for a would be series about the character  In May 2011  Wonder Woman placed fifth on IGN s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time  5  Contents 1 Publication history 1 1 Creation 1 2 Evolution of the character 2 Powers and

25  1940 interview published in Family Circle titled  Don t Laugh at the Comics   William Moulton Marston described what he saw as the great educational potential of comic books  6  This article caught the attention of comics publisher Max Gaines  who hired Marston as an educational consultant for National Periodicals and All American Publications  two of the companies that would merge to form DC Comics  At that time  Marston decided to develop a new superhero  Family Circle published a follow up article two years later from issue of the Boston University alumni magazine  it was Marston s wife Elizabeth s idea to create a female superheroine  William Moulton Marston  a psychologist already famous for inventing the polygraph  forerunner to the magic lasso   struck upon an idea for a new kind of superhero  one who would triumph not with fists or firepower  but with love   Fine   said Elizabeth   But make her a woman   7  Marston introduced the idea to Gaines  co founder of All American Publications  Given the go ahead  Marston developed Wonder Woman with Elizabeth  whom Marston believed to be a model of that era s unconventional  liberated woman  7  Marston was also inspired by Olive Byrne  who lived with the couple in a polygamous polyamorous relationship  8  Both women served as exemplars for the character and greatly influenced the character s creation  7  Wonder Woman debuted in All Star Comics  8  December 1941   scripted by Marston and with art by Harry G  Peter  Marston was the creator of a systolic blood pressure measuring apparatus  which was crucial to the development of the polygraph  lie detector   Marston s experience with polygraphs convinced him that women were more honest and reliable than men and could work more efficiently  9   Wonder Woman is psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who should  I believe  rule the world   Marston wrote  1  Although Gloria Steinem placed Wonder Woman on the first standalone cover of Ms  in 1972  Marston  writing in an earlier time  designed Wonder Woman to represent a particular form of female empowerment  Feminism argues that women are equal to men and should be treated as such  Marston s representative of femininity is a 6 foot tall Amazon wielding a golden lasso that forces obedience on those it encircles  neutrality is disputed  In Marston s mind  women not only held the potential to be as good as men but to be superior to men  original research   In a 1943 issue of The American Scholar  Marston wrote  Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force  strength  and power  Not wanting to be girls  they don t want to be tender  submissive  peace loving as good women are  Women s strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness  The obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman  During this period  Wonder Woman joined the Justice Society of America as the female member  10  albeit as the group s secretary  since the custom was that characters who had their own comic books would hold only honorary membership   edit  Evolution of the character Wonder Woman s new costume  in Wonder Woman  607  Feb  2011   Art by Don Kramer  Initially  Wonder Woman was an Amazon champion who wins the right to return Steve Trevor   a United States intelligence officer whose plane had crashed on the Amazons  isolated island homeland   to  Man s World  and to fight crime and the evil of the Nazis  During the Silver Age  Wonder Woman s origin was revamped  11  along with other characters   The new origin story increased the character s Hellenic and mythological roots  receiving the blessing of each deity in her crib  Diana is destined to become  beautiful as Aphrodite  wise as Athena  stronger than Hercules  and swifter than Mercury   12  At the end of the 1960s  under the guidance of Mike Sekowsky  Wonder Woman surrendered her powers in order to remain in Man s World rather than accompany her fellow Amazons to another dimension  Becoming a mod boutique owner  the powerless Diana Prince acquired a Chinese mentor named I Ching  Under I Ching s guidance  Diana learned martial arts and weapons skills and engaged in adventures that encompassed a variety of genres  from espionage to mythology  Because of the popularity of the Wonder Woman TV series  the character later returned to her superpowered roots in Justice League of America and to the World War II era in her own title  Following the 1985 Crisis on Infinite Earths series  George P rez  Len Wein  and Greg Potter relaunched the character  writing Wonder Woman as an emissary and ambassador from Themyscira to Patriarch s World  charged with the mission of bringing peace to the outside world  In August 2010  issue  600   DC Comics replaced the character s iconic stars and stripes singlet with a blue jacket  later discarded   red and gold top and dark pants  retaining only her tiara and lasso  13  In 2011  DC Comics relaunched its entire line of publications to attract a new generation of readers  In this new continuity  Wonder Woman wears a costume similar to her original costume  Also  her origin is significantly changed and she is no longer a clay figure brought to life by the magic of the gods  Instead  she is a demigod  the natural born daughter of Hippolyta and Zeus   edit  Powers and abilities  edit  Pre Crisis Originally  Wonder Woman owed her abilities to the goddess Aphrodite creating Amazons superior to men  with Diana being the best of their kind  The Golden Age Wonder Woman was later updated by Marston to be able to will a tremendous amount of brain energy into her muscles and limbs because of her Amazon training  endowing her with extraordinary strength and speed  According to her first appearance  she is stronger and more agile than a hundred of the best human athletes  In Sensation Comics  6  June 1942   she is able to tear a steel door off its hinges  In one of her earliest appearances  she is shown running easily at 60 mph  14  In the same comic  she jumps from a building and lands on the balls of her feet  She can even type at a rate of over 160 words a minute during a test given to her  It was implied  and ultimately confirmed  that any woman who underwent Amazon training would gain superhuman strength  15  The TV series took up this notion  16  and in the first episode of Super Friends  Diana states to Aquaman      the only thing that can surpass super strength is the power of the brain   In early Wonder Woman stories  17  Amazon training involves strengthening this ability using pure mental energy  Her powers would be removed in accordance with  Aphrodite s Law  if she allowed herself to be bound or chained by a male  However the effects of this varied  18  In the television series  her magic belt allowed her to retain her powers when she was not on Paradise Island  removing it weakened her  16  Also  she had no powers when she was her alter ego Diana Prince  there was no given explanation for this  With the inclusion of Wonder Girl and  Wonder Tot  in Diana s back story  writers provided new explanations of her powers  the character became capable of feats which her sister Amazons could not equal  Wonder Woman  vol  1   105 reveals that Diana was formed from clay by the Queen of the Amazons and was imbued with the attributes of the Greek and Roman gods by Athena    beautiful as Aphrodite  wise as Athena  swifter than Hermes  and stronger than Hercules   12  Wonder Woman s Amazon training also gave her limited telepathy  profound scientific knowledge  12  and the ability to speak every language known to man and beyond  She was even fluent in caveman 12  19  and Martian  19  Although Wonder Woman s mythos was returned to its original interpretation between 1966 and 1967  new abilities were added  super breath  the ability to blow jet streams or transform water into snow  which apparently came from Hercules  ventriloquism  imperviousness to extremes of heat and cold  the ability to ride the air currents as if flying  even sensing air updrafts with her fingers  telepathy  including the ability to project images  microscopic vision  the ability to vibrate into another dimension  the ability to bestow wisdom to other beings  the ability to throw her tiara with such skill it could stop bullets  and others  according to the Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes  20  Depending on the writer  Diana s invulnerability and power varied greatly according to the needs of the story  Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s  Robert Kanigher  for example  portrayed Wonder Woman as being so strong that she  after standing atop her hovering plane and lassoing it with her magic lasso  was able to effortlessly lift Themyscira out of the way of an approaching tsunami using just one hand  She was able to make a coin into a bridge with her strength  or drill through a mountain within seconds  as well as hurl spaceships with enough accuracy she could bowl over a whole fleet  Her fingernails could cut through a steel door  21  She was even able to flip straight over while nearly paralyzed  and split a tree falling on her with her Amazonian boots  22  Kanigher showed Wonder Woman as a preteen able to lift whales  push a ship away from a whirlpool  and also as a toddler able to blow so hard on her birthday cake that she sent it into orbit  23  In the Silver and Bronze ages of comics  Wonder Woman was able to further increase her strength  She was unable to remove her bracelets without going insane  In times of great need  however  she would do just that  in order to temporarily augment her power tenfold  Since she would become a threat to friend and foe alike  she would use Amazonian berserker rage only as a weapon of last resort  24  Before Crisis on Infinite Earths there were two Wonder Women  the first one lived on Earth Two  the second  on Earth One  The first canonical appearance of the Earth One Wonder Woman is Wonder Woman  vol  1   80  February 1956   Their first published meeting is Justice League of America  vol  1   100  August 1972   however  their earliest meeting within the DC continuity is Wonder Woman  vol  1   228  February 1977   which takes place in 1943  prior to the events of the Justice League of America story   edit  Post Crisis After a brief interrogation  Diana places the head of To Choi Industries in a state of slumber  Wonder Woman s body is a mystical creation made from the clay surrounding Themyscira  Through divine means  her disembodied soul was nurtured in and retrieved from the Cavern of Souls  25  Once the soul was placed into the body  it immediately came to life and was blessed with metahuman abilities by six Olympian deities  Demeter  the goddess of agriculture and fertility  blessed Diana with strength drawn from the Earth spirit Gaea  making her one of the physically strongest heroes in the DC Universe  26  She has been observed assisting in preventing large chunks of the Moon from crashing onto the Earth  27  supporting the weight of bridges  28  or hefting entire railroad trains  28  Although stated as possibly being physically weaker and slower than  for example  Power Girl  Diana s superior warrior training more than makes up for it  along with strength drawn from the earth itself  she is able to overpower either Kara  29  or her counterpart Supergirl   30  and hold her own against beings such as Superman and Captain Marvel  Furthermore  unlike most of her contemporaries in Man s World  Diana is willing to use deadly force  which gives her more options to deal with opponents as circumstances dictate  While not invulnerable  she is capable of withstanding great concussive force  26  shrugging off high powered rifle fire with some pain but little injury  citation needed  being knocked through a building  and even surviving a warp core explosion  citation needed  She is durable enough to survive the rigors of space until she runs out of breath  While her superhuman strength affords her great resistance to blunt force trauma  her skin can be cut by weapons if they are sharp enough  Her muscles do not produce lactic acids  giving her great stamina  This allowed her to once battle a clone of Doomsday  Aphrodite  the goddess of love and beauty  blessed Diana with great beauty and a loving heart  Pallas Athena  the goddess of wisdom and war  granted Diana great wisdom  intelligence  and military prowess  Athena s gift has enabled Diana to master over a dozen languages  including those of alien origin   multiple complex crafts  sciences and philosophies  as well as leadership  military strategy  and armed and unarmed combat  She can mimic voices  although it is more difficult for her to mimic a man s voice  More recently  Athena bound her own eyesight to Diana s  granting her increased empathy  31  Artemis  goddess of the hunt  animals  and the Moon  graced Diana with the Eyes of the Hunter and Unity with Beasts  The Eyes of the Hunter ability gives Diana a full range of enhanced senses  including enhanced sight and hearing  Unity with Beasts grants her the ability to communicate with all forms of animal life and to calm even the most ferocious of beasts  28  Hestia  goddess of hearth and home  granted Diana  sisterhood with fire  that it might open men s hearts to her   This power has been shown to control the  Fires of Truth   which Diana wields through her lasso  making anyone bound by it unable to lie  This ability also grants her resistance to both normal and supernatural fire  citation needed  Hermes  the messenger god of speed  granted Diana superhuman speed and the ability to fly  By concentrating  Diana can mystically defy the laws of gravity and propel herself through the air to achieve flight  She is capable of flying at speeds approaching half the speed of light  26  She is swift enough to deflect bullets  lasers  and other projectiles with her virtually impenetrable bracelets  Her brain can process information at an incredibly fast rate  Diana possesses the ability to relieve her body of physical injury and toxins by becoming one with the Earth s soil and then reforming her body whole again  32  During John Byrne s run  it was stated that this is a ritual so sacred that it is used only in the most dire of circumstances  33  She is able to astrally project herself into various lands of myth  34  Her physical body reacts to whatever happens to her on the mythical astral plane  leaving her body cut  bruised  or sometimes strengthened once her mind and body are reunited  She can apparently leave the planet through meditation  and did this once to rescue Artemis while she was in hell   edit  Skills All versions of Diana depict her as a masterful athlete  acrobat  fighter and strategist  trained and experienced in many ancient and modern forms of armed and unarmed combat  including exclusively Amazonian martial arts  In some versions  her mother trained her  as Wonder Girl  for a future career as Wonder Woman  From the beginning  she is portrayed as highly skilled in using her Amazon bracelets to stop bullets and in wielding her golden lasso  35  She is a superior warrior who has beaten Batman  Big Barda  and Black Canary in sparring matches  The modern version of the character differs from her compatriots in that she is willing to use deadly force when she deems it necessary  36   edit  Weapons Diana has an arsenal of powerful god forged weapons at her disposal  but her signature weapons are her indestructible bracelets and the Lasso of Truth  Her bulletproof bracelets were formed from the remnants of Athena s legendary shield  the Aegis  to be awarded to her champion  The shield was made from the indestructible hide of the great she goat  Amalthea  who suckled Zeus as an infant  These forearm guards have thus far proven indestructible and able to absorb the impact of incoming attacks  allowing Wonder Woman to deflect automatic weapon fire and energy blasts  37  Diana can also slam the bracelets together to create a wave of concussive force capable of making Superman s ears bleed  36  Recently  she gained the ability to channel Zeus s lightning through her bracelets as well  Zeus explained to her that this power had been contained within the bracelets since their creation  because they were once part of the Aegis  and that he had only recently unlocked it for her use  38  The Lasso of Truth  or Lariat of Hestia  was forged by Hephaestus from the golden girdle of Gaea  28  It is virtually indestructible  28  the only times it has been broken were when truth itself was challenged  such as when she confronted Rama Khan of Jarhanpur  39  and by Bizarro in Matt Wagner s non canonical Batman Superman Wonder Woman  Trinity  40  In Sensation Comics  6  June 1942   Hippolyta claims that not even Hercules can break it  The Lasso burns with a magical aura called the Fires of Hestia  forcing anyone within the Lasso s confines to be truthful  It also at one time had the power to force anyone caught to obey any command given them  even overriding other kinds of mind control  this was effective enough to defeat strong willed beings like Captain Marvel  41  Diana wields the lasso with great precision and accuracy and can use it as a whip or noose  As early as the 1950s  23  Wonder Woman s Golden Tiara has also doubled as a dagger and a throwing weapon  returning to her like a boomerang  28  Its sharpness and mystical nature proved enough to cut even Superman  36  Diana once possessed the Sandals of Hermes  or talaria  which granted the wearer great speed and flight  and the ability to travel beyond the mystical veil that protected the island of Themiscyra from Man s World  They were passed on first to Artemis and later to Wonder Girl  Diana also once possessed the Gauntlets of Atlas  which magnify the physical strength and stamina of the wearer  they too were passed on  The Golden  Silver  and Bronze Age portrayals of Wonder Woman showed her using an Invisible Airplane that could be controlled by mental command  It was variously described as being either a creation of Amazon technology or the legendary winged horse Pegasus transformed into an aircraft  Its appearance varied as well  originally it had a propeller  while later it was drawn as a jet aircraft resembling a fighter plane  The post Crisis or Modern Age Wonder Woman has continued to use the Invisible Plane  in the form of a small lightweight disc of alien  Lansinar  technology that  when triggered by her thoughts  transforms into a transparent version of whatever object or vehicle is appropriate for her needs  This disc was revealed to be a sentient life form  Following the  One Year Later  continuity jump  Diana was given a new invisible plane  created by Wayne Industries  because her original invisible plane was stuck on Themyscira  Diana occasionally uses additional weaponry in formal battle  such as ceremonial golden armor with golden wings  war skirt  chest plate  and a golden helmet in the shape of an eagle s head  She also possesses a sword forged by Hephaestus that is sharp enough to cut the electrons off an atom  28  As a recent temporary inductee into the Star Sapphires  Wonder Woman gained access to the violet power ring of love  This ring allowed her to alter her costume at will  create solid light energy constructs  and reveal a person s true love to them  She was able to combine the energy with her lasso to enhance its ability   edit  Other versions  edit  Just Imagine  Stan Lee Creating Wonder Woman
