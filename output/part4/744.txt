amp T and Verizon  The Computer  amp  Communication Industry Association  CCIA   which counts Google  Microsoft  Yahoo and eBay among its members  is opposed to the merger   A deal like this  if not

phone and Internet communications of AT amp T customers without warrants  If true  this would violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and the First and Fourth Amendments of the U S  Constitution  AT amp T has yet to confirm or deny that monitoring by the NSA is occurring  In April 2006  a retired former AT amp T technician  Mark Klein  lodged an affidavit supporting this allegation  61  62  The Department of Justice has stated they will intervene in this lawsuit by means of State Secrets Privilege  63  In July 2006  the United States District Court for the Northern

Internet traffic which passes through its network for intellectual property violations  70  Commentators in the media have speculated that if this plan is implemented  it would lead to a mass exodus

justification for government mandated network neutrality   edit  Discrimination against local Public access television channels AT amp T is accused by community media groups of discriminating against local Public  educational  and government access  PEG  cable TV channels   by  imposing unfair restrictions that will severely restrict the audience   72  According to Barbara Popovic  Executive Director of the Chicago public access service CAN TV  the new AT amp T U verse system forces all Public access television into a special menu system  denying normal functionality such as channel numbers  access to the standard program guide  and DVR recording  72  The Ratepayer Advocates division of the California Public Utilities Commission reported   Instead of putting the stations on individual channels  AT amp T has bundled community stations into a generic channel that can only be navigated through a complex and lengthy process   72  Sue Buske  president of telecommunications consulting firm the Buske Group and a former head of the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers Alliance for Community Media  argue that this is  an overall attack       on public access across the  United States   the place in the dial around cities and communities where people can make their own media in their own communities   72   edit  Information security In June 2010  a hacker group known as Goatse Security discovered a vulnerability within the AT amp T that could allow anyone to uncover email addresses belonging to customers of AT amp T 3G service for the Apple iPad  73  These email addresses could be accessed without a protective password  74  Using a script  Goatse Security collected thousands of email addresses from AT amp T  73  Goatse Security informed AT amp T about the security flaw through a third party  75  Goatse Security then disclosed around 114 000 of these emails to Gawker Media  which published an article about the security flaw and disclosure in Valleywag  73  75  Praetorian Security Group criticized the web application that Goatse Security exploited as  poorly designed   73   edit  Accusations of Enabling Fraud In March 2012  the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against AT amp T  The specific accusations state that AT amp T  violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes  The complaint alleges that  out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline  AT amp T knowingly adopted a non compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States  The complaint further contends that AT amp T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers  which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT amp T s call volume  The government s complaint alleges that AT amp T improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result    76   edit  Naming
