technology Outline of prehistoric technology v t e The Industrial Revolution was a period from 1750 to 1850 where changes in agriculture  manufacturing  mining  transportation  and technology had a profound effect on the social  economic and cultural conditions of the times  It began in the United Kingdom  then subsequently spread throughout Western Europe  North America  Japan  and eventually the rest of the world  The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history  almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way  Most notably  average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth  In the two centuries following 1800  the world s average per capita income increased over tenfold  while the world s population increased over sixfold  2  In the words of Nobel Prize winner Robert E  Lucas  Jr    For the first time in history  the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth     Nothing remotely like this economic behavior has happened before   3  Great Britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled entrepreneurs to pioneer the industrial revolution  4  Starting in the later part of the 18th century  there began a transition in parts of Great Britain s previously manual labour and draft animal based economy towards machine based manufacturing  It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries  the development of iron making techniques and the increased use of refined coal  5  Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of canals  improved roads and railways  6  With the transition away from an agricultural based economy and towards machine based manufacturing came a great influx of population from the countryside and into the towns and cities  which swelled in population  7  The introduction of steam power fuelled primarily by coal  wider utilisation of water wheels and powered machinery  mainly in textile manufacturing  underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity  6  The development of all metal machine tools in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries  The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century  eventually affecting most of the world  a process that continues as industrialisation  The impact of this change on society was enormous  8  The First Industrial Revolution  which began in the 18th century  merged into the Second Industrial Revolution around 1850  when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam powered ships  railways  and later in the 19th century with the internal combustion engine and electrical power generation  The period of time covered by the Industrial Revolution varies with different historians  Eric Hobsbawm held that it  broke out  in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s  9  while T  S  Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830  10  Some 20th century historians such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts have argued that the process of economic and social change took place gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer  This is still a subject of debate among historians  11  12 GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy  13  The Industrial Revolution began an era of per capita economic growth in capitalist economies  14  Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants  15  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Innovations 2

term  Industrial Revolution  seems to be a letter of 6 July 1799 by French envoy Louis Guillaume Otto  announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise  16  In his 1976 book Keywords  A Vocabulary of Culture and Society  Raymond Williams states in the entry for  Industry    The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in Southey and Owen  between 1811 and 1818  and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth at the turn of the century   The term Industrial Revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s  as in Louis Auguste Blanqui description in 1837 of la r volution industrielle  Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of  an industrial revolution  a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society   Credit for popularising the term may be given to Arnold Toynbee  whose lectures given in 1881 gave a detailed account of it  17  Innovations The only surviving example of a Spinning mule built by the inventor Samuel Crompton The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations  18  made in the second half of the 18th century  Textiles   Cotton spinning using Richard Arkwright s water frame  James Hargreaves s Spinning Jenny  and Samuel Crompton s Spinning Mule  a combination of the Spinning Jenny and the Water Frame   This was patented in 1769 and so came out of patent in 1783  The end of the patent was rapidly followed by the erection of many cotton mills  Similar technology was subsequently applied to spinning worsted yarn for various textiles and flax for linen  The cotton revolution began in Derby  which has been known since this period as the  Powerhouse of the North   Steam power   The improved steam engine invented by James Watt and patented in 1775 was at first mainly used to power pumps for pumping water out of mines  but from the 1780s was applied to power other types of machines  This enabled rapid development of efficient semi automated factories on a previously unimaginable scale in places where waterpower was not available  For the first time in history people did not have to rely on human or animal muscle  wind or water for power  The steam engine was used to pump water from coal mines  to lift trucks of coal to the surface  to blow air into the furnaces for the making of iron  to grind clay for pottery  and to power new factories of all kinds  For over a hundred years the steam engine was the king of the industries  Iron making   In the Iron industry  coke was finally applied to all stages of iron smelting  replacing charcoal  This had been achieved much earlier for lead and copper as well as for producing pig iron in a blast furnace  but the second stage in the production of bar iron depended on the use of potting and stamping  for which a patent expired in 1786  or puddling  patented by Henry Cort in 1783 and 1784   These represent three  leading sectors   in which there were key innovations  which allowed the economic take off by which the Industrial Revolution is usually defined  This is not to belittle many other inventions  particularly in the textile industry  Without some earlier ones  such as the spinning jenny and flying shuttle in the textile industry and the smelting of pig iron with coke  these achievements might have been impossible  Later inventions such as the power loom and Richard Trevithick s high pressure steam engine were also important in the growing industrialisation of Britain  The application of steam engines to powering cotton mills and ironworks enabled these to be built in places that were most convenient because other resources were available  rather than where there was water to power a watermill  In the textile sector  such mills became the model for the organisation of human labour in factories  epitomised by Cottonopolis  the name given to the vast collection of cotton mills  factories and administration offices based in Manchester  The assembly line system greatly improved efficiency  both in this and other industries  With a series of men trained to do a single task on a product  then having it moved along to the next worker  the number of finished goods also rose significantly  Also important was the 1756 rediscovery of concrete  based on hydraulic lime mortar  by the British engineer John Smeaton  which had been lost for 1300 years  19  Transfer of knowledge A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery  ca  1766  Informal philosophical societies spread scientific advances Knowledge of innovation was spread by several means  Workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached  A common method was for someone to make a study tour  gathering information where he could  During the whole of the Industrial Revolution and for the century before  all European countries and America engaged in study touring  some nations  like Sweden and France  even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy  In other countries  notably Britain and America  this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods  Study tours were common then  as now  as was the keeping of travel diaries  Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods  Another means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies  like the Lunar Society of Birmingham  in which members met to discuss  natural philosophy   i e  science  and often its application to manufacturing  The Lunar Society flourished from 1765 to 1809  and it has been said of them   They were  if you like  the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions  the Industrial Revolution   20  Other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions  For example  the London based Royal Society of Arts published an illustrated volume of new inventions  as well as papers about them in its annual Transactions  There were publications describing technology  Encyclopaedias such as Harris s Lexicon Technicum  1704  and Abraham Rees s Cyclopaedia  1802 1819  contain much of value  Cyclopaedia contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the Industrial Revolution  very well illustrated by fine engravings  Foreign printed sources such as the Descriptions des Arts et M tiers and Diderot s Encyclop die explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates  Periodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century  and many regularly included notice of the latest patents  Foreign periodicals  such as the Annales des Mines  published accounts of travels made by French engineers who observed British methods on study tours  Technological developments in Britain Textile manufacture Main article  Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution Model of the spinning jenny in a museum in Wuppertal  Germany  The spinning jenny was one of the innovations that started the revolution In the early 18th century  British textile manufacture was based on wool which was processed by individual artisans  doing the spinning and weaving on their own premises  This system is called a cottage industry  Flax and cotton were also used for fine materials  but the processing was difficult because of the pre processing needed  and thus goods in these materials made only a small proportion of the output  Use of the spinning wheel and hand loom restricted the production capacity of the industry  but incremental advances increased productivity to the extent that manufactured cotton goods became the dominant British export by the early decades of the 19th century  India was displaced as the premier supplier of cotton goods  Lewis Paul patented the Roller Spinning machine and the flyer and bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness  developed with the help of John Wyatt in Birmingham  Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey  In 1743  a factory was opened in Northampton with fifty spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt s machines  This operated until about 1764  A similar mill was built by Daniel Bourn in Leominster  but this burnt down  Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented carding machines in 1748  Using two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds  it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill  Lewis s invention was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright in his water frame and Samuel Crompton in his spinning mule  Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning  carding  twisting and spinning  and rolling  so that the supply of yarn increased greatly  which fed a weaving industry that was advancing with improvements to shuttles and the loom or  frame   The output of an individual labourer increased dramatically  with the effect that the new machines were seen as a threat to employment  and early innovators were attacked and their inventions destroyed  To capitalise upon these advances  it took a class of entrepreneurs  of which the most famous is Richard Arkwright  He is credited with a list of inventions  but these were actually developed by people such as Thomas Highs and John Kay  Arkwright nurtured the inventors  patented the ideas  financed the initiatives  and protected the machines  He created the cotton mill which brought the production processes together in a factory  and he developed the use of power first horse power and then water power which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry  Before long steam power was applied to drive textile machinery  Metallurgy Coalbrookdale by Night  1801  Philipp Jakob Loutherbourg the Younger Blast furnaces light the iron making town of Coalbrookdale The Reverberatory Furnace could produce wrought iron using mined coal  The burning coal remained separate from the iron ore and so did not contaminate the iron with impurities like sulphur  This opened the way to increased iron production  The major change in the metal industries during the era of the Industrial Revolution was the replacement of organic fuels based on wood with fossil fuel based on coal  Much of this happened somewhat before the Industrial Revolution  based on innovations by Sir Clement Clerke and others from 1678  using coal reverberatory furnaces known as cupolas  These were operated by the flames  which contained carbon monoxide  playing on the ore and reducing the oxide to metal  This has the advantage that impurities  such as sulphur  in the coal do not migrate into the metal  This technology was applied to lead from 1678 and to copper from 1687  It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s  but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace  The foundry cupola is a different  and later  innovation  This was followed by Abraham Darby  who made great strides using coke to fuel his blast furnaces at Coalbrookdale in 1709  However  the coke pig iron he made was used mostly for the production of cast iron goods such as pots and kettles  He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots  cast by his patented process  were thinner and cheaper than theirs  Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce bar iron in forges until the mid 1750s  when his son Abraham Darby II built Horsehay and Ketley furnaces  not far from Coalbrookdale   By then  coke pig iron was cheaper than charcoal pig iron  Since cast iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful  it also became a major structural material following the building of the innovative The Iron Bridge in 1778 by Abraham Darby III  Matthew Boulton helped James Watt to get his business off the ground  he set up a massive factory called the Soho Factory  in the midlands  Bar iron for smiths to forge into consumer goods was still made in finery forges  as it long had been  However  new processes were adopted in the ensuing years  The first is referred to today as potting and stamping  but this was superseded by Henry Cort s puddling process  From 1785  perhaps because the improved version of potting and stamping was about to come out of patent  a great expansion in the output of the British iron industry began  The new processes did not depend on the use of charcoal at all and were therefore not limited by charcoal sources  Up to that time  British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of imported iron to supplement native supplies  This came principally from Sweden from the mid 17th century and later also from Russia from the end of the 1720s  However  from 1785  imports decreased because of the new iron making technology  and Britain became an exporter of bar iron as well as manufactured wrought iron consumer goods  The Iron Bridge  Shropshire  England An improvement was made in the production of steel  which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do  such as for the cutting edge of tools and for springs  Benjamin Huntsman developed his crucible steel technique in the 1740s  The raw material for this was blister steel  made by the cementation process  The supply of cheaper iron and steel aided the development of boilers and steam engines  and eventually railways  Improvements in machine tools allowed better working of iron and steel and further boosted the industrial growth of Britain  Mining Men working their own coal mines  Early 1900s  USA Coal mining in Britain  particularly in South Wales started early  Before the steam engine  pits were often shallow bell pits following a seam of coal along the surface  which were abandoned as the coal was extracted  In other cases  if the geology was favourable  the coal was mined by means of an adit or drift mine driven into the side of a hill  Shaft mining was done in some areas  but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water  It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a sough  a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine   In either case  the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity  The introduction of the steam engine greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper  enabling more coal to be extracted  These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution  but the adoption of James Watt s more efficient steam engine from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines  making mines more profitable  Coal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of firedamp in many coal seams  Some degree of safety was provided by the safety lamp which was invented in 1816 by Sir Humphry Davy and independently by George Stephenson  However  the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light  Firedamp explosions continued  often setting off coal dust explosions  so casualties grew during the entire 19th century  Conditions of work were very poor  with a high casualty rate from rock falls  Steam power Main article  Steam power during the Industrial Revolution The 1698 Savery Engine   the world s first commercially useful steam engine  built by Thomas Savery The development of the stationary steam engine was an essential early element of the Industrial Revolution  however  for most of the period of the Industrial Revolution  the majority of industries still relied on wind and water power as well as horse  and man power for driving small machines  The first real attempt at industrial use of steam power was due to Thomas Savery in 1698  He constructed and patented in London a low lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump  that generated about one horsepower  hp  and was used in numerous water works and tried in a few mines  hence its  brand name   The Miner s Friend   but it was not a success since it was limited in pumping height and prone to boiler explosions  Newcomen s steam powered atmospheric engine was the first practical engine  Subsequent steam engines were to power the Industrial Revolution The first safe and successful steam power plant was introduced by Thomas Newcomen before 1712  Newcomen apparently conceived the Newcomen steam engine quite independently of Savery  but as the latter had taken out a very wide ranging patent  Newcomen and his associates were obliged to come to an arrangement with him  marketing the engine until 1733 under a joint patent  21  22  Newcomen s engine appears to have been based on Papin s experiments carried out 30 years earlier  and employed a piston and cylinder  one end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston  Steam just above atmospheric pressure  all that the boiler could stand  was introduced into the lower half of the cylinder beneath the piston during the gravity induced upstroke  the steam was then condensed by a jet of cold water injected into the steam space to produce a partial vacuum  the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the vacuum on either side of the piston displaced it downwards into the cylinder  raising the opposite end of a rocking beam to which was attached a gang of gravity actuated reciprocating force pumps housed in the mineshaft  The engine s downward power stroke raised the pump  priming it and preparing the pumping stroke  At first the phases were controlled by hand  but within ten years an escapement mechanism had been devised worked by a vertical plug tree suspended from the rocking beam which rendered the engine self acting  A number of Newcomen engines were successfully put to use in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines  with the engine on the surface  these were large machines  requiring a lot of capital to build  and produced about 5 hp  3 7 kW   They were extremely inefficient by modern standards  but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads  opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper  Despite their disadvantages  Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century  By 1729  when Newcomen died  his engines had spread  first  to Hungary in 1722  Germany  Austria  and Sweden  A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired  of which 14 were abroad  In the 1770s  the engineer John Smeaton built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements  A total of 1 454 engines had been built by 1800  23  James Watt A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by James Watt  In close collaboration with Matthew Boulton  he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his steam engine  which incorporated a series of radical improvements  notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder thereby making the low pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere  use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber  All this meant that a more constant temperature could be maintained in the cylinder and that engine efficiency no longer varied according to atmospheric conditions  These improvements increased engine efficiency by a factor of about five  saving 75  on coal costs  Bolton and Watt opened the Soho Foundry  for the manufacture of such engines  in 1795  Nor could the atmospheric engine be easily adapted to drive a rotating wheel  although Wasborough and Pickard did succeed in doing so towards 1780  However by 1783 the more economical Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a double acting rotative type  which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill  Both of Watt s basic engine types were commercially very successful  and by 1800  the firm Boulton  amp  Watt had constructed 496 engines  with 164 driving reciprocating pumps  24 serving blast furnaces  and 308 powering mill machinery  most of the engines generated from 5 to 10 hp  7 5 kW   The development of machine tools  such as the lathe  planing and shaping machines powered by these engines  enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines  Until about 1800  the most common pattern of steam engine was the beam engine  built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine house  but soon various patterns of self contained portative engines  readily removable  but not on wheels  were developed  such as the table engine  Towards the turn of the 19th century  the Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick  and the American  Oliver Evans began to construct higher pressure non condensing steam engines  exhausting against the atmosphere  This allowed an engine and boiler to be combined into a single unit compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail locomotives and steam boats  In the early 19th century after the expiration of Watt s patent  the steam engine underwent many improvements by a host of inventors and engineers  Chemicals The Thames Tunnel  opened 1843  Cement was used in the world s first underwater tunnel The large scale production of chemicals was an important development during the Industrial Revolution  The first of these was the production of sulphuric acid by the lead chamber process invented by the Englishman John Roebuck  James Watt s first partner  in 1746  He was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger  less expensive chambers made of riveted sheets of lead  Instead of making a small amount each time  he was able to make around 100 pounds  50 kg  in each of the chambers  at least a tenfold increase  The production of an alkali on a large scale became an important goal as well  and Nicolas Leblanc succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of sodium carbonate  The Leblanc process was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and hydrochloric acid  The sodium sulphate was heated with limestone  calcium carbonate  and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium sulphide  Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide  The process produced a large amount of pollution  the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air  and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product   Nonetheless  this synthetic soda ash proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants  barilla  or from kelp  which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash  24  and also to potash  potassium carbonate  derived from hardwood ashes  These two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions  replacing many small scale operations with more cost effective and controllable processes  Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass  textile  soap  and paper industries  Early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling  removing rust  iron and steel  and for bleaching cloth  The development of bleaching powder  calcium hypochlorite  by Scottish chemist Charles Tennant in about 1800  based on the discoveries of French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet  revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required  from months to days  for the traditional process then in use  which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk  Tennant s factory at St Rollox  North Glasgow  became the largest chemical plant in the world  In 1824 Joseph Aspdin  a British bricklayer turned builder  patented a chemical process for making portland cement which was an important advance in the building trades  This process involves sintering a mixture of clay and limestone to about 1 400  C  2 552  F   then grinding it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water  sand and gravel to produce concrete  Portland cement was used by the famous English engineer Marc Isambard Brunel several years later when constructing the Thames Tunnel  25  Cement was used on a large scale in the construction of the London sewerage system a generation later  After 1860 the focus on chemical innovation was in dyestuffs  and Germany took world leadership  building a strong chemical industry  26  Aspring chemists flocked to German universities in the 1860 1914 era to learn the latest techniques  British scientists by contrast  lacked research universities and did not train advanced students  instead the practice was to hire German trained chemists  27  Machine tools Main article  Machine tools Sir Joseph Whitworth The Industrial Revolution could not have developed without machine tools  for they enabled manufacturing machines to be made  They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch produce small mechanisms  The mechanical parts of early textile machines were sometimes called  clock work  because of the metal spindles and gears they incorporated  The manufacture of textile machines drew craftsmen from these trades and is the origin of the modern engineering industry  Machines were built by various craftsmen carpenters made wooden framings  and smiths and turners made metal parts  A good example of how machine tools changed manufacturing took place in Birmingham  England  in 1830  The invention of a new machine by Joseph Gillott  William Mitchell disambiguation needed   and James Stephen Perry allowed mass manufacture of robust  cheap steel pen nibs  the process had been laborious and expensive  Because of the difficulty of manipulating metal and the lack of machine tools  the use of metal was kept to a minimum  Wood framing had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity  and the various joints tended to rack  work loose  over time  As the Industrial Revolution progressed  machines with metal frames became more common  but they required machine tools to make them economically  Before the advent of machine tools  metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers  files  scrapers  saws and chisels  Small metal parts were readily made by this means  but for large machine parts  production was very laborious and costly  A lathe from 1911  a machine tool able to shape parts  usually metal for other machines Apart from workshop lathes used by craftsmen  the first large machine tool was the cylinder boring machine used for boring the large diameter cylinders on early steam engines  The planing machine  the slotting machine and the shaping machine were developed in the first decades of the 19th century  Although the milling machine was invented at this time  it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century  Military production  as well  had a hand in the development of machine tools  Henry Maudslay  who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century  was employed at the Royal Arsenal  Woolwich  as a young man where he would have seen the large horse driven wooden machines for cannon boring made and worked by the Verbruggans  He later worked for Joseph Bramah on the production of metal locks  and soon after he began working on his own  He was engaged to build the machinery for making ships  pulley blocks for the Royal Navy in the Portsmouth Block Mills  These were all metal and were the first machines for mass production and making components with a degree of interchangeability  The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools  and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work  such as Richard Roberts  Joseph Clement and Joseph Whitworth  James Fox of Derby had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century  as did Matthew Murray of Leeds  Roberts was a maker of high quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement  Gas lighting Main article  Gas lighting Another major industry of the later Industrial Revolution was gas lighting  Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere  the large scale introduction of this was the work of William Murdoch  an employee of Boulton and Watt  the Birmingham steam engine pioneers  The process consisted of the large scale gasification of coal in furnaces  the purification of the gas  removal of sulphur  ammonia  and heavy hydrocarbons   and its storage and distribution  The first gas lighting utilities were established in London between 1812 20  They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK  Gas lighting had an impact on social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil  Its introduction allowed night life to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before  Glass making Main article  Glass production The Crystal Palace held the Great Exhibition of 1851 A new method of producing glass  known as the cylinder process  was developed in Europe during the early 19th century  In 1832  this process was used by the Chance Brothers to create sheet glass  They became the leading producers of window and plate glass  This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption  thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings  The Crystal Palace is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure   Paper machine Main article  Papermaking A machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by Nicholas Louis Robert who worked for Saint L ger Didot family in France  The paper machine is known as a Fourdrinier after the financiers  brothers Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier  who were stationers in London  Although greatly improved and with many variations  the Fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today  Effects on agriculture The invention of machinery played a big part in driving forward the British Agricultural Revolution  Agricultural improvement began in the centuries before the Industrial revolution got going and it may have played a part in freeing up labour from the land to work in the new industrial mills of the 18th century  As the revolution in industry progressed a succession of machines became available which increased food production with ever fewer labourers  Jethro Tull s seed drill invented in 1701 was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds efficiently across a plot of land  Joseph Foljambe s Rotherham plough of 1730  was the first commercially successful iron plough  28 Andrew Meikle s threshing machine of 1784 was the final straw for many farm labourers  and led to the 1830 agricultural rebellion of the Swing Riots  Transport in Britain Main article  Transport during the British Industrial Revolution At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution  inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads  with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea  Railways or wagon ways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment  but canals had not yet been constructed  Animals supplied all of the motive power on land  with sails providing the motive power on the sea  The Industrial Revolution improved Britain s transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network  a canal and waterway network  and a railway network  Raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before  Improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly  Canals Main article  History of the British canal system Pontcysyllte Aqueduct  Llangollen  Wales Canals began to be built in the late 18th century to link the major manufacturing centres in the Midlands and north with seaports and with London  at that time itself the largest manufacturing centre in the country  Canals were the first technology to allow bulk materials to be easily transported across the country  A single canal horse could pull a load dozens of times larger than a cart at a faster pace  By the 1820s  a national network was in existence  Canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways  They were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on  Britain s canal network  together with its surviving mill buildings  is one of the most enduring features of the early Industrial Revolution to be seen in Britain  Roads Much of the original British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes  but from the 1720s  and occasionally earlier  turnpike trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads  Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent that almost every main road in England and Wales was the responsibility of some turnpike trust  New engineered roads were built by John Metcalf  Thomas Telford and John Macadam  The major turnpikes radiated from London and were the means by which the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest of the country  Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow  broad wheeled  carts hauled by teams of horses  Lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of pack horse  Stage coaches carried the rich  and the less wealthy could pay to ride on carriers carts  Railways Main article  History of rail transport in Great Britain Puffing Billy  an early railway steam locomotive  constructed in 1813 1814 for colliery work  Wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal  These were all horse drawn or relied on gravity  with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline  The first applications of the steam locomotive were on wagon or plate ways  as they were then often called from the cast iron plates used   Horse drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the 19th century  Steam hauled public railways began with the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825 and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830  Construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first Industrial Revolution  After many of the workers had completed the railways  they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities  providing additional workers for the factories  Railways helped Britain s trade enormously  providing a quick and easy way of transport and an easy way to transport mail and news  Social effects Main article  Life in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution In terms of social structure  the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a middle class of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry  Textile mill workers  Spinning machinery  Macon  Georgia  1909 Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories  but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines  As late as the year 1900  most industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10 hour day  12 hours in the steel industry   yet earned from 20 to 40 percent less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life  29  However  harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place  Pre industrial society was very static and often cruel child labour  dirty living conditions  and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution  30  Factories and urbanisation Manchester  England   Cottonopolis    pictured in 1840  showing the mass of factory chimneys Industrialisation led to the creation of the factory  Arguably the first was John Lombe s water powered silk mill at Derby  operational by 1721  However  the rise of the factory came somewhat later when cotton spinning was mechanised  The factory system was largely responsible for the rise of the modern city  as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of employment in the factories  Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of Manchester  nicknamed  Cottonopolis   and arguably the world s first industrial city  For much of the 19th century  production was done in small mills  which were typically water powered and built to serve local needs  Later each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler  The transition to industrialisation was not without difficulty  For example  a group of English workers known as Luddites formed to protest against industrialisation and sometimes sabotaged factories  In other industries the transition to factory production was not so divisive  Some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers  One of the earliest such reformers was Robert Owen  known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the New Lanark mills  and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the early socialist movement  By 1746  an integrated brass mill was working at Warmley near Bristol  Raw material went in at one end  was smelted into brass and was turned into pans  pins  wire  and other goods  Housing was provided for workers on site  Josiah Wedgwood and Matthew Boulton  whose Soho Manufactory was completed in 1766  were other prominent early industrialists  who employed the factory system  Child labour A young  drawer  pulling a coal tub along a mine gallery  31  In Britain laws passed in 1842 and 1844 improved working conditions in mines  The Industrial Revolution led to a population increase  but the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the Industrial Revolution  although infant mortality rates were reduced markedly   32  33  There was still limited opportunity for education  and children were expected to work  Employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable  there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine  and since the industrial system was completely new there were no experienced adult labourers  This made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution between the 18th and 19th centuries  In England and Scotland in 1788  two thirds of the workers in 143 water powered cotton mills were described as children  34  Child labour had existed before the Industrial Revolution  but with the increase in population and education it became more visible  Many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders  35  10 20  of an adult male s wage  36  Children as young as four were employed  36  Beatings and long hours were common  with some child coal miners and hurriers working from 4 am until 5 pm  36  Conditions were dangerous  with some children killed when they dozed off and fell into the path of the carts  while others died from gas explosions  36  Many children developed lung cancer and other diseases and died before the age of 25  36 Workhouses would sell orphans and abandoned children as  pauper apprentices   working without wages for board and lodging  36  Those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their masters  with some masters shackling them to prevent escape  36  Children employed as mule scavenger by cotton mills would crawl under machinery to pick up cotton  working 14 hours a day  six days a week  Some lost hands or limbs  others were crushed under the machines  and some were decapitated  36  Young girls worked at match factories  where phosphorus fumes would cause many to develop phossy jaw  36  Children employed at glassworks were regularly burned and blinded  and those working at potteries were vulnerable to poisonous clay dust  36  Reports were written detailing some of the abuses  particularly in the coal mines 37  and textile factories 38  and these helped to popularise the children s plight  The public outcry  especially among the upper and middle classes  helped stir change in the young workers  welfare  Politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law  but factory owners resisted  some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid starvation  and others simply welcomed the cheap labour  In 1833 and 1844  the first general laws against child labour  the Factory Acts  were passed in England  Children younger than nine were not allowed to work  children were not permitted to work at night  and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours  Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law  however  their scarcity made enforcement difficult  36  About ten years later  the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden  These laws decreased the number of child labourers  however  child labour remained in Europe and the United States up to the 20th century  39  Housing Over London by Rail Gustave Dor  c  1870  Shows the densely populated and polluted environments created in the new industrial cities Living conditions during the Industrial Revolution varied from the splendour of the homes of the owners to the squalor of the lives of the workers  Poor people lived in very small houses in cramped streets  These homes would share toilet facilities  have open sewers and would be at risk of developing pathologies associated with persistent dampness  Disease was spread through a contaminated water supply  Conditions did improve during the 19th century as public health acts were introduced covering things such as sewage  hygiene and making some boundaries upon the construction of homes  Not everybody lived in homes like these  The Industrial Revolution created a larger middle class of professionals such as lawyers and doctors  Health conditions for improved over the course of the 19th century because of better sanitation  the famines that troubled rural areas did not happen in industrial areas  However  urban people especially small children died due to diseases spreading through the cramped living conditions  Tuberculosis  spread in congested dwellings   lung diseases from the mines  cholera from polluted water and typhoid were also common  A description of housing of the mill workers in England in 1844 was given by Friedrich Engels  a co founder of Marxism  40  In the introduction of the 1892 edition of Engels  1844  he notes that most of the conditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved  Luddites Main article  Luddite The Leader of the luddites  engraving of 1812 The Great Chartist Meeting on Kennington Common  1848 The rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs  The movement started first with lace and hosiery workers near Nottingham and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation  Many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited  and unskilled  labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver  Many such unemployed workers  weavers and others  turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery  These attackers became known as Luddites  supposedly followers of Ned Ludd  a folklore figure  The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811  The Luddites rapidly gained popularity  and the British government took drastic measures using the militia or army to protect industry  Those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged  or transported for life  Unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised  such as agricultural labourers in the 1830s  when large parts of southern Britain were affected by the Captain Swing disturbances  Threshing machines were a particular target  and rick burning was a popular activity  However the riots led to the first formation of trade unions  and further pressure for reform  Organisation of labour See also  Trade union History The Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills  factories and mines  thus facilitating the organisation of combinations or trade unions to help advance the interests of working people  The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production  Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production  Skilled workers were hard to replace  and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining  The main method the unions used to effect change was strike action  Many strikes were painful events for both sides  the unions and the management  In England  the Combination Act forbade workers to form any kind of trade union from 1799 until its repeal in 1824  Even after this  unions were still severely restricted  In 1832  the year of the Reform Act which extended the vote in England but did not grant universal suffrage  six men from Tolpuddle in Dorset founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s  They refused to work for less than 10 shillings a week  although by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to six shillings  In 1834 James Frampton  a local landowner  wrote to the Prime Minister  Lord Melbourne  to complain about the union  invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other  which the members of the Friendly Society had done  James Brine  James Hammett  George Loveless  George s brother James Loveless  George s brother in law Thomas Standfield  and Thomas s son John Standfield were arrested  found guilty  and transported to Australia  They became known as the Tolpuddle martyrs  In the 1830s and 1840s the Chartist movement was the first large scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice  Its Charter of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration  Working people also formed friendly societies and co operative societies as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship  Enlightened industrialists  such as Robert Owen also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class  Unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike  In 1842  a General Strike involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the Chartist movement which stopped production across Great Britain  41  Eventually effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who  after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885  began to support socialist political parties that later merged to became the British Labour Party  Standards of living The history of the change of living conditions during the industrial revolution has been very controversial  and was the topic that from the 1950s to the 1980s caused most heated debate among economic and social historians  42  A series of 1950s essays by Henry Phelps Brown and Sheila V  Hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population  that was at the bottom of the social ladder  suffered severe reductions in their living standards  42  Chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including England and France  until the latter part of the 19th century  Until about 1750  in large part due to malnutrition  life expectancy in France was about 35 years  and only slightly higher in England  The U S  population of the time was adequately fed  were much taller and had life expectancies of 45 50 years  43  A vivid description of living standards of the mill workers in England in 1844 was given by Friedrich Engels  40  During the period 1813 1913  there was a significant increase in worker wages  44  45  46  Population increase According to Robert Hughes in The Fatal Shore  the population of England and Wales  which had remained steady at 6 million from 1700 to 1740  rose dramatically after 1740  The population of England had more than doubled from 8 3 million in 1801 to 16 8 million in 1850 and  by 1901  had nearly doubled again to 30 5 million  47  As living conditions and health care improved during the 19th century  citation needed  Britain s population doubled every 50 years  48  49 Europe s population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900  50  Other effects The application of steam power to the industrial processes of printing supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing  which reinforced rising literacy and demands for mass political participation  During the Industrial Revolution  the life expectancy of children increased dramatically  The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74 5  in 1730 1749 to 31 8  in 1810 1829  32  The growth of modern industry from the late 18th century onward led to massive urbanisation and the rise of new great cities  first in Europe and then in other regions  as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas  In 1800  only 3  of the world s population lived in cities  51  a figure that has risen to nearly 50  at the beginning of the 21st century  52  In 1717 Manchester was merely a market town of 10 000 people  but by 1911 it had a population of 2 3 million  53  The greatest killer in the cities was tuberculosis  TB   54  According to the Harvard University Library   By the late 19th century  70 to 90  of the urban populations of Europe and North America were infected with the TB bacillus  and about 80  of those individuals who developed active tuberculosis died of it  About 40  of working class deaths in cities were from tuberculosis   55  Continental Europe The Industrial Revolution on Continental Europe came a little later than in Great Britain  In many industries  this involved the application of technology developed in Britain in new places  Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities  By 1809 part of the Ruhr Valley in Westphalia was called  Miniature England  because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England  The German  Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries  In some cases  such as iron   the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the British technology were adopted  Wallonia  Belgium Lifts on Canal du Centre  1888   1917  near La Louvi re  Wallonia Workers  housing at Bois du Luc  1838 1853  in La Louvi re Renowned for its coal and steel  Wallonia has experienced strong industrial growth since the Middle Ages  For many years  heavy industry was the driving force behind the region s economy  Indeed  Wallonia was the birthplace of the industrial revolution on continental Europe  Before railway construction on the Continent demanded huge quantities of maleable iron mainly for rails  for which low quality iron sufficed  Wallonia was the only Continental region to follow the British model successfully  Since the middle of the 1820s  numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around Li ge and Charleroi  Excelling all others  John Cockerill s factories at Seraing integrated all stages of production  from engineering to the supply of raw materials  as early as 1825  56  Wallonia came to be regarded as an example of the radical evolution of industrial expansion  Thanks to coal  the French word  houille  was coined in Wallonia   57  the region geared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after England  But it is also pointed out by many researchers  with its Sillon industriel   Especially in the Haine  Sambre and Meuse valleys  between the Borinage and Li ge        there was a huge industrial development based on coal mining and iron making      58  Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830   It was not propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after England   59   The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth making town of Ghent   60  Michel De Coster  Professor at the Universit  de Li ge wrote also   The historians and the economists say that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world  in proportion to its population and its territory       But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal mines  the blast furnaces  the iron and zinc factories  the wool industry  the glass industry  the weapons industry    were concentrated   61  Demographic effects Wallonia s Sillon industriel

the west  to Verviers in the east  except part of North Flanders  in another period of the industrial revolution  after 1920   Even if Wallonia is the second industrial country after England  the effect of the industrial revolution there was very different  In  Breaking stereotypes   Muriel Neven and Isabelle Devious say  The industrial revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one  but with a strong contrast between northern and southern Belgium  During the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period  Flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centres       at the beginning of the nineteenth century this region  Flanders   with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent  remained one of the most urbanised in the world  By comparison  this proportion reached only 17 per cent in Wallonia  barely 10 per cent in most West European countries  16 per cent in France and 25 per cent in England  Nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure  except in Ghent       Also  in Wallonia the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process  even though the proportion of city dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and 1910  Especially in the Haine  Sambre and Meuse valleys  between the Borinage and Li ge  where there was a huge industrial development based on coal mining and iron making  urbanisation was fast  During these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5 000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred  concentrating nearly half of the Walloon population in this region  Nevertheless  industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres  but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal mine or a factory  Communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than  for instance  the area around Li ge where the old town was there to direct migratory flows  62  France The industrial revolution in France was a particular process for it did not correspond to the main model followed by other countries  Notably  most French historians argue that France did not go through a clear take off  63  Instead  France s economic growth and industrialisation process was slow and steady along the 18th and 19th centuries  However  some stages were identified by Maurice L vy Leboyer   French Revolution and Napoleonic wars  1789

Germany The BASF chemical factories in Ludwigshafen  Germany  1881 Based on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories  Germany became dominant in the world s chemical industry in the late 19th century  At first the production of dyes based on aniline was critical  64  Germany Germany s political disunity with three dozen states and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s  However  by the 1840s  trunk lines linked the major cities  each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders  Lacking a technological base at first  the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain  but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways  In many cities  the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training  so that by 1850  Germany was self sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction  and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry  Observers found that even as late as 1890  their engineering was inferior to Britain s  However  German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation  nationalisation into state owned companies  and further rapid growth  Unlike the situation in France  the goal was support of industrialisation  and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts  and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen  By 1880  Germany had 9 400 locomotives pulling 43 000 passengers and 30 000 tons of freight  and pulled ahead of France 65  Sweden Main article  Economic history of Sweden During the period 1790 1815 Sweden experienced two parallel economic movements  an agricultural revolution with larger agricultural estates  new crops and farming tools and a commercialisation of farming  and a protoindustrialisation  with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in the summer season and industrial production in the winter season  This led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a consumption revolution starting in the 1820s  In the period 1815 1850 the protoindustries developed into more specialized and larger industries  This period witness increasing regional specialisation with mining in Bergslagen  textile mills in Sjuh radsbygden and forestry in Norrland  Several important institutional changes took place in this period  such as free and mandatory schooling introduced 1842  as first country in the world   the abolishment of a previous national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in 1846  and a stock company law in 1848  During the period 1850 1890 Sweden witnessed a veritable explosion in its export sector  with agricultural crops  wood and steel being the three dominating categories  Sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and joined the gold standard in 1873  During the period 1890 1930 the second industrial revolution took place in Sweden  During this period new industries developed with their focus on the domestic market  mechanical engineering  power utilities  papermaking and textile industries  United States Main article  Technological and industrial history of the United States Slater s Mill The United States originally used horse powered machinery to power its earliest factories  but eventually switched to water power  with the consequence that industrialisation was essentially limited to New England and the rest of the Northeastern United States  where fast moving rivers were located  Horse drawn production proved to be economically challenging and a more difficult alternative to the newer water powered production lines  However  the raw materials  cotton  came from the Southern United States  It was not until after the Civil War in the 1860s that steam powered manufacturing overtook water powered manufacturing  allowing the industry to fully spread across the nation  Thomas Somers and the Cabot Brothers founded the Beverly Cotton Manufactory in 1787  the first cotton mill in America  the largest cotton mill of its era  66  and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills in the future  This cotton mill was designed to utilise horse powered production  however the operators quickly learned that the economic stability of their horse drawn platform was unstable  and had fiscal issues for years after it was built  Despite the losses  the Manufactory served as a playground of innovation  both in turning a large amount of cotton  but also developing the water powered milling structure used in Slater s Mill  67  Bethlehem Steel  founded in 1857  was once the second largest manufacturer of steel in the United States  its Bethlehem  Pennsylvania  location has been transformed into a casino  Samuel Slater  1768 1835  is the founder of the Slater Mill  As a boy apprentice in Derbyshire  England  he learned of the new techniques in the textile industry and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for New York in 1789  hoping to make money with his knowledge  Slater founded Slater s Mill at Pawtucket  Rhode Island  in 1793  He went on to own thirteen textile mills  68 Daniel Day established a wool carding mill in the Blackstone Valley at Uxbridge  Massachusetts in 1809  the third woollen mill established in the U S   The first was in Hartford  Connecticut  and the second at Watertown  Massachusetts   The John H  Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor retraces the history of  America s Hardest Working River   the Blackstone  The Blackstone River and its tributaries  which cover more than 45 miles  72 km  from Worcester to Providence  was the birthplace of America s Industrial Revolution  At its peak over 1100 mills operated in this valley  including Slater s mill  and with it the earliest beginnings of America s Industrial and Technological Development  While on a trip to England in 1810  Newburyport merchant Francis Cabot Lowell was allowed to tour the British textile factories  but not take notes  Realising the War of 1812 had ruined his import business but that a market for domestic finished cloth was emerging in America  he memorised the design of textile machines  and on his return to the United States  he set up the Boston Manufacturing Company  Lowell and his partners built America s second cotton to cloth textile mill at Waltham  Massachusetts  second to the Beverly Cotton Manufactory After his death in 1817  his associates built America s first planned factory town  which they named after him  This enterprise was capitalised in a public stock offering  one of the first uses of it in the United States  Lowell  Massachusetts  utilising 5 6 miles  9 0 km  of canals and ten thousand horsepower delivered by the Merrimack River  is considered by some to be a major contributor to the success of the American Industrial Revolution  The short lived utopia like Lowell System was formed  as a direct response to the poor working conditions in Britain  However  by 1850  especially following the Irish Potato Famine  the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour  The industrialisation of the watch industry started 1854 also in Waltham  Massachusetts  at the Waltham Watch Company  with the development of machine tools  tools  gauges and assembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches  See also  History of Lowell  Massachusetts Japan Main articles  Meiji Restoration and Economic history of Japan The industrial revolution began about 1870 as Meiji period leaders decided to catch up with the West  The government built railroads  improved roads  and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development  It inaugurated a new Western based education system for all young people  sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe  and hired more than 3 000 Westerners to teach modern science  mathematics  technology  and foreign languages in Japan  O yatoi gaikokujin   In 1871 a group of Japanese politicians known as the Iwakura Mission toured Europe and the USA to learn western ways  The result was a deliberate state led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up  The Bank of Japan  founded in 1877  used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories  Education was expanded and Japanese students were sent to study in the west  Modern industry first appeared in textiles  including cotton and especially silk  which was based in home workshops in rural areas  69  Second Industrial Revolution Main article  Second Industrial Revolution Bessemer converter Steel is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass production  which are said to characterise a  Second Industrial Revolution   beginning around 1850  although a method for mass manufacture of steel was not invented until the 1860s  when Sir Henry Bessemer invented a new furnace which could convert wrought iron into steel in large quantities  However  it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality  70  71  This second Industrial Revolution gradually grew to include the chemical industries  petroleum refining and distribution  electrical industries  and  in the 20th century  the automotive industries  and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from Britain to the United States and Germany  The introduction of hydroelectric power generation in the Alps enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal deprived northern Italy  beginning in the 1890s  The increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation  By the 1890s  industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests  as companies like U S  Steel  General Electric  Standard Oil and Bayer AG joined the railroad companies on the world s stock markets  Intellectual paradigms and criticism Capitalism Main article  Capitalism The advent of the Age of Enlightenment provided an intellectual framework which welcomed the practical application of the growing body of scientific knowledge a factor evidenced in the systematic development of the steam engine  guided by scientific analysis  and the development of the political and sociological analyses  culminating in Adam Smith s The Wealth of Nations  One of the main arguments for capitalism  presented for example in the book The Improving State of the World  is that industrialisation increases wealth for all  as evidenced by raised life expectancy  reduced working hours  and no work for children and the elderly  Socialism Main article  Socialism Socialism emerged as a critique of capitalism  Marxism began essentially as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution  72  According to Karl Marx  industrialisation polarised society into the bourgeoisie  those who own the means of production  the factories and the land  and the much larger proletariat  the working class who actually perform the labour necessary to extract something valuable from the means of production   He saw the industrialisation process as the logical dialectical progression of feudal economic modes  necessary for the full development of capitalism  which he saw as in itself a necessary precursor to the development of socialism and eventually communism  Romanticism Main article  Romanticism During the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed  This was known as the Romantic movement  Its major exponents in English included the artist and poet William Blake and poets William Wordsworth  Samuel Taylor Coleridge  John Keats  Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley  The movement stressed the importance of  nature  in art and language  in contrast to  monstrous  machines and factories  the  Dark satanic mills  of Blake s poem  And did those feet in ancient time   Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein reflected concerns that scientific progress might be two edged  Causes Regional GDP per capita changed very little for most of human history before the Industrial Revolution   The empty areas mean no data  not very low levels  There is data for the years 1  1000  1500  1600  1700  1820  1900  and 2003  The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate  with some historians believing the Revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of feudalism in Britain after the English Civil War in the 17th century  As national border controls became more effective  the spread of disease was lessened  thereby preventing the epidemics common in previous times  73  The percentage of children who lived past infancy rose significantly  leading to a larger workforce  The Enclosure movement and the British Agricultural Revolution made food production more efficient and less labour intensive  forcing the surplus population who could no longer find employment in agriculture into cottage industry  for example weaving  and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed factories  74  The colonial expansion of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade  creation of financial markets and accumulation of capital are also cited as factors  as is the scientific revolution of the 17th century  75  Until the 1980s  it was universally believed by academic historians that technological innovation was the heart of the Industrial Revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine  76  However  recent research into the Marketing Era has challenged the traditional  supply oriented interpretation of the Industrial Revolution  77  Lewis Mumford has proposed that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the Early Middle Ages  much earlier than most estimates  78  He explains that the model for standardised mass production was the printing press and that  the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock   He also cites the monastic emphasis on order and time keeping  as well as the fact that medieval cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later  more physical  manifestations such as the steam engine  The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution  particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain  In other nations  such as France  markets were split up by local regions  which often imposed tolls and tariffs on goods traded amongst them  79  Internal tariffs were abolished by Henry VIII of England  they survived in Russia till 1753  1789 in France and 1839 in Spain  Governments  grant of limited monopolies to inventors under a developing patent system  the Statute of Monopolies 1623  is considered an influential factor  The effects of patents  both good and ill  on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine  the key enabling technology  In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as James Watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines  thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development  However monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance  or even overbalance  the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors  80  Watt s monopoly may have prevented other inventors  such as Richard Trevithick  William Murdoch or Jonathan Hornblower  from introducing improved steam engines  thereby retarding the industrial revolution by about 16 years  81  Causes for occurrence in Europe Main article  European miracle A 1623 Dutch East India Company bond  European 17th century colonial expansion  international trade  and creation of financial markets produced a new legal and financial environment  one which supported and enabled 18th century industrial growth  One question of active interest to historians is why the industrial revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century  particularly China  India  and the Middle East  or at other times like in Classical Antiquity 82  or the Middle Ages  83  Numerous factors have been suggested  including education  technological changes 84   see Scientific Revolution in Europe    modern  government   modern  work attitudes  ecology  and culture  85  The Age of Enlightenment not only meant a larger educated population but also more modern views on work  However  most historians contest the assertion that Europe and China were roughly equal because modern estimates of per capita income on Western Europe in the late 18th century are of roughly 1 500 dollars in purchasing power parity  and Britain had a per capita income of nearly 2 000 dollars 86   whereas China  by comparison  had only 450 dollars  Some historians such as David Landes 87  and Max Weber credit the different belief systems in China and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred  The religion and beliefs of Europe were largely products of Judaeo Christianity  and Greek thought  Conversely  Chinese society was founded on men like Confucius  Mencius  Han Feizi  Legalism   Lao Tzu  Taoism   and Buddha  Buddhism   Whereas the Europeans believed that the universe was governed by rational and eternal laws  the East believed that the universe was in constant flux and  for Buddhists and Taoists  not capable of being rationally understood  citation needed  Other factors include the considerable distance of China s coal deposits  though large  from its cities as well as the then unnavigable Yellow River that connects these deposits to the sea  88  Regarding India  the Marxist historian Rajani Palme Dutt said   The capital to finance the Industrial Revolution in India instead went into financing the Industrial Revolution in England   89  In contrast to China  India was split up into many competing kingdoms  with the three major ones being the Marathas  Sikhs and the Mughals  In addition  the economy was highly dependent on two sectors agriculture of subsistence and cotton  and there appears to have been little technical innovation  It is believed that the vast amounts of wealth were largely stored away in palace treasuries by totalitarian monarchs prior to the British take over  Absolutist dynasties in China  India  and the Middle East failed to encourage manufacturing and exports  and expressed little interest in the well being of their subjects  90  Causes for occurrence in Britain As the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged ahead of other economies  After the Industrial Revolution  it was overtaken later by the United States  There were two main values that really drove the industrial revolution in Britain  These values were self interest and an entrepreneurial spirit  Because of these interests  many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth  These advancements also greatly benefitted the British society as a whole  Countries around the world started to recognize the changes and advancements in Britain and use them as an example to begin their own industrial revolutions  91  The debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the massive lead that Great Britain had over other countries  Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment  However  it has been pointed out that slave trade and West Indian plantations provided only 5  of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution  92  Even though slavery accounted for minimal economic profits in Britain during the Industrial Revolution  Caribbean based demand accounted for 12  of England s industrial output  93  Instead  the greater liberalisation of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies  particularly China and Russia  Britain emerged from the Napoleonic Wars as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse  and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size  European merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the Royal Navy 94    Britain s extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods  The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas  reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe  This was further aided by Britain s geographical position an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe  Another theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed  It had a dense population for its small geographical size  Enclosure of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a supply of this labour readily available  There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the North of England  the English Midlands  South Wales and the Scottish Lowlands  Local supplies of coal  iron  lead  copper  tin  limestone and water power  resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry  Also  the damp  mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton  providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry  The stable political situation in Britain from around 1688  and British society s greater receptiveness to change  compared with other European countries  can also be said to be factors favouring the Industrial Revolution  Peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by the Enclosure movement  and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism  95   This point is also made in Hilaire Belloc s The Servile State   Britain s population grew 280  1550 1820  while the rest of Western Europe grew 50 80   70  of European urbanisation happened in Britain 1750 1800  By 1800  only the Netherlands was more urbanised than Britain  This was only possible because coal  coke  imported cotton  brick and slate had replaced wood  charcoal  flax  peat and thatch  The latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not  Yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horse s work was mechanised  A workhorse needs 3 to 5 acres  1 21 to 2 02 ha  for fodder while even early steam engines produced 4 times more mechanical energy  In 1700  5 6 of coal mined worldwide was in Britain  while the Netherlands had none  so despite having Europe s best transport  most urbanised  well paid  literate people and lowest taxes  it failed to industrialise  In the 18th century  it was the only European country whose cities and population shrank  Without coal  Britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by the 1830s  96  Protestant work ethic Main article  Protestant work ethic Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an entrepreneurial class which believed in progress  technology and hard work  97  The existence of this class is often linked to the Protestant work ethic  see Max Weber  and the particular status of the Baptists and the dissenting Protestant sects  such as the Quakers and Presbyterians that had flourished with the English Civil War  Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law  which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the Glorious Revolution of 1688  and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the national debt by the Bank of England  contributed to the capacity for  and interest in  private financial investment in industrial ventures  Dissenters found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices  as well as education at England s only two universities at the time  although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland s four universities   When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official Anglican Church became mandatory due to the Test Act  they thereupon became active in banking  manufacturing and education  The Unitarians  in particular  were very involved in education  by running Dissenting Academies  where  in contrast to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow  much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies  Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important  along with the nature of the national economies involved  While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government  they were considered fellow Protestants  to a limited extent  by many in the middle class  such as traditional financiers or other businessmen  Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital  the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the 17th century  See also Business and economics portal General Capitalism in the nineteenth century
