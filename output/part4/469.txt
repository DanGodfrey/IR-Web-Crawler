legislature of the federal government of the United States  consisting of the House of Representatives of the United States and the Senate  The Congress meets in the United States Capitol in Washington  District of Columbia Both Representatives and Senators are chosen through direct election  There are 535 voting Members of Congress  of which  the House of Representatives has a membership of 435 and the Senate has a membership 100  Members of the House of Representatives serve two year terms representing the people of a district  Congressional Districts are determined by population using the United States Census results and each State in the union having at least one Representative in the Congress  Each state  regardless of population  has two Senators  since there are fifty states  there are one hundred Senators who each serve a six year term  The terms are staggered  so every two years  approximately one third of the Senate is up for election  Most incumbents seek re election  and their historical likelihood of winning subsequent elections exceeds 90   1  Contents 1 Overview 2 History 2 1 The formative era  1780s 1820s  2 2 The partisan era  1830s 1900s  2 3 The

shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives   The House and Senate are equal partners in the legislative process legislation cannot be enacted without the consent of both chambers  However  the Constitution grants each chamber some unique powers  The Senate ratifies treaties and approves presidential appointments while the House initiates revenue raising bills  The House initiates impeachment cases  while the Senate decides impeachment cases  2  A two thirds vote of the Senate is required before an impeached person can be forcibly removed from office  2  In 1868  this committee of representatives prosecuted president Andrew Johnson in his impeachment trial  but the Senate did not convict him  The term Congress can also refer to a particular meeting of the legislature  A Congress covers two years  the current one  the 112th Congress  began on January 3  2011  3  Members of the House of Representatives are often wrongly referred to as a Congressman  Congresswoman  or Congressperson  while Members of the Senate are almost universally referred to as Senator  The official title for a Member of Congress is either  Representative  or  Senator  depending on their respective office  Scholar and representative Lee H  Hamilton asserted that the  historic mission of Congress has been to maintain freedom  and insisted it was a  driving force in American government  4  and a  remarkably resilient institution   5  Congress is the  heart and soul of our democracy   according to this view  6  even though legislators rarely achieve the prestige or name recognition of presidents or Supreme Court justices  one wrote that  legislators remain ghosts in America s historical imagination   6  One analyst argues that it is not a solely reactive institution but has played an active role in shaping government policy and is extraordinarily sensitive to public pressure  6  Several academics described Congress  United States This template is part

professions  and our shadings of opinion on everything from the value of war to the war over values  Congress is the government s most representative body     Congress is essentially charged with reconciling our many points of view on the great public policy issues of the day    Smith  Roberts  and Wielen 4  Congress is constantly changing  constantly in flux  7  In recent times  the American south and west have gained House seats according to demographic changes recorded by the census and includes more minorities and women although both groups are still underrepresented  according to one view  7  While power balances among the different parts of government continue to change  the internal structure of Congress is important to understand along with its interactions with so called intermediary institutions such as political parties  civic associations  interest groups  and the mass media  6  The Congress of the United States serve two distinct purposes that overlap  local representation to the federal government of a Congressional District by Representatives and a State s at large representation to the federal government by Senators   edit  History Main article  History of the United States Congress The First Continental Congress was a gathering of Representatives from twelve of the thirteen British Colonies in North America  8  On July 4  1776  the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence  referring to the new nation as the  United States of America   The Articles of Confederation in 1781 created a unicameral body with equal representation among the states in which each state had a veto over most decisions  With no executive or judiciary  and minimal authority  this government was weak 9  and lacked authority to collect taxes  regulate commerce  or enforce laws  10  11  George Washington presiding over the signing of the United States Constitution  Government powerlessness led to the Convention of 1787 which proposed a revised constitution with a two chamber or bicameral congress  12  Smaller states argued for equal representation for each state  13  The two chamber structure had functioned well in state governments  7  A compromise plan was adopted with representatives chosen by population  benefitting larger states  and exactly two senators chosen by state governments  benefitting smaller states   7  14  The ratified constitution created a federal structure with two overlapping power centers so that each citizen as an individual was subjected to both the power of state government and the national government  15  16  17  To protect against abuse of power  each branch of government executive  legislative  and judicial had a separate sphere of authority and could check other branches according to the principle of the separation of powers  18  Furthermore  there were checks and balances within the legislature since there were two separate chambers  19  The new government became active in 1789  20  21  Political scientist Julian E  Zelizer suggested there were four main congressional eras  with considerable overlap  and included the formative era  1780s 1820s   the partisan era  1830s 1900s   the committee era  1910s 1960s   and the contemporary era  1970s today   22   edit  The formative era  1780s 1820s  Federalists and anti federalists jostled for power in the early years as political parties became pronounced  surprising the Constitution s Framers  Thomas Jefferson s election to the presidency marked a peaceful transition of power between the parties in 1800  John Marshall  4th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court empowered the courts by establishing the principle of judicial review in law in the landmark case Marbury v  Madison in 1803  effectively giving the Supreme Court a power to nullify congressional legislation   edit  The partisan era  1830s 1900s  These years were marked by growth in the power of political parties  The watershed event was the Civil War which resolved the slavery issue and unified the nation under federal authority  but weakened the power of states rights  A Gilded Age  1877 1901  was marked by Republican dominance of Congress  During this time  lobbying activity became more intense  particularly during the administration of President Ulysses S  Grant in which influential lobbies advocated for railroad subsidies and tariffs on wool  23  Immigration and high birth rates swelled the ranks of citizens and the nation grew at a rapid pace  The Progressive Era was characterized by strong party leadership in both houses of Congress as well as calls for reform  sometimes reformers would attack lobbyists as corrupting politics  24  The position of Speaker of the House became extremely powerful under leaders such as Thomas Reed in 1890 and Joseph Gurney Cannon  The Senate was effectively controlled by a half dozen men   edit  The committee era  1910s 1960s  The United States Capitol A system of seniority in which long time Members of Congress gained more and more power encouraged politicians of both parties to serve for long terms  Committee chairmen remained influential in both houses until the reforms of the 1970s  Important structural changes included the direct election of senators by popular election according to the Seventeenth Amendment 14  with positive effects  senators more sensitive to public opinion  and negative effects  undermining the authority of state governments   14 Supreme Court decisions based on the Constitution s commerce clause expanded congressional power to regulate the economy  25  One effect of popular election of senators was to reduce the difference between the House and Senate in terms of their link to the electorate  26  Lame duck reforms according to the Twentieth Amendment ended the power of defeated and retiring members of Congress to wield influence despite their lack of accountability  27  The Great Depression ushered in President Franklin Roosevelt and strong control by Democrats 28  and historic New Deal policies  Roosevelt s election in 1932 marked a shift in government power towards the executive branch  Numerous New Deal initiatives came from the White House rather than being initiated by Congress  29  The Democratic Party controlled both houses of Congress for many years  30  31  32  During this time  Republicans and conservative southern Democrats 33  formed the Conservative Coalition  32  34  Democrats maintained control of Congress during World War II  35  36  Congress struggled with efficiency in the postwar era partly by reducing the number of standing congressional committees  37  Southern Democrats became a powerful force in many influential committees although political power alternated between Republicans and Democrats during these years  More complex issues required greater specialization and expertise  such as space flight and atomic energy policy  37  Senator Joseph McCarthy exploited the fear of communism and conducted televised hearings  38  39  In 1960  Democratic candidate John F  Kennedy narrowly won the presidency and power shifted again to the Democrats who dominated both houses of Congress until 1994   edit  The contemporary era  1970s today  The Senate chose Archibald Cox to serve as special prosecutor investigating Watergate  Congress enacted Johnson s Great Society program to fight poverty and hunger  The Watergate Scandal had a powerful effect of waking up a somewhat dormant Congress which investigated presidential wrongdoing and coverups  the scandal  substantially reshaped  relations between the branches of government  suggested political scientist Bruce J  Schulman  40  Partisanship returned  particularly after 1994  one analyst attributes partisan infighting to slim congressional majorities which discouraged friendly social gatherings in meeting rooms such as the Board of Education  6  Congress began reasserting its authority  29  41 Lobbying became a big factor despite the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act  Political action committees or PACs could make substantive donations to congressional candidates via such means as soft money contributions  42  While soft money funds were not given to specific campaigns for candidates  the monies often benefited candidates substantially in an indirect way and helped reelect candidates  42  Reforms such as the 2002 McCain Feingold act limited campaign donations but did not limit soft money contributions  43  One source suggests post Watergate laws amended in 1974 meant to reduce the  influence of wealthy contributors and end payoffs  instead  legitimized PACs  since they  enabled individuals to band together in support of candidates   44  From 1974 to 1984  PACs grew from 608 to 3 803 and donations leaped from  12 5 million to  120 million 44  45  46  along with concern over PAC influence in Congress  47  48  In 2009  there were 4 600 business  labor and special interest PACs 49  including ones for lawyers  electricians  and real estate brokers  50  From 2007 to 2008  175 members of Congress received  half or more of their campaign cash  from PACs  49  51  52  In the late 20th century  the media became more important in Congress s work   53  Analyst Michael Schudson suggested that greater publicity undermined the power of political parties and caused  more roads to open up in Congress for individual representatives to influence decisions   53  Norman Ornstein suggested that media prominence led to a greater emphasis on the negative and sensational side of Congress  and referred to this as the tabloidization of media coverage  7  Others saw pressure to squeeze a political position into a thirty second soundbite  54   edit  Congress in the United States government  edit  Powers of Congress Main article  Powers of the United States Congress  edit  Overview of congressional power Article I of the Constitution sets forth most of the powers of Congress  which include numerous explicit powers enumerated in Section 8  Constitutional amendments have granted Congress additional powers  Congress also has implied powers derived from the Constitution s Necessary and Proper Clause  Congress has authority over financial and budgetary policy through the enumerated power to lay and collect taxes  duties  imposts and excises  to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States  There is vast authority over budgets  although analyst Eric Patashnik suggested that much of Congress s power to manage the budget has been lost when the welfare state expanded since  entitlements were institutionally detached from Congress s ordinary legislative routine and rhythm   22  Another factor leading to less control over the budget was a Keynesian belief that balanced budgets were unnecessary  22  Congress s power of the purse authorizes taxing citizens  spending money  and printing currency  The Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 extended congressional power of taxation to include income taxes  55  The Constitution also grants Congress the exclusive power to appropriate funds  and this power of the purse is one of Congress s primary checks on the executive branch  55  Congress can borrow money on the credit of the United States  regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states  and coin money  56  Generally  both the Senate and the House of Representatives have equal legislative authority  although only the House may originate revenue and appropriation bills  57  Congress authorizes defense spending such as the purchase of the USS Bon Homme Richard  Congress has an important role in national defense  including the exclusive power to declare war  to raise and maintain the armed forces  and to make rules for the military  58  Some critics charge that the executive branch has usurped Congress s constitutionally defined task of declaring war  59  While historically presidents initiated the process for going to war  they asked for and received formal war declarations from Congress for the War of 1812  the Mexican American War  the Spanish American War  World War I  and World War II  60  although President Theodore Roosevelt s military move into Panama in 1903 did not get Congressional assent  60  In the early days after the North Korean invasion of 1950  President Truman described the American response as a  police action   61  According to Time magazine in 1970   U S  presidents  had  ordered troops into position or action without a formal congressional declaration a total of 149 times   60  In 1993  Michael Kinsley wrote that  Congress s war power has become the most flagrantly disregarded provision in the Constitution   and that the  real erosion  of Congress s war power  began after World War II   62  63  64  Disagreement about the extent of congressional versus presidential power regarding war has been present periodically throughout the nation s history   65  Congress can establish post offices and post roads  issue patents and copyrights  fix standards of weights and measures  establish Courts inferior to the Supreme Court  and  make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers  and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States  or in any department or officer thereof   Article Four gives Congress the power to admit new states into the Union  Congress oversees other government branches  for example  the investigation of President Nixon and Watergate  One of Congress s foremost non legislative functions is the power to investigate and oversee the executive branch  66 Congressional oversight is usually delegated to committees and is facilitated by Congress s subpoena power  67  Some critics have charged that Congress has in some instances failed to do an adequate job of overseeing the other branches of government  In the Plame affair  critics including Representative Henry A  Waxman charged that Congress was not doing an adequate job of oversight in this case  68  There have been concerns about congressional oversight of executive actions such as warrantless wiretapping  although others respond that Congress did investigate the legality of presidential decisions  69  Political scientists Ornstein and Mann suggested that oversight functions do not help members of Congress win reelection  Congress also has the exclusive power of removal  allowing impeachment and removal of the president  federal judges and other federal officers  70  There have been charges that presidents acting under the doctrine of the unitary executive have assumed important legislative and budgetary powers that should belong to Congress  71  So called signing statements are one way in which a president can  tip the balance of power between Congress and the White House a little more in favor of the executive branch   according to one account  72  Past presidents  including Ronald Reagan  George H  W  Bush  Bill Clinton  and George W  Bush 73  have made public statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it  and commentators including the American Bar Association have described this practice as against the spirit of the Constitution  74  75  There have been concerns that presidential authority to cope with financial crises is eclipsing the power of Congress  76  In 2008  George F  Will called the Capitol building a  tomb for the antiquated idea that the legislative branch matters   77   edit  Enumerated powers Main article  Powers of the United States Congress Enumerated powers The Constitution details the powers of Congress in detail  In addition  other congressional powers have been granted  or confirmed  by constitutional amendments  The Thirteenth  1865   Fourteenth  1868   and Fifteenth Amendments  1870  gave Congress authority to enact legislation to enforce rights of African Americans  including voting rights  due process  and equal protection under the law  78  Generally militia forces are controlled by state governments  not Congress  79   edit  Implied powers and the commerce clause Congress also has implied powers deriving from the Constitution s Necessary and Proper Clause which permit Congress to  make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers  and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States  or in any department or officer thereof   80  Broad interpretations of this clause and of the Commerce Clause  the enumerated power to regulate commerce  in rulings such as McCulloch v Maryland  have effectively widened the scope of Congress s legislative authority far beyond that prescribed in Section 8  81  82   edit  Checks and balances Main article  U S  Congress in relation to the president and Supreme Court View of the United States Capitol from the United States Supreme Court building  Representative Lee H  Hamilton explained how Congress functions within the federal government  To me the key to understanding it is balance  The founders went to great lengths to balance institutions against each other balancing powers among the three branches  Congress  the president  and the Supreme Court  between the House of Representatives and the Senate  between the federal government and the states  among states of different sizes and regions with different interests  between the powers of government and the rights of citizens  as spelled out in the Bill of Rights     No one part of government dominates the other  4  The Constitution provides checks and balances among the three branches of the federal government  Its authors expected the greater power to lie with Congress as described in Article One  4  83  The influence of Congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on factors such as congressional leadership  presidential political influence  historical circumstances such as war  and individual initiative by members of Congress  The impeachment of Andrew Johnson made the presidency less powerful than Congress for a considerable period afterwards  4  The 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt  Wilson  FDR  Nixon  Reagan  and George W  Bush  84  However  in recent years  Congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the War Powers Resolution  Nevertheless  the Presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century  4  84  Executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of Congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret  in return  knowing they may be in the dark about executive branch activity  congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies  85  Many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies  and this is a task that Congress is ill suited for  Congress is slow  open  divided  and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or do a good job of overseeing such activity  according to one analysis  86  The impeachment trial of President Clinton in 1999  Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding  The Constitution concentrates removal powers in the Congress by empowering and obligating the House of Representatives to impeach both executive and judicial officials for  Treason  Bribery  or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors   Impeachment is a formal accusation of unlawful activity by a civil officer or government official  The Senate is constitutionally empowered and obligated to try all impeachments  A simple majority in the House is required to impeach an official  however  a two thirds majority in the Senate is required for conviction  A convicted official is automatically removed from office  in addition  the Senate may stipulate that the defendant be banned from holding office in the future  Impeachment proceedings may not inflict more than this  however  a convicted party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law  In the history of the United States  the House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials  of whom seven were convicted  Another resigned before the Senate could complete the trial  Only two presidents have ever been impeached  Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999  Both trials ended in acquittal  in Johnson s case  the Senate fell one vote short of the two thirds majority required for conviction  In 1974  Richard Nixon resigned from office after impeachment proceedings in the House Judiciary Committee indicated he would eventually be removed from office  The Senate has an important check on the executive power by confirming Cabinet officials  judges  and other high officers  by and with the advice and consent  of the Senate  It confirms most presidential nominees but rejections are not uncommon  Furthermore  treaties negotiated by the President must be ratified by a two thirds majority vote in the Senate to take effect  As a result  presidential arm twisting of senators can happen before a key vote  for example  President Obama s secretary of state  Hillary Rodham Clinton  urged her former senate colleagues to approve a nuclear arms treaty with Russia in 2010  87  The House of Representatives has no formal role in either the ratification of treaties or the appointment of federal officials  other than filling vacancies in the office of Vice President  a vote in each House is required to confirm a president s nomination for vice president if a vacancy happens  88  In 1803  the Supreme Court established judicial review of federal legislation in Marbury v  Madison  holding  however  that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself  The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review  however  the notion that courts could declare laws unconstitutional was envisioned by the founding fathers  Alexander Hamilton  for example  mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in Federalist No  78  Originalists on the Supreme Court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should  might or could have said  89  Judicial review means that the Supreme Court can nullify a congressional law  It is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power substantially  In 1857  for example  the Supreme Court struck down provisions of a congressional act of 1820 in its Dred Scott decision  90  At the same time  the Supreme Court can extend congressional power through its constitutional interpretations  Investigations are conducted to gather information on the need for future legislation  to test the effectiveness of laws already passed  and to inquire into the qualifications and performance of members and officials of the other branches  Committees may hold hearings  and  if necessary  compel individuals to testify when investigating issues over which it has the power to legislate by issuing subpoenas  91  92  Witnesses who refuse to testify may be cited for contempt of Congress  and those who testify falsely may be charged with perjury  Most committee hearings are open to the public  the House and Senate intelligence committees are the exception   important hearings are widely reported in the mass media and transcripts published a few months afterwards  92  Congress  in the course of studying possible laws and investigating matters  generates an incredible amount of information in various forms  and can be described as a publisher  93  Indeed  it publishes House and Senate reports 93  and maintains databases which are updated irregularly with publications in a variety of electronic formats  93  Congress also plays a role in presidential elections  Both Houses meet in joint session on the sixth day of January following a presidential election to count the electoral votes  and there are procedures to follow if no candidate wins a majority  94  The main result of congressional activity is the creation of laws  95  It is a huge body of rulings contained in the United States Code arranged by subject matter alphabetically under fifty title headings to present the laws  in a concise and usable form   96   edit  Structure Main article  Structure of the U S  Congress Congress is split into two branches House and Senate and manages the huge task of writing national legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas  Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees  Further  Congress has ancillary organizations such as the Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress to help provide it with information  and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well  In addition  a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests   edit  Committees Main article  United States congressional committee Second committee room in Congress Hall in Philadelphia  edit  Specialization The committee structure permits members of Congress to study a particular subject intensely  It is neither expected nor possible that a member be an expert on all subject areas before Congress  97  As time goes by  members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects  Committees investigate specialized subjects and advise the entire Congress about choices and trade offs  The choice of specialty may be influenced by the member s constituency  important regional issues  prior background and experience  98  Senators often choose a different specialty from that of the other senator from their state to prevent overlap  99  Some committees specialize in running the business of other committees and exert a powerful influence over all legislation  for example  the House Ways and Means Committee has considerable influence over House affairs  100   edit  Power Committees write legislation  While procedures such as the House discharge petition process can introduce bills to the House floor and effectively bypass committee input  they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action  Committees have power and have been called independent fiefdoms  Legislative  oversight  and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and subcommittees which gather information  evaluate alternatives  and identify problems  101  They propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber  101  In addition  they perform the function of oversight by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing  101   edit  Officers At the start of each two year session the House elects a speaker who does not normally preside over debates but serves as its majority leader  In the Senate  the Vice President is the ex officio president of the Senate  In addition  the Senate elects an officer called the President pro tempore  Pro tempore means for the time being and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate s majority party and customarily keeps this position until there s a change in party control  Accordingly  the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore at the beginning of a new Congress   edit  Support services  edit  Library of Congress Main article  Library of Congress The Library of Congress was established by an act of Congress in 1800  It is primarily housed in three buildings on Capitol Hill  but also includes several other sites  the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in Washington  D C   the National Audio Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper  Virginia  a large book storage facility located at Ft  Meade  Maryland  and multiple overseas offices  The Library had mostly law books when it was burned by a British raiding party during the War of 1812  but the library s collections were restored and expanded when Congress authorized the purchase of Thomas Jefferson s private library  One of the Library s missions is to serve the Congress and its staff as well as the American public  It is the largest library in the world with nearly 150 million items including books  films  maps  photographs  music  manuscripts  graphics  and materials in 470 languages  102   edit  Congressional Research Service Main article  Congressional Research Service The Congressional Research Service provides detailed  up to date and non partisan research for senators  representatives  and their staff to help them carry out their official duties  It provides ideas for legislation  helps members analyze a bill  facilitates public hearings  makes reports  consults on matters such as parliamentary procedure  and helps the two chambers resolve disagreements  It has been called the  House s think tank  and has a staff of about 900 employees  103   edit  Congressional Budget Office Main article  Congressional Budget Office The Congressional Budget Office or CBO is a federal agency which provides economic data to Congress  104  It was created as an independent nonpartisan agency by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974  It helps Congress estimate revenue inflows from taxes and helps the budgeting process  It makes projections about such matters as the national debt 105  as well as likely costs of legislation  It prepares an annual Economic and Budget Outlook with a mid year update and writes An Analysis of the President s Budgetary Proposals for the Senate s Appropriations Committee  The Speaker of the House and the Senate s President pro tempore jointly appoint the CBO Director for a four year term   edit  Lobbyists Main article  Lobbying in the United States Lobbyists represent diverse interests and often seek to influence congressional decisions to reflect their clients  needs  Lobby groups and their members sometimes write legislation and whip bills  In 2007 there were approximately 17 000 federal lobbyists in Washington  106  They explain to legislators the goals of their organizations  Some lobbyists represent non profit organizations and work pro bono for issues in which they are personally interested  The term lobby is from Britain based on approaches by interest groups directed at Members of Parliament who would meet in the lobbies of the House of Commons   edit  Partisanship versus bipartisanship Congress has alternated between periods of constructive cooperation and compromise between parties known as bipartisanship and periods of fierce political infighting known as partisanship  The period after the Civil War was marked by partisanship as is the case today  It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible  Some political scientists speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades 107  but that an alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution  108  109   edit  Procedures of Congress Main article  Procedures of the U S  Congress  edit  Sessions A term of Congress is divided into two  sessions   one for each year  Congress has occasionally been called into an extra or special session  A new session commences on January 3 each year unless Congress decides differently  The Constitution requires Congress meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the Capitol   edit  Joint sessions Main article  Joint session of the United States Congress Joint Sessions of the United States Congress occur on special occasions that require a concurrent resolution from both House and Senate  These sessions include counting electoral votes after a presidential election and the president s State of the Union address  The constitutionally mandated report  normally given as an annual speech  is modeled on Britain s Speech from the Throne  was written by most presidents after Jefferson but personally delivered as a spoken oration beginning with Wilson in 1913  Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings are traditionally presided over by the Speaker of the House except when counting presidential electoral votes when the vice president presides   edit  Bills and resolutions The House Financial Services committee meets  Committee members sit in the tiers of raised chairs  while those testifying and audience members sit below  Ideas for legislation can come from members  lobbyists  state legislatures  constituents  legislative counsel  or executive agencies  The usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review  110  A proposal is usually in one of these forms  Bills are laws in the making  A House originated bill begins with the letters  H R   for  House of Representatives   followed by a number kept as it progresses  95  Joint resolutions  There is little difference between a bill and a joint resolution since both are treated similarly  a joint resolution originating from the House  for example  begins  H J Res   followed by its number  95  Concurrent Resolutions affect only both House and Senate and accordingly are not presented to the president for approval later  In the House  it begins with  H Con Res   95  Simple resolutions concern only the House or only the Senate and begin with  H Res   95  Representatives introduce a bill while the House is in session by placing it in the hopper on the Clerk s desk  95  It s assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage  95  Drafting statutes requires  great skill  knowledge  and experience  and sometimes take a year or more  110  Sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction  Joint resolutions are the normal way to propose a constitutional amendment or declare war  On the other hand  concurrent resolutions  passed by both houses  and simple resolutions  passed by only one house  do not have the force of law but express the opinion of Congress or regulate procedure  Bills may be introduced by any member of either house  However  the Constitution provides that   All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives   While the Senate cannot originate revenue and appropriation bills  it has power to amend or reject them  Congress has sought ways to establish appropriate spending levels  111  Each chamber determines its own internal rules of operation unless specified in the Constitution or prescribed by law  In the House  a Rules Committee guides legislation  in the Senate  a Standing Rules committee is in charge  Each branch has its own traditions  for example  the Senate relies heavily on the practice of getting  unanimous consent  for noncontroversial matters  112  House and Senate rules can be complex  sometimes requiring a hundred specific steps before becoming a law  4  Members sometimes use experts such as Walter Oleszek to learn about proper procedures  113  Each bill goes through several stages in each house including consideration by a committee and advice from the Government Accountability Office  114  Most legislation is considered by standing committees which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations  The House has twenty standing committees  the Senate has sixteen  Standing committees meet at least once each month  115  Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must be open to the public unless the committee votes  publicly  to close the meeting  115  A committee might call for public hearings on important bills  116  Each committee is led by a chair who belongs to the majority party and a ranking member of the minority party  Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill  95  Then  a bill may go to what s called a mark up session where committee members debate the bill s merits and may offer amendments or revisions  95  Committees may also amend the bill  but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments  After debate  the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house  If a bill is tabled then it is rejected  If amendments are extensive  sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so called clean bill with a new number  95  Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used  Generally  members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power  117  A bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex 95  and begins with an enacting formula such as  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled   Consideration of a bill requires  itself  a rule which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debate time limits  possibility of further amendments  and such  95  Each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak  95  Sometimes opponents seek to recommit a bill which means to change part of it  95  Generally  discussion requires a quorum  usually half of the total number of representatives  before discussion can begin  although there are exceptions  118  The house may debate and amend the bill  the precise procedures used by the House and Senate differ  A final vote on the bill follows  Once a bill is approved by one house  it is sent to the other which may pass  reject  or amend it  For the bill to become law  both houses must agree to identical versions of the bill  95  If the second house amends the bill  then the differences between the two versions must be reconciled in a conference committee  an ad hoc committee that includes both senators and representatives 95  sometimes by using a reconciliation process to limit budget bills  111  Both Houses use a budget enforcement mechanism informally known as pay as you go or paygo which discourages members from considering acts which increase budget deficits  111  If both houses agree to the version reported by the conference committee  the bill passes  otherwise it fails  The Constitution specifies that a majority of members known as a quorum be present before doing business in each house  However  the rules of each house assume that a quorum is present unless a quorum call demonstrates the contrary  Since representatives and senators who are present rarely demand quorum calls  debate often continues despite the lack of a majority  Voting within Congress can take many forms  including systems using lights and bells and electronic voting  119  Both houses use voice voting to decide most matters in which members shout  aye  or  no  and the presiding officer announces the result  The Constitution  however  requires a recorded vote if demanded by one fifth of the members present  If the voice vote is unclear or if the matter is controversial  a recorded vote usually happens  The Senate uses roll call voting in which a clerk calls out the names of all the senators  each senator stating  aye  or  no  when his or her name is announced  The House reserves roll call votes for the most formal matters  as a roll call of all 435 representatives takes quite some time  normally  members vote by using an electronic device  In the case of a tie  the motion in question fails  In the Senate  the vice president may cast the tiebreaking vote if he or she is present  Most votes  including quorum votes  are done electronically  and allow members to vote yea or nay or present or open  119  Members insert a voting ID card and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose  in addition  paper ballots are used on some occasions yea indicated by green and nay by red  119  One member can not cast a vote for another  119  Congressional votes are recorded on an online database  120  121  After passage by both houses  a bill is considered to be enrolled and is sent to the president for approval  95  The president may sign it making it law or veto it  perhaps returning it to Congress with his objections  A vetoed bill can still become law if each house of Congress votes to override the veto with a two thirds majority  Finally  the president may do nothing neither signing nor vetoing the bill and then the bill becomes law automatically after ten days  not counting Sundays  according to the Constitution  But if Congress is adjourned during this period  presidents may veto legislation passed at the end of a congressional session simply by ignoring it  the maneuver is known as a pocket veto  and cannot be overridden by the adjourned Congress   edit  Congress and the public Main article  U S  Congress and citizens  edit  Challenges of reelection  edit  Citizens and representatives Senators face reelection every six years  and representatives every two  Reelections encourage candidates to focus their publicity efforts at their home states or districts  53  Running for reelection can be a grueling process of distant travel and fund raising which distracts senators and representatives from paying attention to governing  according to some critics  122  122  although others respond that the process is necessary to keep members of Congress in touch with voters  In this example  the more even distribution is on the left and the gerrymandering is on the right  Nevertheless  incumbent members of Congress running for reelection have strong advantages over challengers  42  They raise more money 47  because donors expect incumbents to win  they give their funds to them rather than challengers  45  123  And donations are vital for winning elections  124  One critic compared being elected to Congress to receiving life tenure at a university  123  Another advantage for representatives is the practice of gerrymandering  125  126  After each ten year census  states are allocated representatives based on population  and officials in power can choose how to draw the congressional district boundaries to support candidates from their party  Both senators and representatives enjoy free mailing privileges called franking privileges  As a result  reelection rates of members of Congress hovers around 90 percent  1  causing some critics to accuse them of being a privileged class  7  Academics such as Princeton s Stephen Macedo have proposed solutions to fix gerrymandering   edit  Expensive campaigns In 1971  the cost of running for congress in Utah was  70 000 127  but costs have climbed  128  The biggest expense is television ads  46  123  127  129  130  Today s races cost more than a million dollars for a House seat  and six million or more for a Senate seat  7  46  129  131  132  Since fundraising is vital   members of Congress are forced to spend ever increasing hours raising money for their re election   133  Nevertheless  the Supreme Court has treated campaign contributions as a free speech issue  128  Some see money as a good influence in politics since it  enables candidates to communicate with voters   128  Few members retire from Congress without complaining about how much it costs to campaign for reelection  7  Critics contend that members of Congress are more likely to attend to the needs of heavy campaign contributors than to ordinary citizens  7  Elections are influenced by many variables  Some political scientists speculate there is a coattail effect  when a popular president or party position has the effect of reelecting incumbents who win by  riding on the president s coattails    although there is some evidence that the coattail effect is irregular and possibly declining since the 1950s  42  Some districts are so heavily Democratic or Republican that they are called a safe seat  any candidate winning the primary will almost always be elected  and these candidates do not need to spend money on advertising  134  135  But some races can be competitive when there is no incumbent  If a seat becomes vacant in an open district  then both parties may spend heavily on advertising in these races  in California in 1992  only four of twenty races for House seats were considered highly competitive  136   edit  Television and negative advertising Since members of Congress must advertise heavily on television  this usually involves negative advertising  which smears an opponent s character without focusing on the issues  137  Negative advertising is seen as effective because  the messages tend to stick   138  However  these ads sour the public on the political process in general as most members of Congress seek to avoid blame  139  One wrong decision or one damaging television image can mean defeat at the next election  which leads to a culture of risk avoidance  a need to make policy decisions behind closed doors  139  and concentrating publicity efforts in the members  home districts  53   edit  Public perceptions of Congress The Federalist Papers argued in favor of a strong connection between citizens and their representatives  Prominent Founding Fathers writing in the Federalist Papers felt elections were essential to liberty and that a bond between the people and the representatives was particularly essential 140  and that  frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured   140  In 2009  however  few Americans were familiar with leaders of Congress  141  142  143  The percentage of Americans eligible to vote who did  in fact  vote was 63  in 1960  but has been falling since  although there was a slight upward trend in the 2008 election  144 Public opinion polls asking people if they approve of the job Congress is doing have  in the last few decades  hovered around 25  with some variation  7  145  146  147  148  149  150  Scholar Julian Zeliger suggested that the  size  messiness  virtues  and vices that make Congress so interesting also create enormous barriers to our understanding the institution    Unlike the presidency  Congress is difficult to conceptualize   151  Other scholars suggest that despite the criticism   Congress is a remarkably resilient institution     its place in the political process is not threatened     it is rich in resources  and that most members behave ethically  5  They contend that  Congress is easy to dislike and often difficult to defend  and this perception is exacerbated because many challengers running for Congress run against Congress  which is an  old form of American politics  that further undermines Congress s reputation with the public  7  The rough and tumble world of legislating is not orderly and civil  human frailties too often taint its membership  and legislative outcomes are often frustrating and ineffective     Still  we are not exaggerating when we say that Congress is essential to American democracy  We would not have survived as a nation without a Congress that represented the diverse interests of our society  conducted a public debate on the major issues  found compromises to resolve conflicts peacefully  and limited the power of our executive  military  and judicial institutions     The popularity of Congress ebbs and flows with the public s confidence in government generally     the legislative process is easy to dislike it often generates political posturing and grandstanding  it necessarily involves compromise  and it often leaves broken promises in its trail  Also  members of Congress often appear self serving as they pursue their political careers and represent interests and reflect values that are controversial  Scandals  even when they involve a single member  add to the public s frustration with Congress and have contributed to the institution s low ratings in opinion polls  Smith  Roberts  amp  Wielen 7  An additional factor that confounds public perceptions of Congress is that Congressional issues are becoming more technical and complex and require expertise in subjects such as science and engineering and economics  7  As a result  Congress often cedes authority to experts at the executive branch  7   edit  Smaller states and bigger states When the Constitution was ratified in 1787  the ratio of the populations of large states to small states was roughly twelve to one  The Connecticut Compromise gave every state  large and small  an equal vote in the Senate  152  Since each state has two senators  residents of smaller states have more clout in the Senate than residents of larger states  But since 1787  the population disparity between large and small states has grown  in 2006  for example  California had seventy times the population of Wyoming  153  Critics such as constitutional scholar Sanford Levinson have suggested that the population disparity works against residents of large states and causes a steady redistribution of resources from  large states to small states   154  155  156  However  others argue that the Connecticut compromise was deliberately intended by the Framers to construct the Senate so that each state had equal footing not based on population  152  and contend that the result works well on balance   edit  Members and constituents A major role for members of Congress is providing services to constituents  157  Constituents request assistance with problems  158  Providing services helps members of Congress win votes and elections  125  159  160  and can make a difference in close races  161  Congressional staff can help citizens navigate government bureaucracies  4  One academic described the complex intertwined relation between lawmakers and constituents as home style  162   edit  Congressional style One way to categorize lawmakers  according to political scientist Richard Fenno  is by their general motivation  Reelection  These are lawmakers who  never met a voter they didn t like  and provide excellent constituent services  Good public policy  Legislators who  burnish a reputation for policy expertise and leadership   Power in the chamber  Lawmakers who spend serious time along the  rail of the House floor or in the Senate cloakroom ministering to the needs of their colleagues   162  Famous legislator Henry Clay in the mid 19th century was described as an  issue entrepreneur  who looked for issues to serve his ambitions  162   edit  Privileges and pay  edit  Privileges protecting members Members of Congress enjoy parliamentary privilege  including freedom from arrest in all cases except for treason  felony  and breach of the peace and freedom of speech in debate  This constitutionally derived immunity applies to members during sessions and when traveling to and from sessions  163  The term arrest has been interpreted broadly  and includes any detention or delay in the course of law enforcement  including court summons and subpoenas  The rules of the House strictly guard this privilege  a member may not waive the privilege on his or her own  but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so  Senate rules however are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose  The Constitution guarantees absolute freedom of debate in both houses  providing in the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution that  for any Speech or Debate in either House  they shall not be questioned in any other Place   Accordingly  a member of Congress may not be sued in court for slander because of remarks made in either house  although each house has its own rules restricting offensive speeches  and may punish members who transgress them  Obstructing the work of Congress is a crime under federal law and is known as contempt of Congress  Each branch has the power to cite individuals for contempt but can only issue a contempt citation the judicial system pursues the matter like a normal criminal case  If convicted in court  an individual found guilty of contempt of Congress may be imprisoned for up to one year  The franking privilege allows members of Congress to send official mail to constituents at government expense  Though they are not permitted to send election materials  borderline material is often sent  especially in the run up to an election by those in close races  164  165  Indeed  some academics consider free mailings as giving incumbents a big advantage over challengers  1  166   edit  Pay and benefits From 1789 to 1815  members of Congress received only a daily payment of  6 while in session  Members received an annual salary of  1 500 per year from 1815 to 1817  then a per diem salary of  8 from 1818 to 1855  since then they have received an annual salary  first pegged in 1855 at  3 000  167  168  In 1907  salaries were raised to  7 500 per year  the equivalent of  173 000 in 2010 dollars  168  In 2006  members of Congress received a yearly salary of  165 200  168  Congressional leaders were paid  183 500 per year  The Speaker of the House of Representatives earns  212 100 annually  The salary of the President pro tempore for 2006 was  183 500  equal to that of the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate  169  Privileges include having an office and paid staff  117  In 2008  non officer members of Congress earned  169 300 annually  145  Some critics complain congressional pay is high compared with a median American income of  45 113 for men and  35 102 for women  170  Others have countered that congressional pay is consistent with other branches of government  145  Congress has been criticized for trying to conceal pay raises by slipping them into a large bill at the last minute  171  Others have criticized the wealth of members of Congress  127  130  Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee told Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig that a chief problem with Congress was that members focused on lucrative careers as lobbyists after serving  that Congress was a  Farm League for K Street   instead of on public service  172  173  Members elected since 1984 are covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System  FERS   Like other federal employees  congressional retirement is funded through taxes and participants  contributions  Members of Congress under FERS contribute 1 3  of their salary into the FERS retirement plan and pay 6 2  of their salary in Social Security taxes  And like Federal employees  members contribute one third of the cost of health insurance with the government covering the other two thirds  174  The size of a congressional pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest three years of his or her salary  By law  the starting amount of a member s retirement annuity may not exceed 80  of his or her final salary  In 2006  the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under the Civil Service Retirement System  CSRS  was  60 972  while those who retired under FERS  or in combination with CSRS  was  35 952  175  Members of Congress make fact finding missions to learn about other countries and stay informed  but these outings can cause controversy if the trip is deemed excessive or unconnected with the task of governing  For example  the Wall Street Journal reported lawmaker trips abroad at taxpayer expense  which included spas   300 per night extra unused rooms  and shopping excursions  176  Lawmakers respond that  traveling with spouses compensates for being away from them a lot in Washington  and justify the trips as a way to meet officials in other nations  176   edit  See also Government of the
