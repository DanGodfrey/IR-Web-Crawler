history of Captain America is spans some 70 years of publication  Below is an abridged version of the history of Captain America  For those who are interested in an unabridged version  please see Captain America  Steven Rogers   Earth 616   Unabridged  Early Life Steve Rogers childhood Added by ADour Steve Rogers was born July 4  1920  to poor Irish immigrant parents  Sarah and Joseph Rogers 1   and grew up a frail youth during the Great Depression in America  Rogers  father died when he was a child and his mother died from pneumonia later  when he was in his late teens 2   Becoming America s Super Soldier Horrified by newsreel footage of Nazis ransacking Europe and atrocities in Asia that the Empire of Japan committed in China and Korea  Rogers tried to enlist in the Army  that rejected him as 4 F because of his frailty and sickness  Overhearing the boy s earnest plea to fight for his country  General Chester Phillips  of the US Army  offered Rogers the opportunity to take part in a top secret performance enhancing experiment called Operation Rebirth  Rogers agreed and was taken to a secret laboratory in Washington  D C   where he was introduced to Doctor Abraham Erskine  code named Professor Joseph Reinstein   the creator of the Super Soldier Serum 3   Captain America   Transformation Added by Kalen Rann After weeks of tests  Rogers was at last administered the Super Soldier Serum  Given part of the compound intravenously and another part orally  Rogers was then bombarded by vita rays  a special combination of exotic  in 1941  wavelengths of radiation designed to accelerate and stabilize the serum s effect on his body  Steve Rogers emerged from the vita ray chamber with a body perfect human body  A Nazi spy  who observed the experiment  murdered Dr  Erskine mere minutes after its conclusion  Dr  Erskine died without fully committing the Super Soldier formula to paper  leaving Rogers the sole beneficiary of his genius  Rogers was then put through an intensive physical and tactical training program  that taught him gymnastics  hand to hand combat from Colonel Rex Applegate and William Essart Fairbairn  and military strategy  Three months later  he was given his first assignment  to stop the Nazi agent called the Red Skull  To help him become a symbolic counterpart to the Red Skull  Rogers was given the red  white  and blue costume of Captain America  4  Rogers was also given the cover identity of a clumsy infantry private at Camp Lehigh  Rogers in his original World War II uniform with gun holster Added by Cap fan020 After successfully becoming Captain America  Rogers was later submitted to an experimental mind conditioning program that conditioned his mind to accept false information in the chance he was captured by the enemy and forced to reveal classified information  As part of the conditioning  Rogers believed his real name to be Grant Rogers  that he had a brother  and that due to his parents being diplomats  he had a casual upper class appointment to the Army and Captain America position  It would not be until far later in life that Rogers would recall the conditioning and his true history 5   Rogers was originally issued a traditionally shaped  kite  shield made of mundane steel  as well as a sidearm  Cap s original helmet served as a mask and was separate from the rest of his costume  This proved a problem as in one early outing it was nearly knocked from his face via the hard wing emblems  almost revealing his identity to an attending newspaper reporter with camera 2   Adding a protective neck plating hood to his costume  rather than his separate mask  solved this problem and afforded Rogers more protection  President F D  Roosevelt later presented Rogers with his now legendary disc shaped shield  Discovering that its excellent aerodynamic properties made it an effective offensive weapon  Rogers abandoned his sidearm  World War II Service Main article  World War II Captain America and the Invaders Added by Moshikal15 During the war   Cap  served as both a symbol of freedom and America s most effective special operative  In addition to working with his young sidekick Bucky  Cap regularly fought alongside other Allied super powered heroes such as Namor the Sub Mariner and the android Human Torch  who were the recognized core of the World War II super team known as the Invaders  Rogers sometimes came into contact with a Canadian paratrooper named Jim Howlett   the man who would come to be known as Wolverine   During the war  Rogers faced fascist Germans and imperialist Japanese  Among his foes and adventures were battles with George Maxon  who was an impostor Red Skull  the Manuel Perez White Death  the Legion of Unholy Beggars  the Dragon of Death  the Reaper  the Black Toad  the Black Talon  the Mikado  Stryker  Doctor Crime  Mock Mikado  Master Man and the Super Axis  Togaro  Prophet of Hate  Agent Axis  the Shark  the Hyena  N2 and Mister Sinister  Dr  Togu  Doctor Destiny  Snapper  Jack The Ripper and Terdu  Dormammu  HYDRA  the Hand  the Grandmaster  the Ringmaster  Baron Zemo  Colonel Von Wagner  Fang  who later died in Hiroshima and thus became one with the Everwraith   and the Butterfly  he also prevented the murder of President F D  Roosevelt by a group called the Defenders  the Battle of the Bulge  D Day  stopping saboteurs  early March 1941   meeting Wakandans  saving President Roosevelt from a deranged Namor  meeting Nikola Tesla  saving a Manhattan Project scientist from Red Skull with the help of the Howling Commandos  stopping  with Howling Commando support  the Red Skull s plot to deploy a centuries old automaton designed by a time traveling Doctor Doom  facing the Red Skull in a hover device  scuffling with fellow Allies the Crusaders  fighting alongside the French Resistance and Peggy Carter  an American who had fallen in love with Captain America   almost accidentally slaying a war orphan  saving Michael Kramer from the Red Skull  In April 1945  Rogers stormed the Red Skull s bunker  with Red Guardian  Patriot  and Spirit of  76  in his last WWII battle with Red Skull  For a time  World War II Bucky fought alongside a time displaced modern era Captain America until the Avengers recovered their colleague to the present day  Suspended Animation During the final days of the war  on or before April 18  1945 6   Captain America and Bucky were trying to stop a bomb loaded drone plane  launched by Baron Zemo  when the plane exploded  apparently killing his partner Bucky and throwing Rogers into icy Arctic waters of the English Channel  The Super Soldier Formula prevented crystallization of Rogers  bodily fluid  allowing him to enter a state of suspended animation  Although Rogers and Bucky had seemingly perished  the war still raged on and U S  presidents and the government picked different volunteers  such as William Naslund  Jeffrey Mace  and another Steve Rogers  over the years  to keep the morale alive  and even after World War II ended  Avengers Avengers Assemble Added by Moshikal15 Decades later  Rogers  wartime comrade  the Sub Mariner  stumbled across his still frozen form  which was being worshiped by a far flung Inuit tribe  Enraged  the Sub Mariner threw the ice block into the ocean  While opposing Namor  the newly formed Avengers happened upon Rogers  thawing body and soon revived the legendary hero 7   Rogers joined their ranks as the first recruit  since their formation  and was given retroactive  founding member  status in place of Hulk  With his superhuman abilities  extensive training  combat experience  combined with his impressive physique  confidence  and will  Rogers was an excellent addition to the team  As a born leader  Rogers would come to be seen as the heart and soul of the team and his commands  while in the field  were often looked to  regardless of who might have been chairman at the time  Rogers would teach teamwork  tactics  and hand to hand combat to many Avengers over the coming years  Seeing that Avengers associate Rick Jones bore a resemblance to Bucky 7   Cap took him into tutelage 8   trying to recover from the great trauma of losing his wartime partner  After a time  Jones even convinced Rogers to let him wear Bucky s old costume and initiate a partnership  although Cap strongly opposed Rick joining the Avengers as a full member 9   The early adventures Cap had with Earth s Mightiest Heroes included a run in with his wartime foe Baron Heinrich Zemo  Zemo organized the first incarnation of the Masters of Evil  a group of super villains who each bore a grudge against a particular Avenger 10   After several skirmishes between the two groups 11  12  9   Zemo kidnapped Rick and Zemo was accidentally killed in a rockslide  caused by his own weaponry as he battled Cap 13   Following another battle with Kang the Conqueror  the remaining founding Avengers  Iron Man  Thor  Giant Man and the Wasp  decided to take a leave of absence from the stress of super crime fighting  Captain America was thus left to lead a new team comprised of Hawkeye  the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver  14   Cap s Kooky Quartet  was at first regarded as less able than the previous lineup  but soon proved their worth by overcoming several threats including a resurgent Kang 15  as well as Doctor Doom 16   While the hotheaded Quicksilver and Hawkeye were at first headstrong loose cannons  Rogers  leadership was able to mold them into valuable team members   Once more into the breach     Added by Copycat989 When Cap took his first leave of absence from the team  it was the Black Panther who stepped in to take his place on the roster  Though when Cap discovered that one of T Challa s motives was to  spy  on the Avengers  as part of his duties as King of Wakanda was to observe foreigners   relations between the two became strained and stayed that way for some time  Eventually  they restored the bonds of alliance and friendship  symbolized by Rogers giving T Challa the enhanced copy of his World War II triangular shield he had used while his round one was broken  17  Meanwhile  Cap s old nemesis  the Red Skull  was brought out of suspended animation by the subversive organization THEM  The Skull feigned cooperation with THEM  actually the ruling council of HYDRA led by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker  long enough to steal the Cosmic Cube from subsidiary organization AIM  This led to the first postwar clash between the two great symbols of World War II  The Skull later impersonated Rogers and drove Rick away  while wielding the Cosmic Cube  Rogers often crossed paths with another World War II veteran as well  this one an ally  Sergeant Nick Fury  of the Howling Commandos  was now Colonel Nick Fury  Director of S H I E L D   Captain America teamed with Fury many times after emerging from suspended animation and their relationship warmed and cooled over the years  depending on various circumstances  They often worked together towards the same goal s  and the Avengers and S H I E L D  maintained a close working relationship  even sometimes sharing a common computer database  Rogers worked with S H I E L D  s Agent 13  Sharon Carter   sister to Peggy  Rogers would come to share a deep romantic relationship with Sharon  eventually admitting his love for her  18  In another plot by the Skull  a Cosmic Cube empowered man named Sam Wilson attacked Rogers  Steve was able to break Wilson of the Skull s control and the two teamed together to defeat Cap s archenemy  Wilson became The Falcon and Steve s most reliable best friend  Cap and the Falcon would share an active partnership for a long time 19   Wilson actively succeeded Rogers as Captain America  when Rogers was badly injured and was encouraged to continue on in the role by Rogers himself  Despite the encouragement  Wilson returned the role upon Rogers  recovery  One of Rogers  and Wilson s most noted battles was against one of Rogers  earlier successors  Steve Rogers  and Jack Monroe  calling himself Bucky  Rogers was shaken at the fact that he could have shared his excessively conservative successor s fate  if not for the technical dedication of Dr  Erskine and his Vita Ray process  20  Nomad Captain America becomes Nomad Added by IronMonger2001 While investigating the subversive organization known as the Secret Empire Rogers discovered that its leader was a high ranking government official  While this traitor committed suicide after being discovered  the government covered up the whole affair by using a double  Disillusioned  Rogers abandoned his Captain America identity and took up the alias  Nomad   21  Two men tried in vain to assume the Captain America title  Bob Russo and  Scar  Turpin  while in the meantime the young idealistic Cap fan  Roscoe Simons  actually succeeded Rogers and Rogers himself awarded Simons his indestructible shield  It was Roscoe s death  at the hands of the Red Skull  that would inspire Rogers to become the  Sentinel of Liberty   a symbol of American inspired ideals rather than the US Government Super Soldier he once was  In a graphic bit of scenery  Roscoe was crucified and tortured by the Red Skull  as a message to Rogers that any other person in the costume would also suffer the same fate  if the Red Skull encountered any of the  fake  Captain Americas  Rogers re assumed his classic costumed identity and shield 22  and a rehabilitated Monroe joined Cap in a partnership  himself assuming the Nomad identity in a modified costume  23  Following a battle with Viper  Rogers  Super Soldier Serum reacted with the venom in her whip  temporarily granting him superhuman strength  24  Secret Wars After the Avengers journeyed to New York s Central Park to investigate an enormous circular construct which had materialized in the park s Sheep Meadow  they were joined by the Hulk  Spider Man  the X Men  and Fantastic Four  Upon entering the construct  the adventurers  as well as the construct itself  were teleported to an area of spacetime near a galaxy far from the vicinity of Earth s  Similarly  a large number of costumed criminals  including the Absorbing Man  Doctor Doom  Doctor Octopus  the Enchantress  Kang  the Lizard  the Molecule Man  Ultron  the Wrecker and the Wrecking Crew  as well as the planet devourer Galactus  found themselves in another construct within this same area of spacetime  Aboard the constructs the passengers watched in awe as an unseen force annihilated the galaxy nearest to them  A single star survived  Then  before their eyes  a planet  which became known as Battleworld  was created to orbit that star  Finally  a rift opened in spacetime  from which poured a blinding light  and the passengers within the constructs heard a voice telling them   I am from beyond  Stay your enemies and all you desire shall be yours  Nothing you dream of is impossible for me to accomplish   The passengers were then sent to Battleworld  There  over the next several days  they engaged in a  secret war  amongst themselves  most of the criminals sought to destroy the heroic adventurers in order to gain the prize that the Beyonder had promised  Captain America s sterling leadership abilities were showcased  when he was nominated leader of the heroes  Clashing with Doctor Doom s forces repeatedly  Cap was faced with leadership challenges ranging from dealing with the outcast X Men  keeping the Hulk from attacking Doom s forces by himself  after She Hulk s defeat  and The Wasp s apparent death  Cap also was burdened with keeping morale up in the face of battling Galactus  Rogers  leadership qualities would be deferred to time and time again during large gatherings of heroes  such as when Adam Warlock sent a band of heroes to oppose the Infinity Gauntlet wielding Thanos and also when he assumed joint command of the Avengers and the Justice League of America  When Avengers Mansion was attacked and conquered by the Masters of Evil  under the leadership of Baron Helmut Zemo  Captain America was specifically targeted by Zemo  to avenge his father s death  Rogers was captured  during an attempt to retake the mansion and was forced to watch  as Mister Hyde tortured helpless butler Edwin Jarvis  The Masters proceeded to destroy a treasure trove of Rogers  memorabilia  including a picture with Bucky taken just before he was killed  Rogers  only picture of his mother  a baseball signed by Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig  and Cap s original triangular shield  In the final battle  Cap defeated The Wrecker  with the aid of the Wasp  and defeated Baron Zemo in a rooftop duel  As Zemo fell  Cap tried to grab his hand and  though he was later revealed to have survived the fall  Zemo refused such charity 25   The Captain Captain America becomes The Captain Added by Peter Wildenbeest Captain America continued to come into conflict with many foes  including the extreme anti nationalist Flag Smasher and the vigilante called The Scourge of the Underworld  Rogers was informed by the Commission on Superhuman Activities that he had never been officially discharged from the U S  Army  and for this  he received a large back pay  dating to the end of World War II  which he used to establish a nation wide hot line service to help him keep abreast of criminal activities  However  the Commission demanded that Rogers  as an  active  member of the armed forces  resume service as a government directed operative  Finding himself unable to merely follow orders as a simple soldier any longer  especially after the events of the government that led to him becoming Nomad  Rogers again resigned the Captain America identity  even surrendering his legendary shield to the new Captain America  John Walker  who had previously clashed with Rogers as the  Super Patriot   26  During this time  Rogers used an Adamantium shield and  adopting a new costume  continued adventuring as  The Captain  27   Not long afterward  the Avengers were temporarily disbanded  due to a lack of active members  As The Captain  Rogers led a new lineup of the Avengers consisting of Thor  Gilgamesh  and temporary recruits Reed  Mr  Fantastic  and Sue Richards  Invisible Woman  of the Fantastic Four  Reed himself was accustomed to leading  however  and there were some conflicts of leadership between the two  The Captain also led an unnamed  unofficial team during the same period that accompanied him on several missions  Along with The Falcon and Nomad  the group at times included Demolition Man  who had assisted Rogers against Power Broker  Inc   and Vagabond  a tag along of Nomad s  It would later be discovered that the Red Skull was manipulating the Commission  The Captain and Nomad clashed with Walker and his Bucky  Resolving their differences  Rogers and Walker confronted the Skull 28   Following the events and deeds that Walker had done while Captain America  Walker resigned from being Captain America and the Commission asked Rogers to take up the mantle again  Rogers initially refused  but after Walker begged him  accepted  Later  Walker was apparently killed  but later reappeared in a new identity  after plastic surgery in the new name of  Jack Daniels  wearing Rogers   The Captain  uniform and shield as the rechristened  USAgent  29   Continued Career Steve Rogers  Captain America Added by Peteparker At one point  Cap avoided the explosion of a meth lab only to have the chemical effects of the blast react dangerously with his Super Soldier Serum  To remove the problem  Rogers removed the serum and trained constantly to keep in peak condition  Cap discovered that the serum was not a drug per se  which would have metabolized out of his system  but in fact a virus that effected a biochemical and genetic change  This additionally explained how arch nemesis  Red Skull  who at the time inhabited a body cloned from Rogers  cells  also had the formula in his body  Because of his altered biochemistry  Rogers  body began to deteriorate and  for a time he  wore a powered exoskeleton designed by Iron Man and Dr  Hank Pym  but was eventually placed again in suspended animation  During this time  Rogers was given a blood transfusion from the Red Skull  which cured his condition and stabilized the Super Soldier virus in his system  Captain America returned both to crime fighting and the Avengers  Captain America was reunited with his WWII era flame  the now aged American Maquis fighter Peggy Carter  Freeing her and others from the grip of the criminal Doctor Faustus  Rogers had her hired on as communications expert at Avengers Mansion as part of the expanded domestic staff called the Avengers Ground Crew  Their romantic feelings diminished  but the two remained good friends  Another person taken on by Steve during this time was John Jameson  who acted as his pilot  When the Avengers learned of the Kree Shi ar War and the danger the war efforts posed to Earth s sun  Rogers proposed to send diplomatic envoys to each superpower in an attempt to avert catastrophe known as Operation Galactic Storm  Captain America led the team bound for the Kree Empire  He had several conflicts of leadership with Iron Man  which culminated when the latter  against orders  led a team of Avengers to execute the Kree Supreme Intelligence for war crimes  His confidence in his leadership shaken  Cap offered to resign as chief executive and commanding officer of the two Avengers branches  but this was not the route the other Avengers wanted to take  Cap s old friend Hawkeye helped reinforce Cap s leadership confidence  as did the rescue by USAgent  John Walker and the Falcon of Demolition Man from ULTIMATUM  Flag Smasher s terrorist organization  After returning to Earth  Cap rescued Diamondback  Rachel Leighton  from Red Skull s henchman Crossbones  Diamondback had previously  as a member of the Serpent Society  had a chance to kill Rogers in battle that she did not take  This was because she was smitten with him  the two began an on and off semi romantic partnership afterwards  Cap was part of the force raised to battle the psychic entity called Onslaught  and was one of the Avengers who seemingly gave their lives to absorb Onslaught s energy  In reality  they  the senior Avengers and the Fantastic Four  had been shunted to an alternate dimension created by Franklin Richards  After several months in this world  the heroes realized it was a construct and escaped  During a rebuilding period with the Avengers  Captain America and the rest of the team  past and present  were duped by Morgan Le Fay into acting as her elite guard  the Queen s Vengeance  Rogers  alias in this alter ego was  Yeoman America   He was the first Avenger to break out of Morgan s trance  and formed a resistance group that foiled the ancient sorceress  plans  Captain America  both in his solo career and as an Avenger  went on to participate in a variety of other missions  Avengers Disassembled On a day that would become the darkest in Avengers history  the Scarlet Witch suffered a breakdown that  combined with her powers  had catastrophic consequences  Cap had recently had a strange encounter with Wanda  as well as the beginnings of romance  and was struck hard by the devastation of the team  which disbanded shortly thereafter  In future events  Rogers moved into the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn  revealed his identity to the world  although he lived in a SHIELD safe house   and resumed his off and on relationship with Sharon Carter  Cap was among those heroes present at the Raft when Electro instigated a jailbreak  The next day  he spoke with Tony Stark  and convinced him to help form the New Avengers  Most of those present during the jailbreak were founding members of the team  The new SHIELD Director  Maria Hill  was opposed to their incorporation  but Rogers reminded her that he had Full Champion License that is  he was authorized by SHIELD to assemble any team he deemed necessary for any mission he deemed necessary  and therefore did not need her permission  The New Avengers embarked on several missions under his leadership  Winter Soldier and Civil War Meanwhile  Cap had also been dealing with more personal matters  Having been made a special SHIELD operative  Rogers  Sharon Carter  and Nick Fury began an investigation into Aleksander Lukin and his powerful Kronas Corporation  After the apparent assassination of the Red Skull  Lukin was in possession of the Cosmic Cube  but he also had a more personal weapon  the Winter Soldier  a revived Bucky Barnes   A KGB assassin who had been occasionally let out of suspended animation to perform only the most difficult missions  the Winter Soldier encountered Sharon Carter  who believed that he was the real Bucky  Cap at first refused to believe it  but Fury presented him with solid evidence  Winter Soldier killed Jack Monroe and caused major devastation in Philadelphia before Cap  the Falcon  and Agent Carter stormed a hidden underground base operated by Lukin  Cap and Winter Soldier dueled  and the latter showed no sign of memory  Cap used the Cosmic Cube to restore his memory  Bucky then used it himself to teleport to Camp Lehigh  where he began to cope with his past  Months later  Cap and Sharon tracked Bucky to a small mid western town that was actually controlled by AIM  Distracted by storming the AIM compound and battling Crossbones and Sin  Synthia Schmidt   they were unable to catch up with him  When SHIELD suggested the Superhuman Registration Act  Special Agent Hill ordered Rogers and the Avengers to help enforce it  When he refused  Hill had her trained  Superhuman Response Unit  attacked him  During the scuffle Rogers avoided being tranquillized and managed to escape by lodging his shield in an aircraft and forcing the pilot to fly him to safety  Soon after  at the Baxter Building  the Watcher told the heroes who had gathered there about Cap s escape  He became the leader of the resistance to the registration act  fearing that the freedom of America s heroes and the safety of their families were in danger  Adopting the alias  Brett Hendrick   a mall security guard to avoid government detection  Rogers became more and more extreme in his desire to win the Civil War  He allowed the The Punisher to join his  Secret Avengers   and worked  albeit reluctantly  with the Kingpin  Since his old friend Iron Man was leading the Pro Registration Superhero Unit  their rivalry was especially bitter  The two attempted to meet twice during the conflict  but each time it devolved into combat  They even refused to attend the wedding of Black Panther and Storm together  Cap was nearly captured by Paladin but escaped with the aid of Shang Chi and the Heroes for Hire  In the final battle against the Pro Registration forces  Rogers  teammate the Vision disabled Iron Man s armor  evening the odds for Cap and allowing him to take down Stark in Times Square  However  a crowd of civilians approached in support of Stark  Realizing that his fight against the registration act was endangering the people that he was trying to protect  he surrendered to Iron Man  He then gave his followers the order to stand down  Death of a Hero The death of Captain America  Art by Steve Epting  from Captain America  25 Added by Copycat989 Following his surrender  Steve Rogers was indicted on several criminal charges  It was noted SHIELD had restrained Steve with strength dampeners  while he was in custody  A successful assassination was orchestrated by the resurgent Red Skull which involved Crossbones deployed as a sniper  He fired the first shot  hitting Captain America in the back as he entered a federal courthouse to stand trial for his criminal charges  In addition  Doctor Faustus  posing as a SHIELD psychiatrist  had manipulated Sharon Carter and implanted in her mind a hypnotic suggestion that caused her to shoot Rogers  three times in the stomach and chest in the chaos that ensued  Rogers was taken to a hospital  where he succumbed to his wounds  Captain America was given a state funeral  but the body in his memorial at Arlington was a fake  Immediately after his death  Rogers  body was taken to SHIELD Headquarters as the only perfect super soldier specimen in the world  Unexplainably  his body was discovered to have withered back to its original frail state  Tony Stark  accompanied by Hank Pym  and Janet Van Dyne  returned Steve Rogers  body to the Arctic where they had found him frozen in ice  Namor also attended the small private ceremony swearing that as long as he ruled the seas  no one would disturb Captain America s rest 30   Many people mourned him including various heroes that knew him  Others such as reformed Winter Soldier James Buchanan Barnes and Wolverine swore to avenge his death  Before the day of his assassination  Rogers prepared a package to be delivered to Stark in the event that he would not survive  It contained a photo of himself as Captain America and Bucky in World War II  and his final requests  that Stark  save  Bucky  and that the mantle of Captain America should continue  A SHIELD agent presented it to Stark confirming that it was delivered by an unknown attorney  Thor communicated with Steve Rogers  spirit on the first anniversary of his death  Though Thor vowed to avenge him in full  Rogers declined  saying that their world was already too stained with the taint of death and violence  Thor granted Steve a minute of silence  by using his powers to cut off all the electronic media in America for exactly sixty seconds 31   Rebirth It was later discovered that  while his body was killed  Rogers  essence was  locked into a fixed point in space and time   Rogers  mind was being transported through time  forcing him to relive certain segments of his life such as World War II and becoming Captain America as well in various other scenes  Some changes were revealed to what was previously known  See notes below   While reliving the Kree Skrull War  he was able to ask the Vision to record a message about his time travel condition to Mister Fantastic and Wasp in the future  which was duly relayed by the current Vision 32   With this data  Richards concluded that Sharon was the key to bringing Steve out of time  although they were too late to stop Doctor Doom and Arnim Zola from doing just that  however the Red Skull was now in control of Steve s body 33   Barnes and Rogers fought to drive the Red Skull from his body and succeeded in doing so  Rogers considered retirement from the role and allowed Barnes to continue operating as Captain America  thinking that there should not be two formal active Captain Americas  Rogers visited the current US President who gave  Captain America   not Steve Rogers specifically  a full pardon for his actions during the Civil War  Rogers explained that he didn t intend to resume wielding the shield  but would if asked  The President mentioned that this was fine  as he had another idea for Steve s services in the future  Siege Main article  Siege  Event  With his own house in order  Rogers set about the next great task  removing Norman Osborn  current head of American national security agency H A M M E R   from power  Rogers soon came to assist in bringing back Tony Stark  who was in a vegetative state  having diminished his intelligence to erase the Superhuman Registration database to keep Osborn from abusing it  To do so  Rogers and his associates resorted to a quite radical step in rebooting Stark s brain  channeling Thor s thunder through Rogers  shield connected to the implant on Stark s chest  a move which could very well have killed him  The process restarted Tony s heart  but for some reason his mind didn t reboot  Steve left to get Doctor Strange s help in going inside Tony s mind  Following this  Steve was in the New Avengers hideout in New York when he learned that Osborn was laying siege to Asgard 34   Enraged  Steve assembled the New Avengers  the Young Avengers  and Nick Fury s Secret Warriors to provide support for the Asgardians and finally bring down Osborn  Bucky gave Steve the shield  saying that they needed him leading the counterattack  Bucky told Steve that he needed the shield in the fight against the Dark Avengers  Steve took the shield but asked Bucky what he would do  to which Bucky replied  I will do what I

 although as a result of the Super Soldier serum  he was transformed from a frail young man into a  perfect  specimen of human development and conditioning  Rogers is as intelligent  strong  fast  agile  and durable as it was possible for a human being to be without being considered superhuman  Although the SSS is definite  he maintains an overall healthy lifestyle including a regular exercise regimen and a balanced diet  Peak Human Strength  Rogers  physical strength is enhanced to the very peak of human potential  As a result  he is as physically strong as a human being can be without being classified as superhuman  48  Captain America had been seen bench pressing 500 kg  1 100 lbs  which is consistent with his strength level  as benching is easier than military press lifting 49   He can snap steel handcuffs and chains  and is capable of breaking wooden walls and steel doors with a single kick  Peak Human Speed  He can run at speeds of up to approximately 48 kilometers per hour  30 miles per hour   and has on occasion run a mile in just under a minute when under duress  which would roughly be a little less than 60 miles per hour   Peak Human Stamina  Rogers  body eliminates the excessive build up of fatigue producing chemicals in his muscles  granting him exceptional endurance and lung capacity  He can exert himself at peak capacity for several hours without rest and before showing any signs of fatigue  Peak Human Agility  His agility is greater than that of an Olympic gold medalist He can coordinate his body with balance flexibility  and dexterity  He also has the ability to leap 50 yards out in a single bound and 20 ft into the air without a running start  Peak Human Reflexes  Rogers  reflexes border on superhuman level  His reaction speed is 20 kph  which makes it possible for him to dodge gunfire even in short range from multiple gunners at the same time  Peak Human Durability  His bones and muscles are denser and harder than normal  to the highest human potential  which makes him very durable compared to a normal human  He is durable enough to the point that if a person beats him with a thick wooden stick  the stick would eventually break and Rogers would show little discomfort  This level of durability is how he survived other forms of extensive punishment throughout his career  Peak Human Healing  Rogers  healing speed and efficiency is at the highest limits of human potential  which means he can heal faster than most humans  The white blood cells  WBCs  and the SSS in his body are efficient enough to fight off any microbe  foreign body and others from his body keeping him healthy and immune to most if not all infections  diseases and disorders  also making it impossible to become intoxicated  Peak Human Mental Process  His mental performance has been greatly enhanced  allowing his mind to operate in the most efficient and rapid manner possible  One manifestation of this is his tactical genius  the ability to quickly process multiple information streams  e g   threat assessment  and rapidly respond to changing tactical situations  Rogers also possesses an eidetic memory  meaning that he never forgets anything and has perfect recall  This enables him to remember any military tactic and apply it to any situation  50  Peak Human Senses  Rogers  senses of sight  hearing  smell  taste  and touch are at the highest possible limits of human potential  He once said that he is able to dodge bullets because he sees faster than them  Peak Human Aging The SSS dramatically slows Roger s aging due to extensively healthy cells  Sersi once stated because of this it is possible that he may indefinitely maintain his youth This would presumably also include Isaiah Bradley and Josiah X  two others exposed to the Super Soldier Serum  Power Grids Official Ratings 51  Intelligence  3 Strength  3 Speed  2 Durability  3 Energy Projection  1 Fighting Skills 6  Fan Ratings Intelligence 5  Strength  3 Speed  3 Durability

combat experts Rex Applegate and William Fairbairn whose fields of expertise were European martial arts and Chinese martial arts during WW2  While the majority of the instructors  curriculums were simplified for training the Allied Forces  it is possible that they trained Rogers in the more complex techniques because his body was already developed for them and because the majority of his combat

was cast by American metallurgist Dr  Myron MacLain  who was contracted by the U S  government to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II  During his experiments  MacLain combined Vibranium with a steel alloy he was working with and an unknown catalyst  creating the disc shaped shield  MacLain was never able to duplicate the process due to his inability to identify the still unknown factor that played a role in it  however attempts to reverse engineer its composition resulted in the development of adamantium  The shield was issued to Captain America by the government several months after the beginning of his career  The shield had great aerodynamic properties  it was able to slice through the air with minimal wind resistance and deflection of path  Its great overall resilience  combined with its natural concentric stiffness  enabled it to rebound from objects with minimal loss of angular momentum  It was virtually indestructible  it was resistant to

ancestor already living in the colonies that would become the USA versus both of his own parents were immigrants themselves from outside the USA  If true  the Revolutionary War era Rogers or his direct descendant who maintained the surname of Rogers left the USA after its initial formation as an independent country which seems unlikely    2 02 1 recounted in Captain America  255   According to  Adventures of Captain America  1    4  Oct  1991   Jan  1992  by Fabian Nicieza  a later revamp   Erskine s serum awakened the  latent power  of the individual to varying degrees  This was unlike earlier accounts where everyone would be enhanced  According to Erskine  tests were conducted prior to the patient receiving the serum to see how much inner power the patient had  and if it was worth the risk to awaken it  No matter how much latent power the patient had  the chance of survival was 1 in 4  Most texts use the universal acceptability standard of the Super Soldier Serum on everyone in canon as the reason for the specific desire to exactly recreate Erskine s process  rather than the selective applicability of this retcon  Other processes existed which were also unreliable  such as the Power Broker s process  which created a Super human powered Captain America  John Walker    His title of  Captain  was apparently a tribute to a  Captain Rogers  who served in the Revolutionary
