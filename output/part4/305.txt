Francisco  According to the Chinese zodiac Lee was born in both the hour and the year of the Dragon which in this cultural tradition is considered a strong and fortuitous omen  13  His father  Lee Hoi chuen  was fully Chinese  and his mother  Grace Ho        was half Chinese and half Caucasian  14  Grace was the daughter of Ho Kom tong and the niece of Sir Robert Ho tung  both notable Honk Kong businessmen and philanthropists  15  Lee was the fourth child of five children  Agnes  Phoebe  Peter  and Robert  Lee and his parents returned to Hong Kong when he was three months old  16  Names Lee s Cantonese birth name was Lee Jun fan        17  The name homophonically means  return again   it was given to Lee by his mother  who felt he would return to the United States once he came of age  18  Because of his mother s superstitious nature  she originally named him Sai fon       which is a feminine name meaning  small phoenix   19  The English name  Bruce  was thought to be given by the hospital attending physician  Dr  Mary Glover  20  Lee had three other Chinese names  Li Yuanxin        a family clan name  Li Yuanjian        as a student name while he was attending La Salle College  and his Chinese screen name Li Xiaolong       Xiaolong means  little dragon    Lee s given name Jun fan was originally written in Chinese as     however  the Jun     Chinese character was identical to part of his grandfather s name  Lee Jun biu        Hence  the Chinese character for Jun in Lee s name was changed to the homonym   instead  to avoid naming taboo in Chinese tradition  Family Lee s father  Lee Hoi chuen  was one of the leading Cantonese opera and film actors at the time  and was embarking on a year long Cantonese opera tour with his family on the eve of the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong  Lee Hoi chuen had been touring the United States for many years and performing at numerous Chinese communities there  Although a number of his peers decided to stay in the United States  Lee Hoi chuen decided to go back to Hong Kong after his wife gave birth to Bruce Lee  Within months  Hong Kong was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under Japanese occupation  After the war ended  Lee Hoi chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong s rebuilding years  Lee s mother  Grace Ho  was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in Hong Kong  the Ho tungs  She was the niece of Sir Robert Ho tung  15  21  of Eurasian descent and patriarch of the clan  As such  the young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment  Despite this advantage of his family s status  the Hong Kong neighborhood Lee grew up in became over crowded  dangerous  and full of gang rivalries because of the mass number of people fleeing communist China to Hong Kong    19  Post war Hong Kong was a tough place to grow up  Gangs ruled the city streets and Lee was often forced to fight them  But Bruce liked a challenge and faced his adversaries head on  To his parents dismay  Bruce s street fighting continued and the violent nature of his confrontations was escalating  After being involved in several street fights  Lee s parents decided that he needed to be trained in the martial arts  Lee s first introduction to martial arts was through his father  He learned the fundamentals of Wu style tai chi chuan from his father  22  Wing Chun See also  History of Wing Chun The largest influence on Lee s martial arts development was his study of Wing Chun  Lee began training in Wing Chun at the age of 13 under the Wing Chun teacher Yip Man in 1954  after losing a fight with rival gang members  Yip s regular classes generally consisted of the forms practice  chi sao  sticking hands  drills  wooden dummy techniques  and free sparring  23  There was no set pattern to the classes  23  Yip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organized competitions  24  After a year into his Wing Chun training  most of Yip Man s other students refused to train with Lee after they learnt of his ancestry  his mother was half Chinese and half Caucasian  as the Chinese generally were against teaching their martial arts techniques to non Asians  25  26  Lee s sparring partner  Hawkins Cheung states   Probably fewer than six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught  or even partly taught  by Yip Man   27  However  Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun  and continued to train privately with Yip Man and Wong Shun Leung in 1955  28  Leaving Hong Kong After attending Tak Sun School         a couple of blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road  Kowloon   Lee entered the primary school division of La Salle College in 1950 or 1952  at the age of 12   In around 1956  due to poor academic performance  or possibly poor conduct as well   he was transferred to St  Francis Xavier s College  high school  where he would be mentored by Brother Edward  a teacher and coach of the school boxing team  In the spring of 1959  Lee got into yet another street fight and the police were called  29  From all the way to his late teens  Lee s street fights became more frequent and included beating up the son of a feared triad family  Eventually  Lee s father decided for him to leave Hong Kong to pursue a safer and healthier avenue in the United States  His parents confirmed the police s fear that this time Lee s opponent had an organised crime background  and there was the possibility that a contract was out for his life  The police detective came and he says  Excuse me Mr  Lee  your son is really fighting bad in school  If he gets into just one more fight I might have to put him in jail    Robert Lee 19  In April 1959  Lee s parents decided to send him to the United States to stay with his older sister  Agnes Lee        who was already living with family friends in San Francisco  New life in America At the age of 18  Lee returned to the United States with  100 in his pocket and the titles of 1957 High School Boxing Champion and 1958 Crown colony Cha Cha Champion of Hong Kong  13  After living in San Francisco for several months  he moved to Seattle in 1959  to continue his high school education  where he also worked for Ruby Chow as a live in waiter at her restaurant  Chow s husband was a co worker and friend of Lee s father  Lee s elder brother Peter Lee       would also join him in Seattle for a short stay before moving on to Minnesota to attend college  In December 1960  Lee completed his high school education and received his diploma from Edison Technical School  now Seattle Central Community College  located on Capitol Hill  Seattle   In March 1961  Lee enrolled at the University of Washington  majoring in drama according to the university s alumni association information  30  not in philosophy as claimed by Lee himself and many others  Lee also studied philosophy  psychology  and various other subjects  31  32  It was at the University of Washington that he met his future wife Linda Emery  a fellow student studying to become a teacher  whom he married in August 1964  Lee had two children with Linda Emery  Brandon Lee  1965 93  and Shannon Lee  b  1969   Jun Fan Gung Fu Lee began teaching martial arts in the United States in 1959  He called what he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu  literally Bruce Lee s Kung Fu   It was basically his approach to Wing Chun  33  Lee taught friends he met in Seattle  starting with Judo practitioner Jesse Glover  who later became his first assistant instructor  Lee opened his first martial arts school  named the Lee Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute  in Seattle  Lee dropped out of college in the spring of 1964 and moved to Oakland to live with James Yimm Lee        James Lee was twenty years senior to Bruce Lee and a well known Chinese martial artist in the area  Together  they founded the second Jun Fan martial art studio in Oakland  James Lee was also responsible for introducing Bruce Lee to Ed Parker  royalty of the U S  martial arts world and organiser of the Long Beach International Karate Championships at which Bruce Lee was later  discovered  by Hollywood  Jeet Kune Do The Jeet Kune Do emblem is a registered trademark held by the Bruce Lee Estate  The Chinese characters around the Taijitu symbol read   Using no way as way  and  Having no limitation as limitation  The arrows represent the endless interaction between yang and yin  34  Main article  Jeet Kune Do Jeet Kune Do originated in 1967  After filming one season of The Green Hornet  Lee found himself out of work and opened The Jun Fan Institute of Gung Fu  A controversial match with Wong Jack Man influenced Lee s philosophy about martial arts  Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his Wing Chun techniques  He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalistic to be practical in scenarios of chaotic street fighting  Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on  practicality  flexibility  speed  and efficiency   He started to use different methods of training such as weight training for strength  running for endurance  stretching for flexibility  and many others which he constantly adapted  including fencing and basic boxing techniques  Lee emphasised what he called  the style of no style   This consisted of getting rid of the formalised approach which Lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles  Lee felt the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was even too restrictive  and eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call Jeet Kune Do or the Way of the Intercepting Fist  It is a term he would later regret  because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that styles connote  whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations  35  Long Beach International Karate Championships At the invitation of Ed Parker  Lee appeared in the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships 36  and performed repetitions of two finger push ups  using the thumb and the index finger of one hand  with feet at approximately a shoulder width apart  In the same Long Beach event he also performed the  One inch punch   37  the description of which is as follows  Lee stood upright  his right foot forward with knees bent slightly  in front of a standing  stationary partner  Lee s right arm was partly extended and his right fist approximately an inch away from the partner s chest  Without retracting his right arm  Lee then forcibly delivered the punch to his partner while largely maintaining his posture  sending the partner backwards and falling into a chair said to be placed behind the partner to prevent injury  though his partner s momentum soon caused him to fall to the floor  His volunteer was Bob Baker of Stockton  California   I told Bruce not to do this type of demonstration again   Baker recalled   When he punched me that last time  I had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable   38  It was at the 1964 championships where Lee first met Taekwondo master Jhoon Goo Rhee  The two developed a friendship   a relationship from which they benefited as martial artists  Rhee taught Lee the side kick in detail  and Lee taught Rhee the  non telegraphic  punch  39  Lee appeared at the 1967 Long Beach International Karate Championships and performed various demonstrations  including the famous  unstoppable punch  against USKA world Karate champion Vic Moore  36  Lee told Moore that he was going to throw a straight punch to the face  and all he had to do was to try to block it  Lee took several steps back and asked if Moore was ready  when Moore nodded in affirmation  Lee glided towards him until he was within striking range  He then threw a straight punch directly at Moore s face  and stopped before impact  In eight attempts  Moore failed to block any of the punches  40  41  Fight history Lee defeated three time champion British boxer Gary Elms by way of knockout in the third round in the 1958 Hong Kong Inter School amateur Boxing Championships by using Wing Chun traps and high low level straight punches  42  The following year  Lee became a member of the  Tigers of Junction Street   and was involved in numerous gang related street fights   In one of his last encounters  while removing his jacket the fellow he was squaring off against sucker punched him and blackened his eye  Bruce flew into a rage and went after him  knocking him out  breaking his opponent s arm  The police were called as a result   43  The incident took place on a Hong Kong rooftop at 10 pm on Wednesday  29 April 1959  44  In 1962  Lee was challenged by a man who had been holding a grudge against Lee while the two were practicing at a YMCA in Seattle  45  The man was described by Jesse Glover as a karate man who also had a blackbelt in judo  though Glover  who was a brown belt in judo at the time  claimed to be better than the man in judo  45  After weeks 46  or months 47  of provocation by the man  Lee agreed to fight the man for three two minute rounds  with the winner being the one who knocked the opponent down or out in two out of three rounds  48  The match took place at YMCA s handball court  with Glover as the referee and Ed Hart as the time keeper  48  Lee wore street clothes and used a Wing Chun stance while his opponent wore a gi and used a karate stance  48  According to Glover  Lee used his right forearm to deflect an initial kick from the man and simultaneously landed a left punch to the face  48  Lee deflected more punches using the forearm  controlling the center line and landed more punches to the man s face until he was against the wall  48  The man attempted to grab Lee s arms  which Lee responded by a double fist punch to the face and chest  followed by a kick to the nose  which produced a nosebleed and a knockout  at which time Glover stopped the fight  48  Taki Kamura said the fight lasted 10 seconds  49  Ed Hart stated  the fight lasted exactly 11 seconds   I know because I was the time keeper   and Bruce had hit the guy something like 15 times and kicked him once  I thought he d killed him   46  In Oakland  California in 1964 at Chinatown  Lee had a controversial private match with Wong Jack Man  a direct student of Ma Kin Fung known for his mastery of Xingyiquan  Northern Shaolin  and T ai chi ch uan  According to Lee  the Chinese community issued an ultimatum to him to stop teaching non Chinese  When he refused to comply  he was challenged to a combat match with Wong  The arrangement was that if Lee lost  he would have to shut down his school  while if he won  then Lee would be free to teach Caucasians or anyone else  43  Wong denied this  stating that he requested to fight Lee after Lee issued an open challenge during one of Lee s demonstrations at a Chinatown theatre  and that Wong himself did not discriminate against Caucasians or other non Chinese  50  Lee commented   That paper had all the names of the sifu from Chinatown  but they don t scare me   51  Individuals known to have witnessed the match included Cadwell  James Lee  Bruce Lee s associate  no relation   and William Chen  a teacher of T ai chi ch uan  Wong and witness William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20 25 minutes  50  According to Bruce Lee  Linda Lee Cadwell  and James Yimm Lee  the fight lasted 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee   The fight ensued  it was a no holds barred fight  it took three minutes  Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said  do you give up   and the man said he gave up    Linda Lee Cadwell  43  Wong Jack Man published his own account of the battle in the Chinese Pacific Weekly  a Chinese language newspaper in San Francisco  which contained another challenge to Lee for a public rematch  50  Lee had no reciprocation to Wong s article  nor were there any further public announcements by either  but Lee had continued to teach Caucasians  Lee s eventual celebrity put him in the path of a number of men who sought to make a name for themselves by causing a confrontation with Lee  A challenger had invaded Lee s private home in Hong Kong by trespassing into the backyard to incite Lee in combat  Lee finished the challenger violently with a kick  infuriated over the home invasion  Describing the incident  Herb Jackson states  One time one fellow got over that wall  got into his yard and challenged him and he says  how good are you   And Bruce was poppin mad  He  Bruce  says  he gets the idea  this guy  to come and invade my home  my own private home  invade it and challenge me   He said he got so mad that he gave the hardest kick he ever gave anyone in his life  52  Bob Wall  USPK karate champion and Lee s co star in Enter the Dragon  recalled one encounter that transpired after a film extra kept taunting Lee  The extra yelled that Lee was  a movie star  not a martial artist   that he  wasn t much of a fighter   Lee answered his taunts by asking him to jump down from the wall he was sitting on  Wall described Lee s opponent as  a gang banger type of guy from Hong Kong   a  damned good martial artist   and observed that he was fast  strong  and bigger than Bruce  53  This kid was good  He was strong and fast  and he was really trying to punch Bruce s brains in  But Bruce just methodically took him apart  54  Bruce kept moving so well  this kid couldn t touch him   then all of a sudden  Bruce got him and rammed his ass with the wall and swept him up  proceeding to drop him and plant his knee into his opponent s chest  locked his arm out straight  and nailed him in the face repeatedly     Bob Wall 55  Acting career Bruce Lee in The Kid  Lee s father Lee Hoi chuen was a famous Cantonese opera star  Because of this  Lee was introduced into films at a very young age and appeared in several short black and white films as a child  Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film Golden Gate Girl  By the time he was 18  he had appeared in twenty films  13  While in the United States from 1959 to 1964  Lee abandoned thoughts of a film career in favour of pursuing martial arts  However  a martial arts exhibition on Long Beach in 1964 eventually led to the invitation by William Dozier for an audition for a part in the pilot for  Number One Son   The show never aired  but Lee was invited for the role of Kato alongside Van Williams in the TV series The Green Hornet  The show lasted just one season  from 1966 to 1967  Lee also played Kato in three crossover episodes of Batman  This was followed by guest appearances in three television series  Ironside  1967   Here Come the Brides  1969   and Blondie  1969   At the time  two of Lee s martial arts students were Hollywood script writer Stirling Silliphant and actor James Coburn  In 1969 the three worked on a script for a film called The Silent Flute  and went together on a location hunt to India  The project was not realised at the time  but the 1978 film Circle of Iron  starring David Carradine  was based on the same plot  In 2010  producer Paul Maslansky was reported to plan and receive fundings for a film based on the original script for The Silent Flute  56  In 1969  Lee made a brief appearance in the Silliphant penned film Marlowe where he played a henchman hired to intimidate private detective Philip Marlowe   played by James Garner   by smashing up his office with leaping kicks and flashing punches  only to later accidentally jump off a tall building while trying to kick Marlowe off  The same year he also choreographed fight scenes for The Wrecking Crew starring Dean Martin  Sharon Tate  and featuring Chuck Norris in his first role  In 1970  he was responsible for fight choreography for A Walk in the Spring Rain starring Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn  again written by Silliphant  In 1971  Lee appeared in four episodes of the television series Longstreet  written by Silliphant  Lee played the martial arts instructor of the title character Mike Longstreet  played by James Franciscus   and important aspects of his martial arts philosophy were written into the script  According to statements made by Lee  and also by Linda Lee Cadwell after Lee s death  in 1971 Lee pitched a television series of his own tentatively titled The Warrior  discussions which were also confirmed by Warner Bros  In a 9 December 1971 television interview on The Pierre Berton Show  Lee stated that both Paramount and Warner Brothers wanted him  to be in a modernized type of a thing  and that they think the Western idea is out  whereas I want to do the Western   57  According to Cadwell  however  Lee s concept was retooled and renamed Kung Fu  but Warner Bros  gave Lee no credit  58  Warner Brothers states that they had for some time been developing an identical concept  59  created by two writers and producers  Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander  According to these sources  the reason Lee was not cast was in part because of his ethnicity  but more so because he had a thick accent  60  The role of the Shaolin monk in the Wild West  was eventually awarded to then non martial artist David Carradine  In The Pierre Berton Show interview  Lee stated he understood Warner Brothers  attitudes towards casting in the series   They think that business wise it is a risk  I don t blame them  If the situation were reversed  and an American star were to come to Hong Kong  and I was the man with the money  I would have my own concerns as to whether the acceptance would be there   61  Producer Fred Weintraub had advised Lee to return to Hong Kong and make a feature film which he could showcase to executives in Hollywood  62  Not happy with his supporting roles in the United States  Lee returned to Hong Kong  Unaware that The Green Hornet had been played to success in Hong Kong and was unofficially referred to as  The Kato Show   he was surprised to be recognised on the street as the star of the show  After negotiating with both Shaw Brothers Studio and Golden Harvest  Lee signed a film contract to star in two films produced by Golden Harvest  Lee played his first leading role in The Big Boss  1971  which proved to be an enormous box office success across Asia and catapulted him to stardom  He soon followed up with Fist of Fury  1972  which broke the box office records set previously by The Big Boss  Having finished his initial two year contract  Lee negotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest  Lee later formed his own company  Concord Productions Inc            with Chow  For his third film  Way of the Dragon  1972   he was given complete control of the film s production as the writer  director  star  and choreographer of the fight scenes  In 1964  at a demonstration in Long Beach  California  Lee had met Karate champion Chuck Norris  In Way of the Dragon Lee introduced Norris to movie goers as his opponent in the final death fight at the Colosseum in Rome  today considered one of Lee s most legendary fight scenes and one of the most memorable fight scenes in martial arts film history  63  The role was originally offered to American Karate champion Joe Lewis  64  Bruce Lee s star at the Avenue of Stars  Hong Kong  In late 1972  Lee began work on his fourth Golden Harvest Film  Game of Death  He began filming some scenes including his fight sequence with 7 2  American Basketball star Kareem Abdul Jabbar  a former student  Production was stopped when Warner Brothers offered Lee the opportunity to star in Enter the Dragon  the first film to be produced jointly by Golden Harvest and Warner Bros  Filming commenced in Hong Kong in February 1973  One month into the filming  another production company  Starseas Motion Pictures  promoted Bruce Lee as a leading actor in Fist of Unicorn  although he had merely agreed to choreograph the fight sequences in the film as a favour to his long time friend Unicorn Chan  Lee planned to sue the production company  but retained his friendship with Chan  65  However  only a few months after the completion of Enter the Dragon  and six days before its 26 July 1973 release  66  Lee died  Enter the Dragon would go on to become one of the year s highest grossing films and cement Lee as a martial arts legend  It was made for US 850 000 in 1973  equivalent to  4 million adjusted for inflation as of 2007   67  To date  Enter the Dragon has grossed over  200 million worldwide  68  The film sparked a brief fad in martial arts  epitomised in songs such as  Kung Fu Fighting  and TV shows like Kung Fu  Robert Clouse  the director of Enter the Dragon and Golden Harvest revived Lee s unfinished film Game of Death  Lee had shot over 100 minutes of footage  including out takes  for Game of Death before shooting was stopped to allow him to work on Enter the Dragon  In addition to Abdul Jabbar  George Lazenby  Hapkido master Ji Han Jae and another of Lee s students  Dan Inosanto  were also to appear in the film  which was to culminate in Lee s character  Hai Tien  clad in the now famous yellow track suit  taking on a series of different challengers on each floor as they make their way through a five level pagoda  In a controversial move  Robert Clouse finished the film using a look alike and archive footage of Lee from his other films with a new storyline and cast  which was released in 1978  However  the cobbled together film contained only fifteen minutes of actual footage of Lee  he had printed many unsuccessful takes  69  while the rest had a Lee look alike  Kim Tai Chung  and Yuen Biao as stunt double  The unused footage Lee had filmed was recovered 22 years later and included in the documentary Bruce Lee  A Warrior s Journey  70  Apart from Game of Death  other future film projects were planned to feature Lee at the time  In 1972  after the success of The Big Boss and Fist of Fury  a third film was planned by Raymond Chow at Golden Harvest to be directed by Lo Wei  titled Yellow Faced Tiger  However  at the time  Lee decided to direct and produce his own script for Way of the Dragon instead  Although Lee had formed a production company with Raymond Chow  a period film was also planned from September November 1973 with the competing Shaw Brothers Studio  to be directed by either Chor Yuen or Cheng Kang  and written by Yi Kang and Chang Cheh  titled The Seven Sons of the Jade Dragon  71  Lee had also worked on several scripts himself  A tape containing a recording of Lee narrating the basic storyline to a film tentatively titled Southern Fist Northern Leg exists  showing some similarities with the canned script for The Silent Flute  Circle of Iron   72  Another script had the title Green Bamboo Warrior  set in San Francisco  planned to co star Bolo Yeung and to be produced by Andrew Vajna who later went on to produce First Blood  65  Photo shoot costume tests were also organized for some of these planned film projects  Physical fitness and nutrition Lee in Way of the Dragon in 1972  Physical fitness Lee was renowned for his physical fitness and vigorous  dedicated fitness regimen to become as strong as he possibly could  After his match with Wong Jack Man in 1965  Lee changed his approach toward martial arts training  Lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend enough time on physical conditioning  Lee included all elements of total fitness muscular strength  muscular endurance  cardiovascular endurance  and flexibility  He tried traditional bodybuilding techniques to build bulky muscles or mass  However  Lee was careful to admonish that mental and spiritual preparation was fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills  In Tao of Jeet Kune Do  he wrote Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics  Too much time is given to the development of skill and too little to the development of the individual for participation      JKD  ultimately is not a matter of petty techniques but of highly developed spirituality and physique  73  The weight training program that Lee used during a stay in Hong Kong in 1965 placed heavy emphasis on his arms  At that time he could perform single biceps curls at a weight of 70 to 80 lb  about 32 to 36 kg  for three sets of eight repetitions  along with other forms of exercises  such as squats  push ups  reverse curls  concentration curls  French presses  and both wrist curls and reverse wrist curls  74  The repetitions he performed were 6 to 12 reps  at the time   While this method of training targeted his fast and slow twitch muscles  it later resulted in weight gain or muscle mass  placing Lee a little over 160 lb  about 72 kg   Lee was documented as having well over 2 500 books in his own personal library  and eventually concluded that  A stronger muscle  is a bigger muscle   a conclusion he later disputed  75  Bruce forever experimented with his training routines to maximise his physical abilities and push the human body to its limits  He employed many different routines and exercises including skipping rope  which served his training and bodybuilding purposes effectively  76  Lee believed that the abdominal muscles were one of the most important muscle groups for a martial artist  since virtually every movement requires some degree of abdominal work  Mito Uyehara recalled that  Bruce always felt that if your stomach was not developed  then you had no business doing any hard sparring   According to Linda Lee Cadwell  even when not training  Lee would frequently perform sit ups and other abdominal exercises in domestic living throughout the day  such as during watching TV  She said of Lee   Bruce was a fanatic about ab training  He was always doing sit ups  crunches  Roman chair movements  leg raises and V ups   77  Lee trained from 7 am to 9 am  including stomach  flexibility  and running  and from 11 am to 12 pm he would weight train and cycle  A typical exercise for Lee would be to run a distance of two to six miles in 15 to 45 minutes  in which he would vary speed in 3 5 minute intervals  Lee would ride the equivalent of 10 miles  about 16 kilometres  in 45 minutes on a stationary bike  78  79  Lee would sometimes exercise with the jump rope and put in 800 jumps after cycling  Lee would also do exercises to toughen the skin on his fists  including thrusting his hands into buckets of harsh rocks and gravel  He would do over 500 repetitions of this on a given day  80  An article of the S  China Post writes  When a doctor warned him not to inflict too much violence on his body  Bruce dismissed his words   the human brain can subjugate anything  even real pain   Bruce Lee   81  Physical feats Lee s phenomenal fitness allowed him to perform numerous exceptional physical feats  82  83  Lee s speed in terms of reacting   punching from a distance of three feet away was determined to be around five hundreths of a second  0 05 second   from five feet away it was around eight hundreths of a second  0 08 second   84  85  86  Lee could take in one arm a 75 lb barbell from a standing position with the barbell held flush against his chest and slowly stick his arms out locking them  holding the barbell there for several seconds  87  In a speed demonstration  Lee could snatch a dime off a person s open palm before they could close it  and leave a penny behind  88  Lee performed one hand push ups using only the thumb and index finger  83  89  Lee performed 50 reps of one arm chin ups  90  Lee could cause a 300 lb  136 08 kg  bag to fly towards and thump the ceiling with a sidekick  83  Lee held an elevated v sit position for 30 minutes or longer  82  Nutrition According to Linda Lee Cadwell  soon after he moved to the United States  Lee started to take nutrition seriously and developed an interest in health foods  high protein drinks and vitamin and mineral supplements  He later concluded that in order to achieve a high performance body  one could not fuel it with a diet of junk food  and with  the wrong fuel  one s body would perform sluggishly or sloppily  91  Lee also avoided baked goods and refined flour  describing them as providing calories which did nothing for his body  92  Lee consumed green vegetables and fruit every day  He always preferred to eat Chinese or other Asian food because he loved the variety that it had  Some of Lee s favorite Chinese dishes were beef in oyster sauce  tofu and steak and liver  93  He also became a heavy advocate of dietary supplements  including Vitamin C  Lecithin granules  bee pollen  Shilajit  Vitamin E  rose hips  liquid form   wheat germ oil  Acerola   C and B Folia  94  Lee disliked dairy food although he felt that for building muscle he must consume milk  As a result he only ate dairy as part of cereals and protein drinks  usually using powdered milk instead of fresh milk  Lee s diet included protein drinks  he always tried to consume one or two daily  but discontinued drinking them later on in his life  They typically included non instant powdered milk which is reported to have a higher concentration of calcium than other forms of powdered milk  eggs  wheat germ  peanut butter  banana  brewers yeast for its B vitamins  and Inositol and Lecithin supplements  95  Linda Lee recalls Bruce Lee s waist fluctuated between 26 and 28 inches  66 to 71 centimetres    He also drank his own juice concoctions made from vegetables and fruits  apples  celery  carrots and so on  prepared in an electric blender   she said  citation needed  According to Lee  the size of portions and number of meals were just as important  He would usually consume four or five smaller meals a day rather than a couple of large meals  and would boost his metabolism by eating small healthy snacks such as fruits throughout the day  95  Fruit and vegetables provided him with the richest source of carbohydrates  he was particularly keen on carrots which would make up one half of the contents of the drink  with the remaining being split between the other fruits and vegetables  The reason why Lee was so keen on juicing vegetables and fruits is that he believed it allowed the body to assimilate many nutrients more easily  The enzymes in the juiced vegetables acting as organic catalysts which increase the metabolism and absorption of nutrients  Given that most of these enzymes are destroyed when vegetables are cooked  Lee would try to consume them raw  96  Lee often drank a royal jelly and ginseng drink as they contain B complex vitamins  including a high concentration of vitamin B5  pantothenic acid  and vitamin B6  pyridoxine   acetylcholine  hormones  and eighteen amino acids which allow for a quick energy boost  96  In traditional Chinese medicine  ginseng is also said to improve circulation  increase blood supply  allow quicker recovery times after exhaustion and stimulating the body  97  In addition  Lee regularly drank black tea  often with honey or with milk and sugar  98  Philosophy Lee is best known as a martial artist  but he also studied drama and philosophy while a student at the University of Washington  He was well read and had an extensive library  His own books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions  both inside and outside of martial arts circles  His eclectic philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs  though he was quick to claim that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings  He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self knowledge  and said that his chosen method of self expression was martial arts  99  His influences include Taoism  Jiddu Krishnamurti  and Buddhism  100  On the other hand  Lee s philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative world view advocated by Confucianism  101  John Little states that Lee was an atheist  When asked in 1972 about his religious affiliation  he replied   none whatsoever   102  Also in 1972  he was asked if he believed in God  and he responded   To be perfectly frank  I really do not   99  The following quotations reflect his fighting philosophy   Be formless    shapeless  like water  Now you put water into a cup  it becomes the cup  You pour water into a bottle  it becomes the bottle  You put water into a teapot  it becomes the teapot  Now water can flow  or creep or drip or crash  Be water  my friend     103   All types of knowledge  ultimately leads to self knowledge  104   Use only that which works  and take it from any place you can find it   105   Do not deny the classical approach  simply as a reaction  or you will have created another pattern and trapped yourself there   106   Quick temper will make a fool of you soon enough   107   I always learn something  and that is  to always be yourself  And to express yourself  to have faith in yourself  Do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate him   108   It s not the daily increase but daily decrease  Hack away at the unessential   109  Death Bruce Lee is buried next to his son Brandon in Lakeview Cemetery  Seattle  On 10 May 1973  Lee collapsed in Golden Harvest studios while doing dubbing work for the movie Enter the Dragon  Suffering from seizures and headaches  he was immediately rushed to Hong Kong Baptist Hospital where doctors diagnosed cerebral edema  They were able to reduce the swelling through the administration of mannitol  These same symptoms that occurred in his first collapse were later repeated on the day of his death  110  On 20 July 1973  Lee was in Hong Kong  to have dinner with former James Bond star George Lazenby  with whom he intended to make a film  According to Lee s wife Linda  Lee met producer Raymond Chow at 2 pm at home to discuss the making of the film Game of Death  They worked until 4 pm and then drove together to the home of Lee s colleague Betty Ting Pei  a Taiwanese actress  The three went over the script at Ting s home  and then Chow left to attend a dinner meeting  111  112  Later Lee complained of a headache  and Ting gave him an analgesic  painkiller   Equagesic  which contained both aspirin and the muscle relaxant meprobamate  Around 7 30 pm  he went to lie down for a nap  When Lee did not turn up for dinner  Chow came to the apartment but could not wake Lee up  A doctor was summoned  who spent ten minutes attempting to revive him before sending him by ambulance to Queen Elizabeth Hospital  Lee was dead by the time he reached the hospital  113  There was no visible external injury  however  according to autopsy reports  his brain had swollen considerably  from 1 400 to 1 575 grams  a 13  increase   Lee was 32 years old  The only substance found during the autopsy was Equagesic  On 15 October 2005  Chow stated in an interview that Lee died from an allergic reaction to the muscle relaxant  meprobamate  in Equagesic  which he described as a common ingredient in painkillers  When the doctors announced Lee s death officially  it was ruled a  death by misadventure   114  115  Don Langford  Lee s personal physician in Hong Kong  had treated Lee during his first collapse  Controversy erupted when he stated   Equagesic was not at all involved in Bruce s first collapse   116  Donald Teare  a forensic scientist recommended by Scotland Yard who had overseen over 1 000 autopsies  was assigned to the Lee case  His conclusion was  death by misadventure  caused by an acute cerebral edema due to a reaction to compounds present in the combination medication Equagesic  117  The preliminary opinion of Peter Wu  the neurosurgeon who saved Lee s life during his first seizure  was that the cause of death should have been attributed to either a reaction to cannabis or Equagesic  However  Wu later backed off from this position  stating that   Professor Teare was a forensic scientist recommended by Scotland Yard  he was brought in as an expert on cannabis and we can t contradict his testimony  The dosage of cannabis is neither precise nor predictable  but I ve never known of anyone dying simply from taking it   116  Lee s wife Linda returned to her hometown of Seattle  and had him buried at lot 276 of Lakeview Cemetery  118  Pallbearers at his funeral on 31 July 1973 included Taky Kimura  Steve McQueen  James Coburn  Chuck Norris  George Lazenby  Dan Inosanto  Peter Chin  and Lee s brother Robert  Lee s iconic status and untimely demise fed many theories about his death  including murder involving the triads and a supposed curse on him and his family  119 Black Belt magazine in 1985 carried the speculation that the death of Bruce Lee in 1973 may have been caused by  a delayed reaction to a Dim Mak strike he received several weeks prior to his collapse   Legacy Certified instructors Bruce Lee personally certified only three instructors  Taky Kimura  James Yimm Lee  and Dan Inosanto  Inosanto holds the 3rd rank  Instructor  directly from Bruce Lee in Jeet Kune Do  Jun Fan Gung Fu  and Bruce Lee s Tao of Chinese Gung Fu  Taky Kimura holds a 5th rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu  James Yimm Lee held a 3rd rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu  Ted Wong holds 2nd rank in Jeet Kune Do certified directly by Bruce Lee and was later promoted to Instructor under Dan Inosanto  feeling that Bruce would have wanted to promote him  Other Jeet Kune Do instructors since Lee s death have been certified directly by Dan Inosanto  some with remaining Bruce Lee signed certificates  James Yimm Lee  a close friend of Lee  died without certifying additional students apart from Gary Dill who studied Jeet Kune Do under James and received permission via a personal letter from him in 1972 to pass on his learning of JKD to others  Taky Kimura  to date  has certified only one person in Jun Fan Gung Fu  his son Andy Kimura  Dan Inosanto continued to teach and certify select students in Jeet Kune Do for over 30 years  making it possible for thousands of martial arts practitioners to trace their training lineage back to Bruce Lee  Prior to his death  Lee told his then only two living instructors Kimura and Inosanto  James Yimm Lee had died in 1972  to dismantle his schools  Both Taky Kimura and Dan Inosanto were allowed to teach small classes thereafter  under the guideline  keep the numbers low  but the quality high   Bruce also instructed several World Karate Champions including Chuck Norris  Joe Lewis  and Mike Stone  Between the three of them  during their training with Bruce they won every karate championship in the United States  120  In Japan  Junichi Okada is a certified Japanese instructor in Jeet Kune Do  121  Hong Kong legacy Sculpture of Bruce Lee at the Avenue of Stars  Hong Kong There are a number of stories  perhaps apocryphal  surrounding Lee that are still repeated in Hong Kong culture  One is that his early 70s interview on the TVB show Enjoy Yourself Tonight cleared the busy streets of Hong Kong as everyone was watching the interview at home  On 6 January 2009  it was announced that Bruce s Hong Kong home  41 Cumberland Road  Kowloon  Hong Kong  will be preserved and transformed into a tourist site by philanthropist Yu Pang lin  122  123
