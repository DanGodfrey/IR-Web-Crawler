census  it has more than 153 550 people of indigenous descent  and most are from Latin America   The invisible population that is virtually ignored by the census is that of indigenous people from

units are in multi unit structures   edit  Law  government and politics The county s voters elect a governing five member Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors  The small size of the board means each supervisor represents over 2 million people  The board operates in a legislative  executive  and quasi judicial capacity  As a legislative authority  it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas  ordinances that affect the whole county  like posting of restaurant ratings  must be ratified by the individual city   As an executive body  it can tell the county departments what to do  and how to do it  As a quasi judicial body  the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process  and holds public hearings on various agenda items  As of 2008  the Board of Supervisors oversees a  22 5 billion annual budget and approximately 100 000 employees  20  The county government is managed on a day to day basis by a Chief Executive Officer  William T Fujioka  and is organized into many departments  each of which is enormous in comparison to equivalent county level  and even state level  departments anywhere else in the United States  Some of the larger or better known departments include  The Grand Avenue entrance of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse  Los Angeles County Coroner   performs autopsies and determines the cause of death for those who die without medical supervision  Community Development Commission of the County of Los Angeles 21  serves as the County s housing authority as well as the housing and community and economic development agency with wide

Transportation Authority  despite its name  is not a County department  Technically it is a state mandated county transportation commission that also operates bus and rail  The Los Angeles Superior Court  which covers the entire county  is not a County department but a division of the State s trial court system  Historically  the courthouses were county owned buildings that were maintained at county expense  which created significant friction since the trial court judges  as officials of the state government  had to lobby the county Board of Supervisors for facility renovations and upgrades  In turn  the state judiciary successfully persuaded the state Legislature to authorize the transfer of all courthouses to the state government in 2008 and 2009  so that judges would have direct control over their own courthouses   Courthouse security is still provided by the county government under a contract with the state   edit  Politics Los Angeles County vote by party in

cases arising under state law  while the U S  District Court for the Central District of California hears all federal cases  Both are headquartered in a large cluster of government buildings in the city s Civic Center  Unlike the largest city in the US  New York City  all of the city of Los Angeles and most of its important suburbs are located within a single county  As a result  both the county superior court and the federal district court are respectively the busiest courts of their type in the nation  24  25  Many celebrities like O J  Simpson have been seen in Los Angeles courts  In 2003
