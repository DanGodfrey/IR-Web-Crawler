and Elobey Chico  and an insular region containing Annob n island and Bioko island  formerly Fernando Po  where the capital Malabo is situated  Annob n is the southernmost island of Equatorial Guinea and is situated just south of the equator  Bioko island is the northernmost point of Equatorial Guinea  Between the two islands and to the east is the mainland region  Equatorial Guinea is bordered by Cameroon on the north  Gabon on the south and east  and the Gulf of Guinea on the west  where the island nation of S o Tom  and Pr ncipe is located between Bioko and Annob n  Formerly the colony of Spanish Guinea  its post independence name is suggestive of its location near both the equator and the Gulf of Guinea  Besides the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla on the Mediterranean coast next to Morocco  it is the only territory in mainland Africa with Spanish as the official language  With an area of 28 000 square kilometres  11 000 sq mi  Equatorial Guinea is one of the smallest countries in continental Africa  It is also the richest per capita  5  however  the wealth is distributed very unevenly  with 70  of the population living under the United Nations Poverty Threshold of  2 day  With a population of 650 702  Equatorial Guinea is the third smallest country in continental Africa  6  It is also the second smallest United Nations  UN  member from continental Africa  The discovery of sizeable petroleum reserves in recent years is altering the economic and political status of the country  Its gross domestic product  GDP  per capita ranks 28th in the world  7  however  most of the country s considerable oil wealth actually lies in the hands of only a few people  Equatorial Guinea has one of the worst human rights records in the world  consistently ranking among the  worst of the worst  in Freedom House s annual survey of political and civil rights 8  and Reporters Without Borders ranks President Obiang among its  predators  of press freedom  9  Out of 44 sub Saharan countries  Equatorial Guinea ranks 9th highest in the Human Development Index  HDI  and 115th overall  which is among the medium HDI countries  Contents 1 Geography 1 1 Climate 2 History 3

Africa  The country consists of a mainland territory  R o Muni  which is bordered by Cameroon to the north and Gabon to the east and south and five small islands  Bioko  Corisco  Annob n  Small Elobey and Great Elobey  Bioko  the site of the capital  Malabo  lies about 40 kilometers  25 mi  off the coast of Cameroon  Annob n island is about 350 kilometers  220 mi  west south west of Cape Lopez in Gabon  Corisco and the two Elobey islands are in Corisco Bay  on the border of R o Muni and Gabon  Equatorial Guinea lies between latitudes 4 N and 2 S  and longitudes 5  and 12 E  Despite its name  no part of the country s territory lies on the equator   it is entirely in the northern hemisphere  except for the island province of Annob n which is about 155 km south of the equator  Equatorial Guinea spans several ecoregions  R o Muni region lies within the Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests ecoregion except for patches of Central African mangroves on the coast  especially in the Muni River estuary  The Cross Sanaga Bioko coastal forests ecoregion covers most of Bioko and as well as the adjacent portions of Cameroon and Nigeria on the African mainland  and the Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests ecoregion covers the highlands of Bioko and nearby Mount Cameroon  The S o Tom   Pr ncipe  and Annob n moist lowland forests ecoregion covers all of Annob n  as well as S o Tom  and Pr ncipe   edit  Climate Equatorial Guinea has a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons  From June to August  R o Muni is dry and Bioko wet  from December to February  the reverse occurs  In between there is gradual transition  Rain or mist occurs daily on Annob n  where a cloudless day has never been registered  The temperature at Malabo  Bioko  ranges from 16  C  61  F  to 33  C  91  F   though on the southern Moka Plateau normal high temperatures are only 21  C  70  F   In R o Muni  the average temperature is about 27  C  81  F   Annual rainfall varies from 1 930 mm  76 in  at Malabo to 10 920 mm  430 in  at Ureka  Bioko  but R o Muni is somewhat drier  10   edit  History Main article  History of Equatorial Guinea In the continental region that is now Equatorial Guinea there are believed to have been pygmies  of whom only isolated pockets remain in southern R o Muni  Bantu migrations between the 18th and 20th centuries brought the coastal tribes and later the Fang  Elements of the latter may have generated the Bubi  who emigrated to Bioko from Cameroon and Rio Muni in several waves and succeeded former Neolithic populations  The Annob n population  native to Angola  was introduced by the Portuguese via S o Tom  island  S o Tom  and Pr ncipe   The Portuguese explorer Fern o do P   seeking a path to India  is credited as being the first European to discover the island of Bioko in 1472  He called it Formosa   Beautiful    but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer  The islands of Fernando P  and Annob n were colonized by Portugal in 1474  In 1778  the island  adjacent islets  and commercial rights to the mainland between the Niger and Ogoue Rivers were ceded to Spain in exchange for territory in the American continent  Treaty of El Pardo  between Queen Maria I of Portugal and King Charles III of Spain   Between 1778 and 1810  the territory of Equatorial Guinea depended administratively on the Viceroyalty of the R o de la Plata  with seat in Buenos Aires  From 1827 to 1843  the United Kingdom established a base on the island to combat the slave trade  11  which was then moved to Sierra Leone upon agreement with Spain in 1843  In 1844  on restoration of Spanish sovereignty  it became known as the Territorios Espa oles del Golfo de Guinea Ecuatorial  The mainland portion  Rio Muni  became a protectorate in 1885 and a colony in 1900  Conflicting claims to the mainland were settled by the Treaty of Paris in 1900  and periodically  the mainland territories were united administratively under Spanish rule  Between 1926 and 1959 they were united as the colony of Spanish Guinea  In September 1968  Francisco Mac as Nguema was elected first president of Equatorial Guinea  and independence was recognised on October 12  1968  In July 1970  Nguema created a single party state  Nguema s reign of terror led to the death or exile of up to 1 3 of the country s population  Out of a population of 300 000  an estimated 80 000 had been killed  12  13  The economy collapsed  and skilled citizens and foreigners left  14 Teodoro Obiang deposed Francisco Mac as Nguema on August 3  1979  in a bloody coup d  tat  In 2011 the government announced it was planning a new capital in the country  named Djibloho  15  16  17  18   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Equatorial Guinea Map of Equatorial Guinea The current president of Equatorial Guinea is Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  The 1982 constitution of Equatorial Guinea  written following the 1979 deposition of dictator Francisco Mac as Nguema and with help from the UN  gives the presidency extensive powers  including naming and dismissing members of the cabinet  making laws by decree  dissolving the Chamber of Representatives  negotiating and ratifying treaties and serving as commander in chief of the armed forces  The Prime Minister  Ignacio Milam Tang is appointed by the President and operates under powers designated by the President  On Christmas 1975  Mac as had 150 alleged coup plotters executed to the sound of a band playing Mary Hopkin s tune Those Were the Days in a national stadium  19  It is estimated that 100 000 people  approximately one third of the population  were killed or fled into exile during Mac as  reign  20  President Obiang overthrew previous dictator Francisco Mac as Nguema on 3 August 1979 in a bloody coup d  tat  Since August 1979 some 12 real and perceived unsuccessful coup attempts have occurred  The  real  coup attempts were often perpetrated in an attempt by rival elites to seize the state s economic resources  20  Under President Obiang  the U S  Agency for International Development  USAID  entered into a Memorandum of Understanding  MOU  with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  in April 2006  to establish a Social Development Fund in the country  implementing projects in the areas of health  education  women s affairs and the environment  21  Since 2005  MPRI  a U S  based international policing consulting company  has worked in Equatorial Guinea to train police forces in appropriate human rights practices  In February 2010  Equatorial Guinea signed a contract with the MPRI subsidiary of the US defense corporation  L3 Communications for coastal surveillance and maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea  22  23  Although President Obiang signed a national anti torture decree in 2006 to ban all forms of abuse and improper treatment in Equatorial Guinea and commissioned the renovation and modernization of Black Beach prison in 2007 to ensure the humane treatment of prisoners  24  human rights abuses continue  Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International among other non governmental organizations have documented severe human rights abuses in prisons  including torture  beatings  unexplained deaths and illegal detention  25  26  Under President Obiang  the basic infrastructure of Equatorial Guinea has also improved  Asphalt now covers more than 80  of the national roads and ports and airports are being built across the entire country  27  Progress of this increase in infrastructure was confirmed in October 2011 when a British parliamentary delegation and press entourage toured the country as guests of the president  However  despite all the new infrastructure there were very few of its citizens who seemed to have access to it  with reports of empty three lane highways and many empty buildings during the course of the tour according to a journalist who represented The Guardian newspaper who formed part of the press entourage  28  According to a March 2004 BBC profile  29  politics within the country are currently dominated by tensions between Obiang s son  Teodorin  and other close relatives with powerful positions in the security forces  The tension may be rooted in power shift arising from the dramatic increase in oil production which has occurred since 1997  A November 2004 report 30  named Mark Thatcher as a financial backer of a 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d  tat attempt to topple Obiang  organized by Simon Mann  Various accounts also name the United Kingdom s MI6  the United States  CIA  and Spain as having been tacit supporters of the coup attempt  31  Nevertheless  the Amnesty International report released in June 2005 32  on the ensuing trial of those allegedly involved highlighted the prosecution s failure to produce conclusive evidence that a coup attempt had actually taken place  Simon Mann was released from prison on November 3  2009 for humanitarian reasons  The presidential decree pardoning Mann from prison cites concerns about his physical health and the need for him to receive ongoing care in his home country  33  President Obiang was re elected to serve an additional term in 2009 in an election deemed by the African Union as  in line with electoral law   34  The President reappointed Prime Minister Ignacio Milam Tang and installed a new government in Equatorial Guinea on January 12  2010  35  The new government is dedicated to strengthening the  cooperation and friendship  with the Barack Obama administration  During a meeting on the sidelines of the recent United Nations General Assembly  President Obiang urged President Obama to institute a U S Africa summit  to strengthen the cooperation between the United States and Africa  27   edit  Administrative divisions Main

Main article  Economy of Equatorial Guinea Pre independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings  On January 1  1985  the country became the first non Francophone African member of the franc zone  adopting the CFA as its currency  The national currency  the ekwele  was previously linked to the Spanish peseta  36  The discovery of large oil reserves in 1996 and its subsequent exploitation have contributed to a dramatic increase in government revenue  As of 2004  37  Equatorial Guinea is the third largest oil producer in Sub Saharan Africa  Its oil production has risen to 360 000 barrels per day  57 000 m3 d   up from 220 000 only two years earlier  Forestry  farming  and fishing are also major components of GDP  Subsistence farming predominates  The deterioration of the rural economy under successive brutal regimes has diminished any potential for agriculture led growth  In July 2004  the United States Senate published an investigation into Riggs Bank  a Washington based bank into which most of Equatorial Guinea s oil revenues were paid until recently  and which also banked for Chile s Augusto Pinochet  The Senate report  as to Equatorial Guinea  showed that at least  35 million were siphoned off by Obiang  his family and senior officials of his regime  The president has denied any wrongdoing  While Riggs Bank in February 2005 paid  9 million as restitution for its banking for Chile s Augusto Pinochet  no restitution was made with regard to Equatorial Guinea  as reported in detail in an Anti Money Laundering Report from Inner City Press  38  Equatorial Guinea is a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa  OHADA   39  Equatorial Guinea tried to become validated as an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative  EITI  Compliant country  working toward transparency in reporting of oil revenues and the prudent use of natural resource wealth  The country was one of 30 Candidate countries and obtained Candidate status February 22  2008  It was then required to meet a number of obligations to do so  including committing to working with civil society and companies on EITI implementation  appointing a senior individual to lead on EITI implementation  and publishing a fully costed Work Plan with measurable targets  a timetable for implementation and an assessment of capacity constraints  However  when Equatorial Guinea applied to extend the deadline for completing EITI validation  the EITI Board did not agree to grant Equatorial Guinea an extension  40   edit  Demographics Main article  Demographics of Equatorial Guinea Equatorial Guinean children of Bubi descent  The majority of the people of Equatorial Guinea are of Bantu origin  citation needed  The largest tribe  the Fang  is indigenous to the mainland  but substantial migration to Bioko Island has resulted in the Fang population exceeding that of the earlier Bantu inhabitants  The Fang constitute 80  of the population 41  and comprise 67 clans  Those in the northern part of Rio Muni speak Fang Ntumu  while those in the south speak Fang Okah  the two dialects have differences but are mutually intelligible  Dialects of Fang are also spoken in parts of neighboring Cameroon  Bulu  and Gabon  These dialects  while still intelligible  are more distinct  The Bulu Fang of Cameroon were traditional rivals of Fang in Rio Muni  The Bubi  who constitute 15  of the population  are indigenous to Bioko Island  The traditional demarcation line between Fang and beach tribes was the village of Niefang  limit of the Fang  inland from Bata  In addition  there are coastal tribes  sometimes referred to as Ndowe or  Playeros   Beach People in Spanish   Combes  Bujebas  Balengues  and Bengas on the mainland and small islands  and Fernandinos  a Krio community on Bioko Island  Together  these groups compose 5  of the population  Some Europeans  largely of Spanish or Portuguese descent    among them mixed with African ethnicity   also live in the nation  Most Spaniards left after independence  There is a growing number of foreigners from neighboring Cameroon  Nigeria  and Gabon  Equatorial Guinea received Asians and black Africans from other countries as workers on cocoa and coffee plantations  Other black Africans came from Liberia  Angola  and Mozambique  Most of the Asian population is Chinese  with small numbers of Indians  Equatorial Guinea also allowed many fortune seeking European settlers of other nationalities  including British  French and Germans  There is also a group of Israelis  and Moroccans  After independence  thousands of Equatorial Guineans went to Spain  Another 100 000 Equatorial Guineans went to Cameroon  Gabon  and Nigeria because of the dictatorship of Francisco Mac as Nguema  Some Equatorial Guinean communities are also to be found in Latin America  the United States  Portugal  and France  Oil extraction has contributed to a doubling of the population in Malabo  Religion in Equatorial Guinea religion percent Christian    93  Muslim    1  Other  indigenous beliefs Baha i     6   edit  Religion The principal religion in Equatorial Guinea is Christianity which is the faith of 93  of the population  These are predominately Roman Catholic  87   while a minority are Protestants  5    Another 5  of the population follow indigenous beliefs and the final 2

as well as Annobonese language  F  d Amb   a Portuguese creole  and Fernando Poo Creole English  English and German are also studied as foreign languages  Aboriginal languages are recognized as integral parts of the  national culture   Constitutional Law No  1 1998 of January 21   The great majority of Equatorial Guineans speak Spanish  44  especially those living in the capital  Malabo  Spanish has been an official language since 1844  Some media reported that in October 2011  the Constitutional Law that amends article four of the Constitution of Equatorial Guinea was enacted by Chamber of People s Representatives  This Constitutional Law established the third official language of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea   Portuguese  by that time only the Spanish and French had official status   This was in an effort by the government to improve its communications  trade  and bilateral relations with Portuguese speaking countries  45  The adoption of Portuguese followed the announcement in July 13  2007  by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema of his government s decision for Portuguese to become Equatorial Guinea s third official language  in order to meet one of the requirements to apply for full membership in the Community of Portuguese Language Countries  CPLP   the other one being political reforms allowing for effective democracy and the respect for human rights  This upgrading from its current Associate Observer condition would result in Equatorial Guinea being able to access several professional and academic exchange programs and the facilitation of cross border circulation of citizens  Its application for membership of the CPLP is currently being assessed by the organisations  members  44  According to draft of the Constitutional Law   This Constitutional Law will go into effect twenty days from its publication in the Official State Gazette   46  So far no official confirmation of approving the decree by the Parliament nor published it in the Official State Gazette  Moreover official Equatorial Guinean sources  do not treat Portuguese as an official language yet  47   edit  Culture Main articles  Culture of Equatorial Guinea and

integration and the marriage of the Hispanic culture with African cultures  36   edit  Education Under the regime of Francisco Macias  education had been significantly neglected with few children receiving any type of education  Under President Obiang  the illiteracy rate dropped from 73 percent to 13 percent  48  and the number of primary school students has risen from 65 000 in 1986 to more than 100 000 in 1994  Education is free and compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14  36  The Equatorial Guinea government has also partnered with Hess Corporation and The Academy for Educational Development  AED  to establish a  20 million education program through which primary school teachers participate in a training program to teach modern child development techniques  49  In recent years  with change in economic political climate and government social agendas  several cultural dispersion and literacy organizations are now located in the country  founded chiefly with the financial support of the Spanish government  The country has one university  the Universidad Nacional de Guinea Ecuatorial  UNGE  with a campus in Malabo and a Faculty of Medicine located in Bata on the mainland  In 2009 the university produced the first 110 national doctors  27  The Bata Medical School is supported principally by the government of Cuba and staffed by Cuban medical educators and physicians  however  it is predicted that Equatorial Guinea will have enough national doctors in the country to be self sufficient within the next five years  27   edit  Health Equatorial Guinea s innovative malaria control programs have had a remarkable impact on malaria infection  disease  and mortality in the population  50  Their program consists of twice yearly indoor residual spraying  IRS   the introduction of artemisinin combination treatment  ACTs   the use of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant women  IPTp  and the introduction of very high coverage with long lasting insecticide treated mosquito nets  LLINs   The result of their efforts resulted in a reduction in all cause under five mortality from 152 to 55 deaths per 1 000 live births  down 64    and the drop occurred rapidly and timed directly with the beginning of the program  51   edit  Transportation Main article  Transport in Equatorial Guinea  edit  Air transport Every airline registered in the
