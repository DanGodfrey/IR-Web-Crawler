Overview Though Stark s wide array of armors have many different abilities  they are alike in that they are made of incredibly strong fictional materials bolstered by a force field  Every suit has a self contained environment  assorted onboard weapons systems  enhanced strength  flight  and various communications arrays and sensors  such as radar and radio   Furthermore  they typically have multiple power sources including a secondary solar energy collection function in the event that conventional recharging methods are unavailable  Older versions of the armor could also fold virtually flat  allowing Stark to store them in his bullet proof briefcase  The defining abilities of Stark s armor are the jets situated in the boots and the repulsors situated in the gloves  The repulsors originated as a hand attachment  but have since become the armor s most important standard armament  They have been referred to as being magnetic  1  a blast of charged particles  2  and as a force beam  3  In the 2008 movie  the repulsors are a form of propulsion and  as hand units  steering jet  though they can be used offensively  A later variation on this is the Pulse Bolts  bolts of concussive energy that actually gain energy the further they have to travel  up to a limit of roughly three football fields  about 329 meters   Another defining trait is the chest mounted  uni beam   also known as the variobeam  and tri beam  in the 2008 film  Tony commands J A R V I S  to divert power to his  chest RT   or chest repulsor transmitter   Originally a spotlight and  proton beam   it has grown to accommodate a number of other weapons  primarily light and force based   edit  Construction This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Contrary to its appearance  most of Stark s armors are not rigid metal suits  like a medieval knight s  His standard armor suit consists of approximately two million grain of sand sized discrete units  which are shaped to have as large a surface as possible to optimize their effectiveness  The basis of the suit s structural integrity is the powerful force field which permeates the armor s  cells   as well as the whole configuration when active  Each of the  cells  is a tiny unit in its own right  contributing energy and computing power to the entire armor  this is also why the suit can remain functional even after having sustained considerable damage  The basic principle of the suit is holistic  each part contains the whole  as it were  When inactive  the entire suit can collapse on the microscopic level  the cells  folding  in on themselves to take up a smaller volume  like a three dimensional accordion pleat  While Tony Stark designs every aspect of the armor  the complexity of the design requires that production be entirely automated  Each cell is constructed by using specialized bacteria   the bacteria consume minute amounts of specific metals  arrange themselves on pre tagged areas on the  chip wafer   then die  leaving a very small amount of iron  or gold  or gallium arsenide  This method allows great precision in determining the thickness of circuitry  All the details of the armor s construction listed above are laid out in the Iron Manual  However  some armor which appeared after publication of the Iron Manual may well use entirely different methods of construction   edit  Armors of the 1960s  edit  Iron Man Armor MK I  Grey  Mark I grey armor  First Appearance  Tales of Suspense  39  March 1963  Stark s grey armor was the first iron man armor he built and  in retrospect  a prototype for the later models  It was built around an iron chest plate designed to prevent the piece of shrapnel he received in Vietnam from traveling to his heart and killing him  The armor  made from ordinary iron  provided protection from physical attacks  small arms  fire  extreme temperatures  some forms of energy  and acid  Powered by flat linear armature DC motors  rechargeable via any electrical outlet   the exoskeleton boosted the strength of the wearer by about 10 times  and employed negative feedback for motion sensing  Air pressure jets allowed for extended jumps  but not true flight  and removable suction cups allowed the wearer to cling to walls and ceilings  Weaponry included a chest mounted monobeam  proton beam generator  useful range was only a few yards   a miniature hacksaw that could be attached to the gauntlet s fingertip  and magnetic turbo insulators that allowed Stark to magnetically deflect metal projectiles or bring metal objects to him  Sensors consisted of a short wave radio  All of the armor s devices and functions were manually controlled by the wearer  Stark used it to escape terrorists in Vietnam who were holding him hostage  He constructed at least one updated  form fitting  although still rigid  version upon his return to the United States   edit  Iron Man Armor MK II  Golden Avenger  Iron Man debuts his new golden armor as he battles the caveman like villain Gargantus  From Tales of Suspense  40  1963   Cover art by Jack Kirby First Appearance  Tales of Suspense  40  April 1963  In order to make this armor   which originally was gun metal grey  like the original   less frightening to the general public  Stark created a gold colored version with a wide array of improvements over the original  The new armor used the three dimensional  collapsible micro structure now common in Stark s suits  so that it could be folded up and stored in his briefcase while inactive  The chest plate was streamlined so that it could be worn under normal clothing without being noticeable  The suit had a semi rigid interior with 3D knitted metallic exterior of a lightweight iron alloy  providing the same protection as his old suit did  This was also the first suit to be equipped with a force field generator  Power was still provided by flat linear armature DC motors  now rechargeable via solar recharger as well as electrical outlets  and motion sensing was still provided by negative feedback  The Mk II air pressure boot jets provided limited flight  steering while flying was accomplished by bodily movement  Weaponry consisted of the chest mounted Mk II Monobeam  usable as either a concussive force beam or a heat beam   a sledgehammer  hacksaws extending from the fingertips  hand drills  electromagnets allowing him to pull things to him and push them away  and an electrical field generator  Communications and sensor arrays consisted of a loudspeaker  short wave two way radio  radar  and a tape recorder  When one iteration of this particular armor was partially destroyed by the Melter  a super villain who could dissolve iron and iron alloys with a special ray  Stark built an exact copy using aluminium instead of iron  which was unaffected by the Melter s ability to dissolve iron   edit  Iron Man Armor MK III  original red and gold  First Appearance  Tales of Suspense  48  December 1963  Stark s trademark red and gold armor arose from a battle with a villain named Mr  Doll  who could control the gold armor through a replica figurine  To circumvent the villain s ability  Stark withdrew and constructed a new suit with a significantly different look and a lighter build  thus allowing him to devote less of his own strength to moving the armor and more to fighting Mr  Doll s influence  resulting in the streamlined red and gold suit  The red and gold armor was composed of an ultra fine 3 D knit alloy and incorporated motors into the knitting to allow full mobility  While it ran on the same type of power  the power consumption was much more efficient  The boot jets were upgraded to chemically fueled thrusters  which provided a much faster flight speed  Weaponry consisted of the chest mounted Mk II Monobeam  useful range was still only several yards   repulsor rays  a proton gun  and powerful electromagnets to pull metal objects to him or repel push them away  Communications and sensors consisted of a short wave radio  Other features included an image reproducer and collapsible roller skates  Most functions were controlled by miniature electronic switches mounted on the insides of various pieces of the armor such as the helmet and the gloves  by pressing various combinations of them  different systems were engaged  The switches in the helmet were enabled by the wearer s tongue  other functions were utilized with wrist mounted controls  Beyond these features  Stark also occasionally experimented with cosmetic modifications such as adding a nose indentation on his faceplate  or rimming the face plate with rivets  While the appearance of the armor changed only slightly  over the years its technology improved by leaps and bounds  resulting in vastly increased strength  speed  and firepower  Control of the armor was slowly shifted from motion feedback and internal buttons to cybernetic controls  which could sense and interpret the wearer s own brainwaves and respond accordingly  The pacemaker function of the chestplate was also eventually abandoned  as Stark s heart was repaired using artificial tissue  It is hinted that Tony Stark based the new cosmetic improvement on a childhood fantasy  as the red and gold color scheme came from his elementary school s colors  and the whole  Iron Man  motif from the eponymous song by Black Sabbath  4   edit  Armors of the 1970s  edit  Iron Man Armor MK V  classic red and gold  First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   85  April 1976  Armor structure was improved with 3D knitting  In addition  a force field helped keep the armor rigid  The armor used solar power and integrated micro circuitry  A thermocouple was used to handle extreme temperature and convert it to usable power  but it could be overloaded  Repulsors were standard weaponry  The variobeam uni beam was capable of various effects  A tractor beam could be used to pull or throw objects  The most recent version of the armor was able to use pulse bolts  Gyro stabilizers were used in the boot jets  Power pods were capable of various functions such as boosting other systems or being set to detonate  ECM jamming was used to evade detection  A hologram emitter created multiple images to make the armor harder to target  In addition to the sonic emitter  a voice distorter helped protect Stark s identity and could also be used to duplicate sounds  The armor could travel underground  Freon could be emitted and a built in fire extinguisher handled internal and external fire  Finger lasers and a  sabresaw  were available for cutting through objects  Life support was improved  the pacemaker was no longer needed after successful heart surgery  A slave circuit was added to control older suits after the incident with Weasel Willis  However  this was a weakness when Midas attempted to gain control of the armors  Sensors were upgraded with a full band transceiver  infrared  and a  life detector  that was keyed to several important personnel   edit  Armors of the 1980s During this period  Stark came to realize there were several situations where his regular model armor  while functional in most environments or situations when necessary  could not perform optimally  In response  Stark began to develop numerous specialized suits for special missions   edit  Space Armor MK I First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   142  January 1981  While based on the same design principles  this suit s matrix was formed non collapsible to increase its protection from the rigors of deep space  also  its specialized nature made collapsibility unnecessary  Power was provided by a Mk IV micro nuclear supply pack  supplemented by solar power converters  Systems were controlled via a cybernetic interface  though it proved to be overly sensitive  when Stark first used the armor he had difficulty triggering the appropriate command to activate the feature he wanted  The suit was designed for extended time outside of the atmosphere  up to two days in orbit  food and catheterization capable   The life support  boot jets and altitude maneuvering were powered by an on board supply of liquid oxygen  Weaponry consisted of palm mounted third generation Repulsors  electron beams which require laser ionized path of air to travel through the atmosphere  the beam is moderated using a pulsing beam and early form of adaptive optics  objects are jolted away from the beam path by the combination of ionized air and the accelerated neutron beam  and a chest mounted Unibeam  a variable intensity light source usable as a spotlight or a laser  the pentagon shape of the emitter allowed for more accurate laser pulsing while in an atmosphere   and epaulet mounted concussion burst cannons  Sensors consisted of radar  sonar  infrared scanners  and radio  Additional features included ECM against radar and sonar  and the fully articulated hands could be fired out on retractable cables for use as long range grapples  The most obvious feature on this special armor was its ability to attain escape velocity without aid of an external thruster  unique to this Iron Man version  however  the nuclear jets which allowed this made the suit bulky  heavy and awkward in Earth s gravity  The dangers inherent in an atomic energy based propulsion system of such immense power seem to have driven Tony Stark to build the thruster unit which he has been using ever since   edit  Iron Man Armor Model 07  Stealth Armor MK I  First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   152  November 1981  The Stealth armor is another of the specialized suits of armor developed by Tony Stark for specific missions  similar to the Space Armor  indeed  its creation was inspired due to him being tracked by radar during his use of the Space Armor  The Stealth Armor was designed using current  stealth  technology to allow Iron Man to foil detection devices and slip unknown in and out of restricted areas  This sleek  jet black suit  composed of impact resistant carbon composites overlaid on top of layered  flex metal  which can condense itself like a 3 dimensional accordion pleat  was a polarized metal mesh armor that uses every bit of space for detection and evasion components  and therefore was originally designed with no weapons  A bubble shaped  backpack  was also incorporated into the armor to expand the space available for the stealth systems  Most of this armor used solar power to charge the batteries and run most of the integrated circuitry  though the pods on the sides were batteries that could maintain the suit s functions for a short time  It was able to recharge itself from electrical sources  a thermocouple to siphon power from extreme heat or cold  and solar power  The suit utilized force field technology to render Iron Man electronically invisible  a layer of low density plasma would be held in place by a focused magnetic field  and the tripole waveform reflected radar  along with a wave modifier that bent the radar around it  To quash any detectable infrared signature  the armor s boot jet exhaust was  washed  by bursts of super cooled air  The micro turbines on his jet boots possess assisted air liquification devices  rings of liquid nitrogen   edit  Iron Man Armor MK VI  Recovery armor  First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   191  February 1985  After climbing back out of the gutter where he had landed after Obadiah Stane s psychological attack had devastated him  Tony Stark started to construct a very basic armor out of spare parts he asked as payment from the companies he advised  More symbolic than anything  this armor had a strong resemblance to the very first  gray armor  While far more advanced than most earlier armors  it was inferior to the regular model Jim Rhodes was using at the time  It was eventually and unceremoniously destroyed by one of Stane s mechanical pawns  Nevertheless  it served to channel Stark s emotional distress into creative paths and paved the way for the armor that came next   edit  Silver Centurion Silver Centurion armor First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   200  November 1985  Stark began creating the Silver Centurion armor as a method of working out ideas and experimenting  The S circuit  which uses its energy more efficiently  is an example of the breakthrough developed by Stark  using the armor as a model  With the destruction of Circuits Maximus by Obadiah Stane  Stark donned the newest set of armor to battle the foe that stripped him of his business  his friends  and almost his life  The battle with Stane was the first field test of this armor  and resulted in the defeat of Stane and the destruction of Stane International  The suit had a rigid interior and a 3 D knitted metallic exterior  providing protection from physical attacks as well as acid  heat  cold  most forms of energy  radiation  and electricity  A 3 D knitting pattern on a submolecular construction level gave the armor itself more strength  while allowing for the most comfortable suit interior  By expanding the field that keeps the armor rigid  the armor could encase itself in a protective force field that was effective against most forms of attack  Stark could also use this field to polarize the armor to either attract or repulse other items via magnetic polarity  Most of this armor used solar power to charge the batteries and run most of the integrated circuitry  though the pods on the sides were batteries that could maintain the suit s functions for a short time  It was also able to recharge itself from electrical sources  a thermocouple to siphon power from extreme heat or cold  Flight was accomplished via Mk IV boot jets  which incorporated high speed duo source turbines   supplemented by a booster pack that enabled the armor to attain speeds up to 750 mph  1 210 km h  in the air and 180 mph  290 km h  in the water  Weaponry consisted of a chest mounted Mk III Unibeam  search light  heat beams  tractor beam  laser beam  and ultraviolet light beam   palm mounted Mk III Repulsors  laser guided particle beam emitters   pulse bolts  slow moving high energy plasma discharge  torpedoes  that build in intensity as they travel through the atmosphere  picking up static and ambient energy and thus doing more damage the farther they travel   and a sonic emitter  generating high frequency sound waves   Sensors consisted of a full band audiovisual transceiver simultaneous images of the armor  It could also be used to generate a  chameleon field  around itself  the computer in the armor would analyze its surroundings and generate a hologram to make it blend in with the surroundings making it effectively invisible visually and to cameras  Unfortunately  the  chameleon effect  module interfered with the cybernetic controls of the armor  generating feedback and resulting in massive headaches for Stark  The Silver Centurion armor  or a copy of it  given that the original was destroyed towards the conclusion of the  Armor Wars   was used by Tony Stark to defeat the Mandarin  when his Extremis abilities were temporarily deactivated due to concerns regarding his mental health  5   edit  Hydro Armor First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   218  May 1987  This unit was designed for salvage missions at the bottom of the deepest oceans while Stark s conventional suits function underwater  they were noisy  inefficient  and they leaked  The exact composition is unknown  it is assumed to be composed of the same layered  flex metal  micro scale suit tiles fabricated by genetically engineered metal affinity bacteria which assemble themselves in specific orderly arrays and then expire  leaving behind various metallic deposits which form all the metal shapes and micro electronic circuits  A new aligned crystal production process allowed the construction of a large  semi spherical headpiece  as transparent as glass  This unit possessed several ocean specific weapons  such as the electric field of an electric eel  a camouflage  ink cloud  and small  manta ray  torpedoes  It also comprised an inner  Escape Suit  that could be jettisoned from the main suit in case of emergency  this inner suit possessed a Unibeam  2 torpedoes  and the holding bay   Functions were controlled by cybernetic interface   edit  Low Observable Armor  Stealth Armor  Mark II  First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   229  April 1988  This armor was nearly identical to the Mk I Stealth Armor  with two additional features  The first was a camouflage effect  similar to the chameleon effect generated by the Silver Centurion armor  This suit s camouflage effect was entirely manually controlled  providing the wearer with invisibility to visual or camera detection  but only against backgrounds that are mostly of one color  The second addition were palm mounted Mk IV Repulsors  though they only had enough energy to fire three shots at full power  The stealth systems were far more streamlined  allowing for the elimination of the  backpack  on the first model  This suit was utilized by Clay Wilson to fill in for the  real  Iron Man after Tony Stark had been shot  6   edit  Iron Man Armor MK VIII  New Red  amp  Gold  First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   231  June 1988  During the Armor Wars  Iron Man found himself facing the government sanctioned armored assassin Firepower  Against this walking  flying armored arsenal  even the Silver Centurion armor did not stand a chance  and it was destroyed  Reluctant to enter the fray again  but forced into action  Tony Stark designed a new suit  even more powerful and versatile than its predecessor  designed specifically to negate Firepower s original advantages  such as a means of disrupting Firepower s targeting systems  a gauntlet generated energy shield  and more powerful boosters for increased speed  It made short work of Firepower  and Stark was so horrified of the destructive potential of the armor should it fall into the wrong hands  he resolved to destroy it  Fortunately  he changed his mind  The modern classic armor resembled the classic armor which had endured for many years  with some minor cosmetic changes  Its appearance changed somewhat  mainly becoming more bulky  ostensibly to increase thruster power  its massive boot jets earning it the some time nickname  coffeepot armor    It was also the first armor to incorporate a beta particle generator  radically reducing Iron Man s external power needs and boosting his offensive power   edit  Armors of the 1990s  edit  Space Armor  Mark II First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   278  March 1992  A new space armor design intended to function for weeks on end without maintenance  recharging or restocking of resources  It was able to evade the sophisticated sensors on Kree and Shi ar spaceships as well as interface with their technology  It also possessed an extremely powerful self destruct mechanism via its fusion reactor   edit  Telepresence Armor First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   280 Critically wounded by a bullet near his spine  Tony Stark was paralyzed from the waist down  After some soul searching  he designed an armor which would enable him to walk  While his paralysis was ended by the implantation of an organic microchip  this proved only the start of his problems  as the biochip was revealed to be a parasitic life form  designed to consume his own nervous system and replace it with one that could be controlled from the outside  He now needed the support armor even more to protect himself from the people who controlled his body  since his armor cybernetically responded to his own brain  The cybernetic interface and battle computer were integrated with the Telepresence Neural Net  a more subtle armor he used to simulate his degenerating nervous system  While it was still worn as a suit of armor  the functions and muscle control were carried out by the suit  not by the wearer   edit  War Machine Armor  Variable Threat Response Battle Suit  Mark I  Main article  War Machine First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   281 Officially known as the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit  this armor was created initially by Stark to deal with the Masters of Silence threat by using a  respond in kind  philosophy and strategy  It was designed for all out warfare and was Stark s experiment with laser guided munitions and ballistic weaponry  Since the Masters of Silence were protected against Iron Man s usual weaponry of repulsors and unibeam  those weapons were removed from the Mark I model  The armor included several response devices such as a shoulder mounted electric minigun  shoulder mounted missile box launcher  and wrist mounted gaunlet cannons with additional weaponry such as a laser blade and flamethrower  It was not collapsible  and included far heavier carbon composite based armor as well as improved tactical computer systems and automatic targeting  A later version  Mark II Model JRXL 1000  was designed and built for James Rhodes  which became a full fledged superhero identity for him as War Machine  In Mark I model  both the double barreled cannon and the plasma blade were fixed with the flamethrower built over the plasma blade casing  In Rhodes  Mark II model  the wrist weapons became modular and the armor also included respulor and unibeam technology  In both iterations  the shoulder mounted weapons are modular and can be removed and replaced  All further incarnations of the armor were used by Rhodes   edit  NTU 150 Telepresence Armor First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   290  March 1993  Though similar in design to both the Neo Classic armor and its remote controlled counterpart  the NTU 150 incorporated the new SE Telepresence technology  enabling the unit to be operated under full Virtual Control  This unit was not a wearable suit of armor  rather  it was a fully articulated device controlled by the mental impulses of the user via a remote headset apparatus  The remote headset transmitted commands to the active unit in much the same way as the human brain transmits commands to the central nervous system  in this case  it is via a subspace radio connection  lessening reaction time to almost zero   Similarly  the visual  aural  and  to a lesser degree  tactile information collected by the NTU 150 could be interpreted by the user s brain in the same way as normal sensory data  The primary difference is that the sensory data collected by the NTU 150 includes a full range of electromagnetic spectra and computer processed data normally unavailable to humans  while the active devices contained in the unit includes not only analogues to the human body  but weaponry  data collection and processing hardware as well  all under autonomic and voluntary nervous system control  In contrast to traditional robotic devices  the NTU 150 contains no mechanical framework to mimic the action of the human body  the unit s outer shell is articulated by a multiprocessor controlled structural integrity field which allows for a much greater range of movement   edit  Modular Armor First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   300  January 1994  This unit is a drastic departure from all of the previous armors  Instead of a single cohesive unit  each piece of the armor is a stand alone subsystem that can be interchanged at will  As such  while the overall unit is still referred to as the Mark 11  the actual configuration at any given time will vary  The shell was composed of layered  flex metal  which could condense itself like a 3 dimensional accordion pleat  Micro scale suit tiles were fabricated by genetically engineered metal affinity bacteria  which assembled themselves in specific orderly arrays and then expired  leaving behind various metallic deposits which form all the metal shapes and micro electronic circuits  The Modular Armor is rather well known outside of comics due to it being the main armor in the Iron Man animated TV series and Capcom s Marvel vs  Capcom video game series   edit  Hulkbuster Armor  Modular Add on  First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   304  May 1994  The Hulkbuster armor is a heavy duty exo frame  an add on to the Mk  XI Modular Armor  designed for maximum strength amplification at the cost of reduced versatility and mobility  As its name suggests  it was specifically designed for hand to hand combat with the rampaging Hulk  The armor was rated with a lift  press  capacity of 175 tons  During its maiden run  the armor enabled Stark to hold his own in sustained physical combat with the Hulk   edit  Arctic Armor First  and only  Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   318  July 1995  The Arctic Armor was designed to be able to withstand temperatures as low as  340 degrees  it was one of Tony s favorite armors and one of the worst  Very little is known about this armor  Stark used it to travel to an Arctic bunker  It is hypothesized that the armor may have special thermal units for added wearer insulation  It was blue and silver in color  and possessed a unique hexagonal chest beam   edit  Crossing Armor First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   319  August 1995  with this armor  Stark did away with the Modular Armor and constructed a version designed specifically for combat  Its appearance was simpler  sporting rivets as its only decoration  Bulky gauntlets housed more powerful repulsors on top of the wrist instead of in the palm of the hand   edit  Retro Armor First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  1   325  February 1996  This armor s design history is unknown  it stands out because it  out of all the other armors in the armory  was picked by  Teen Tony   a Tony Stark who had been plucked out of an alternate time stream many years in the past to help fight his present day self   edit  Teen Tony Armor First appearance  Iron Man volume 1  326  March 1996  MARK 1  Iron Man volume 1  326   Not a full armor  but only a chest plate to keep the young Tony s heart beating  Was soon upgraded with a pair of gauntlets  MARK 2  Iron Man volume 1  327   A chestplate and gauntlets  but more powerful and with superior shielding against energy attacks  MARK 3  Iron Man volume 1  328   Based on the mark 2  this was the first full body armor constructed by the young Tony Stark   out of bits and pieces cobbled together on a moment s notice  It was created to fight the super cold villain Frostbite and therefore particularly geared at manipulating heat and cold  MARK 4  Iron Man volume 1  329   Finalized armor  like a streamlined  upgraded version of the mark 3  with design elements of model 16  It only partly consisted of solid metal  parts of the limbs  armor were holographic force fields  which were visually indistinguishable from the original golden armor    edit  Prometheum Armor   Heroes Reborn   First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  2   1  November 1996  During the Onslaught event  Tony Stark was one of the heroes who sacrificed himself to defeat the menace  and consequently was shunted into a newly created pocket universe by reality altering mutant Franklin Richards  In the new universe  every person had a new  but complete history  including a childhood  youth and adulthood  and no memory of their original universe  So Iron Man had to be reborn  and he was  this time not as a result of a booby trap in the Far East  but a direct encounter with the newly born Incredible Hulk  His chest pierced by shrapnel from a crashed helicopter  Tony Stark had no choice but to don an experimental exoskeleton  Project  Prometheus Rising  which had cost the life of one of his closest friends before  He had to keep wearing the chest plate constantly to keep his shredded heart beating thereafter  The paradigm of this armor was quite different from the one Iron Man had worn for years in the baseline universe  but the arrangement of weapons  and  oddly enough  the color scheme  remained similar  Its sensors seemed somewhat more advanced  It remained cloaked when not worn  but could join up with the chestplate in seconds when called   edit  Renaissance Armor   Heroes Return   Sentient armor First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  3   1  February 1998  Fresh upon his return from the  Heroes Reborn  universe  Tony constructed this armor which served as a new beginning  combining cutting edge technology with classic lines  The armor possessed energy absorption strips  as well as a  horned  faceplate  reminiscent of the first red and gold armor  and a pentagonal chest beam  Its most useful feature was a completely self contained life support system  allowing Tony to completely cut himself off from the outside world while relying on food pills and the armor s own internal atmosphere if he was in a hostile environment  a feature that came in particularly useful when he was abducted by the Brood to participate in a contest against other heroes  the armor s internal life support allowing Tony to escape infection by the mood altering nanites the Brood were using to keep the heroes too aggressive to consider their situation in depth long enough to develop a means of curing his allies  7  This armor eventually achieved sentience due to Tony downloading Jocasta into the armor  thus corrupting the usual failsafes Tony had installed to prevent such an occurrence happening as Jocasta unintentionally infected the armor with the  Ultron Imperative   a system that would cause Ultron s creations to rebuild him if he was ever destroyed   lightning strikes sustained during a fight with Whiplash providing the necessary  nudge  to push the armor into full sentience based on Tony s own mind  Although the armor s new tactical abilities made it far more efficient than previous armors  able to evade attacks based on past experience with opponents  its lack of human morality caused it to kill Whiplash in its  test drive   subsequently becoming increasingly obsessed with merging with Tony so that they would become Iron Man on a permanent basis  on a more practical note  it also suffered from a power supply problem as it ran down its batteries at a far more rapid rate due to the energy required to sustain its sentience   Although it attempted to kill Tony in a final confrontation on a deserted island  when Tony suffered a heart attack  it reverted to its default programming  sacrificing its own central power source to help sustain Tony s heart  It was later salvaged by the  Sons of Yinsen   a cult who followed Ho Yinsen  to use as a host for Yinsen s brain  only for Ultron to take control of the armor before it was destroyed for good  Tony temporarily returned to a variation of the Heroes Return armor in the aftermath of Secret Invasion in Iron Man  vol  5   10  April 2009    edit  Experimental Safe Armor First Appearance  Fantastic Four  vol  3   15  March 1999  Experimental armor incorporating safe power systems  necessary when it became apparent the constant exposure to the powerful energy fields inside the Iron Man armor were harming Tony s health  Iron Man transported to the moon to help the Fantastic Four  however a malfunction caused a brief battle between Iron Man and the FF  Despite its rough  unfinished state  it still played a vital role in defeating Ronan  the Kree Supreme Accuser   edit  Armors of the 2000s  edit  Outer Atmospheric Armor First Appearance  Iron Man  Bad Blood  miniseries   4  December 2000  A completely new space armor design  It requires a booster rig for takeoff  and has therefore been trimmed down to reduce weight  While it offers less protection than previous models  it is also stealthier and far more maneuverable in space  using anaerobic jets for propulsion  It contains a special compression gel to protect the wearer from G forces  and automatically seals any leaks  To accommodate re entry  the unit possesses a massive  expanding solar sail   edit  S K I N  Armor First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  3   42  July 2001  prototype   Iron Man  vol  3   44  September  finished design  This armor s main difference from its predecessors is its sheer size  the torso and shoulders in particular are massive  Its development  starting from scratch  resulted mainly from Tony s fear that an innate factor had resulted in his previous armor developing sentience  Its appearance also differed markedly from the Sentient Armor  perhaps to make it seem as different as possible  it possessed a circular chest beam  a greatly altered overall configuration  including many  industrial style  details such as external tubing  earning this suit the ignoble nickname  udder armor  citation needed   and a restyled helmet  The armor is powered by a Beta Particle Generator and solar power converters and controlled by a Cybernetic Interface and Battle Computer to enhance reactions when in combat  It can absorb directed energy attacks as well as massive non directional energy discharges  like explosions   It also possesses a new force field  The golden sections of Iron Man consisted of S K I N  Synth Kinetic Interface Nano fluid   a liquid alloy that can be manipulated to conform to any desired shape  It is lightweight but has immense structural integrity  being harder than titanium and approaching low grade adamantium  S K I N  can be contracted to fit into a small container or stretched shaped into another form  The alloy s wondrous properties were developed by Askew Technologies  and the exact elements incorporated into the S K I N  remain unknown  Tony had set up the S K I N  of his armor to be stored in a small container  On his command  the S K I N  spilled out and assumed its default armor configuration  The larger size of the armor accommodated storage of several new systems  including an improved sonic array  upgraded chameleon field  energy blade  missiles and even a number of grapefruit sized  spherical drone units which could hover and fly autonomously  and serve as scouts or remote controlled weapons  Unfortunately  this design had to be abandoned after Ultron proved how easily he could make S K I N   or a human being it was bonded to  jump through hoops   edit  Stealth Armor  Mark III First Appearance  Black Panther  vol  2   44  July 2002  Similar to Stark s earlier Armor  the Mark III Stealth unit was also specifically designed to combat the Black Panther s anti metal vibranium claws   it is composed entirely of advanced composite ceramics and experimental bio neural gel pack circuitry  fused with a kevlar like polymer and backed by optical fiber networks  all of which comes down to an armor which was invisible to electronic detection systems as well as the naked eye  even the Black Panther s  Although the development of Stark s new cloaking technology for the Mark 25  S K I N   armor probably rendered the Mark III unit s stealth technology obsolete  the Stealth armor is nevertheless an effective weapon against opponents such as the Black Panther and Magneto because of its plastic ceramic design   edit  Tin Man Armor First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  3   50  March 2002  After the S K I N  fiasco  Tony once again more or less redesigned the armor from scratch  Improved scanning included GPS and a particle mist that could be used to  mark  targets  The armor  which went through various evolutions  had originally a generally segmented  almost insect like appearance  later  it became heavier  more industrial  and the ultimate form of this armor  through trimmed down  made Tony sigh   It s difficult to believe I used to be able to fit this inside a briefcase   Carbon dioxide provides underwater propulsion  immediate satellite uplinking even from miles underwater was possible  Repulsors were improved with a  crowd control  setting  The armor could also release a  tentatively called   deflector pulse   a shaped force field blasting outward from various points on the suit  Armor could also release a devastating  blockbuster  blast utilizing uni beam and repulsors in concert  but more potent than either  When commanded  the armor could also adopt a hovering  non humanoid  autonomous combat mode  equipped with energy and projectile weapons   edit  Thorbuster First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  3   64  March 2003  The Thor Buster armor was designed by Tony Stark as a precaution against Thor  in case his good deeds went bad  The power source for the armor was a mystical Asgardian crystal  originally part of a new type of power generator that Thor left Tony Stark to possibly use as a new energy source for mankind  Outwardly  it resembled the Asgardian Destroyer  It was destroyed by Thor  its power source undone   edit  Cobalt Man impostor First Appearance  Avengers Thunderbolts  1  May 2004  Used to impersonate the Cobalt Man   edit  Ablative Armor First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  3   71  October 2003  This prototype armor possessed armor made up out of three inch  76 mm   honeycomb shaped tiles  piled several layers thick  Each tile was made of high impact polymer  When one of the tiles was damaged  it popped off and the next one below it snapped into place  Furthermore  the suit used repulsor tech force fields to position new tiles  produced in a  polymer kiln  on its back  It could also create a  storm cloud  of thousands of orbiting tiles around itself to act as  chaff   This armor was originally designed to be used in space  where micrometeoroids provided an impact rich environment  but was ultimately used to defend against a parasitical alien life form which infected organisms and altered them to suit its needs  For optimal efficacy  the tiles were  loaded  with specialized nanobots which would turn the alien s biology against itself   edit  Iron Man Armor Model 29 First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  3   72  November 2003  Tony Stark began using this armor during the time that he served as the United States Secretary of Defense  Standard weaponry including repulsors  uni beam and sonics  Concussion blasts were used against the Hand  Zero point energy was used against Michael Pointer  aka The Collective   Via voice command  the armor could adopt an autonomous  robotic Battle Mode  If separated by magnetism  it could reform and return to Stark  Defensively  a repulsor shield could be extended to protect the armor and allies  Security was enhanced by upgrades to anti tampering devices  edit  Anti Radiation Armor First Appearance  Incredible Hulk  vol  2   72  July 2004  The armor is designed to attract radiation into the armor where it is converted into usable power  This greatly enhances its strength  Through absorbing ambient radiation the armor is able to decontaminate irradiated areas  It also possesses repulsors and a unibeam  Banner s addition was  RG 27   a special compound that neutralizes gamma radiation  Since it is most effective in liquid or gas form  a series of tubes were built into the armor for irrigation  This enables the armor not only to withstand radiation  but also allows it to decontaminate areas  To expose a government conspiracy  the two faked a quarrel over some of their designs  Stark unveiled a finished version of the suit to battle the Hulk  However  Stark seemed to be acting strangely while wearing the suit  A problem with the irrigation system was discovered  The Hulk was able to help Stark shut it down before gamma poisoning set in   edit  High Gravity Armor First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  3   83  July 2004  Designed to withstand high gravity environments  it was bulky  being able to survive long term exposure to at least 50 G  the wearer had blood artificially forced to body parts which would otherwise suffer from the extreme gravity  Unfortunately  the wearer is still susceptible to nitrogen narcosis and the bends   edit  Iron Man Model 30  Extremis Armor  This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  The Extremis Armor was the first that could be broken down and stored within Stark s bones  From Iron Man  volume 5   1  July 2008   Art by Salvador Larocca  First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  4   5  March 2006  After being critically injured during a battle with a nanotech enhanced foe  Stark injected his nervous system with a modified techno organic virus to save his own life  This fused Stark s armor to his body  allowing him to store the inner layers of the Iron Man armor in the hollows of his bones as well as control it through direct brain impulses  The Extremis enhancement has turned Stark into a cyborg  whereby the usage of his existing lockchip  a personal area networking implement implanted in his forearm  is directly integrated into his nervous system  His new armor is no longer a bulky unit which houses its own AI  response server  and miscellaneous interfaces for neural control  Instead  it is more lightweight  constructed of a pliable crystalline material with a molecular structure that can collimate into super hard planes upon the application of an electrical field  and less complex  as it interfaces directly to Stark s brain via the Extremis modified cybernetic connections   and has much faster response time since it effectively functions like Stark s second skin  He is also able to remotely connect to external communications systems such as satellites  cellular phones  and computers through the PAN interconnect  that is now thought controlled   Because the armor s operating system is now directly connected to Stark s nervous system  its response time has been significantly improved  Another major departure from the previous armors is expansion of repulsor technology  The  repulsor flight system  provides lift  something like anti gravity  and positive flight control  pitch  roll and yaw   while the usual rocket boots provide the armor with thrust  The same repulsor technology allows the individual pieces of the armor to levitate and assemble themselves  by modulating what Stark referred to as  vectored Repulsor fields   Furthermore  the Extremis process has endowed Stark with a  healing factor  and possibly even enhanced physical abilities  as he was confident enough to challenge Logan Wolverine to a fight  and even challenging to see who s capable of recovering faster from the other s attack   It was later stated that the Extremis enhancement speeds up a person s repair process and hence the body s cells died and regenerated at a faster rate  This effectively made Tony Stark immune to cancer and gave him his  healing factor   In the Iron Man  The Inevitable storyline  it was shown that it s not only Tony Stark s body and the interfacing undersheath that has self healing properties  Even the Iron Man armor has the ability to self heal and self repair  presumably through the use of nanotechnology  The armor is also able to store power throughout its structure  indicating that instead of having main batteries mounted around the waist as in the older Iron Man armors  the Extremis armor incorporates distributed and decentralized energy storage  Note  Although Extremis for reasons of simplicity is referred to as  a virus   it is not  The Extremis process involved injecting several billion microscopic nanotubes  which act as information carriers  into the brain  The brain is then partly reprogrammed  the so called  repair center   that part of the brain which maintains an  integrity map  of the body  is told that the body is wrong  The physical reaction is that the entire body regrows itself  remaking itself per the Extremis instructions  Extremis itself  the original information package  is not involved  neither are  nanobots   citation needed  After the entire Stark  dataspine   the central data processing center which governed all  or at least the pertinent portion of Stark technology  was infected with a hyper advanced  Skrull developed computer virus during the  Secret Invasion  storyline  Tony lost the ability to use Extremis  interface functions and consequently the armor was rendered obsolete  For the 2008  World s Most Wanted  storyline  Tony used older armors  such as the Heroes Return and Classic Red and Gold versions   edit  Argonauts Sometime after the Extremis transformation  during an attack by the new Super Adaptoid  Tony Stark realized he could command several armors at once  Building on this  and realizing the world was becoming an increasingly dangerous place  he decided to construct a  team  of Iron Men hyper advanced drones that would be under his direct mental command  just as his own armored body  Unfortunately  the  Argonauts  were abused and destroyed before they ever could serve for good  They included   Space Ghost   space flight capable  could reach low Earth orbit under its own power  nearly impossible to detect espionage model  possibly intended as a satellite killer   Submariner   streamlined for great speed underwater  capable of using the ocean itself as a weapon  it apparently unleashed several tsunamis  and was able to overpower Namor  the Submariner  under water   an incredible feat   Adamantium Man   equipped with practically indestructible  Stark Chobham  armor  an experimental composite of carbon nanotube reinforced ceramics  laced with adamantium   Digger   enormous drone  possibly over a hundred tons  equipped with  shielded  Antarctic Vibranium  which dissolves any metal  helmet dome and a specialized repulsor unibeam system which allowed it to tunnel at incredible speed   Hulkbuster II   also a massive drone  ostensibly designed mainly for raw power and toughness  to take on the Hulk  It proved entirely capable of taking on the Avengers  Like its predecessor  Hulkbuster II bore a distinct resemblance to Juggernaut  While extremely powerful  the drones were useless once Tony Stark rendered himself clinically dead   edit  Modern Hydro Suit First Appearance  Wolverine  vol  3   45  August 2006  During the Civil War arc of Wolverine solo series  Wolverine borrows Stark s armor to pursue Namor who is undersea in New Pangea  A new hydro suit is used by Wolverine which reflects the style of the Extremis generation Iron Man suit   edit  Hypervelocity First Appearance  Iron Man  Hypervelocity  January 2007  This new iteration of the armor possesses enhanced repulsors  housed not in gloves but in high strength manipulator waldoes  giving the armor somewhat longer arms than usual   multiple mode bootjets that can operate both with and without oxygen intake  improved structural integrity for the armor  an improved  chameleon mode  and a  supercavitation spike   projecting upward from the back  which apparently creates a sort of  bubble  so that the armor can travel underwater at near supersonic speeds  A massive amount of electrical energy is stored in a spinning  superconductive capacitor ring on the back  The most radical feature of this armor must be that its vastly increased computing power allows it to make a  back up  of Tony s own mind  so that in the event of critical injury of the wearer  the armor can act as him  with all his knowledge  insight and experience  The effect is so complete that the armor  thus activated  referred to itself as  Tony 2 0   After several hours of existence  the armor managed to develop a program that enabled it to function at  hypervelocity    effectively thinking and moving at a much  much faster timeframe than everyone else  Note that this story is set before  Extremis   though it was published afterwards   edit  Hulkbuster Armor MK II In the World War Hulk event  Stark designed a new Hulkbuster armor  in order to battle the Hulk upon his return from space  He does so in World War Hulk  1  and initially was able to hold his own against his foe  The new armor was built as a large exoskeletal shell which fits around his normal armor and is equipped with rocket boosted gauntlets  capable of punching the Hulk back several miles  It is also equipped with adamantium tipped injector needles  which Stark used in an attempt to suppress the Hulk s power with S P I N  Tech nanites  but the nanites failed due to sabotage  see Avengers  The Initiative  4   With the damage done by the Hulk and the entire Stark Tower collapsing on the already damaged armor  it was unable to continue functioning  It briefly re emerged as a host body for the demon Zom  who attempted to use it to access S H I E L D  technology and destroy New York City by shifting it into the Negative Zone  Zom was defeated by the efforts of the self styled  Renegades   Amadeus Cho  Hercules  Angel  and Namora   and the armor was used by Amadeus Cho as a temporary support to shore up structural damage caused in the battle   edit  Mark 0 First Appearance  The Invincible Iron Man  Vol  5   18  November 2009  The Iron Man Mark 0 is the redesigned Mark I  with new operative system  lenses  heating system and coolers  Stark used it during the  World s Most Wanted  storyline to escape from Norman Osborn   edit  Armor of the 2010s  edit  Prison escape Armor First Appearance  Iron Man vs  Whiplash  2  February 2010  When Stark was accused of destroying the Russian city Volstok  where Anton Vanko lived  he developed an armor similar to the Mark I from the feature film in order to escape the prison where he was being held  He ended up using it in a fight with Vanko  now as Whiplash  who wanted revenge  The armor was partially destroyed  but Stark could escape both prison and his enemy   edit  Bleeding Edge Armor Iron Man in his Bleeding Edge armor  Cover art to Invincible Iron Man  volume 5   25  second printing  August 2010  by Salvador Larroca  First Appearance  Iron Man  vol  5   25  June 2010  In Invincible Iron Man  25  2010   Tony creates a new armor in the aftermath of the  Stark  Disassembled  storyline  8  Created by writer Matt Fraction and artist Ryan Meinerding  this new armor is sleeker in appearance  and is featured in the 2010 crossover storyline  the  Heroic Age   9  Disputing the Bleeding Edge as an upgrade to Extremis  Tony Stark commented   Nah   this is what comes next   As such the new armor is a part of Tony Stark s now posthuman biology   it is stored inside Tony s body in its entirety   manifesting  itself when mentally commanded  10  The neurokinetic user controlled morphologic nanoparticle bundles that form the suit reside in Stark s body  and form a fibrous wetweb of iron and platinum  11  that can be commanded to form any type of structure upon Stark s skin  such as large boxing gloves  12  or weapons  including large guns extending from his arms 11  or a light saber like energy sword with which Iron Man was actually able to harm one of the Worthy during the 2011  Fear Itself  storyline  13  The nano machines can even mimic the appearance of clothes  and then dissociate to transform into the Iron Man armor whenever Stark wishes  14  The suit adds less than twenty five pounds to Stark s body mass  and can stop a howitzer shell  11  The armor and Stark s own transhuman body are powered by the high yield arc reactor mounted in his chest  10  The high output of the arc reactor has greatly augmented Stark s intelligence and provided him superhuman level multitasking and learning capabilities  Unlike earlier armors  this new armor does not appear to rely on motors and servos for motion  Instead  the nano machines create a secondary artificial musculature over Stark s body  upon which additional rigid structures are assembled  This also enables the armor to self repair and be almost invulnerable  as the armor is capable of transforming and healing itself as long as the power output from the arc reactor is not interrupted or terminated  when the armor was briefly apparently destroyed in a fight with an alternate version of the Scarlet Witch who was one of Apocalypse s Horsemen  it was restored to normal after only a matter of seconds  although it was still out of action long enough for Stark to need rescuing by Spider Man to stop himself hitting the ground as he fell   15  The suit s repulsors  which are located around the knuckles  chest  back and legs of the armor  as well as in the traditional palms  now function also as cameras  or  eyeballs   which afford Stark a 360 degree panoramic view around himself  11   edit  Iron Destroyer During the Serpent s War  which occurred during the  Fear Iself  storyline  Iron Man journeyed to the realm of Asgard  the home of his fellow Avenger Thor  in order to procure weapons to fight Odin s brother  The Serpent  and his generals  the Worthy  who were ravaging the Earth  In addition to the hand held weapons he had forged for his fellow Avengers  Iron Man s armor received an additional coating of Uru by Asgardian blacksmiths  as well as magical enchantments by Odin  16  17  18  Iron Man referred to this manifestation of his armor as the  Iron Destroyer   for its resemblance to the Asgardian weapon  the Destroyer  Its magical enhancements disappeared when Odin left Earth at the conclusion of the Serpent s War  and Iron Man vented the uru from the suit s molecular structure before returning the metal to Asgard  where it was melted back down with the other loaned weapons  19   edit  Armors from alternate realities and possible futures Iron Man 2020   Arno Stark bought the corporate identity of Stark Industries  and apparently this included Iron Man  Unlike his heroic ancestor  actually  Tony might be his uncle  once removed  he found himself working as a ruthless mercenary to bolster the financial reserves of his company  His armor was recognized to be both more powerful and more combat oriented than that of the twentieth century Iron Man  Decades later  this same armor  although possibly upgraded by Doctor Doom  is worn by Andros Stark  the villainous Iron Man of 2093  Heroes Reborn  Prometheum  Armor  See also  Heroes Reborn armor    originally an experimental self contained  armored life support and combat system  It was a joint project of Tony Stark and Connor  Rebel  O Reilly  but it proved dangerously unstable  and Rebel was killed in the testing stage  The project was abandoned and Tony Stark went into a spiral towards psychological self destruction  Ironically  years later  when he went to investigate an incident at one of his more remote business annexes  his helicopter was attacked by the newborn Incredible Hulk of that reality and crashed where he was impaled by debris  He was forced to don an upgraded version of the experimental armor which had been stored at the annex to save his own life  and from that day on fought on as Iron Man  Later  he came face to face with a resurrected Rebel  outfitted with another version of his armor which had been completely reimagined by Doctor Doom  Iron Man of Earth X Iron Manor   In the world of Earth X  the whole world has become exposed to an airborne agent which causes everyone to mutate into superpowered beings  Tony Stark sealed off his factory complex while still inside  fearful of being changed into a  super  version of himself  Over the years  he constructed an army of Iron Men  intended to be used as a worldwide police force  but never used  again for fear of being corrupted by such power  Instead  he built robotic versions of the deceased Avengers  otherwise remaining mostly passive inside his fortress  Forced into action by the arrival of the Celestials  he revealed that his entire factory was a final  titanic armor  he managed to delay the Host of the immense aliens  but was finally destroyed  Marvel Mangaverse Iron Man   In this universe  Tony Stark vanishes after fighting Namor one last time    and his position as both industrialist and Iron Person is taken by his twin sister Antoinette  Toni  Stark  a former agent of S H I E L D  She expands the paradigm into an entire army of every conceivable form of Iron Man  from flying weapons platforms  one of which is a clear homage to the RX 78GP03 Gundam  Dendrobium Orchis  from the Gundam anime franchise   to 100 foot  30 m  mechas  to platoons of armored soldiers    all of which proves entirely useless against the Incredible Hulk  Meanwhile  it is revealed Tony Stark is still alive   albeit reduced to a head in a life support unit because of spinal cancer  He initially equips the Avengers  Captain America  Vision  Hawkeye and the Scarlet Witch  with four super powerful vehicles  capable of combining into yet another skyscraper sized Iron Man mecha  bringing new meaning to their classic

foreign armies of superhumans  Tony Stark deployed  Iron Man 6   a gunship that might very well be the largest  armor  in any known reality  the flying fortress could be over 1 000 feet  300 m  across   The main armor requires a full behind the scenes support team to maintain and operate at full proficiency  In subsequent storylines like Ultimate Comics  Armor Wars  and Ultimates 3  he has built dozens of armors since the Ultimatum wave  Iron Maniac   An alternate Tony Stark from a world in which the Avengers were drawn into outer space  lured into interstellar battle and effectively destroyed by a warlike alien race  His spirit shattered  he returned to Earth  apparently to find that Reed Richards had planned to take over the world  to date  the exact circumstances behind his descent are unclear   He decided to take control of the planet himself  to save it  and adopted methods more like those of Dr  Doom  killing  among others  the Human Torch  and adopting a bulkier gray armor that resembled his original suit  although possessing far more advanced weaponry than he had back then  including a weapon capable of temporarily negating the FF s powers and a means of escaping from mystical bonds  He was accidentally drawn into the 616 universe  and after an extended battle with the local heroes  initially facing the Fantastic Four and Doctor Strange before his attempt to escape saw him fighting Captain America  the Black Widow  Spider Man and X 23   was incarcerated  He escaped  adapting a hyper advanced LMD into a new set of armor that could shape itself according to his thoughts and form any weapon he could conceive of  and called himself the  Iron Maniac   since everything in this world was backwards from his perspective  this was his way of stating he was sane and everyone else was mad  He is a cyborg  at the least his chest is armored  The Lord Iron armor from Marvel 1602  A Spanish scientist who was taken captive by the English in the war and forced

alternate world where Tony Stark went public with his armor instead of keeping it for himself  the  arms race  quickly completely escalated  with more and more advanced armor being developed by all parties from the U S  government and S H I E L D  to HYDRA and the Mandarin  Ultimately  the worst threat turned out to be Magneto  who was infuriated by the lack of interest in the plight of the Mutants  who were being hunted by Starktech Sentinels  He used his power over metal to defeat everything that was thrown at him  but was ultimately defeated by Iron Man in a towering suit  which

Men  This force is led by an Iron Man giant robot piloted by Tony Stark himself  This huge machine  easily as big as the New Avengers Transformers giant suit  could only be controlled by direct neural interface  so Tony Stark was physiologically injured when the suit was damaged by Wakanda s panther shaped giant robot  Tony s death ended the war and inspired a Wakandan led global peace  In the  House of M  storyline  Tony Stark is still the head of Stark Industries but also the star of the hit TV show Sapien Death Match along with his father  and Johnny Storm  His battle armor for the show is similar to his original gold armor  however  it is then revealed that he was working on a much more advanced armor  more advanced than his current armor in the normal reality  This armor was chunkier  had large wing like jets coming from the back and a cannon on its right hand  It also has counter magnets built in  to prevent Magneto from controlling it  20  In the 2007 New Avengers

media  edit  1994 animated series Iron Man and War Machine in the 1994 Iron Man animated series  As noted above  Iron Man s modular armor was his standard suit for his appearance in the 1990s Iron Man animated series  but with a slightly modified face plate to give it the traditional mouth slit  The suit was redesigned in the second season of the show  most significantly by restoring the  mouthless  appearance of the armor   The season 1 armor appeared in a flashback early on  The trademark of a changing armor remained a constant in the animated series  with the first season featuring the hydro armor and deep space armor  straight from the comics  The second season  however  was when the variant armors became a focal point of the series  the new modifications Stark made to his suit allowed it to shape shift into different forms with specialized capabilities that could be called upon for the assorted situations he found himself in  The hydro armor and space armors were incorporated into this mechanism  and more armors from the comics such as the stealth armor and Hulkbuster armor were introduced  The series also introduced an array of original situational armor designs  including  Subterranean drill armor   Brown and gold  with an arm mounted pneumatic drill for underground burrowing  Inferno armor   Red and gold with pink highlights  this armor was resistant to extreme temperatures and outfitting with fire extinguishing foam  which proved helpful in combat with Firebrand  Samurai armor   Never actually used in combat  this highly stylized armor was blue and grey

Armor   edit  The Invincible Iron Man In the 2007 direct to DVD film The Invincible Iron Man  Tony with Rhodey s help creates a grey and bulky suit of armor in order to escape from China  After returning to Stark Industries in America  Tony reveals to Rhodey that he had previously used his company s resources to create several multi use armors  First  Tony used his Underwater suit to fight off the Elementals  destroying one while sustaining minor damage to the suit  Tony subsequently used a red and yellow suit to destroy two Elementals in a volcano  although there was severe damage to his suit  When he returned to China  Tony used his grey suit to fight the last Elemental  an army of Terracotta soldiers  a giant dragon  and even the Mandrin  The grey and bulky armor that Tony and Rhodey built was similar to the original Iron Man armor that Tony and Yinsen created in the comics  the various armors that Tony showed Rhodey were several armors throughout the comics  i e  the Hulkbuster armor  the War Machine armor  and Ultimate Iron Man s armor   and the red and yellow suit resembles Iron Man s standard suit color   edit  Live action films The Mark III armor as featured in the 2008 film Iron Man  Several types of Iron Man armor appear in the 2008 film Iron Man  the 2010 sequel Iron Man 2 and the 2012 film The Avengers  Mark I  As in the comics  the first armor which Stark builds with Yinsen s help while in captivity in Afghanistan during the first film is crude and bulky  It had the ability to amplify Stark s strength tremendously and protected him from small arms fire  The suit was armed with flamethrowers and a missile launcher  as well as a limited rocket jump capacity to allow Stark to exit the immediate hostile area after he sustained damage to the suit s knee joints during his escape  The suit was also able to protect the occupant from the effects of extreme g forces  However  the rockets failed shortly after the start and the suit shattering upon landing and forced Stark to abandon it to attempt to reach friendly territory  Later  Stark s enemies found the abandoned armor  using it as the base design for Obadiah Stane s Iron Monger suit  although Stane still needed to steal the power supply from Stark   The second film shows that Stark displays the Mark I within his workshop  with the label  Reconstruction   and has it apparently retrofitted with an independent arc power source  allowing it to be operated by other users that have access to Stark s lab  citation needed  The first prototype was based on the original gray suit from Iron Man s first appearance  Mark II  Upon returning home during the first film  Stark developed the sleeker  polished stainless steel Mark II prototype version with improved flight capability  Furthermore  the Mark II was the first one to have a holographic HUD  repulsor technology and to operate with remote assistance from JARVIS  Stark s artificial intelligence   who manages the armor s systems at Stark s command and also have variable control surfaces for active flight control by JARVIS to automatically stabilize the suit in flight  Like the Mark I  the Mark II was able to protect the occupant from the effects of extreme g forces  However  it was prone to icing at high altitudes  which would cause it to stall  The Mark II was then replaced with the Mark III s Gold Titanium Alloy to correct these problems  However  Rhodes briefly contemplated using it  The second film shows that Stark displays the Mark II prototype within his workshop  with the label  Prototype   and has it retrofitted with an independent arc power source as shown when it was operated by James Rhodes in hand to hand combat against Stark in the Mark IV armor  this suit is later equipped with conventional weaponry  thus becoming the War Machine armor  Mark III  The armed red gold Mark III prototype armor was the last armor built in the first film and was built with a gold titanium alloy  a fictional composite used in the Seraphim series of Stark Industries  satellites  to resolve the freezing problem  Like the Mark II  the Mark III has a holographic HUD and to operate with remote assistance from JARVIS manage the armor s systems at Stark s command and also have variable control surfaces for active flight control by JARVIS to automatically stabilize the suit in flight  Like the Mark I and II  the Mark III was able to protect the occupant from the effects of extreme g forces  It was able to withstand small arms fire  an explosion from a tank shell  the shell exploded in close proximity to Stark  resulting in a fall from several thousand feet up   followed by hits by 20mm Vulcan shells and a high speed collision with an F 22 Raptor with only minimal cosmetic damage  In addition to repulsors  it was armed with anti tank missiles on the wrists  anti personal guns on the shoulders that could pick out individual targets  and flare launchers on the hips  When Stark reverted to the original reactor after the second reactor was stolen by Stane to power the Iron Monger suit  the first reactor had great difficulty providing enough power to the Mark III suit  being depleted to around a fifth of its power supply simply by flying Stark from his home to Stark Industries  with the last 20  being exhausted and was extremely damaged in the fight against Stane in the Iron Monger armor  The second film shows that Stark displays the Mark III prototype within his workshop  with the label  Battle Damaged   The Mark III armor s look was inspired by the signature red and gold armors in the comics  Mark IV  The Mark IV armor is the first shown armor in the second film  The suit has a differently colored HUD  Although its full arsenal and fighting potential is not explored in the movie  When it was shown on display within Stark s workshop  the Mark IV was labeled  Awaiting Upgrades  above it  Mark V  Also introduced in the second film is the Mark V travel armor  a portable suit developed for emergency use that is lightweight and flexible enough to take the form of a briefcase that s handcuffed to Happy Hogan  The armor is deployed as Stark is forced into a confrontation with Ivan Vanko in Monaco  By kicking open the case  inserting his hands into the protruding gloves and placing the main assembly onto his chest  the armor folds out around Stark  quickly forming into a full red and silver armor  This armor is shown to be durable enough to withstand the focused repulsor energy of Vanko s energy whip attacks  though it sustained heavy internal and external damage  While this model features the palm mounted repulsors  any potential flight capability is not shown  while in the game based on the second movie it is established that the suit can fly  but it takes all of its power just to keep Tony airborne  preventing him from carrying anything else   Because of how form fitting the suitcase suit was required to be  the production team researched some of the classic comics armors  since they were seen as essentially variations on muscle suits  One specific aspect of an earlier armor was the color scheme from the Silver Centurion armor  21  War Machine  After Rhodes confiscates the Mark II armor on behalf of the United States government in the second film  it is heavily weaponized by the United States Air Force for their  War Machine  project  The Mark II s ballistic weaponry upgrades were provided by defense contractor Justin Hammer  Two weapon pods containing a 9mm submachine gun and a 5 56 mm assault rifle  respectively  are mounted on both forearms  An external 7 62mm minigun is attached via a gyro stabilized arm mounted behind the right shoulder  Enclosed inside of the left shoulder is a 40 mm grenade launcher capable of firing heavy munitions  including a bunker buster warhead  which Hammer personally nicknamed the  Ex Wife   which performed well below expectations when it was used against Vanko s suit  completely failing to explode  The energy repulsors from the original design are still located in the palms and chest  Though Rhodes is the War Machine suit s primary pilot  its internal computer systems were linked to the Hammer Industries mainframe  allowing it to be operated by remote  Mark VI  The Mark VI armor differs little from the Mark III and Mark IV platform  the main difference being a triangular shaped chestplate protecting the arc reactor assembly  The major changes are to the shoulders and legs  and convey a more linear appearance that  according to concept artist and visual development supervisor Ryan Meinerding  make  Iron Man look like he s built for flying   The suit was also designed for the greater amount of fist fighting on the ground seen in the movie  The new model was shown using two weapons not show in previous models  a multi fire adhesive grenade launcher in the upper arm  and a one time use hand mounted laser weapon  powerful enough to cut through several Hammer Drones cleanly in half  The armor retains the red and gold color scheme  but was designed by Adi Granov and Phil Saunders to be sleeker than the Mark III  21  Mark VII  Kevin Feige of Marvel Studios has confirmed that Tony Stark will wear a new  gadget laden  Mark VII suit for The Avengers  22  Arc Reactor  In the first movie  the armor suits are powered by a miniaturized arc reactor  a fictional clean energy source  The arc reactor is also used to power the electromagnet that protects Stark s heart from the shrapnel embedded in his chest  The first reactor was allegedly capable of powering the electromagnet protecting Tony s heart for fifty lifetimes on its own  but after returning home Stark developed a more efficient reactor that he used to power the Mark II and Mark III suits as well  Although Stark reverted to the original reactor after the new model was stolen by Obadiah Stane to power his Iron Monger suit  the reactor had great difficulty providing enough power to the Mark III suit  being depleted to around a fifth of its power supply simply by flying Stark from his home to Stark Industries  with the last 20  being exhausted during his fight with Stane in the Iron Monger armor  By the second film  all of Stark s Iron Man suits are fitted with their own arc reactors  allowing James Rhodes to confiscate one  The second movie reveals that the original arc reactor was first developed some years earlier in a joint effort between Howard Stark  Stark s father  and Russian physicist Anton Vanko  the father of Ivan Vanko   Also  the miniaturized arc reactor that Stark has been using for a power source in the previous version was slowly poisoning him with palladium  When Stark successfully develops a new element   unidentified in the movie  but said to be Vibranium  the same material used in the Shield of Captain America  in the novelization   for a power source of his personal arc reactor  he has a new suit  Mark VI  developed  which is capable of channeling the power of the small  yet extremely powerful  new reactor   edit  Iron Man  Armored Adventures This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  In Iron Man  Armored Adventures  a teenage Tony Stark initially creates the first armor completely on his own  It is similar to the movie version of the Mark III armor  with a less complex design and more red  Once Obadiah Stane s scientists said the armor is  more advanced then anything we re currently working on  and that  it s years  if not decades ahead of current technology   Tony even mentioned in the same episode that he may have  outgeniused himself  when he made the armor   In addition to the traditional abilities the armor gives  superhuman strength and durability  flight  repulsors  and the uni beam   it is able to generate an force field around it  uses magnetic manipulation  and has other various functions  including a remote command system to enable Rhodey to control it from a separate computer terminal if Tony can t   Secrets and lies    a security system to prevent people from opening it when Stark is unconscious   Seeing Red   and a secondary wheeled transportation system that enables him to  skate  when the flight system is damaged   Masquerade    In  Ancient History 101   Stark even creates a pack that allows him to don the armor when and where he needs to  combined with anti gravity devices so as to reduce the suit s weight  possibly based on how the comic version always carried his armor in his briefcase   Iron Man s original armor in the series The armor briefly gained intelligence in Episode 14 of Season 1  Man and Iron Man   Problems arose due to its desire to protect Tony above all  including almost killing Whiplash  like what it did in the comics    by constantly keeping him inside itself  However  like in the comics  the armor sacrificed itself in order to save Stark during a cardiac arrest  The first variation of the armor appears in  Cold War   when he created enhanced Thermal Gauntlets for his armor and used them to help him fight Blizzard  After the fight  he talks about creating Arctic and Space Armor  New armors then appear in various episodes  Silver Centurion  Red and silver  very similar to the original red and gold armor and its own comic counterpart in both appearance and abilities  Stark created it in the episode  Whip Lash   and used it in the same episode to fight the eponymous villain  The Silver Centurion armor made a cameo in  Don t Worry  Be Happy  and other episodes  episode needed  Stealth Armor  Again  initially similar to the red and gold armor  but with a different chest plate and shining cameras on the sides  First seen and used in  Field Trip   It allows Stark to become invisible and undetectable to cameras and sensors  including those used by Stark International  Unfortunately  this function burns up the power cells after a short period of time  The armor returned in  Panther s Prey  with a new design that is almost completely a bluish black with red lights on the sides  more like it s comic design   This version made several cameos in later episodes and was shown exploding in  Tales of Suspense  Part One    though a rebuilt one was used in season 2  At the end of  Iron vs Titanium   Tony upgraded the armor with better weapons and stealth gear  episode needed  Hulkbuster Armor  A heavy duty armor designed for maximum strength and endurance at the cost of reduced mobility  It has the ability to redirect energy shot at it and has powerful versions of the repulsors and uni beam as well as missiles and shoulder mounted Gatling laser blasters  First used to take on the Crimson Dynamo in  Seeing Red  when Obadiah Stane redesigned and weaponized it and sent it after Iron Man  Tony later used it in  Uncontrollable  to fight the Hulk  a reference to its comic roots   The armor was later shown exploding in  Tales of Suspense  Part One    It s designs were later used to create Firepower in  Armor Wars   Tony refers to the suit by name in this episode   It has a slight resemblance to the X Men villain Juggernaut  Stark later used the rebuilt armor to fight the Iron Monger in  Heavy Mettle   episode needed  Space Armor  A mouth less  black and gold armor that has all of the same weapons systems as Tony s standard armor  However  this armor also has extended life support capabilities and an expanded propulsion system on the back  twin thrusters  for long term flight and for flying into and maneuvering through space  Tony mentioned making space armor at the end of  Cold War  and used it for the first time in  Fun with Lasers  against the Living Laser  It made some cameos in later episodes  episode needed  Arctic Armor  A white and gold armor contains additional systems that project thermal energy from Iron Man s gauntlets and uni beam  Also  Tony said the Mark II armor s sonic disrupters were adapted from this suit  It has greater life support functions and generally resists freezing temperatures  This special suit is equipped for long range flight  Tony mentioned making arctic armor at the end of  Cold War  and used it in  Best Served Cold  against Blizzard  episode needed  War Machine Armor  Whereas Tony Stark created the Iron Man armor as a multi environment suit for exploration and rescue  the War Machine armor was created for fighting  The War Machine is as fast as the Iron Man armor  but it has numerous weapons  more powerful and bulkier than the normal armor  Equipped with more powerful versions of the Repulsors and Uni Beam  the War Machine also sports three shoulder mounted missile launchers as well as wrist mounted machine guns and a shoulder mounted Gatling laser rifle  While Iron Man is red  War Machine is grey  The War Machine first appeared in the two part season finale  Tales of Suspense   where Rhodes uses it to bring the Mark I Armor to Stark and help him against the Mandarin and Fin Fang Foom  Rhodey has since frequently used the suit throughout season 2  episode needed  Iron Man Mark II Armor  In the second season of series  Tony creates a more powerful suit of Iron Man Armor  Its design possibly originated from the Extremis Armor from the comics and the first season s Silver Centurion Armor  In addition to the enhanced versions of all the systems from the Mark I Armor  it also has wrist mounted flame blasters  shoulder mounted missile launchers  sonic disrupters  Tony mentions they were adapted from the Arctic Armor  and more powerful repulsors and Uni Beam  episode needed  Extemis Armor  During the epispde Extremis  Stark implants himself with a tech based sample of the unstample  Extremis  serum  giving him superhuman strength  the ability to control all forms of digital technology mentally with his armor  and the ability to don his armor without using his backpack or the Armory  This new suit s outer design is the same as the Mark II  but with new upgrades that include high speed broadband Internet Wi Fi connectivity  superhuman speed  300 mph   and upgraded versions of all his weapons  episode needed   edit  Avengers  Earth s Mightiest Heroes In the Avengers  Earth s Mightiest Heroes series  in which Iron Man is the leader of the Avengers  his standard armors are based on the ones in the film series  In  The Kang Dynasty   he even made special suits for the Avengers for use in the space battle against Kang  excluding the Hulk  who only needed a breathing mask  and Black Panther  who was still in Wakanda   episode needed  His current armored
