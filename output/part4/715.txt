of Anaheim and Disneyland in 1965 The city of Anaheim was founded in 1857 by grape farmers and wine makers from the region around Rothenburg ob der Tauber  Franconia in Bavaria  The first such settler was Daniel Kraemer  The colony was situated on 1 165 acres  4 71 km2   Anaheim in 1879 Settlers voted to call the community Anaheim  meaning Annahome or more longly  Home in the valley  in German  The name later was changed slightly  to Anaheim  To the Spanish speaking neighbors  the settlement was known as Campo Alem n  Spanish for German Field   The grape industry was destroyed in the 1880s by an insect pest  Other crops   walnuts  lemons and  of course oranges   soon filled the void  fruits and vegetables having become viable cash crops when the Los Angeles   Orange County region was connected to the continental railroad network in 1886  The famous Polish actress Helena Modjeska settled in Anaheim with her husband and various friends  among them Henryk Sienkiewicz  Julian Sypniewski and  ucjan Paprocki  While living in Anaheim  Helena Modjeska became good friends with Clementine Langenberger  the second wife of August Langenberger  5  Helena Street 6  and Clementine Street 6  are named after these two ladies  and the streets are located adjacent to each other as a symbol of the strong friendship which Helena Modjeska and Clementine Lagenberger shared  Modjeska Park 7  in West Anaheim  is also named after Helena Modjeska  Anaheim in 1922 In the 1920s  the Ku Klux Klan  at the height of its influence and popularity  decided to make Anaheim a  model  Klan city  In 1924  the Klan secretly managed to get four of its members elected to the five member Board of Trustees  Nine of the ten members of the police force were also Klansmen  The four Klan trustees served for nearly a year  until they were publicly exposed  and voted out in a recall election in which 95  of the population participated  8  During the first half of the 20th century  before Disneyland opened its doors to the public  Anaheim was a massive rural community inhabited by orange groves  and the landowners who farmed them  One of the landowners was a man by the name of Bennett Payne Baxter  He owned much land in northeast Anaheim that today is the location of Edison Park  9  He came up with many new ideas for irrigating orange groves and shared his ideas with other landowners  He was not only successful  he helped other landowners and businesspeople succeed as well  Ben Baxter and other landowners helped to make Anaheim a thriving rural community before Disneyland changed the city forever  Today  a street runs along Edison Park 9  which is named Baxter Street  Also during this time  Rudolph Boysen served as Anaheim s first Park Superintendent from 1921 to 1950  Boysen created a hybrid berry which Walter Knott later named the boysenberry  after Rudy Boysen  Boysen Park 10  in East Anaheim was also named after him  The Disneyland theme park was

Riverside  and San Bernardino in addition to Orange County  The new owner knew the name would help him market the team to the entire Southern California region rather than just Orange County  The  of Anaheim  was included in the official name to comply with a provision of the team s lease at Angel Stadium which requires that  Anaheim  be included in the team s name  Mayor Curt Pringle and other city officials countered that the name change violated the spirit of the lease clause  even if it were in technical compliance  They argued that a name change was a major bargaining chip in negotiations between the city and Disney Baseball Enterprises  Inc   then the ownership group for the Angels  They further argued that the city would never have agreed to the new lease without the name change  because the new lease required that the city partially fund the stadium s renovation but provided very little revenue for the city  Anaheim sued Angels Baseball LP in Orange County Superior Court  and a jury trial was completed in early February 2006  resulting in a victory for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim franchise  Anaheim appealed the court decision with the California Court of Appeal in May 2006  The case was tied up in the Appeals Court for over two years  In December 2008  the Appeals Court upheld the February 2006 Decision and ruled in favor of The Angels Organization  In January 2009  The Anaheim City Council voted not to appeal the court case any further  bringing an end to the four year legal dispute between the City of Anaheim and the Angels Organization   edit  Disney vs  SunCal vs  Anaheim In March 2007 the Disney corporation filed a lawsuit against the City of Anaheim after the city approved a developer s plan to construct 1 500 homes in the Resort Area  a 2 2 square mile  5 7 km2  district surrounding the Disneyland Park  Disney claims that the city breached a contract signed between the city and Resort Area businesses in 1994 banning any housing to be constructed within the Resort Area thereby reserving all land in the 2 2 square mile  5 7 km2  district for tourism and commercial uses  By voting 3 2 to approve the housing development in April  the city of Anaheim thereby violated the terms of the contract  In response  Disney  Mayor Curt Pringle  and Council member Harry Sidhu formed a coalition called  Save Our Anaheim Resort  with the objective of overturning the zoning allowance thereby keeping the initial plan for the Resort Area intact  The highly successful group boasted support from several local politicians  many building trade unions  the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce  the Anaheim Police Department  and the Anaheim Fire Department  as well as 97  of all businesses within the Resort Area  The group collected 21 000 petitions  9 000 more than needed  to overturn the council s decision to rezone the area with the option of either the council turning the decision over or the city hold an election to vote on the initiative  In response  Council member Lorri Galloway  Council member Bob Hernandez  SunCal  and some local affordable housing advocates came together to form a group known as  The Coalition to Protect and Defend Anaheim   Their objective was to keep the rezoning approved by the council as legitimate  and stop the so called  Disney Takeover   At the August 21  2007 city council meeting  the council voted 4 1 to place the zoning decision on the June 3  2008 ballot  Ms  Galloway voted against   This referendum would have overturned the zoning change on the 26 acres  110 000 m2  of land SunCal wanted to build on  On November 27  2007 the City Council rescinded the decision on a 3 2 vote and cancelled the zoning change  thereby eliminating the need for the referendum  The next day  August 22  2007 had the Save Our Anaheim Resort group submit 31 348 signatures for verification for an Initiative that would require that any zoning change in the entire Anaheim Resort District for other than commercial and tourist related uses to be approved by the voters  This Initiative was placed on the June 3  2008 ballot  and is separate from the referendum  On March 4  2008  the city council revisited the Initiative and decided to adopt the measure outright by a 3 2 vote  saving about  250 000 in election costs  since the measure no longer needs to be on the ballot  In October 2007  SunCal defaulted on a payment for the property in question  SunCal has also pulled funding for this legal suit  42  43  Then in November 2007  The Frank Family  owners of the Mobile Home Park land in dispute  filed a counter suit against SunCal for their failure to make the required payment in October 2007  44   edit  Notable people Joseph M  Acaba   NASA astronaut 45
