    is the county seat of King County  in the U S  state of Washington  With 608 660 residents as of the 2010 Census  Seattle is the largest city in the Northwestern United States  The Seattle metropolitan area of about 3 4 million inhabitants is the 15th largest metropolitan area in the country  8  The city is a major coastal seaport situated on a narrow isthmus between Puget Sound  an arm of the Pacific Ocean  and Lake Washington  about 114 miles  183 km  south of the Canada United States border  In 2010  Seattle was the sixth busiest port in the United States  serving as a major gateway for trade with Asia  9  The Seattle area had been inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4 000 years before the first permanent white settlers  10 Arthur A  Denny and his group of travelers  subsequently known as the Denny Party  arrived at Alki Point on November 13  1851  The settlement was moved to its current site and renamed  Seattle  in 1853  after Chief Seattle of the local Duwamish and Squamish tribes  Logging was Seattle s first major industry  but by the late 19th century the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush  By 1910  Seattle was one of the 25 largest cities in the country  11  However  a combination of strikes and the Great Depression severely damaged the city s economy  Growth returned during and after World War II when the local Boeing company established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing  The city developed as a technology center in the 1980s  The stream of new software  biotechnology  and internet companies led to an economic revival  which increased the city s population by 50 000 between 1990 and 2000  More recently  Seattle has become a hub for  green  industry and a model for sustainable development  Seattle has a noteworthy musical history  From 1918 to 1951  there were nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs along Jackson Street in the current Chinatown International District  The jazz scene developed the early careers of Ray Charles  Quincy Jones  Ernestine Anderson and others  Seattle is also the birthplace of rock legend Jimi Hendrix and the rock music style known as  grunge   12  which was made famous by local groups Nirvana  Soundgarden  Alice in Chains  and Pearl Jam  In more recent years  Seattle has been known for indie rock and indie dance music  Contents 1 History 1 1 Founding 1 2 Timber town 1 3 Gold Rush  World War I  and the Great Depression 1 4 Post war years  aircraft and software 2 Geography 2 1 Topography 2 2

for at least 4 000 years  10  By the time the first European settlers arrived in the area  the people  subsequently called the Duwamish tribe  occupied at least seventeen villages in the areas around Elliott Bay  13  14  15  The first European to visit the Seattle area was George Vancouver  in May 1792 during his 1791 95 expedition to chart the Pacific Northwest  16  In 1851  a large party led by Luther Collins made a location on land at the mouth of the Duwamish River  they formally claimed it on September 14  1851  17  Thirteen days later  members of the Collins Party on the way to their claim passed three scouts of the Denny Party  18  Members of the Denny Party claimed land on Alki Point on September 28  1851  19  The rest of the Denny Party set sail from Portland  Oregon and landed on Alki point during a rainstorm on November 13  1851  19  First Avenue at Columbia Street  c  1870 After a difficult winter  most of the Denny Party relocated across Elliott Bay and founded the village of  Dewamps  or  Duwamps  on the site of present day Pioneer Square  19  Charles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location and established a village they initially called  New York   but renamed  New York Alki  in April 1853  from a Chinook word meaning  roughly   by and by  or  someday   20  For the next few years  New York Alki and Duwamps competed for dominance  but in time Alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers  21  David Swinson   Doc   Maynard  one of Duwamps s founders  was the primary advocate to rename the village  Seattle  after Chief Sealth   Seattle   of the Duwamish and Suquamish tribes  22  23  24  The term   Seattle   appears on official Washington Territory papers dated May 23  1853  when the first plats for the village were filed  In 1855  nominal land settlements were established  On January 14  1865  the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a board of trustees managing the city  Two years later  after a petition was filed by most of the leading citizens  the Legislature disincorporated the town  In 1867  a young French Canadian Catholic priest named Francis X  Prefontaine arrived in Seattle and decided to establish a parish there  During 1868 69 he built the church by raising the money at fairs in the Puget Sound area and doing much of the work himself  and in 1869 he opened Seattle s first Catholic church at Third Avenue and Washington Street  on the site where the present day Prefontaine Building stands  The town of Seattle remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869 when a new petition was filed and the city was re incorporated with a Mayor council government  19  25  The corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date  1869    edit  Timber town Seattle s first streetcar  at the corner of Occidental and Yesler  1884  All of the buildings visible in this picture were destroyed by fire five years later  Seattle has a history of boom and bust cycles  as is common to cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources  Seattle has risen several times economically  then gone into precipitous decline  but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure  26  The first such boom  covering the early years of the city  was fueled by the lumber industry   During this period the road now known as Yesler Way was nicknamed  Skid Road   27  after the timber skidding down the hill to Henry Yesler s sawmill  This is considered a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as Skid Row   26  Like much of the American West  Seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management  as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the anti Chinese riots of 1885 1886  28  This violence was caused by unemployed whites who determined to drive the Chinese from Seattle  anti Chinese riots also occurred in Tacoma   In 1900  Asians were 4 2  of the population  29  Martial law was declared  and federal troops were brought in to put down the disorder  Nevertheless  the economic success in the Seattle area was so great that when the Great Seattle fire of 1889 destroyed the central business district  a far grander city center rapidly emerged in its place  30  Finance company Washington Mutual  for example  was founded in the immediate wake of the fire  31  This boom was followed by the construction of a park system  designed by the Olmsted brothers  landscape architecture firm  26  However  the Panic of 1893 hit Seattle hard  32   edit  Gold Rush  World War I  and the Great Depression The Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition had just over 3 7 million visitors during its 138 day run 33  The second and most dramatic boom and bust resulted from the Klondike Gold Rush  which ended the depression that had begun with the Panic of 1893  in a short time  Seattle became a major transportation center  On July 14  1897  the S S  Portland docked with its famed  ton of gold   and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in Alaska and the Yukon  Few of those working men found lasting wealth  however  it was Seattle s business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run  Along with Seattle  other cities like Everett  Tacoma  Port Townsend  Bremerton  and Olympia  all in the Puget Sound region  became competitors for exchange  rather than mother lodes for extraction  of precious metals  34  The boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century and funded many new Seattle companies and products  In 1907  19 year old James E  Casey borrowed  100 from a friend and founded the American Messenger Company  later UPS   Other Seattle companies founded during this period include Nordstrom and Eddie Bauer  31  The Gold Rush era culminated in the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition of 1909  which is largely responsible for the layout of today s University of Washington campus  35  Pioneer Square in 1917 featuring the Smith Tower  the Seattle Hotel and to the left the Pioneer Building A shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during World War I  making Seattle somewhat of a company town  the subsequent retrenchment led to the Seattle General Strike of 1919  the first general strike in the country  36  A 1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused  Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression  experiencing some of the country s harshest labor strife in that era  Violence during the Maritime Strike of 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic  which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles  37  Seattle was also the home base of impresario Alexander Pantages who  starting in 1902  opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies  His activities soon expanded  and the thrifty Greek went on and became one of America s greatest theater and movie tycoons  Between Pantages and his rival John Considine  Seattle was for a while the western United States  vaudeville mecca  B  Marcus Priteca  the Scottish born and Seattle based architect  built several theaters for Pantages  including some in Seattle  The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses  but many other theaters survive in other cities of the USA  often retaining the Pantages name  Seattle s surviving Paramount Theatre  on which he collaborated  was not a Pantages theater   edit  Post war years  aircraft and software War work again brought local prosperity during World War II  this time centered on Boeing aircraft  The war dispersed the city s numerous Japanese American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment  After war  the local economy dipped  It rose again with Boeing s growing dominance in the commercial airliner market  38  Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition  the 1962 World s Fair  39  Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s  Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere  and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading  Will the last person leaving Seattle   Turn out the lights   40  Building the Seattle Center Monorail  1961  Looking up Fifth Avenue from Virginia Street  Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001  when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities  the headquarters were moved to Chicago  41  The Seattle area is still home to Boeing s Renton narrow body plant  where the 707  720  727  and 757 were assembled  and the 737 is assembled today  and Everett wide body plant  assembly plant for the 747  767  777  and 787   The company s credit union for employees  BECU  remains based in the Seattle area  though it is now open to all residents of Washington  As prosperity began to return in the 1980s  the city was stunned by the Wah Mee massacre in 1983  when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the International District  Seattle s Chinatown  42  Beginning with Microsoft s 1979 move from Albuquerque  New Mexico to nearby Bellevue  Washington  43  Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon com  RealNetworks  McCaw Cellular  now part of AT amp T Mobility   VoiceStream  now T Mobile USA   and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream  later purchased by Philips   Heart Technologies  later purchased by Boston Scientific   Physio Control  later purchased by Medtronic   ZymoGenetics  ICOS  later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company  and Immunex  later purchased by Amgen   This success brought an influx of new citizens with a population increase within city limits of almost 50 000 between 1990 and 2000  44  and saw Seattle s real estate become some of the most expensive in the country  45  Many of the Seattle area s tech companies remain relatively strong  but the frenzied dot com boom years ended in early 2001  46  47  Downtown Seattle and a ferry at the Central Waterfront  Seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies  but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games 48  and the APEC leaders conference in 1993  as well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge  a sound that had developed in Seattle s independent music scene  49  Another bid for worldwide attention hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 garnered visibility  but not in the way its sponsors desired  as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself  50  The city was further shaken by the Mardi Gras Riots in 2001  and was literally shaken the following day by the Nisqually Earthquake  51  The UK consulting firm Mercer  in a 2009 assessment  conducted to help governments and major companies place employees on international assignments   ranked Seattle 50th worldwide in quality of living  the survey factored in political stability  personal freedom  sanitation  crime  housing  the natural environment  recreation  banking facilities  availability of consumer goods  education  and public services including transportation  52   edit  Geography   The

co ordinates of 47 37 North latitude and 122 20 West longitude  The topography of Seattle is hilly  Seattle lies on seven hills including Capitol Hill  First Hill  West Seattle  Beacon Hill  Denny Hill and Queen Anne  The Kitsap and the Olympic peninsulas along with the Olympic mountains lie to the west of Puget Sound  while the Cascade Range and Lake Sammamish lie to the east of Lake Washington  The lush green forests and the numerous water bodies have provided livelihood for many hunting and gathering communities   edit  Topography See also  List of Seattle parks  Bodies of water

Shilshole Bay   The sea  rivers  forests  lakes  and fields surrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world s few sedentary hunter gatherer societies  The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing  skiing  bicycling  camping  and hiking year round  53  54  The city itself is hilly  though not uniformly so  55  Like Rome  the city is said to lie on seven hills  56  the lists vary  but typically include Capitol Hill  First Hill  West Seattle  Beacon Hill  Queen Anne  Magnolia  and the former Denny Hill  The Wallingford  Mount Baker and Crown Hill neighborhoods are technically located on hills as well  Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center  with Capitol Hill  First Hill  and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington  57  The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man made  the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center  58  The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island  completed 1909  at the mouth of the city s industrial Duwamish Waterway  The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle  roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St  Other notable hills include Crown Hill  View

incorporates four natural bodies of water  Lake Union  Salmon Bay  Portage Bay  and Union Bay  Due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire  Seattle is in a major earthquake zone  On February 28  2001  the magnitude 6 8 Nisqually earthquake did significant architectural damage  especially in the Pioneer Square area  built on reclaimed land  as are the Industrial District and part of the city center   but caused no fatalities  59  Other strong quakes occurred on January 26  1700  estimated at 9 magnitude   December 14  1872  7 3 or 7 4   59  April 13  1949  7 1   60  and April 29  1965  6 5   61  The 1949 quake caused eight known deaths  all in Seattle  60  the 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly  and one more by heart failure  61  Although the Seattle Fault passes just south of the city center  neither it 62  nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the city s founding  The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9 0 or greater  capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings  especially in zones built on fill  63  According to the United States Census Bureau  the city has a total area of 142 5 square miles  369 km2   64  83 9 square miles  217 km2  of which is land and 58 7 square miles  152 km2  water  41 16  of the total area    edit  Surrounding municipalities

those days occurring between May and September 65  Seattle s climate is usually described as temperate marine  with fairly mild  wet winters and warm  dry summers  Like much of the Pacific Northwest  according to the K ppen climate classification it falls within a cool  dry summer subtropical zone  Csb   with  cool  summer Mediterranean characteristics  66  Other climate classification systems  such as Trewartha  place it firmly in the Oceanic zone  Do   67  Temperature extremes are moderated by adjacent Puget Sound  the greater Pacific Ocean  and Lake Washington  The region is largely denied Pacific storms by the Olympic Mountains and Arctic air by the Cascade Range  Despite being on the margin of the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains  the city has a misleading reputation for frequent rain  68  This reputation comes from the frequency of precipitation in the winter  In an average year  more than 0 01 in 0 3 mm of precipitation falls on 150 days  It is cloudy 201 days and partly cloudy 93 days  65  The location of official weather and climatic records  the Seattle Tacoma  nicknamed Sea Tac  International Airport  is located about 12 miles south of downtown in the city of Seatac  and records more cloudy days and fewer partly cloudy days per year  69  For this reason  official weather and climatic records do not actually reflect the weather and climate conditions of the city proper  At 944mm  37 49 in    in reality  the city receives less precipitation annually than New York City  1201 mm  47 28 in    Atlanta  1290 mm  50 79 in    Boston  1055 mm  41 53 in    Baltimore  1038 mm  40 87 in    Portland  Maine  1128 mm  44 41 in    Jacksonville  Florida  1304 mm  51 34 in    and most cities on the Eastern Seaboard of the U S  Seattle was also not listed in a study that revealed the 10 rainiest cities in the continental United States  This is due largely to Seattle s dry summers  which result in statistically moderate annual accumulations  However  according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s National Climatic Data Center  Seattle is becoming wetter  the current annual rainfall average of 37 49 inches reflects an increase of  42 inches  70  Seattle receives the largest amount of rainfall of any major  pop  gt  250 000  U S  city in November  and is in the top 10 through Winter  but is in the lower half of all cities June September  Thunderstorms are rare  Seattle reports thunder on just seven days per year 71  For comparison  Fort Myers  Florida reports thunder on 93 days per year Kansas City 52  and New York City 25  There are occasional downpours  One downpour occurred on December 2 4  2007  when sustained hurricane force winds and widespread heavy rainfall associated with a strong  Pineapple Express  event occurred in the greater Puget Sound area and the western parts of Washington and Oregon  People blamed heavy rain and strong winds for several power outages and at least four deaths  Interstate 5 at Chehalis  Washington was flooded and closed for almost two days  Precipitation totals exceeded 14 inches  356 mm  in some areas with winds topping out at 130 mph  209 km hr  along coastal Oregon   72  It became the second wettest event in Seattle history when a little over 5 inches  130 mm  of rain fell on Seattle in a 24 hour period  People claim the rain indirectly led to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage  73  Early spring  late fall  and winter are frequently characterized by drizzle  Winters are cool and wet with average lows in the mid 30s  F  2 4  C  on winter nights  Colder weather does sometimes occur  Summers are fairly dry and warm by comparison  with average daytime highs around 72  F  22  C   Hotter weather occurs during some summer days  Seattle s hottest official recorded temperature was 103  F  39  C  on July 29  2009  74  the coldest recorded temperature was 0  F   18  C  on January 31  1950  75  Eastern suburbs of Seattle  such as Bellevue and Issaquah  are typically even hotter when the temperature soars above 80  F  27  C   due to their location closer to downslope winds from the Cascade Mountains and further from Puget Sound  on Seattle s recorded hottest day of July 29  2009  parts of south Bellevue  Renton and Issaquah peaked at 110  F  43  C   76  Between October and May  Seattle is mostly or partly cloudy six out of every seven

Precipitation totals in mm Eighty miles  130 km  to the west  the Hoh Rain Forest in Olympic National Park on the western flank of the Olympic Mountains receives an annual average rainfall of 142 inches  361 cm   Sixty miles to the south of Seattle  the state capital Olympia  which is out of the rain shadow  receives an annual average rainfall of 52 inches  132 cm   Seattle typically receives some snowfall on an annual basis but heavy snow is rare  Average annual snowfall  as measured at Sea Tac Airport  is 8 1 inches  21 cm   77  Single calendar day snowfall of six inches or greater has occurred on only 15 days since 1948  and only once since February 17  1990  when 6 8 inches of snow officially fell at Sea Tac airport on January 18  2012  This moderate snow event was officially the 12th snowiest calendar day at the airport since 1948 and snowiest since November 1985  77  Much of the city of Seattle proper received somewhat lesser snowfall accumulations  Locations to the south of Seattle received more  with Olympia and Chehalis receiving 14 to 18 inches even before noon  78  Another moderate snow event occurred from December 12 25  2008  when over one foot of snow fell and stuck on much of the roads  causing widespread difficulties in a city not equipped for clearing snow  Seattle s daily record snowfall is 20 inches  51 cm  on January 13  1950  79  The largest snowstorm on record occurred from January 5 9  1880  with snow drifting to 6 feet  1 8 m  in places at the end of the snow event  From January 31 to February 2  1916  another heavy snow event occurred with 29 inches  74 cm  of snow on the ground by the time the event was over  80  A very sunny and dry climate typically dominates from May to late September  An average of 0 8 inches  20 mm  of rain falls in July and 1 0 inch  25 mm  in August  Summer thunderstorms are rare  81  The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an important feature of Seattle s weather  In the convergence zone  air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south  Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean  airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle s west  then reunited to the east  When

given night  and many of those live in Seattle  200  In September 2005  King County adopted a  Ten Year Plan to End Homelessness   one of the near term results of which is a shift of funding from homeless shelter beds to permanent housing  201  In recent years  the city has seen steady population growth  and has been faced with the issue of accommodating more residents  In 2006  after growing by 4 000 citizens per year for the previous 16 years  regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by 200 000 people by 2040  202  However  former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60   or 350 000 people  by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle s single family housing zoning laws  202  The Seattle City Council later voted to relax height limits on buildings in the greater part of Downtown  partly with the aim to increase residential density in the city centre  203  Seattle also has a robust LGBT population  A 2006 study by UCLA indicated that the city has one of the highest LGBT populations per capita  With 12 9  of citizens polled identifying as gay  lesbian  bisexual  or transgender  the

the population being LGBT  205  In addition  Seattle has a relatively high number of people living alone  According to the 2000 US census interim measurements of 2004  Seattle has the fifth highest proportion of single person households nationwide among cities of 100 000 or more residents  at 40 8   206   edit  Government and politics Seattle City Hall  2007 Main article  Government and politics of Seattle Seattle is a charter city  with a Mayor Council form of government  Since 1911  Seattle s nine city councillors have been elected at large  rather than by geographic subdivisions  207  The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges  All city  county  and state offices are technically non partisan  208  Like most parts of the United States  government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives  where people can pass or reject laws   referendums  where people can approve or reject already passed legislation   and Propositions  where specific government agencies can propose new laws tax increases directly to the people  Seattle s politics are strongly liberal progressive  although there is a small libertarian movement within the metro area  209  It is one of the most liberal cities in the United States  with approximately 80  voting for the Democratic Party  only two precincts in Seattle one in the Broadmoor community  and one encompassing neighboring Madison Park had a majority of votes for Republican George W  Bush in the 2004 presidential election  In addition  all precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election  including the two precincts who had previously voted Republican in 2004  209  In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress  nearly all elections are won by Democrats  Seattle is one of the most politically progressive cities in North America  with an overwhelming majority of voters supporting Democratic politicians  support for liberal issues such as same sex marriage  reproductive rights and gun control is largely taken for granted in local politics  Like much of the Pacific Northwest  which has the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of atheism 210  211    church attendance  religious belief and political influence of religious leaders is much lower than in other parts of America  212  Seattle also has a thriving alternative press  with two well established weekly newspapers  several online dailies  including the Seattle P I   Publicola and Crosscut   and a number of issue focused publications  including the nation s two largest online environmental magazines  Worldchanging and Grist org  Federally  Seattle is part of Washington s 7th congressional district  represented by Democrat Jim McDermott  elected in 1988 and one of Congress  most liberal members  213   edit  Education Main article

diploma or equivalent  214  A United States Census Bureau survey showed that Seattle had the highest percentage of college and university graduates of any major U S  city  215  The city was listed as the most literate of the country s 69 largest cities in 2005 and 2006 and the second most literate in 2007  after Minneapolis  and tied with Minneapolis for most literate in 2008 in studies conducted by Central Connecticut State University  216  University of Washington Quad in Spring Seattle Public Schools desegregated without a court order 217  but continue to struggle to achieve racial balance in a somewhat ethnically divided city  the south part of town having more ethnic minorities than the north   218  In 2007  Seattle s racial tie breaking system was struck down by the United States Supreme Court  but the ruling left the door open for desegregation formulae based on other indicators  e g   income or socioeconomic class   219  The public school system is supplemented by a moderate number of private schools  five of the private high schools are Catholic  one is Lutheran  and six are secular  220  Seattle is home to one of the United States s most respected public research universities  the University of Washington  as well as its professional and continuing education unit  University of Washington Educational Outreach  A study by Newsweek International in 2006 cited UW as the twenty second best university in the world  221  Seattle also has a number of smaller private universities including Seattle University and Seattle Pacific University  both founded by religious groups  universities aimed at the working adult  like City University and Antioch University  colleges  such as North Seattle Community College  Seattle Central Community College  and South Seattle Community College  and a number of arts colleges  such as Cornish College of the Arts and The Art Institute of Seattle  In 2001  Time magazine selected Seattle Central Community College as community college of the year  stating the school  pushes diverse students to work together in small teams   222   edit  Infrastructure  edit  Health systems Main article  Medical facilities of Seattle The University of Washington is consistently ranked among the country s top leading institutions in medical research  earning special merits for programs in neurology and neurosurgery  Seattle has seen local developments of modern paramedic services with the establishment of Medic One in 1970  223  In 1974  a 60 Minutes story on the success of the then four year old Medic One paramedic system called Seattle  the best place in the world to have a heart attack   224  Three of Seattle s largest medical centers are located on First Hill  Harborview Medical Center  the public county hospital  is the only Level I trauma hospital serving Washington  Alaska  Montana  and Idaho  225 Virginia Mason Medical Center and Swedish Medical Center s two largest campuses are also located in this part of Seattle  including the Virginia Mason Hospital  This concentration of hospitals resulted in the neighborhood s nickname  Pill Hill   226  Located in the Laurelhurst neighborhood  Seattle Children s  formerly Children s Hospital and Regional Medical Center  is the pediatric referral center for Washington  Alaska  Montana  and Idaho  The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has a campus in the Eastlake neighborhood and also shares facilities with the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and University of Washington Medical Center  The University District is home to the University of Washington

information  Street layout of Seattle The first streetcars appeared in 1889 and were instrumental in the creation of a relatively well defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines  The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle  Tacoma Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett Seattle service came to an end in 1939  replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system  Rails on city streets were paved over or removed  and the opening of the Seattle trolleybus system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941  This left an extensive network of privately owned buses  later public  as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region  227  Central Link light rail trains in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel under the International District Chinatown  King County Metro provides frequent stop bus service within the city and surrounding county  as well as a South Lake Union Streetcar line between the South Lake Union neighborhood and Westlake Center in downtown  228  Seattle is one of the few cities in North America whose bus fleet includes electric trolleybuses  Sound Transit currently provides an express bus service within the metropolitan area  two Sounder commuter rail lines between the suburbs and downtown  and its Central Link light rail line  which opened in 2009  between downtown and Sea Tac Airport gives the city its first rapid transit line that has intermediate stops within the city limits  Washington State Ferries  which manages the largest network of ferries in the United States and third largest in the world  229  connects Seattle to Bainbridge and Vashon Islands in Puget Sound and to Bremerton and Southworth on the Kitsap Peninsula  229  According to the 2007 American Community Survey  18 6  of Seattle residents used one of the three public transit systems that serve the city  giving it the highest transit ridership of all major cities without heavy or light rail prior to the completion of Sound Transit s Central Link line  230  231  The city has also been described as the fourth most walkable city in the United States  232  Seattle Tacoma International Airport  locally known as Sea Tac Airport and located just south in the neighboring city of SeaTac  is operated by the Port of Seattle and provides commercial air service to destinations throughout the world  Closer to downtown  Boeing Field is used for general aviation  cargo flights  and testing delivery of Boeing airliners  The main mode of transportation  however  relies on Seattle s streets  which are laid out in a cardinal directions grid pattern  except in the central business district where early city leaders Arthur Denny and Carson Boren insisted on orienting their plats relative to the shoreline rather than to true North  233  Only two roads  Interstate 5 and State Route 99  both limited access highways   run uninterrupted through the city from north to south  State Route 99 runs through downtown Seattle on the Alaskan Way Viaduct  which was built in 1953  However  due to damage sustained during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake the viaduct will be replaced by a tunnel in 2015 at a cost of US 4 25 billion  From 2006 to 2008  transit ridership in Seattle went up by 23   citation needed  and many bus routes in the central part of the city are routinely forced to leave passengers because they are full  Seattle has the 12th worst traffic congestion of all American cities  234  The city has started moving away from the automobile and towards mass transit  In 2006  voters in King County passed proposition 2 Transit Now  which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five Bus Rapid Transit lines called RapidRide  235  After rejecting a roads and transit measure in 2007  Seattle area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 that increases ST Express bus service and extends the Link Light Rail system  currently 15 7 miles  25 3 km  with 3 miles  4 8 km  under construction  by over 30 miles  and expands and improves Sounder commuter rail service  236  A light rail line from downtown heading south to the Seattle Tacoma International Airport began service on December 19  2009  giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations within the city limits  An extension north to the University of Washington is under construction as of 2010  and further extensions are planned to reach Lynnwood to the north  Des Moines to the south  and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2023  237  238  Mayor Michael McGinn hopes to put another transit measure on the 2011 ballot to build light rail from Downtown Seattle to Ballard  Fremont  and West Seattle 239  after seeing a surprisingly large amount of support for it from its campaign  and now city s  policy forum  citation needed   edit  Walkability A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Seattle the sixth
