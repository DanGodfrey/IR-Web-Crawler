State Building is a 102 story landmark skyscraper and American cultural icon in New York City at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and West 34th Street  It has a roof height of 1 250 feet  381 meters   and with its antenna spire included  it stands a total of 1 454 ft  443 2 m  high  7  Its name is derived from the nickname for New York  the Empire State  It stood as the world s tallest building for 40 years  from its completion in 1931 until construction of the World Trade Center s North Tower was completed in 1972  Following the September 11 attacks in 2001  the Empire State Building was again the tallest building in New York  although it was no longer the tallest in the world   Once the new One World Trade Center is completed  the Empire State Building will once again be demoted to second tallest building in New York  The Empire State Building is designed in the distinctive Art Deco style  and has been named by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World  The building and its street floor interior are designated landmarks of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission  and confirmed by the New York City Board of Estimate  11  It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1986  9  12  13  In 2007  it was ranked number one on the List of America s Favorite Architecture according to the AIA  The building is owned and managed by W amp H Properties  14  The Empire State Building is currently the third tallest skyscraper in the United States  after the Willis Tower and Trump International Hotel and Tower  both in Chicago   and the 15th tallest in the world  It is also the fourth tallest freestanding structure in the Americas  The Empire State Building is currently undergoing a  550 million renovation  with  120 million spent in an effort to transform the building into a more energy efficient and eco friendly structure  15  Receiving a gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  LEED  rating in September 2011  the Empire State Building is the tallest LEED certified building in the United States  16  Contents 1 History 1 1 Design and construction 1 2 Opening 1 3 Suicides 1 4 1945 plane crash

John Thompson Farm in the late 18th century  17  At the time  a stream ran across the site  emptying into Sunfish Pond  located a block away  Beginning in the late 19th century the block was occupied by the Waldorf Astoria Hotel  frequented by The Four Hundred  the social elite of New York   edit  Design and construction The Empire State Building was designed by William F  Lamb from the architectural firm Shreve  Lamb and Harmon  which produced the building drawings in just two weeks  using its earlier designs for the Reynolds Building in Winston Salem  North Carolina  and the Carew Tower in Cincinnati  Ohio  designed by the architectural firm W W  Ahlschlager  amp  Associates  as a basis  citation needed  Every year the staff of the Empire State Building sends a Father s Day card to the staff at the Reynolds Building in Winston Salem to pay homage to its role as predecessor to the Empire State Building  18  19  The building was designed from the top down  20  The general contractors were The Starrett Brothers and Eken  and the project was financed primarily by John J  Raskob and Pierre S  du Pont  The construction company was chaired by Alfred E  Smith  a former Governor of New York and James Farley s General Builders Supply Corporation supplied the building materials  3 John W  Bowser was project construction superintendent  21  22  23  Excavation of the site began on January 22  1930  and construction on the building itself started symbolically on March 17 St  Patrick s Day per Al Smith s influence as Empire State  Inc  president  The project involved 3 400 workers  mostly immigrants from Europe  along with hundreds of Mohawk iron workers  many from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal  According to official accounts  five workers died during the construction  24  Governor Smith s grandchildren cut the ribbon on May 1  1931  Lewis Wickes Hine s photography of the construction provides not only invaluable documentation of the construction  but also a glimpse into common day life of workers in that era  25  A worker bolts beams during construction  the Chrysler Building can be seen in the background  The construction was part of an intense competition in New York for the title of  world s tallest building   Two other projects fighting for the title  40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building  were still under construction when work began on the Empire State Building  Each held the title for less than a year  as the Empire State Building surpassed them upon its completion  just 410 days after construction commenced  The building was officially opened on May 1  1931 in dramatic fashion  when United States President Herbert Hoover turned on the building s lights with the push of a button from Washington  D C  Coincidentally  the first use of tower lights atop the Empire State Building  the following year  was for the purpose of signaling the victory of Franklin D  Roosevelt over Hoover in the presidential election of November 1932  26   edit  Opening The building s opening coincided with the Great Depression in the United States  and as a result much of its office space went without being rented  The building s vacancy was exacerbated by its poor location on 34th Street  which placed it relatively far from public transportation  as Grand Central Terminal  the Port Authority Bus Terminal  and Penn Station are all several blocks away  Other more successful skyscrapers  such as the Chrysler Building  did not have this problem  In its first year of operation  the observation deck took in approximately 2 million dollars  as much money as its owners made in rent that year  The lack of renters led New Yorkers to deride the building as the  Empty State Building   27  28  The building would not become profitable until 1950  The famous 1951 sale of The Empire State Building to Roger L  Stevens and his business partners was brokered by the prominent upper Manhattan real estate firm Charles F  Noyes  amp  Company for a record  51 million  At the time  that was the highest price ever paid for a single structure in real estate history  29   edit  Suicides Over the years  more than thirty people have committed suicide from the top of the building  30  The first suicide occurred even before its completion  by a worker who had been laid off  The fence around the observatory terrace was put up in 1947 after five people tried to jump during a three week span  31  On May 1  1947  23 year old Evelyn McHale leapt to her death from the 86th floor observation deck and landed on a United Nations limousine parked at the curb  Photography student Robert Wiles took a photo of McHale s oddly intact corpse a few minutes after her death  The police found a suicide note among possessions she left on the observation deck   He is much better off without me     I wouldn t make a good wife for anybody   The photo ran in the May 12  1947 edition of LIFE Magazine 32  and is often referred to as  The Most Beautiful Suicide   It was later used by visual artist Andy Warhol in one of his paintings entitled Suicide  Fallen Body   On December 2  1979  Elvita Adams jumped from the 86th floor  only to be blown back onto the 85th floor and left with a broken hip  33  34  35  Only one person has jumped from the upper observatory  On November 3  1932  Frederick Eckert of Astoria  Queens  ran past a guard in the enclosed 102nd floor gallery and jumped a gate leading to an outdoor catwalk intended for dirigible passengers  Eckert s body landed on the roof of the 86th floor observation promenade  36   edit  1945 plane crash A night view from the observatory  looking south Main article  B 25 Empire State Building crash At 9 40 a m on Saturday  July 28  1945  a B 25 Mitchell bomber  piloted in thick fog by Lieutenant Colonel William Franklin Smith  Jr   37  crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building  between the 79th and 80th floors  where the offices of the National Catholic Welfare Council were located  One engine shot through the side opposite the impact and flew as far as the next block where it landed on the roof of a nearby building  starting a fire that destroyed a penthouse  The other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft  The resulting fire was extinguished in 40 minutes  14 people were killed in the incident  38  39  Elevator operator Betty Lou Oliver survived a plunge of 75 stories inside an elevator  which still stands as the Guinness World Record for the longest survived elevator fall recorded  40  Despite the damage and loss of life  the building was open for business on many floors on the following Monday  The crash helped spur the passage of the long pending Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946  as well as the insertion of retroactive provisions into the law  allowing people to sue the government for the accident  41  A year later  another aircraft narrowly missed striking the building  42   edit  1997 observation deck shooting Main article  1997 Empire State Building shooting On February 24  1997  a gunman shot seven people on the observation deck  killing one  then fatally wounded himself  43   edit  Architecture The Empire State Building as seen from Brooklyn A series of setbacks causes the building to taper with height  Taken from across the street The Empire State Building rises to 1 250 ft  381 m  at the 102nd floor  and including the 203 ft  62 m  pinnacle  its full height reaches 1 453 ft 89 16 in  443 09 m   The building has 85 stories of commercial and office space representing 2 158 000 sq ft  200 500 m2   It has an indoor and outdoor observation deck on the 86th floor  The remaining 16 stories represent the Art Deco tower  which is capped by a 102nd floor observatory  Atop the tower is the 203 ft  62 m  pinnacle  much of which is covered by broadcast antennas  with a lightning rod at the very top  The Empire State Building was the first building to have more than 100 floors  It has 6 500 windows and 73 elevators  and there are 1 860 steps from street level to the 102nd floor  It has a total floor area of 2 768 591 sq ft  257 211 m2   the base of the Empire State Building is about 2 acres  8 094 m2   The building houses 1 000 businesses and has its own zip code  10118  As of 2007  approximately 21 000 employees work in the building each day  making the Empire State Building the second largest single office complex in America  after the Pentagon  The building was completed in one year and 45 days  Its original 64 elevators are located in a central core  44  today  the Empire State Building has 73 elevators in all  including service elevators  It takes less than one minute by elevator to get to the 80th floor where visitors can take another elevator or stairs to the 86th floor  where an observation deck is located  The building has 70 mi  113 km  of pipe  2 500 000 ft  760 000 m  of electrical wire  45  and about 9 000 faucets  citation needed  It is heated by low pressure steam  despite its height  the building only requires between 2 and 3 psi  14 and 21 kPa  of steam pressure for heating  It weighs approximately 370 000 short tons  340 000 t   The exterior of the building was built using Indiana limestone panels  The Empire State Building cost  40 948 900 to build  Equal to roughly  500 000 000 in 2010   4  Long term forecasting of the life cycle of the structure was implemented at the design phase to ensure that the building s future intended uses were not restricted by the requirements of previous generations  This is particularly evident in the over design of the building s electrical system  Unlike most of today s skyscrapers  the Empire State Building features an art deco design  typical of pre World War II architecture in New York  The modernistic stainless steel canopies of the entrances on 33rd and 34th Streets lead to two story high corridors around the elevator core  crossed by stainless steel and glass enclosed bridges at the second floor level  The elevator core contains 67 elevators  11  The lobby is three stories high and features an aluminum relief of the skyscraper without the antenna  which was not added to the spire until 1952  The north corridor contained eight illuminated panels  created by Roy Sparkia and Ren e Nemorov in 1963 in time for the 1964 World s Fair  which depicts the building as the Eighth Wonder of the World  alongside the traditional seven  These panels were eventually moved near a ticketing line for the observation deck  The building s lobbies and common areas received a  550 million renovation in 2009  which included new air conditioning  waterproofing  and renovating the observation deck  moving the gift shop to the 80th floor  46  Up until the 1960s  the ceilings in the lobby had a shiny art deco mural depicting inspired by both the sky and the Machine Age  until it was covered with ceiling tiles and fluorescent lighting  Because the original murals  designed by an artist named Leif Neandross  were damaged  reproductions were installed  Over 50 artists and workers used 15 000 square feet of aluminum and 1 300 square feet of 23 karat gold leaf to re create the mural  Renovations to the lobby alluded to original plans for the building  replacing the clock over the information desk in the Fifth Avenue lobby with an Anemometer  as well as installing two chandeliers originally intended to be part of the building when it first opened  47  Lighting at the top of the Empire State Building  edit  Floodlights In 1964  floodlights were added to illuminate the top of the building at night  in colors chosen to match seasonal and other events  such as St  Patrick s Day  Christmas  Independence Day and Bastille Day  48  After the eightieth birthday and subsequent death of Frank Sinatra  for example  the building was bathed in blue light to represent the singer s nickname  Ol  Blue Eyes   After the death of actress Fay Wray  King Kong  in late 2004  the building stood in complete darkness for 15 minutes  49  The floodlights bathed the building in red  white  and blue for several months after the destruction of the World Trade Center  then reverted to the standard schedule  50  On June 4  2002  the Empire State Building donned purple and gold  the royal colors of Queen Elizabeth II   in thanks for the United Kingdom playing the Star Spangled Banner during the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace on September 12  2001  a show of support after the September 11 Attacks   51  This would also be shown after the Westminster Dog Show  Traditionally  in addition to the standard schedule  the building will be lit in the colors of New York s sports teams on the nights they have home games  orange  blue and white for the New York Knicks  red  white and blue for the New York Rangers  and so on   The first weekend in June finds the building bathed in green light for the Belmont Stakes held in nearby Belmont Park  The building is illuminated in tennis ball yellow during the US Open tennis tournament in late August and early September  It was twice lit in scarlet to support nearby Rutgers University  once for a football game against the University of Louisville on November 9  2006  and again on April 3  2007 when the women s basketball team played in the national championship game  52   edit  Dirigible  airship  terminal The building s distinctive Art Deco spire was originally designed to be a mooring mast and depot for dirigibles  The 102nd floor was originally a landing platform with a dirigible gangplank  53  A particular elevator  traveling between the 86th and 102nd floors  was supposed to transport passengers after they checked in at the observation deck on the 86th floor  54  However  the idea proved to be impractical and dangerous after a few attempts with airships  due to the powerful updrafts caused by the size of the building itself  55  as well as the lack of mooring lines tying the other end of the craft to the ground  56  A large broadcast tower was added to the top of the spire in 1953  53   edit  Height records and comparisons Height comparison of buildings in New York City  showing the under construction One World Trade Center at far left The Empire State Building remained the tallest man made structure in the world for 23 years before it was surpassed by the Griffin Television Tower Oklahoma  KWTV Mast  in 1954  It was also the tallest free standing structure in the world for 36 years before it was surpassed by the Ostankino Tower in 1967  The longest world record held by the Empire State Building was for the tallest skyscraper  to structural height   which it held for 42 years until it was surpassed by the North Tower of the World Trade Center in 1972  An early  70s proposal to dismantle the spire and replace it with an additional 11 floors  which would have brought the building s height to 1 494 feet  455 m  and made it once again the world s tallest at the time  was considered but ultimately rejected  57  With the destruction of the World Trade Center in the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks  the Empire State Building again became the tallest building in New York City  and the second tallest building in the Americas  surpassed only by the Willis Tower in Chicago  It is currently the third tallest  surpassed by the Willis Tower and the Trump International Hotel and Tower  Chicago   When measured by pinnacle height  the Empire State Building is also the third tallest building in the USA  surpassed by the Willis Tower and the John Hancock Center  On clear days  the building can be seen from as far away as New Haven  CT  Morristown  NJ  and from the roller coasters at Six Flags Great Adventure  specifically Kingda Ka  One World Trade Center  currently under construction in New York City  is expected to exceed the height of the Empire State Building upon completion  It will be 1 776 feet  541 m  tall  becoming the tallest building in the city and the country   edit  Observation decks The Empire State Building has one of the most popular outdoor observatories in the world  having been visited by over 110 million people  The 86th floor observation deck offers impressive 360 degree views of the city  There is a second observation deck on the 102nd floor that is open to the public  It was closed in 1999  but reopened in November 2005  It is completely enclosed and much smaller than the first one  it may be closed on high traffic days  Tourists may pay to visit the observation deck on the 86th floor and an additional amount for the 102nd floor  58  The lines to enter the observation decks  according to the building s website  are  as legendary as the building itself   there are five of them  the sidewalk line  the lobby elevator line  the ticket purchase line  the second elevator line  and the line to get off the elevator and onto the observation deck  59  For an extra fee tourists can skip to the front of the line  58  The skyscraper s observation deck plays host to several cinematic  television  and literary classics including  An Affair To Remember  On the Town  Love Affair and Sleepless in Seattle  In the Latin American literary work Empire of Dreams by Giannina Braschi the observation deck is the site of a pastoral revolution  shepherds take over the City of New York  The deck was also the site of a publicity stunt Martian invasion in an episode of I Love Lucy   Lucy Is Envious   season 3  episode 25   A panoramic view of New York City from the 86th floor observation deck of the Empire State Building  spring 2005  edit  New York Skyride View from Macy s Night view from the same street corner The Empire State Building also has a motion simulator attraction  located on the 2nd floor  Opened in 1994 as a complement to the observation deck  the New York Sky ride  or NY Sky ride  is a simulated aerial tour over the city  The cinematic presentation lasts approximately 25 minutes and costs  52  Since its opening  the ride has gone through two incarnations  The original version  which ran from 1994 until around 2002  featured James Doohan  Star Trek s Scotty  as the airplane s pilot  who humorously tried to keep the flight under control during a storm  with the tour taking an unexpected route through the subway  Coney Island  and FAO Schwartz  among other places  After the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001  however  the ride was closed  and an updated version debuted in mid 2002 with actor Kevin Bacon as the pilot  The new version of the narration attempted to make the attraction more educational  and included some minor post 9 11 patriotic undertones with retrospective footage of the World Trade Center  The new flight also goes haywire  but this segment is much shorter than in the original   edit  Broadcast stations New York City is the largest media market in the United States  Since the September 11  2001 attacks  nearly all of the city s commercial broadcast stations  both television and FM radio  have transmitted from the top of the Empire State Building  although a few FM stations are located at the nearby Cond  Nast Building  Most New York City AM stations broadcast from just across the Hudson River in New Jersey  Antennas for broadcast stations are located at the top of the Empire State Building  Broadcasting began at Empire on December 22  1931  when RCA began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the spire  They leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there  and in 1934 RCA was joined by Edwin Howard Armstrong in a cooperative venture to test his FM system from the Empire antenna  When Armstrong and RCA fell out in 1935 and his FM equipment was removed  the 85th floor became the home of RCA s New York television operations  first as experimental station W2XBS channel 1  which eventually became  on July 1  1941  commercial station WNBT  channel 1  now WNBC TV channel 4   NBC s FM station  WEAF FM  now WQHT  began transmitting from the antenna in 1940  NBC retained exclusive use of the top of Empire until 1950  when the FCC ordered the exclusive deal broken  based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the  now  seven New York television stations to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted  Construction on a giant tower began  Other television broadcasters then joined RCA at Empire  on the 83rd  82nd  and 81st floors  frequently bringing sister FM stations along for the ride  Multiple transmissions of TV and FM began from the new tower in 1951  In 1965  a separate set of FM antennas was constructed ringing the 103rd floor observation area  When the World Trade Center was being constructed  it caused serious problems for the television stations  most of which then moved to the World Trade Center as soon as it was completed  This made it possible to renovate the antenna structure and the transmitter facilities for the benefit of the FM stations remaining there  which were soon joined by other FMs and UHF TVs moving in from elsewhere in the metropolitan area  The destruction of the World Trade Center necessitated a great deal of shuffling of antennas and transmitter rooms to accommodate the stations moving back uptown  As of 2009  the Empire State Building is home to the following stations  TV  WCBS TV 2  WNBC TV 4  WNYW 5  WABC TV 7  WWOR TV 9 Secaucus  WPIX TV 11  WNET 13 Newark  WNYE TV 25  WPXN TV 31  WXTV 41 Paterson  WNJU

race from ground level to the 86th floor observation deck that has been held annually since 1978  Its participants are referred to both as runners and as climbers  and are often tower running enthusiasts  The race covers a vertical distance of 1 050 feet  320 m  and takes in 1 576 steps  The record time is 9 minutes and 33 seconds  achieved by Australian professional cyclist Paul Crake in 2003  60  61  at a climbing rate of 6 593 ft  2 010 m  per hour   edit  In popular culture 1933 Movie poster for King Kong 12 000 brick LEGO model in the exhibition LEGO  Architecture  Towering Ambition Film Perhaps the most famous popular culture representation of the building is in the 1933 film King Kong  in which the title character  a giant ape  climbs to the top to escape his captors but falls to his death after being attacked by airplanes  In 1983  for the 50th anniversary of the film  a huge 90 foot  27 m  tall inflatable King Kong was placed on the building mast above the observation deck as a skyscraper sculpture by artist Robert Keith Vicino  In 2005  a remake of King Kong was released  set in 1930s New York City  including a final showdown between Kong and biplanes atop a greatly detailed Empire State Building   The 1976 remake of King Kong was set in a contemporary New York City and held its climactic scene on the towers of the World Trade Center   The 1939 romantic drama film Love Affair involves a couple who plan to meet atop the Empire State Building  a rendezvous that is averted by an automobile accident  The film was remade in 1957  as An Affair to Remember  and in 1994  again as Love Affair   The 1993 film Sleepless in Seattle  a romantic comedy partially inspired by An Affair to Remember  climaxes with a scene at the Empire State observatory  Andy Warhol s 1964 silent film Empire is one continuous  eight hour shot of the Empire State Building at night  shot in black and white  In 2004  the National Film Registry deemed its cultural significance worthy of preservation in the Library of Congress  The film Independence Day features the Empire State Building as the focal point for the aliens  attack on New York City  The building is destroyed in an extraordinary explosion by the aliens  primary weapon  which proceeds to destroy the entire city  In the film Percy Jackson  amp  the Olympians  The Lightning Thief  Mount Olympus is located over the Empire State Building  and there is a special elevator in the building to the  600th floor   which is supposed to be Olympus  just like in the book series  The building is chosen as Ground Zero for the target of a nuclear bomb that is dropped on New York in the film Fail Safe  In the 2002 film The Time Machine  the Empire State Building is still standing in the year 2030  but dwarfed by several larger skyscrapers around it  It is eventually destroyed by pieces of the moon breaking up  In the 2004 film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow  the building serves its original purpose of being a docking station for dirigibles  and the Hindenburg III docks at it on its maiden voyage  Many films have opened with the Empire State Building  such as West Side Story and The Other Guys  The building has been destroyed in many disaster films such as Knowing and The Day After Tomorrow  Many other movies that feature the Empire State Building are listed on the building s own website  62  Television The Empire State Building featured in the 1966 Doctor Who serial The Chase  in which the TARDIS lands on the roof of the building  The Doctor and his companions leave quite quickly  however  because The Daleks are close behind them  A Dalek is also seen on the roof of the building while it interrogates a human  In 2007  Doctor Who episodes  Daleks in Manhattan  and  Evolution of the Daleks  also featured the building  which the Daleks are constructing to use as a lightning conductor  Russell T Davies said in an article that  in his mind   the Daleks remembered the building from their last visit  In the science fiction drama series Fringe  the observation deck of the Empire State Building serves its primary purpose as a docking station for zeppelins in the parallel universe shown in the second season episode Peter  The Discovery Channel show MythBusters tested the urban myth which claims that if one drops a penny off the top of the Empire State Building  it could kill someone or put a crater in the pavement  The outcome was that  by the time the penny hits the ground  it is going roughly 65 mph  105 km h   terminal velocity for an object of its mass and shape   which is not fast enough to inflict lethal injury or put a crater into the pavement  The urban legend is a joke in the 2003 musical Avenue Q  where a character waiting atop the building for a rendezvous tosses a penny over the side only to hit her rival  In Gerry Anderson s popular puppet series Thunderbirds  the episode Terror in New York City  the Empire State Building is being moved to a new location as the site around it is set for redevelopment  However  something goes wrong and the building collapses  trapping a reporter and his cameraman underneath the rubble  Their
