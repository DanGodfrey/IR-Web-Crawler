information  History of the board game Monopoly The history of Monopoly can be traced back to 1904  2  when an American woman named Elizabeth  Lizzie  J  Magie Phillips created a game through which she hoped to be able to explain the single tax theory of Henry George  it was intended to illustrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies   Her game  The Landlord s Game  was commercially published in 1924  3  In 1941  the British Secret Service had John Waddington Ltd   the licensed manufacturer of the game outside the U S   create a special edition for World War II prisoners of war held by the Nazis  4  Hidden inside these games were maps  compasses  real money  and other objects useful for escaping  They were distributed to prisoners by secret service created fake charity groups  5  Because of the lengthy court process and appeals  the legal status of Parker Brothers  trademarks on the game was not settled until the late 1970s  Ralph Anspach won a lawsuit over his game Anti Monopoly on appeals in 1979  as the 9th District Court determined that the trademark Monopoly was generic  and therefore unenforceable  6   edit  Board The Monopoly game board consists of forty spaces containing twenty eight properties  twenty two colored streets  four railway stations and two utilities   three Chance spaces  three Community Chest spaces  a Luxury Tax space

property on the board shown  is actually a misspelling of the original location name  Marven Gardens  The misspelling was said to be introduced by Charles Todd and passed on when his home made Monopoly board was copied by Charles Darrow and thence to Parker Brothers  The Todd board is on display in the Forbes Gallery in New York City  It was not until 1995 that Parker Brothers acknowledged this mistake and formally apologized to the residents of Marven Gardens for the misspelling  7  Another change made by Todd and duplicated by Darrow  and later Parker Brothers  was the use of North Carolina Avenue  which was substituted for South Carolina Avenue on the board  citation needed  Short Line is believed to refer to the Shore Fast Line  a streetcar line that served Atlantic City  rk 2  The B amp O Railroad did not serve Atlantic City  A booklet included with the reprinted 1935 edition states that the four railroads that served Atlantic City in the mid 1930s were the Jersey Central

Reading  and granddaughter of the B   amp  O   Their track ran from the New York City area to Delaware Bay and some trains ran on the Reading controlled track to Atlantic City  8  The actual  Electric

February 2012  The board cover of the standard British version  In the 1930s  John Waddington Ltd   Waddingtons  was a firm of printers from Leeds that had begun to branch out into packaging and the production of playing cards  Waddingtons had sent the card game Lexicon to Parker Brothers hoping to interest them in publishing the game in the United States  In a similar fashion  Parker Brothers sent over a copy of Monopoly to Waddingtons early in 1935 before the game had been put into production in the United States  The managing director of Waddingtons  Victor Watson  gave the game to his son Norman  who was head of the card games division  to test over the weekend  Norman was impressed by the game and persuaded his father to call Parker Brothers on Monday morning   transatlantic calls then being almost unheard of  This call resulted in Waddingtons obtaining a license to produce and market the game outside of the United States  Watson felt that for the game to be a success in the United Kingdom  the American locations would have to be replaced  so Victor and his secretary  Marjory Phillips  went to London to scout out locations  The Angel  Islington is not a street in London but an area of North London named after a coaching inn that stood on the Great North Road  By the 1930s  the inn had become a Lyons Corner House  it is now a Co operative Bank   Some accounts say that Marjory and Victor met at the Angel to discuss the selection and celebrated the fact by including it on the Monopoly board  In 2003  a plaque commemorating the naming was unveiled at the site by Victor Watson s grandson  who is also named Victor  The standard British board  produced by Waddingtons  was for many years the version most familiar to people in countries in the Commonwealth  except Canada  where the U S  edition with Atlantic City area names was reprinted   although local variants of the board are now also found in several of these countries  see Licensed and localized versions of the Monopoly game   The original income tax choice from the U S  board is replaced by a flat rate on the UK board  and the  75 Luxury Tax space is replaced with the  100 Super Tax space  the same as the current German board  The U S  Edition now also uses the flat  200 Income Tax value and the upped  100 Luxury Tax amount since 2008  In the cases wherein the game was produced under license by a national company  the    pound  was replaced by a    dollar  sign  but the place names were unchanged  Standard  UK Edition  Monopoly game board layout Free Parking Strand  220 Chance   Fleet Street

Monopoly Here and Now  was produced  replacing game scenarios  properties  and tokens with modern equivalents  Similar boards were produced for Germany and France  Variants of these first editions appeared with Visa branded debit cards taking the place of cash   the later US  Electronic Banking  edition has unbranded debit cards  The success of the first Here and Now editions caused Hasbro US to allow online voting for 26 landmark properties across the United States to take their places along the game board  The popularity of this voting  in turn  caused the creation of similar websites  and secondary game boards per popular vote to be created in the UK  Canada  France  Germany  Australia  New Zealand  Ireland  and other nations  9  In 2006  Winning Moves Games released the Mega Edition  with a 30  larger game board and revised game play  Other streets from Atlantic City  eight  one per a color group  were included  along with a third  utility   the Gas Company  In addition

limited to the first fifty people who correctly completed an online quiz  Out of concerns that such methods of qualifying might not always ensure a competition of the best players  the 2009 Championship qualifying was expanded to include an online multiple choice quiz  a score of 80  or better was required to advance   followed by an online five question essay test  followed by a two

cannon for Diplomacy  Early localized editions of the standard edition  including some Canadian editions  which used the U S  board layout  did not include pewter tokens but instead had generic wooden

groups of two or three streets  a player must own all of a color group  commonly mistaken for being called a monopoly  in order to build houses or hotels  If a player wants to mortgage one property of a color group  not only must any houses or hotels be removed from that property  but from the others in the color group as well  4 railways  players collect  25 rent if they own one station   50 if they own two   100 if they own three and  200 if they own all four  These are usually replaced by railway stations in non U S  editions of Monopoly  2 utilities  rent is four times dice value if

begins the game with his or her token on the Go square  and  1 500  or 1 500 of a localized currency  in play money  Prior to September 2008  the money was divided as follows in the U S  standard rules  2 each of   500 bills  100 bills  50 bills 6  20 bills 5 each of   10 bills  5 bills  1 bills Since then  the US version has taken on the British version s initial cash distributions of  2

it requires 32  100 bills and 40  1 bills  However  the amount of cash contained in the game is enough for eight players with a slight alteration of bill distribution  Pre Euro German editions of the game started with 30 000  Spielmark  in eight denominations  abbreviated as  M     and later used seven denominations of the  Deutsche Mark    DM     In the classic Italian game  each player receives  350 000   3500  in a two player game  but  50 000   500  less for each player more than two  Only in a six player game does a player receive the equivalent of  1 500  The classic Italian games were played with only four denominations of currency  Both Spanish editions  the Barcelona and Madrid editions  started the game with 150 000 in play money  with a breakdown identical to that of the American version  Special editions versions Hasbro also sells a Deluxe Edition  which is mostly identical to the classic edition but has wooden houses and hotels and gold toned tokens  including one

player determined by chance before the game  A typical turn begins with the rolling of the dice and advancing their piece clockwise around the board the corresponding number of squares  If a player lands on Chance or Community Chest  they draw the top card from the respective pile and obey its instructions  If the player lands on an unowned property  whether street  railroad  or utility  he can buy the property for its listed purchase price  If he declines this purchase  the property is auctioned off by the bank to the highest bidder  If the property landed on is already owned and unmortgaged  he must pay the owner a given rent  the price dependent on whether the property is part of a set or its level of development  If a player rolls doubles  he rolls again after completing his turn  Three sets of doubles in a row  however  land the player in jail  A player also lands in jail if he lands on  Go to Jail  or draws a Community Chest or Chance Card saying  Go to Jail   When a player is sent to jail he cannot pass GO or collect his  200 salary and his turn ends  If the player is not  sent  to jail but just lands on that space  he is  Just Visiting   incurs no penalty  and moves in the usual manner on his next turn  If a player is in jail  he does not take a normal turn  and may either pay a fine of  50 to be released from jail  use a Chance or Community Chest Get Out of Jail Free card  or attempt to roll doubles on the dice  If a player fails to roll doubles  he misses his turn  If he fails to roll doubles three times  he must automatically pay the  50 fine to be released  While a player is in jail  he can still buy and sell property and buildings  participate in auctions  and collect rents  If a player does roll doubles  he may immediately move according to the roll  but he cannot roll a second time after exiting jail  During a player s turn  that player may also choose to develop properties  if the player owns all the properties of the color group  Development involves the construction of houses or hotels on properties  for given amounts of money paid to the bank  and is tracked on the board by adding plastic houses and hotels to the square  Development must be uniform across a monopoly  such that a second house cannot be built on one property in a monopoly until the others have one house  Although houses and hotels cannot be built on railroads or utilities  the given rent also increases if a player owns multiple railroads or utilities  Properties can also be mortgaged  although all developments on a monopoly must be sold before any property of that color can be mortgaged or traded  The player receives money from the bank for each mortgaged property  which must be repaid with interest to unmortgage  Houses and hotels can be sold back to the bank for half their purchase price  Property may not be given away to another player  A player goes bankrupt  and is thus eliminated from the game  if he cannot pay what he owes  If the bankrupt player owes the bank  he must turn all of his assets to the bank  If the debt is instead to another player  all the assets are instead given to that opponent  but the new owner must still pay the bank to unmortgage any such properties received  The winner is the remaining player left after all the others have gone bankrupt   edit  House rules This section needs additional citations for

used to are not part of the official rules  Many of these house rules tend to make the game longer by randomly giving players more money  Some common house rules are listed below  No Auctions  Should a player choose not to buy an unowned property they landed on  no auction is held  and the turn passes to the next player  This lengthens the game by increasing the amount of time necessary for all properties to be bought and developed  and by reducing the speed at which money is exchanged  citation needed  Free Parking jackpot  which usually consists of an initial stake  typically  500  or  5 million in the Here and Now Edition  plus collections of fines and taxes otherwise paid to the bank  A player who lands on Free Parking wins the jackpot  which may then be reset with the initial stake  if any   The jackpot is usually put in the center of the board  Since the jackpot forms an additional income for players in this set of house rules  games can take a much longer time than under normal rules  A bonus for landing directly on Go by dice roll  commonly an additional  200 or  500   This may or may not include cards that send the player to Go  In trades  players may offer  rent immunity  from their own properties  someone does not have to pay rent for landing on that property  as part of a deal  this can be good for a certain number of landings or the entire game   House rules  while unofficial  are not wholly unrecognized by Parker Brothers  From 1936  the rules booklet included with each Monopoly set contained a short section at the end providing rules for making the game shorter  either by setting a time limit  or by ending the game after the second player goes bankrupt  As well  an additional rules booklet or sheet wm 5  was included giving the rules for a short variant with several changes  such as starting each player out with two properties selected at random  A later version of the rules 21  included this variant  along with the time limit game  in the main rules booklet  omitting the second bankruptcy method as a third short game  Video game and computer game versions of Monopoly have options where popular house rules can be used  House rules that have the effect of randomly introducing more money into the game have a side effect of increasing the time it takes for players to become bankrupt  lengthening the game considerably  as well as decreasing the effects of strategy and prudent investment  House rules that increase the amount of money in the game may change the strategies of the players  such as changing the relative value of different properties  the more money in the game  the more one may wish to invest in the higher value properties  citation needed   edit  Strategy According to Jim Slater in The Mayfair Set  the Orange property group is the best to own because players land on them more often  as a result of the Chance cards Go to Jail  Advance to St  Charles Place  Pall Mall   Advance to Reading Railroad  Marylebone Station  and Go Back Three Spaces  22  In all  during game play  Illinois Avenue  Trafalgar Square   New York Avenue  Vine Street   B amp O Railroad  Fenchurch Street Station   and Reading Railroad  King s Cross Station  are the most frequently landed upon properties  Mediterranean Avenue  Old Kent Road  and Baltic Avenue  Whitechapel Road  are the least landed upon properties  23   edit  End game One common criticism of Monopoly is that it has carefully defined  yet almost unreachable  termination conditions  Edward P  Parker  a former president of Parker Brothers  is quoted as saying   We always felt that forty five minutes was about the right length for a game  but Monopoly could go on for hours  Also  a game was supposed to have a definite end somewhere  In Monopoly you kept going around and around   24  However  the problem of time can be resolved by playing with a time limit and counting each player s net worth when the time is up  In fact  tournament play calls for a 90 minute time limit  citation needed  Two hour time limits are used for international play  citation needed  The Lord of the Rings edition gives players the option of creating a random time limit using the included One Ring token and specialized dice  The SpongeBob SquarePants game board includes a Plankton piece that moves every time someone rolls a 1 with the dice  if a player rolls two 1s  the Plankton piece moves two spaces   and the game is over when it reaches the end of the board  citation needed  Hasbro states that the longest game of Monopoly ever played lasted 1 680 hours  70 days or 10 weeks or 2  months   citation needed   edit  Add ons Numerous add ons have been made for Monopoly  both before its commercialization and after  Three such official add ons are discussed below   edit  Stock Exchange The original Stock Exchange add on was published by Capitol Novelty Co  of Rensselaer  New York in early 1936  It was marketed as an add on for Monopoly  Finance  or Easy Money games  Shortly after Capitol Novelty introduced Stock Exchange  Parker Brothers bought it from them then marketed their own slightly redesigned version as an add on specifically for their  new  Monopoly game and it is known that the Parker Brothers version was available in June  1936  The Free Parking square is covered over by a new Stock Exchange space and the add on included three Chance and three Community Chest cards directing the player to  Advance to Stock Exchange   25  The Stock Exchange add on was later redesigned and rereleased in 1992 under license by Chessex  this time including a larger number of new Chance and Community Chest cards  This version included ten new Chance cards  five  Advance to Stock Exchange  and five other related cards  and eleven new Community Chest cards  five  Advance to Stock Exchange  and six other related cards  26  the regular Community Chest card  From sale of stock you get  45  is removed from play when using these cards   Many of the original rules applied to this new version  in fact  one optional play choice allows for playing in the original form by only adding the  Advance to Stock Exchange  cards to each deck   citation needed  A Monopoly Stock Exchange Edition was released in 2001  although not in the US   this time adding an electronic calculator like device to keep track of the complex stock figures  This was a full edition  not just an add on  that came with its own board  money and playing pieces  Properties on the board were replaced by companies on which shares could be floated  and offices and home offices  instead of houses and hotels  could be built  27   edit  Playmaster Playmaster  another official add on  released in 1982  was an electronic device that kept track of all player movement and dice rolls as well as what properties are still available  It then uses this information to call random auctions and mortgages that are advantageous for some players and a punishment for others  making it easier to free up cards of a color group  It also plays eight short tunes when key game functions occur  for example when a player lands on a railroad it plays I ve Been Working on the Railroad  28   edit  Speed Die This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   February 2012  In 2007  Parker Brothers began releasing its standard version of Monopoly with a new addition to gameplay the Speed Die  First included in Winning Moves  Monopoly  The Mega Edition variant  this third die alters gameplay by allowing players to increase their move up to 3 spaces  rolling one of the 3 numbered sides   move immediately to the next unowned property OR

one die to move  i e  A roll of 1 5 BUS would let the player choose from moving 1  5 or 6 spaces   or even move directly to any space on the board  rolling a triple all three dice showing the same 1  2  or 3   Usage of the die in the regular game differs slightly from use in the Mega Edition  i e  Players use the Speed Die from the beginning in Mega  players can only use the Speed Die in the regular game AFTER their first time going past GO    edit  Spinoffs  edit  Other games Besides the many variants of the actual game  and the Monopoly Junior spin off  released in either video game or computer game formats  e g  Windows based PC  Macintosh  Game Boy  Super Nintendo  Game Boy Advance  Satellaview  Sega Genesis  Commodore 64  etc    two spin off computer games have been created  29  An electronic handheld version was marketed from 1997 2001  30  Parker Brothers and its licensees have also sold several spin offs of Monopoly  These are not add ons  as they do not function as an
