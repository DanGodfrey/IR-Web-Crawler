programming  The channel was launched on October 1  1992  after Turner purchased the animation studio Hanna Barbera Productions in 1991  It was served as a 24 hour outlet for classic animation properties from the Turner Broadcasting libraries and was all ages oriented  but now the channel serves as a platform for the up  amp  rising animation medium with various programmes catering to both adult and child audiences respectively  It also broadcasts many shows  ranging from action to animated comedy  Original series started in 1994 with Space Ghost Coast to Coast  along with Cartoon Cartoons original programmings like Dexter s Laboratory  Johnny Bravo  Cow and Chicken  I Am Weasel  The Powerpuff Girls  Sheep in the Big City  Ed  Edd n Eddy  Courage the Cowardly Dog and Mike  Lu

cards  some promotional bumpers  on Boomerang  In 1986  Ted Turner s cable TV conglomerate acquired most of the pre May 1986 MGM film and television library 1   which also included Gilligan s Island and its animated spin offs  the U S  rights to a majority of the RKO Radio Pictures library  and the Associated Artists Productions catalog which includes the pre 1950 Warner Bros  feature films  the pre September 1948 Warner Bros  short subjects  the Harman and Ising Merrie Melodies except Lady  Play Your Mandolin   the pre August 1948 color Warner Bros  cartoons  and the Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios Popeye cartoons released by Paramount Pictures   On October 3  1988  its cable channel Turner Network Television was launched and had gained an audience with its film library 2   In 1991  it purchased animation studio Hanna Barbera Productions and acquired its large library as well as most of the Ruby Spears library 3    edit  Launch At 12PM ET on October 1  1992  Cartoon Network was launched as an outlet for Turner s considerable library of animation  and the initial programming on the channel consisted exclusively of reruns of classic Warner Bros  cartoons  the pre August 1948 Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies   the 1933 1957 Popeye cartoons  MGM cartoons  and Hanna Barbera cartoons  citation needed  At first  cable providers in New York City  Philadelphia  Washington D C   and Detroit carried the channel 4   By the time the network launched  Cartoon Network had a 8 500 hour cartoon library 5   From its launch until 1995  the network s announcers said the network s name with the word  The  added before  Cartoon Network   thus calling the network  The Cartoon Network   Cartoon Network was not the first cable channel to have relied on cartoons to attract an audience  Nickelodeon had paved the way in the 1980s  On August 11  1991  Nickelodeon had launched three  high profile  animated series  Doug  The Ren  amp  Stimpy Show  and Rugrats  further signifying the importance of cartoons in its programming  The Disney Channel and the Family Channel had also included animated shows in their programming  In each of these cases  until 11 59AM ET on October 1  1992  cartoons were only broadcast during the morning or the early afternoon  Prime time and late night television hours were reserved for live action programs  following the assumption that television animation could only attract child audiences  while Cartoon Network was a 24 hour single genre channel with animation as its main theme  Turner Broadcasting System had defied conventional wisdom before by launching CNN  a channel providing 24 hours news coverage  The concept was previously thought unlikely to attract a sufficient audience to be particularly profitable  however the CNN experiment had been successful and Turner could hope that the Network would also find success 6   Initially  the channel would broadcast cartoons 24 7  Most of the short cartoons were aired in half hour or hour long packages  usually separated by character or studio Down Wit  Droopy D aired old Droopy Dog shorts  The Tom and Jerry Show presented the classic cat and mouse team  and Bugs and Daffy Tonight provided classic Looney Tunes shorts  Late Night Black and White showed early black and white cartoons  mostly from the Fleischer Studios and Walter Lantz cartoons from 1930s   and ToonHeads  which would show three shorts with a similar theme and provide trivia about the cartoons  citation needed  There was also an afternoon cartoon block called High Noon Toons which was hosted by cowboy hand puppets  an example of the simplicity and imagination the network had in the early years   The majority of the classic animation that was shown on Cartoon Network no longer airs on a regular basis  with the exception of Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes  The first challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems  When launched in October 1992  the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems  However  it benefited from package deals  New subscribers to sister stations TNT and WTBS could also get access to Cartoon Network through such deals  The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it  By the end of 1994  Cartoon Network had become  the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States  6    edit  Series For the first few years of Cartoon Network s existence  programming meant for Cartoon Network would also be simulcast on TBS and or TNT in order to increase the shows   and Cartoon Network s  exposure  examples include The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest  Cartoon Planet  and 2 Stupid Dogs  The network s first exclusive original show was The Moxy Show  produced by Hanna Barbera Cartoons  and was first aired in 1993  citation needed  The first series produced by Cartoon Network was Space Ghost Coast to Coast  1994   but the show mostly consisted of  recycled animation cels  from the archives of Hanna Barbera  being an ironic deconstruction of a talk show  It featured live action guests  mostly consisting of celebrities which were past their prime or counterculture figures  A running gag was that the production cost was dubbed  minimal   The series found its audience among young adults who appreciated its  hip  perspective 7   Kevin Sandler considered that Space Ghost Coast to Coast was instrumental in establishing Cartoon Network s appeal to older audiences  Space Ghost  a 1960s superhero by Hanna Barbera  was recast as the star of a talk show parody  This was arguably the first time the Network revived a  classic animated icon  in an entirely new context for comedic purposes  Grown ups who had ceased enjoying the original takes on the characters could find amusement in the  new ironic and self referential context  for them  Promotional shorts such as the  Scooby Doo Project   a parody of the The Blair Witch Project  gave similar treatments to the Scooby gang 8   However  there were less successful efforts at such revivals  A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith and Boo Boo Runs Wild  1999  featured new takes on Yogi Bear s supporting cast by John Kricfalusi  Their  tasteless  humor  sexual content and lack of respect for the source material was rather out of place among the rest of the Cartoon Network shows  These shorts do not seem to have much of a fan following and the network rarely found a place for them in its programming 9   In 1994  Hanna Barbera s new division Cartoon Network Studios was founded and started production on What A Cartoon   promotionally known as World Premiere Toons   This show debuted in 1995  offering original animated shorts commissioned from Hanna Barbera and various independent animators  The Network promoted the series as an attempt to return to the  classic days  of studio animation  offering full animator control  high budgets  and no limited animation  The project was spearheaded by several Cartoon Network executives  plus John Kricfalusi and Fred Seibert  Kricfalusi was the creator of The Ren  amp  Stimpy Show and served as an advisor to the Network  while Seibert was formerly one of the driving forces behind Nicktoons and would go on to produce the similar animation anthology series Oh  Yeah  Cartoons and Random Cartoons 7  10   Cartoon Network was able to assess the potential of certain shorts to serve as pilots for spin off series and signed contracts with their creators to create ongoing series 7   Dexter s Laboratory was the most popular short series according to a vote held in 1995 and eventually became the first spin off of What A Cartoon  in 1996  Three more series based on shorts debuted in 1997  Johnny Bravo  Cow and Chicken  and I Am Weasel  the latter two as segments of the same show  later  I Am Weasel was separated and got its own show   These were followed by The Powerpuff Girls in 1998 and concluded with Courage the Cowardly Dog and Mike  Lu  amp  Og in 1999 7  10  11   The unrelated series Ed  Edd n Eddy was also launched in 1999 6   These original series were intended to appeal to a wider audience than the average Saturday morning cartoon  Linda Simensky  vice president of original animation  reminded adults and teenage girls that cartoons could appeal to them as well  Kevin Sandler s article of them claimed that these cartoons were both less  bawdy  than their counterparts at Comedy Central and less  socially responsible  than their counterparts at Nickelodeon  Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness  high exaggeration  and self consciousness of the overall output  while each individual series manage 8    edit  Expansion In 1996  Turner merged with Time Warner 12   This consolidated ownership of all the Warner Bros  cartoons  so now post July 1948 and the former Sunset owned black and white cartoons  which Warner Brothers had reacquired in the 1960s  releases were being shown on the network  Although most of the post July 1948 cartoons were still contracted to be shown on Nickelodeon  the network wouldn t air them until September 1999  Newer animated productions by Warner Bros  also started appearing on the network mostly reruns of shows that had aired on Kids  WB  plus certain new programs such as Justice League citation needed   Cartoon Network s programming wouldn t be available in Canada until 1997  when a Canadian specialty network entitled Teletoon and its French language counterpart launched   edit  2000s Adult Swim debuted on September 2  2001 with an episode of Home Movies  Adult Swim was also where Harvey Birdman  Attorney at Law  Sealab 2021  and Aqua Teen Hunger Force made their official debuts  although they first aired in December 2000  while Space Ghost Coast to Coast was on hiatus  The first theatrical film The Powerpuff Girls Movie was released on July 3  2002  which received mixed to positive reviews by critics  The second Cartoon Network logo used in various forms different colors different styles from June 14  2004 to May 28  2010  The logo can still be seen in Cartoon Network when it is airing a Chowder episode   Gazpacho Stands Up   A Taste of Marzipan   The segment  Gazpacho Stands Up  used this logo in a fourth wall gag  The gag was not removed from the segment  and can still be seen on it  this results in it being in conjunction with the current Cartoon Network logo   At 5AM ET on the morning of June 14  2004  Cartoon Network debuted its second logo with a new theme and new bumpers  designed by Animal Logic  and its slogan   This is Cartoon Network   13   The bumpers now featured 2D cartoon characters from their shows interacting in a CGI city composed of sets from their shows  By now  nearly all of Cartoon Network s classic cartoon programming had been relocated to its sister network Boomerang to make way for new programming  Jim Samples  president of the Cartoon Network since August 2001  resigned on February 9  2007 due to the 2007 Boston bomb scare 14  15   Following Samples s resignation  Stuart Snyder was named his successor 16   On September 1  2007  the network look was revamped  and bumpers and station identification were themed to The Hives song Fall is Just Something That Grown Ups Invented  On October 15  2007  the channel began broadcasting in 1080i high definition 17   Every October since 2007  Cartoon Network would air 40 episodes of the former Fox Kids program Goosebumps  though Cartoon Network lost the rights to the show on October 31  2009 and stopped airing the program citation needed   Starting in the end of 2007  the network has also began to air some imported programs from Teletoon such as George of the Jungle  Atomic Betty  6teen  Chaotic  Bakugan Battle Brawlers  Stoked  Total Drama Island and its successors Total Drama Action and Total Drama World Tour  Cartoon Network announced at its 2008 Upfront that it was working on a new project called Cartoonstitute  which was headed by animators Craig McCracken as executive producer and Rob Renzetti as supervising producer  Both reported to Rob Scorcher  who created the idea  It would have worked similar to What A Cartoon   by creating at least 150 pieces of animation within 20 months 18   Cartoonstitute was eventually cancelled citation needed   and out of all the shorts  two Regular Show and Secret Mountain Fort Awesome were selected  after animator Craig McCracken  the creator of The Powerpuff Girls and Foster s Home for Imaginary Friends  eventually left the network after 15 years in 2009 citation needed   On September 20  2008  Cartoon Network ended Toonami after its 11 year run 19   Beginning May 25  2008  Cartoon Network began airing animated shorts  called Wedgies  to fill in spots between two programs  On July 14  2008  the network took on a newer look created by Tristan Eaton and was animated by Crew972  The bumpers of that era had white  faceless characters called Noods  based on the DIY toy  Munny  The standard network logo was then completely white  adopting different colors based on the occasion in the same style 20   On Saturday September 20  2008 21  Cartoon Network ended Toonami after it s eleven year run on the network  At the end of Toonami s final airing  the host  TOM  voiced by Steven Blum   ended the block with its final monologue 22   In June 2009  a block of live action reality shows  The Othersiders  Survive This  BrainRush  Destroy Build Destroy  Dude  What Would Happen and Bobb e Says  began airing in a programming block promoted as CN Real 23   The network also aired some limited sports programming  including basketball recaps and Slamball games  during the commercials   edit  2010s A new identity for the network was introduced on May 29  2010  along with a new theme and new bumpers  The network s current branding  designed by Brand New School  makes heavy use of the black and white checkerboard which made up the network s first logo  as well as various CMYK color variations and various patterns  Since December 27  2010  Adult Swim began starting 1 hour earlier at 9 PM 24   In February 2011  Cartoon Network aired their first sports award show  called Hall of Game Awards  hosted by Tony Hawk  The second Hall of Games Awards aired February 20  2012 was hosted by Shaquille O Neal  At its 2011 upfront  Cartoon Network announced 14 new series  including The Problem Solverz  formerly known as Neon Knome  The Looney Tunes Show  Secret Mountain Fort Awesome  Level Up  a

on October 1st the eve of the 20th anniversary of Cartoon Network  On March 18  2012  Cartoon Network aired its first documentary entitled  Speak Up   The program was aimed towards bullies and their victims  It was rated TV PG L   edit  Programming Main article  List of programs broadcast by Cartoon Network Many of the programs were actually aired including the original series that were produced by Cartoon Network Studios  like Dexter s Laboratory  Cow and Chicken  Johnny Bravo  I Am Weasel  The Powerpuff Girls Foster s Home for Imaginary Friends  Codename  Kids Next Door and The Grim Adventures of Billy  amp  Mandy  including non productions like Ed  Edd n Eddy  Courage the Cowardly Dog and Adventure Time  The network also carries acquired programs that some of them were produced by Warner Bros  Animation and third party animation studios  which were not produced by Cartoon Network Studios  It also has original live action series like Out of Jimmy s Head  The Othersiders  Destroy Build Destroy and Dude  What Would Happen  A Spanish language audio track is accessible via SAP  some cable and satellite companies offer the Spanish feed as a separate channel  Cartoon Network benefited from having access to  the largest collection of animated programming  available  The titles available for broadcasting included the libraries of threatrically released shorts produced by both Warner Bros   Looney Tunes  Merrie Melodies  and the Metro Goldwyn Mayer cartoon studio  Tom and Jerry and other series   the television series produced by the Hanna Barbera animation studio  The Flintstones  Scooby Doo  and many others   syndicated shows from Kids  WB  Batman  The Animated Series and others   and licensed anime shows  Dragonball Z   Transformers Armada Mobile Suit Gundam Wing  29   By the early 2000s  Cartoon Network had established programming blocks aimed at different age demographics  The shows broadcast during the early morning had preschoolers as their target audience and mostly had prosocial behavior as a theme  The Toonami programming block  featured later in the day  mostly included anime shows and their target audience were tweens and teenagers  Prime time shows mostly included classic cartoons  featured as part of theThe Tex Avery Show  The Chuck Jones Show and The Bob Clampett Show  Jason Mittell considers Cartoon Network to have helped the  cartoon genre   animation in general  reach a wider audience in the 1990s  Mittell noted that Disney feature films starting with The Little Mermaid  1989   prime time animated series starting with The Simpsons  1989 present   and the success of Cartoon Network all helped end the  stigma  of animation only appealing to children  allowing adults to enjoy animation once again  He also credited the Network for returning cartoons initially designed for mass audiences back to their original purpose  but noted that in the case of the Hanna Barbera shows  Cartoon Network only broadcast the most successful and well regarded of them  largely overlooking the  lesser efforts  of the company in an apparent belief that these would turn off their adult viewers 30   The Network s target audience  however  is stated to include  people who love cartoons  in general  regardless of their age or whether the viewers approach cartoons as a form of nostalgia  due to an appreciation of the art form  or simply seeking entertainment   edit  Marketing Cartoon Network shows with established fan followings  such as the The Powerpuff Girls  allowed the Network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series related merchandise  For example  agreements with Kraft Foods led to widespread in store advertising for Cartoon Network related products  The Network also worked on cross promotion campaigns with both Kraft and Tower Records  In product development and marketing  the Network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent Time Warner  allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies 31   Time Warner Cable  the cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent  distributed Cartoon Network as part of its packages  Turner Broadcasting System  the subsidiary overseeing various Time Warner owned networks  helped cross promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks  For example  Samurai Jack  one of CN s original shows  was at times seen at Kids  WB  while Cardcaptors  an anime show licensed by Kids  WB  was at times seen at Cartoon Network  In each case the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks  Time Inc   the subsidiary overseeing the many magazines of the corporate parent  ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications  Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as Time  Entertainment Weekly  and Sports Illustrated Kids  AOL  a sibling company to Time Warner covering Internet services  helped promote Cartoon Netwoerk shows online by offering exclusive contents for certain animated series  online sweepstakes and display advertising for CN 31   Warner Home Video  the home video subsidiary  distributed VHS tapes and DVDs featuring Cartoon Network shows  Rhino Entertainment  a record label subsidiary  distributed cassette tapes and CDs wirh Cartoon Network related music  All such products were also available through the Warner Bros  Studio Store  DC Comics  the comic book subsidiary  published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls  indicating it could handle other CN related characters  Warner Bros   the film studio subsidiary  released The Powerpuff Girls Movie in 2002  Kevin Sandler considered it likely that the film would find its way to HBO or Cinemax  two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films  Sandler also viewed book tie ins through Warner Books as likely  since it was the only area of marketing not covered yet by 2001 31    edit  Censorship Cartoon Network has  during its history  broadcast most of the Warner Bros  animated shorts originally created between the 1930s and the 1960s  but the censorship practices of the Network and its corporate parent resulted in editing out scenes depicting discharge of gunfire  alcohol ingestion  cowboys and Indians gags  and racist humor  The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market   Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs   1943   a racist but critically well regarded short  was notably omitted entirely  while  The Scarlet Pumpernickel   1950  and  Feed the Kitty   1952   both well regarded  had their finales heavily edited due to violence 32   There was controversy in 2001 over a Network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting  The Cartoon Network scheduled a 49 hour long marathon promising to broadcast every Bugs Bunny animated short in chronological order  The Network originally intended to include 12 shorts that had become controversial for using ethnic stereotypes  albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure no children were watching  with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time  The Network s corporate parent  however  considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity  This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety  Laurie Goldberg  vice president of public relations  defended the decision  stating   We re the leader in animation  but we re also one of the top rated general entertainment networks  There are certain responsibilities that come with that  32   Following complaints by its adult fanbase  the Network offered a compromise solution  the 12 omitted animated shorts would be included in upcoming documentaries  The first such documentary was a special on  The Wartime Cartoons   It notably included  Herr Meets Hare   1945  in its entirety  but only certain clips of  Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips   1943   Kevin Sandler considered it a positive sign of the Network being willing to  confront and unveil  some of the dishonorable aspects of animated history  but noted that so far only the Warner Bros  shorts got this serious treatment  not the MGM animated shorts also broadcast by the Network 32   When Cartoon Network began rerunning the original Looney Tunes again in March 2011  given their own timeslot this time in place of marathons during new years day   most censored scenes in some cartoons  along with original title cards  have been reinstated  such as gunfire and alcohol  though the network still edits out racist scenes  The network s two most popular shows  Adventure Time and Regular Show  have shown scenes of violence and mild profanity  though both are rated TV PG   Sometimes  the network may remove the scenes once more after the first broadcast  or will leave them unedited  Examples of cartoons that have had their censored scenes title cards reinstated include  Scaredy Cat  and  For Scent imental Reasons   two cartoons that have shown gunfire  Many licensed anime programs broadcast on its action themed block Toonami had to be edited for content in order to receive a TV Y7 rating  Mostly since many of these series had objectionable content that could considered offensive or inappropriate to its younger viewers  Despite that Toonami managed to get these series on the air through editing out heavy amounts of violence  drug usage  language  sexuality and nudity particularly with Rurouni Kenshin  YuYu Hakusho  Gundam  Dragon Ball Z  Outlaw Star  Tenchi Muyo   Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon  However anime such as Naruto and One Piece  both rated TV PG DSV  received minor editing and included light swearing  partial nudity and alcohol references   edit  Sister channels and related projects  edit  Adult Swim Main article  Adult Swim Adult Swim  often stylized as  adult swim  or  as   is an adult oriented cable television network that shares Channel space with Cartoon Network from 9 00 pm to 6 00 am ET PT in the United States  and broadcasts in countries such as Australia and New Zealand  33  The network features myriad stylistically variable animated and live action shows  including original programming  syndicated shows  and Japanese anime  generally with minimal or no editing for content  The programs featured on Adult Swim are geared toward an 18  audience  in contrast to the originally all ages pre teen daytime programming on Cartoon Network   edit  Boomerang Main article  Boomerang  TV channel  The logo for Boomerang  Boomerang was a programming block on Cartoon Network  since the network s launch in  92  aimed towards the Baby Boom generation  The block s start time jumped frequently but was always aired in the weekends  On April 1  2000  Boomerang received both a new look and a cable spin off channel 34    edit  Get Animated Get Animated is a campaign of the channel  encouraging children to get active  more importantly in outdoor areas  Original promos involved many different cartoon characters  and real kids  Current promos still show cartoon characters playing alongside kids  though occasional sports celebrities  such as Freddy Adu  make appearances  Other promos show real kids who make great physically related achievements  or cartoon characters explaining ways of getting active   edit  Cartoon Network Universe  FusionFall Main article  Cartoon Network Universe  FusionFall Cartoon Network Universe  FusionFall is a massively multiplayer online game developed by Cartoon Network and Grigon Entertainment  FusionFall uses the Unity engine as its client technology basis  For the first year  the full game required a subscription  free accounts could only access to a portion of the content 35   It was scheduled to be released in fall 2008  but the release date was pushed back to January 14  2009  The game became free to play on April 19  2010   edit  Cartoon Network HD Cartoon Network HD is a high definition feed version of Cartoon Network that launched on October 15  2007  and is available from many cable
