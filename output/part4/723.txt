 Spies for the Rebel Alliance have stolen plans to the Galactic Empire s Death Star  a weaponized space station capable of annihilating an entire planet  Rebel leader Princess Leia  Carrie Fisher  is in possession of the plans  but her ship is captured by Imperial forces under the command of the evil lord Darth Vader  David Prowse  voiced by James Earl Jones    Before she is captured  Leia hides the plans in the memory of a droid called R2 D2  Kenny Baker   along with a holographic recording  The small droid escapes to the surface of the desert planet Tatooine with fellow droid C 3PO  Anthony Daniels   The droids are quickly captured by Jawa traders  who sell the pair to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars  Phil Brown and Shelagh Fraser  and their nephew  Luke Skywalker  Mark Hamill   While Luke is cleaning R2 D2  he accidentally triggers part of Leia s holographic message  in which she requests help from Obi Wan Kenobi  The only  Kenobi  Luke knows of is an old hermit named Ben Kenobi  Alec Guiness  who lives in the nearby hills  The next morning  upon finding R2 D2 after he escapes to seek Obi Wan  Luke meets Ben Kenobi  revealing himself to be Obi Wan  Obi Wan tells Luke of his days as a Jedi Knight  one of a faction of former galactic peacekeepers who were wiped out by the Empire  Contrary to his uncle s claims  Luke learns that his father Anakin Skywalker fought alongside Obi Wan as a Jedi Knight before he was betrayed and killed by Vader  Obi Wan s former pupil who turned to the  dark side of the Force   Obi Wan views Leia s complete message in which she begs Obi Wan to take the Death Star plans to her home planet of Alderaan for her father to retrieve and analyze  He then asks Luke to accompany him and learn the ways of the Force  Luke initially refuses  but changes his mind after discovering that Imperial stormtroopers have destroyed his home and killed his aunt and uncle in search of C 3PO and R2 D2  Obi Wan and Luke hire smuggler Han Solo  Harrison Ford  and his Wookiee co pilot Chewbacca  Peter Mayhew  to transport them on their ship  the Millennium Falcon  Upon the Falcon s arrival at Alderaan  they find that it has been destroyed under the orders of the Death Star s commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin  Peter Cushing  to demonstrate the Death Star s power  The Falcon is caught by the nearby Death Star s tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay  While Obi Wan goes off to disable the tractor beam  Luke discovers that Leia is imprisoned on board and  with the help of Han and Chewbacca  rescues her  After several harrowing escapes  they make their way back to the Falcon  though Obi Wan is killed in a lightsaber duel with Vader  The Falcon escapes the Death Star but  unknown to everyone on board  the Empire has placed a tracking device on the ship to follow them to the rebels  hidden base on Yavin IV  The rebels analyze the Death Star plans  disclosing a vulnerable exhaust port leading to the station s main reactor  Luke joins the assault team  but Han collects his reward for the rescue and leaves despite Luke s request for him to stay  The rebels suffer heavy losses after several failed attack runs  leaving Luke one of the few surviving pilots  Vader appears in a group of TIE fighters and attacks Luke  but Han returns in the Falcon and fires at Vader s wingmen  sending Vader s ship careening into

Rebel Alliance  He is voiced by James Earl Jones  Lucas shared a joint casting session with long time friend Brian De Palma  who was casting his own film Carrie  As a result  Carrie Fisher and Sissy Spacek auditioned for both films in each other s respective roles  Lucas favored casting young actors without long time experience  While reading for Luke Skywalker  then known as  Luke Starkiller    Hamill found the dialogue to be extremely odd because of its universe embedded concepts  He chose to simply read it sincerely and was selected instead of William Katt  who was subsequently cast in Carrie  5  6  7  Lucas initially rejected the idea of using Harrison Ford  as he had previously worked with him on American Graffiti  and instead asked Ford to assist in the auditions by reading lines with the other actors and explaining the concepts and history behind the scenes that they were reading  Lucas was eventually won over by Ford s portrayal and cast him instead of Kurt Russell  Nick Nolte  7 Sylvester Stallone  8 Christopher Walken  Billy Dee Williams  who would play Lando Calrissian in the sequels   and Perry King  who wound up playing Solo in the radio plays  5  9  Many young actresses in Hollywood auditioned for the role of Princess Leia  including Cindy Williams  5  Carrie Fisher was cast under the condition that she lose 10 pounds for the role  Aware that the studio disagreed with his refusal to cast big name stars  Lucas signed veteran stage and screen actor Alec Guinness as Obi Wan Kenobi  5  Additional casting took place in London  where Mayhew was cast as Chewbacca after he stood up to greet Lucas  Lucas immediately turned to Gary Kurtz  and requested that Mayhew be cast  10  Daniels auditioned for and was cast as C 3PO  he has said that he wanted the role after he saw a McQuarrie drawing of the character and was struck by the vulnerability in the robot s face  5  11   edit  History  edit  Writing Elements of the history of Star Wars are commonly disputed  as Lucas  statements about it have changed over time  a 1  George Lucas completed directing his first full length feature  THX 1138  in 1971  He has said that it was around this time that he first had the idea for Star Wars  12  though he has also claimed to have had the idea long before then  13  One of the most influential works on Lucas s early concepts was the Flash Gordon space adventure comics and serials  14  Lucas even made an attempt to purchase the rights to remake Flash Gordon at one point  but could not afford them  15  Friend and collaborator Walter Murch suggested in an interview that Star Wars was Lucas   transubstantiated version of Apocalypse Now   at one time  Lucas had planned to direct that film  16  Following the completion of THX 1138  Lucas was granted a two film development deal with United Artists at the Cannes Film Festival in May of that year for American Graffiti  and an idea for a space opera he called The Star Wars  He showed United Artists the script for American Graffiti  but they passed on the film  Universal Studios picked the film up  17  and Lucas spent the next two years completing it  Only then did he turn his attention to The Star Wars  He began writing the treatment in January 1973  unsure what would come of Graffiti  and still very much in debt  17  Lucas began his creation process by taking small notes  inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterizations  Lucas would discard many of these by the time the final script was written  but he included several names and places in the final script or its sequels  such as Luke Skywalker and Han Solo   He revived others decades later when he wrote his prequel trilogy  such as Mace Windy  renamed Windu   He used these initial names and ideas to compile a two page synopsis titled  The Journal of the Whills   which bore little resemblance to the final story  18  The Journal told the tale of the son of a famous pilot who is trained as a  padawaan  apprentice of a revered  Jedi Bendu   18  Frustrated after being told that his story was too difficult to understand  19  Lucas started again on a completely new outline  this time borrowing heavily from Akira Kurosawa s The Hidden Fortress  20  so much so that he at one time considered buying the rights to the film  21  He relied on a plot synopsis from Donald Richie s book The Films of Akira Kurosawa and wrote a 14 page draft that paralleled The Hidden Fortress  with names and settings reminiscent of the science fiction genre  22  Both United Artists and Universal passed on their options for the film later that year  citing the risk involved in the project s potentially high budget  Lucas pursued Alan Ladd  Jr   the head of 20th Century Fox  and in June 1973 closed a deal to write and direct the film  Although Ladd did not grasp the technical side of the project  he believed that Lucas was talented  Lucas later stated that Ladd  invested in me  he did not invest in the movie   5  The deal afforded Lucas  150 000 to write and direct  Later that year  Lucas began writing a full script of his synopsis  which he would complete in May 1974  In this script he reintroduced the Jedi  which had been absent in his previous treatment  as well as their enemies  the Sith  He changed the protagonist  who had been a mature General in the treatment  to an adolescent boy  and he shifted the General into a supporting role as a member of a family of dwarfs  5  23  Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler  Han Solo  as a large  green skinned monster with gills  this would turn out to be Greedo  whom Han would shoot in the Mos Eisley Cantina when we first meet his character   He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog  Indiana   whom he would later use as namesake for his next hero Indiana Jones   who often acted as the director s  co pilot  by sitting in the passenger seat of his car  23  Many of the final elements in the film began to take shape  though the plot 24  was still far removed from the final script  It did  however  begin to diverge from The Hidden Fortress and take on the general story elements that would comprise the final film  Lucas began researching the science fiction genre  both watching films and reading books and comics  25  His first script incorporated ideas from many new sources  The script would also introduce the concept of a Jedi master father and his son  training to be a Jedi under the father s Jedi friend  which would ultimately form the basis for the film and even the trilogy  However  in this draft  the father is a hero who is still alive at the start of the film  26  The script was also the first time Darth Vader appeared in the story  though other than being a villain  he bore little resemblance to the final character  Lucas grew distracted by other projects  but he would return to complete a second draft of The Star Wars by January 1975  while still having some differences in the characters and relationships  For example  the protagonist Luke  Starkiller in this draft  had several brothers  as well as his father who appears in a minor role at the end of the film  The script became more of a fairy tale quest as opposed to the more grounded action adventure of the previous versions  This version ended with another text crawl which previewed the next story in the series  This draft was also the first to introduce the concept of a Jedi turning to the dark side  a historical Jedi that became the first to ever fall to the dark side  and then trained the Sith to use it  Lucas hired conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie to create paintings of certain scenes around this time  When Lucas delivered his screenplay to the studio  he included several of McQuarrie s paintings  27  A third draft  dated August 1  1975  was titled The Star Wars  From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller which now had most of the elements of the final plot  with only some differences in the characters and settings  Luke was again an only child  and his father was  for the first time  written as dead  This script would be re written for the fourth and final draft  dated January 1  1976 as The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills  Saga I  Star Wars  Lucas worked with his friends Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck to revise the fourth draft into the final pre production script  28  20th Century Fox approved a budget of  8 250 000  American Graffiti  having been released in 1973 to positive reviews  allowed Lucas to renegotiate his deal with Alan Ladd  Jr  and request the sequel rights to the film  For Lucas  this deal protected Star Wars  unwritten segments and most of the merchandising profits  5  29  Lucas would continue to tweak the script during shooting  most notably adding the death of Kenobi after realizing he served no purpose in the ending of the film  30  31   edit  Lucas s claims Lucas has often alleged that the entire original trilogy was written as one film  that the Star Wars script was too long  so he split it into three films  5  32  33  However  none of Lucas s drafts had more pages or scenes than his final draft  Lucas s second draft is usually cited as the script he is referring to with these comments  34  Michael Kaminski argues in his work The Secret History of Star Wars that this draft is structurally very similar to the final film in plot arrangement  and that the only elements from it that were saved for the sequels were an asteroid field space chase  moved to The Empire Strikes Back  and a forest battle involving Wookiees  moved to Return of the Jedi  with Ewoks in place of Wookiees   and that none of the major plotlines of the sequels are present  34  Lucas himself has admitted this  35   edit  Production In 1975  Lucas founded the visual effects company Industrial Light  amp  Magic  ILM  after discovering that 20th Century Fox s visual effects department had been disbanded  ILM began its work on Star Wars in a warehouse in Van Nuys  California  Most of the visual effects used motion control photography  which creates the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras  Model spaceships were constructed on the basis of drawings by Joe Johnston  input from Lucas  and paintings by McQuarrie  Lucas opted to abandon the traditional sleekness of science fiction by creating a  used universe  in which all devices  ships  and buildings looked aged and dirty  5  36  37  A traditional underground building in Matm ta  Tunisia was used as a set for Luke s home on Tatooine  When principal photography began on March 22  1976 in the Tunisian desert for the scenes on the planet Tatooine  the project faced several problems  38  Lucas fell behind schedule in the first week of shooting due to a rare Tunisian rainstorm  malfunctioning props  and electronic breakdowns  38  39  When actor Anthony Daniels wore the C 3PO outfit for the first time  the left leg piece shattered down through the plastic covering his left foot  stabbing him  After completing filming in Tunisia  production moved into the more controlled environment of Elstree Studios  near London  39  However  significant problems  such as a crew that had little interest in the film  still arose  5  39  Most of the crew considered the project a  children s film   rarely took their work seriously  and often found it unintentionally humorous  5  40  Actor Kenny Baker later confessed that he thought the film would be a failure  Harrison Ford found the film  weird  in that there was a Princess with buns for hair and what he called a  giant in a monkey suit  named Chewbacca  Ford also found the dialogue difficult  saying  George  you can type this shit  but you can t say it    41  Lucas clashed with cinematographer Gilbert Taylor  BSC  whom producer Gary Kurtz called  old school  and  crotchety   Moreover  with a background in independent filmmaking  Lucas was accustomed to creating most of the elements of the film himself  His lighting suggestions were rejected by an offended Taylor  who felt that Lucas was over stepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions and sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself  Taylor refused to use the soft focus lenses and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look  42  Lucas eventually became frustrated that the costumes  sets and other elements were not living up to his original vision of Star Wars  He rarely spoke to the actors  who felt that he expected too much of them while providing little direction  His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words  faster  and  more intense   5  Ladd offered Lucas some of the only support from the studio  he dealt with scrutiny from board members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts  After production fell two weeks behind schedule  Ladd told Lucas that he had to finish production within a week or he would be forced to shut down production  The crew split into three units  led by Lucas  Kurtz and production supervisor Robert Watts  Under the new system  the project met the studio s deadline  5  39  Mayan ruins at Tikal  Guatemala  which were used in the film as the rebel base  During production  the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile as he often appeared depressed  At one point  the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level  5  39 Post production was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century Fox  Moreover  Mark Hamill s car accident left his face visibly scarred  which suppressed re shoots  39   edit  Post production Star Wars was originally slated for release in Christmas 1976  however  delays pushed the film s release to summer 1977  Already anxious about meeting his deadline  Lucas was shocked when editor John Jympson s first cut of the film was a  complete disaster   According to an article in Star Wars Insider  41 by David West Reynolds  this first edit of Star Wars contained about 30 40  different footage from the final version  This included scenes that have never been seen elsewhere along with alternate takes of existing scenes  After attempting to persuade Jympson to cut the film his way  Lucas replaced him with Paul Hirsch and Richard Chew  He also allowed his then wife Marcia Lucas to aid the editing process while she was cutting the film New York  New York with Lucas s friend Martin Scorsese  Richard Chew found the film had an unenergetic pace  it had been cut in a by the book manner  scenes were played out in master shots that flowed into close up coverage  He found that the pace was dictated by the actors instead of the cuts  Hirsch and Chew worked on two reels simultaneously  whoever finished first moved on to the next  5  Meanwhile  Industrial Light  amp  Magic was struggling to achieve unprecedented special effects  The company had spent half of its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable  39  Moreover  theories surfaced that the workers at ILM lacked discipline  forcing Lucas to intervene frequently to ensure that they were on schedule  With hundreds of uncompleted shots remaining  ILM was forced to finish a year s work in six months  Lucas inspired ILM by editing together aerial dogfights from old war films  which enhanced the pacing of the scenes  5  During the chaos of production and post production  the team made decisions about character voicing and sound effects  Sound designer Ben Burtt had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an  organic soundtrack   Blaster sounds were a modified recording of a steel cable  under tension  being struck  For Chewbacca s growls  Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by dogs  bears  lions  tigers and walruses to create phrases and sentences  Lucas and Burtt created the robotic voice of R2 D2 by filtering their voices through an electronic synthesizer  Darth Vader s breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a scuba regulator implanted with a microphone  43  Lucas never intended to use the voice of David Prowse  who portrayed Darth Vader in costume  because of Prowse s English West Country accent  He originally wanted Orson Welles to speak for Darth Vader  However  he felt that Welles  voice would be too recognizable  so he cast the lesser known James Earl Jones  7  Nor did Lucas intend to use Anthony Daniels  voice for C 3PO  Thirty well established voice actors read for the voice of the droid  According to Daniels  one of the major voice actors  believed by some sources to be Stan Freberg  recommended Daniels  voice for the role  5  23  When Lucas screened an early cut of the film for his friends  among them directors Brian De Palma  John Milius and Steven Spielberg  their reactions were disappointing  Spielberg  who claimed to have been the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film  believed that the lack of enthusiasm was due to the absence of finished special effects  Lucas later said that the group was honest and seemed bemused by the film  In contrast  Alan Ladd  Jr  and the rest of 20th Century Fox loved the film  one of the executives  Gareth Wigan  told Lucas   This is the greatest film I ve ever seen   and cried during the screening  Lucas found the experience shocking and rewarding  having never gained any approval from studio executives before  5  The delays increased the budget from  8 million to  11 million  44   edit  Cinematic and literary allusions See also  Star Wars sources and analogues According to Lucas  the film was inspired by numerous sources  such as Beowulf and King Arthur for the origins of myth and world religions  5  Lucas originally wanted to rely heavily on the 1930s Flash Gordon film serials  however  he resorted to Akira Kurosawa s film The Hidden Fortress and Joseph Campbell s The Hero with a Thousand Faces because of copyright issues with Flash Gordon  45 Star Wars features several parallels to Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon  such as the conflict between Rebels and Imperial Forces  the  wipes  between scenes  and the famous opening crawl that begins each film  A concept borrowed from Flash Gordon a fusion of futuristic technology and traditional magic was originally developed by one of the founders of science fiction  H  G  Wells  Wells believed the Industrial Revolution had quietly destroyed the idea that fairy tale magic might be real  Thus  he found that plausibility was required to allow myth to work properly  and substituted elements of the Industrial Era  time machines instead of magic carpets  Martians instead of dragons  and scientists instead of wizards  Wells called his new genre  scientific fantasia   46  Star Wars was influenced by the 1958 Kurosawa film The Hidden Fortress  for instance  the two bickering peasants evolved into C 3PO and R2 D2  and a Japanese family crest seen in the film is similar to the Imperial Crest  Star Wars also borrows heavily from another Kurosawa film  Yojimbo  In both films  several men threaten the hero  bragging how wanted they are by authorities  The situation ends with an arm being cut off by a blade  Kuwabatake Sanjuro  portrayed by Toshir  Mifune  is offered  twenty five ryo now  twenty five when you complete the mission   whereas Han Solo is offered  Two thousand now  plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan   Lucas s affection for Kurosawa may have influenced his decision to visit Japan in the early 1970s  leading some to believe he borrowed the name  Jedi  from jidaigeki  which in English means  period dramas   and refers to films typically featuring samurai   46  Tatooine is similar to Arrakis from Frank Herbert s book Dune  Arrakis is the only known source of a longevity drug called the Spice Melange  References to  spice   various illegal stimulant drugs  occur throughout the last three films of the Star Wars saga  In Episode IV Han Solo is a spice smuggler who has been through the spice mines of Kessel  In the conversation at Obi Wan Kenobi s home between Obi Wan and Luke  Luke expresses a belief that his father was a navigator on a spice freighter  Other similarities include those between Princess Leia and Princess Alia      li      and between Jedi mind tricks and  The Voice   a controlling ability used by Bene Gesserit  In passing  Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru are  Moisture Farmers   in Dune  Dew Collectors are used by Fremen to  provide a small but reliable source of water   47  Frank Herbert reported that   David Lynch   director of 1984 film Dune  had trouble with the fact that Star Wars used up so much of Dune   The pair found  sixteen points of identity  and they calculated that   the odds against coincidence produced a number larger than the number of stars in the universe   48  The Death Star assault scene was modeled after the film The Dam Busters  1955   in which Royal Air Force Lancaster bombers fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim  bouncing bombs  at their man made dams to cripple the heavy industry of the Ruhr  Some of the dialogue in The Dam Busters is repeated in the Star Wars climax  Gilbert Taylor also filmed the special effects sequences in The Dam Busters  In addition  the sequence was partially inspired by the climax of the film 633 Squadron  1964  directed by Walter Grauman  49  in which RAF Mosquitos attack a German heavy water plant by flying down a narrow fjord to drop special bombs at a precise point while avoiding anti aircraft guns and German fighters  Clips from both films were included in Lucas s temporary dogfight footage version of the sequence  14  The opening shot of Star Wars  in which a detailed spaceship fills the screen overhead  is a nod to the scene introducing the interplanetary spacecraft Discovery One in Stanley Kubrick s seminal 1968 film 2001  A Space Odyssey  The earlier big budget science fiction film influenced the look of Star Wars in many other ways  including the use of EVA pods and hexagonal corridors  The Death Star has a docking bay reminiscent of the one on the orbiting space station in 2001  50  The film also draws on The Wizard of Oz  1939   similarities exist between Jawas and Munchkins  the main characters disguise themselves as enemy soldiers  and when Obi Wan dies  he leaves only his empty robe  similar to the melting of the Wicked Witch of the West  Also of note is that Luke lives on a farm with his uncle and aunt like Dorothy  51  Although golden and male  C 3PO is inspired by the robot Maria  the Maschinenmensch from Fritz Lang s 1927 film Metropolis  His whirring sounds were speculated to be inspired by the clanking noises of The Wizard of Oz character the Tin Woodsman and C 3PO has an arc throughout the Star Wars saga that is similar to the arc of the Cowardly Lion  52   edit  Soundtrack Main article  Star Wars Episode IV  A New Hope  soundtrack  On the recommendation of his friend Steven Spielberg  Lucas hired composer John Williams  who had worked with Spielberg on the film Jaws  for which he won an Academy Award  Lucas felt that the film would portray visually foreign worlds  but that the musical score would give the audience an emotional familiarity  In March 1977  Williams conducted the London Symphony Orchestra to record the Star Wars soundtrack in twelve days  5  Lucas wanted a grand musical sound for Star Wars  with leitmotifs to provide distinction  Therefore  he assembled his favorite orchestral pieces for the soundtrack  until John Williams convinced him that an original score would be unique and more unified  However  a few of Williams  pieces were influenced by the tracks given to him by Lucas  The  Main Title Theme  was inspired by the theme from the 1942 film Kings Row  scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold  and the track  Dune Sea of Tatooine  drew from the soundtrack from Bicycle Thieves  scored by Alessandro Cicognini  The American Film Institute s list of best scores lists the Star Wars soundtrack at number one  53   edit  Releases Charles Lippincott was hired by Lucas s production company  Lucasfilm Ltd   as marketing director for Star Wars  As 20th Century Fox gave little support for marketing beyond licensing T shirts and posters  Lippincott was forced to look elsewhere  He secured deals with Stan Lee  Roy Thomas and Marvel Comics for a comic book adaptation and with Del Rey Books for a novelization  A fan of science fiction  he used his contacts to promote the film at the San Diego Comic Con and elsewhere within fandom  Worried that Star Wars would be beaten out by other summer films  such as Smokey and the Bandit  20th Century Fox moved the release date to the Wednesday before Memorial Day  May 25  1977  However  fewer than forty theaters ordered the film to be shown  In response  20th Century Fox demanded that theaters order Star Wars if they wanted an eagerly anticipated film based on a best selling novel titled The Other Side of Midnight  5  Lucas himself was not able to predict how successful Star Wars would be  After visiting the set of the Steven Spielberg directed Close Encounters of the Third Kind  Lucas was sure Close Encounters would outperform the yet to be released Star Wars at the box office  Spielberg disagreed  and felt Lucas s Star Wars would be the bigger hit  With each Lucas and Spielberg confident that the other s film would be the bigger hit  Lucas proposed they trade 2 5  of the profit on each other s films  Spielberg took the trade  and still receives 2 5  of the profits from Star Wars  54  Within three weeks of the film s release  20th Century Fox s stock price doubled to a record high  Before 1977  20th Century Fox s greatest annual profits were  37 000 000  in 1977  the company earned  79 000 000  Although the film s cultural neutrality helped it to gain international success  Ladd became anxious during the premiere in Japan  After the screening  the audience was silent  leading him to fear that the film would be unsuccessful  Ladd was later told that  in Japan  silence was the greatest honor to a film  When Star Wars made an unprecedented second opening at Mann s Chinese Theatre on 3 August 1977 after Sorcerer failed  thousands of people attended a ceremony in which C 3PO  R2 D2  and Darth Vader placed their footprints in the theater s forecourt  55  5  Some cinemas continuously screened the film for more than a year  Little Star Wars merchandise was available for several months after the film s debut  only Kenner Toys had accepted Lippincott s licensing offers  Kenner responded to the sudden demand for toys by selling boxed vouchers in its  empty box  Christmas campaign  Television commercials told children and parents that vouchers within a  Star Wars Early Bird Certificate Package  could be redeemed for toys  between February 1 and June 1   5  In 1978  at the height of the film s popularity  Smith Hemion Productions approached Lucas with the idea of The Star Wars Holiday Special  The result is often considered a failure  Lucas himself disowned it  56  The film was originally released as Star Wars  without Episode IV or the subtitle A New Hope  The 1980 sequel  Star Wars Episode V  The Empire Strikes Back  featured an episode number and subtitle in the opening crawl  When the original film was re released in 1981  Episode IV  A New Hope was added above the original opening crawl  Although Lucas claims that only six films were ever planned  representatives of Lucasfilm discussed plans for nine or twelve possible films in early interviews  57  The film was re released theatrically in 1978  1979  1981  1982  and with additional scenes and enhanced special effects in 1997   edit  Original home video releases The film was released on VHS  Betamax and Laserdisc during the 1980s and  90s by CBS Fox Video  58  59  The first Star Wars was released on video tape in 1982  but only to rental customers  The first sell through video tapes of Star Wars were released in 1984   60   edit  Special Edition After ILM used computer generated effects for Steven Spielberg s Jurassic Park  Lucas concluded that digital technology had caught up to his original vision for Star Wars  5  For the film s 20th anniversary in 1997  A New Hope was digitally remastered and re released to movie theaters  along with The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi  under the campaign title The Star Wars Trilogy  Special Edition  The Special Edition versions contained visual shots and scenes that were unachievable in the original release due to financial  technological  and time restraints  one such scene involved a meeting between Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt  5  The process of creating the new visual effects for A New Hope was featured in the Academy Award nominated IMAX documentary film  Special Effects  Anything Can Happen  directed by veteran Star Wars sound designer  Ben Burtt  Although most changes were minor or cosmetic in nature  some fans believe that Lucas degraded the movie with the additions  61  For instance  a particularly controversial change in which a bounty hunter named Greedo shoots first when confronting Han Solo has inspired T shirts brandishing the phrase  Han Shot First   62  Although the Special Edition s changes were artistic  A New Hope required extensive restoration before Lucas could even attempt his modifications  It had been discovered that in addition to the negative motion picture stocks commonly used on feature films  Lucas had also used internegative film  a reversal stock which deteriorated faster than negative stocks did  This meant that the entire printing negative had to be disassembled  and the CRI  color reversal internegative  portions cleaned separately from the negative portions  Once the cleaning was complete  the film was scanned into the computer for restoration  In many cases  entire scenes had to be reconstructed from their individual elements  Fortunately  digital compositing technology allowed them to correct for problems such as alignment of mattes   blue spill   and so forth  63  The film was then color corrected and digitally printed onto a new negative  from which prints would be struck   edit  DVD releases A New Hope was released on DVD on September 21  2004  in a box set with The Empire Strikes Back  Return of the Jedi  and a bonus disc of supplementary material  The movies were digitally restored and remastered  and more changes were made by George Lucas  The DVD features a commentary track from George Lucas  Ben Burtt  Dennis Muren  and Carrie Fisher  The bonus disc contains the documentary Empire of Dreams  The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy  three featurettes  teaser and theatrical trailers  TV spots  still galleries  an exclusive preview of Revenge of the Sith  a playable Xbox demo of the LucasArts game Star Wars  Battlefront  and a  Making Of  documentary on the Episode III video game  The set was reissued in December 2005 as part of a three disc  limited edition  boxed set without the bonus disc  The trilogy was re released on separate two disc Limited Edition DVD sets from September 12 to December 31  2006  and again in a box set on November 4  2008  64  the original versions of the films were added as bonus material  Controversy surrounded the release because the unaltered versions were from the 1993 non anamorphic Laserdisc masters  and were not retransferred with modern video standards  65   edit  Blu ray release On August 14  2010  George Lucas announced that all six Star Wars films would be released on Blu ray Disc in Fall 2011  66  On January 6  2011  the release was announced for September 16  2011 in three different editions  67 Star Wars  The Complete Saga

with The Phantom Menace on February 10  2012  A New Hope is scheduled to be re released in 3D in 2015   edit  Reaction   On opening day I     did a radio call in show     this caller  was really enthusiastic and talking about the movie in really deep detail  I said   You know a lot about the film   He said   Yeah  yeah  I ve seen it four times already      Producer Gary Kurtz  on when he realized Star Wars had become a cultural phenomenon 69  Star Wars debuted on Wednesday  May 25  1977  in 32 theaters  and eight more on Thursday and Friday  It immediately broke box office records  effectively becoming one of the first blockbuster films  and Fox accelerated plans to broaden its release  55  Lucas spent most of the day in a sound studio in Los Angeles  When he went out for lunch with his then wife Marcia  they encountered a long queue of people along the sidewalks leading to Mann s Chinese Theatre  waiting to see Star Wars  39  Even technical crew members  such as model makers  were asked for autographs  and cast members became instant household names  5  Star Wars remains one of the most financially successful films of all time  The film earned  1 554 475 through its opening weekend  building up to  7 million weekends as it entered wide release  2  It replaced Jaws as the highest earning film in North America just six months into release  70  eventually earning over  220 million during its initial theatrical run  71 Star Wars entered international release towards the end of the year  and in 1978 added the worldwide record to its domestic one  72  earning  410 million in total  73  Reissues in 1978  1979  1981 and 1982 brought its cumulative gross in Canada and the U S  to  323 million  74  and extended its global earnings to  530 million  75  The film remained the highest grossing film of all time until E T  the Extra Terrestrial broke that record in 1983  76  Following the release of the Special Edition in 1997  77 Star Wars briefly reclaimed the North American record before losing it again the following year to Titanic  78  In total  the film has earned  775 398 007 worldwide and  460 998 007 in Canada and the United States  2  It has earned  2 5 billion worldwide at 2011 prices  making it the most successful franchise film of all time  79  at the North American box office it ranks second behind Gone with the Wind on the inflation adjusted list  80   edit  Critical response The film received a largely positive critical reception  According to review aggregator  Rotten Tomatoes  94  of 66 reviews assessed are favorable  with an average rating of 8 2 10  signifying universal critical acclaim   Its consensus states in summary   A legendary expansive and ambitious start to the sci fi saga  George Lucas opens our eyes to the possibilities of blockbuster film making and things have never been the same   In his 1977 review  Roger Ebert called the film  an out of body experience   compared its special effects to those of 2001  A Space Odyssey  and opined that the true strength of the film was its  pure narrative   81 Vincent Canby called the film  the movie that s going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic book adventure   82  However  there were a few negative responses  Pauline Kael of The New Yorker criticized the film  stating that  there s no breather in the picture  no lyricism   and that it had no  emotional grip   83 Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader stated   None of these characters has any depth  and they re all treated like the fanciful props and settings   84  Peter Keough of the Boston Phoenix said  Star Wars is a junkyard of cinematic gimcracks not unlike the Jawas  heap of purloined  discarded  barely functioning droids   85  86   edit  Top ten lists 7th   Gene Siskel  Chicago Tribune 87  10th   Roger Ebert  Chicago Sun Times 88  Prolific film producer Roger Corman considers Star Wars to be one of

after   92  It began a new generation of special effects and high energy motion pictures  The film was one of the first films to link genres such as space opera and soap opera together to invent a new  high concept genre for filmmakers to build upon  36  92  Finally  along with Steven Spielberg s Jaws it shifted the film industry s focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast paced big budget blockbusters for younger audiences  5  92  93  After seeing Star Wars  director James Cameron quit his job as a truck driver to enter the film industry  Other filmmakers who have said to have been influenced by Star Wars include Peter Jackson  Dean Devlin  Roland Emmerich  Christopher Nolan  John Lasseter  David Fincher  Kevin Smith  John Singleton  and Ridley Scott  36  Scott was influenced by the  used future   where vehicles and culture are obviously dated  and extended the concept for his science fiction horror film Alien and science fiction noir film Blade Runner  which also starred Harrison Ford   Jackson used the concept for his production of The Lord of the Rings trilogy to add a sense of realism and believability  36  Nolan cited Star Wars as an influence when making the blockbuster Inception  94  Some critics have blamed Star Wars and also Jaws for ruining Hollywood by shifting its focus from sophisticated and relevant films such as The Godfather  Taxi Driver  and Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy  95 Peter Biskind complained for the same reason   When all was said and done  Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience  grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films  to the simplicities of the pre 1960s Golden Age of movies  They marched backward through the looking glass   95  96  In an opposing view  Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws  Lucas and Spielberg  didn t betray cinema at all  they plugged it back into the grid  returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow  a magic act  one big special effect   which was  a kind of rebirth   93  Star Wars has been the subject of many parodies  including those in Robot Chicken  South Park  Family Guy in the episode  Blue Harvest   the short film Hardware Wars and Mel Brooks  full length parody  Spaceballs   edit  Honors In 1989  the U S  National Film Registry of the Library of Congress selected the film as a

six months before the film was released  The credited author was George Lucas  but the book was revealed to have been ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster  who later wrote the first Expanded Universe novel  Splinter of the Mind s Eye  The book was first published as Star Wars  From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker  later editions were titled simply Star Wars  1995  and  later  Star Wars  A New Hope  1997   to reflect the retitling of the film  Certain scenes deleted from the film  and later restored or archived in DVD bonus features  were always present in the novel  since it had been based on the screenplay   such as Luke at Tosche Station with Biggs and the encounter between Han and Jabba  referred to as  Jabba the Hut   in Docking Bay 94  Other deleted scenes from the movie  such as a close up of a stormtrooper riding on a Dewback  were included in a photo insert added to later printings of the book  Smaller details were also different from the film version  for example  in the Death Star assault  Luke s callsign is Blue Five instead of Red Five as in the film  Also Obi Wan does not sacrifice himself  Vader actually defeats and executes him in the lightsaber duel  Charles Lippincott secured the deal with Del Rey Books to publish the novelization in November 1976  By February 1977  a half million copies had been sold  5   edit  Book and record sets Lucasfilm adapted the

for the show  Mark Hamill  Luke Skywalker  and Anthony Daniels  C 3PO  reprised their roles as well  The radio drama featured scenes not seen in the final cut of the film  such as Luke Skywalker s

designation  like the screenplay and novelization   G canon  109  110   edit  References  edit  Annotations   The Secret History of Star Wars has  as its basis  a goal of determining the true history
