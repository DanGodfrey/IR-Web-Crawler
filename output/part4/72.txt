of the 48 contiguous United States  The name  based on the Caddo word  Tejas  meaning  friends  or  allies   was applied by the Spanish to the Caddo themselves and to the region of their settlement in East Texas  9  Located in the South Central United States  Texas shares an international border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua  Coahuila  Nuevo Le n  and Tamaulipas to the south  and borders the US states of New Mexico to the west  Oklahoma to the north  Arkansas to the northeast  and Louisiana to the east  Texas has an area of 268 820 square miles  696 200 km2   and a growing population of 25 7 million residents  10  During the Spanish colonial rule  the area was officially known as the Nuevo Reino de Filipinas  La Provincia de Texas  11  Antonio Margil de Jes s was known to be the first person to use the name in a letter to the Viceroy of Mexico in 20 July 1716  The name was not popularly used in daily speech but often appeared in legal documents until the end of the 1800s  Houston is the largest city in Texas and the fourth largest in the United States  while San Antonio is the second largest in the state and seventh largest in the United States  Dallas Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and sixth largest United States metropolitan areas  respectively  Other major cities include El Paso and Austin the state capital  Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State to signify Texas as a former independent republic and as a reminder of the state s struggle for independence from Mexico  The  Lone Star  can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal today  12  Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault  Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the American South and Southwest  13  Although Texas is popularly associated with the Southwestern deserts  less than 10  of the land area is desert  14  Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies  grasslands  forests  and the coastline  Traveling from east to west  one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods  to rolling plains and rugged hills  and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend  The term  six flags over Texas  came from the several nations that had ruled over the territory  Spain was the first European country to claim the area of Texas  France held a short lived colony in Texas  Mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when Texas won its independence  becoming an independent Republic  In 1845 it joined the United States as the 28th state  The state s annexation set off a chain of events that caused the Mexican American War in 1846  A slave state  Texas declared its secession from the United States in early 1861  joining the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War  After the war and its restoration to the Union  Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation  One Texas industry that thrived after the Civil War was cattle  Due to its long history as a center of the industry  Texas is associated with the image of the cowboy  The state s economic fortunes changed in the early 20th century  when oil discoveries initiated an economic boom in the state  With strong investments in universities  Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid 20th century  As of 2010 it shares the top of the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with California at 57  15  With a growing base of industry  the state leads in many industries  including agriculture  petrochemicals  energy  computers and electronics  aerospace  and biomedical sciences  It leads the nation in export revenue since 2002 and has the second highest gross state product  Contents 1 Geography 1 1 Geology 2 Climate 3 History 3 1 Pre

It is 10  larger than France and almost twice as large as Germany or Japan  though it ranks only 27th worldwide amongst country subdivisions by size  If it were a country  Texas would be the 40th largest behind Chile and Zambia  Texas is in the south central part of the United States of America  Three of its borders are defined by rivers  The Rio Grande river forms a natural border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua  Coahuila  Nuevo Le n  and Tamaulipas to the south  The Red River forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas to the north  The Sabine River forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east  The Texas Panhandle has an eastern border with Oklahoma at 100  W  a northern border with Oklahoma at 36 30  N and a western border with New Mexico at 103  W  El Paso lies on the state s western tip at 32  N and the Rio Grande  16  Hill Country With 10 climatic regions  14 soil regions  and 11 distinct ecological regions  regional classification becomes problematic with differences in soils  topography  geology  rainfall  and plant and animal communities  17  One classification system divides Texas  in order southeast to west  into the following  Gulf Coastal Plains  Interior Lowlands  Great Plains  and Basin and Range Province  The Gulf Coastal Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast section of the state  Vegetation in this region consists of thick piney woods  The Interior Lowlands region consists of gently rolling to hilly forested land is part of a larger pine hardwood forest  The Great Plains region in central Texas is located in spans through the state s panhandle and Llano Estacado to the state s hill country near Austin  This region is dominated by prairie and steppe   Far West Texas  or the  Trans Pecos  region is the state s Basin and Range Province  The most varied of the regions  this area includes Sand Hills  the Stockton Plateau  desert valleys  wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands  Lake Alan Henry Texas has 3 700 named streams and 15 major rivers  18  19  The largest of these rivers is the Rio Grande  Other major rivers include the Pecos  the Brazos  Colorado  and Red River  which forms the border with Oklahoma  While Texas has few natural lakes  Texans have built over 100 artificial reservoirs  20  The size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation debatable  it can be fairly considered a Southern or a Southwestern state  or both  The vast geographic  economic  and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a recognized region of the United States  Notable extremes range from East Texas which is often considered an extension of the Deep South  to Far West Texas which is generally acknowledged to be part of the interior Southwest  Geology Main article  Geology of Texas Shaded Relief Map of the Llano Estacado Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains  which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico  The continental crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico  The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1 600 million years old  These Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks underlie most of the state  and are exposed in three places  Llano uplift  Van Horn  and the Franklin Mountains  near El Paso  Sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks  The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin  or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time  This margin existed until Laurasia and Gondwana collided in the Pennsylvanian subperiod to form Pangea  This is the buried crest of the Appalachian Mountains Ouachita Mountains zone of Pennsylvanian continental collision  This orogenic crest is today buried beneath the Dallas Waco Austin San Antonio trend  The late Paleozoic mountains collapsed as rifting in the Jurassic period began to open the Gulf of Mexico  Pangea began to break up in the Triassic  but seafloor spreading to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid and late Jurassic  The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the Gulf of Mexico passive margin began to form  Palo Duro Canyon Today 9 miles  14 km  to 12 miles  19 km  of sediments are buried beneath the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining US oil reserves are located here  At the start of its formation  the incipient Gulf of Mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of Jurassic age  These salt deposits formed salt dome diapirs  and are found in East Texas along the Gulf coast  21  East Texas outcrops consist of Cretaceous and Paleogene sediments which contain important deposits of Eocene lignite  The Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sediments in the north  Permian sediments in the west  and Cretaceous sediments in the east  along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas continental shelf contain oil  Oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west Texas in the Big Bend area  A blanket of Miocene sediments known as the Ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer  22  Located far from an active plate tectonic boundary  Texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes  23  Climate Main article  Climate of Texas Average annual precipitation in Texas Average annual temperature in Texas Damage from the 1915 Galveston hurricane  The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather  The Panhandle of the state has colder winters than North Texas  while the Gulf Coast has mild winters  Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns  El Paso  on the western end of the state  averages 8 7 inches  220 mm  of annual rainfall  2   while parts of southeast Texas averages as much as 64 inches  1 600 mm  per year  3  Dallas in the North Central region averages a more moderate 37 inches  940 mm  per year  Snow falls multiple times each winter in the Panhandle and mountainous areas of West Texas  once or twice a year in North Texas  and once every few years in Central and East Texas  Snow rarely falls south of San Antonio or on the coast except in rare circumstances  Of note is the 2004 Christmas Eve Snowstorm  when 6 inches  150 mm  of snow fell as far south as Kingsville  where the average high temperature in December is 65  F  24  Maximum temperatures in the summer months average from the 80s  F  26  C  in the mountains of West Texas and on Galveston Island to around 100  F  38  C  in the Rio Grande Valley  but most areas of Texas see consistent summer high temperatures in the 90  F  32  C  range  Night time summer temperatures range from the upper 50s  F  14  C  in the West Texas mountains 25  to 80  F  27  C  in Galveston  26  Thunderstorms strike Texas often  especially the eastern and northern portions of the state  Tornado Alley covers the northern section of Texas  The state experiences the most tornadoes in the United States  an average of 139 a year  These strike most frequently in North Texas and the Panhandle  27  Tornadoes in Texas generally occur in the months of April  May  and June  28  Some of the most destructive hurricanes in U S  history have impacted Texas  A hurricane in 1875 killed approximately 400 people in Indianola  followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town  These events allowed Galveston to take over as the chief port city  The Galveston hurricane of 1900 subsequently devastated that city killing approximately 8 000 people  possibly as many as 12 000   making it the deadliest natural disaster in U S  history  Other devastating Texas hurricanes include the 1915 Galveston Hurricane  Hurricane Audrey in 1957 which killed over 600 people  Hurricane Carla in 1961  Hurricane Beulah in 1967  Hurricane Alicia in 1983  Hurricane Rita in 2005  and Hurricane Ike in 2008  29 Tropical storms have also caused their share of damage  Allison in 1989 and again during 2001  and Claudette in 1979 among them  Texas emits the most greenhouse gases in the U S  30  31  32  The state emits nearly 1 5 trillion pounds  680 billion kg  of carbon dioxide annually  As an independent nation  Texas would rank as the world s seventh largest producer of greenhouse gases  31  Causes of the state s vast greenhouse gas emissions include the state s large number of coal power plants and the state s refining and manufacturing industries  31  History Main article  History of Texas History of Texas This article is part of a series Timeline French Texas

Texas Portal v t e Pre European era Further information  Pre Columbian Mexico Texas lies between two major cultural spheres of Pre Columbian North America  the Southwestern and the Plains areas  Archaeologists have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this territory  and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact  These were  33  the Pueblo from the upper Rio Grande region  centered west of Texas  the Mississippian culture  also known as Mound Builder  which extended along the Mississippi River Valley east of Texas  and the civilizations of Mesoamerica  centered south of Texas  Influence of Teotihuacan in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined over the 8th to 10th centuries  No culture was dominant in the present day Texas region  and many peoples inhabited the area  33 Native American tribes that lived inside the boundaries of present day Texas include the Alabama  Apache  Atakapan  Bidai  Caddo  Coahuiltecan  Comanche  Choctaw  Coushatta  Hasinai  Jumano  Karankawa  Kickapoo  Kiowa  Tonkawa  and Wichita  34  35  The name Texas derives from t ysha   a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai  which means  friends  or  allies   3  36  37  38  39  Whether a Native American tribe was friendly or warlike was critical to the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land  40  Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops  prepare foods  and hunt wild game  Warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans through their attacks and resistance to the newcomers  41  Colonization Flag of the six nations that have had sovereignty over some or all of the current territory of Texas Main articles  French colonization of Texas  Spanish Texas  and Mexican Texas Texas in 1718  Guillaume de L Isle map  approximate state area highlighted  northern areas indefinite Stephen F  Austin was the first American empresario given permission to operate a colony within Mexican Texas  The first historical document related to Texas was a map of the Gulf Coast  created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso  lvarez de Pineda  42  43  Nine years later  shipwrecked Spanish explorer  lvar N  ez Cabeza de Vaca and his cohort became the first Europeans in Texas  44  45  European powers ignored Texas until accidentally settling there in 1685  Miscalculations by Ren  Robert Cavelier de La Salle resulted in his establishing the colony of Fort Saint Louis at Matagorda Bay rather than along the Mississippi River  46  The colony lasted only four years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives  47  In 1690 Spanish authorities  concerned that France posed competitive threat  constructed several missions in East Texas  48  After Native American resistance  the Spanish missionaries returned to Mexico  49  When France began settling Louisiana  mostly in the southern part of the state  in 1716 Spanish authorities responded by founding a new series of missions in East Texas  50  51  Two years later  they created San Antonio as the first Spanish civilian settlement in Texas  52  Hostile native tribes and distance from nearby Spanish colonies discouraged settlers from moving to Texas  It was one of New Spain s least populated provinces  53  In 1749  the Spanish peace treaty with the Lipan Apache 54  angered many tribes  including the Comanche  Tonkawa  and Hasinai  55  The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785 56  and later helped to defeat the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes  57  58  With more numerous missions being established  priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes  By the end of the 18th century only a few nomadic tribes had not converted to Christianity  59  When the United States purchased Louisiana from France in 1803  American authorities insisted that the agreement also included Texas  The boundary between New Spain and the United States was finally set at the Sabine River in 1819  60  Eager for new land  many United States settlers refused to recognize the agreement  Several filibusters raised armies to invade Texas  61  In 1821  the Mexican War of Independence included the Texas territory  which became part of Mexico  62  Due to its low population  Mexico made the area part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas  63  Hoping that more settlers would reduce the near constant Comanche raids  Mexican Texas liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain  64  Under the Mexican immigration system  large swathes of land were allotted to empresarios  who recruited settlers from the United States  Europe  and the Mexican interior  The first grant  to Moses Austin  was passed to his son Stephen F  Austin after his death  Austin s settlers  the Old Three Hundred  made places along the Brazos River in 1822  65  Twenty three other empresarios brought settlers to the state  the majority of whom were from the United States  65  66  The population of Texas grew rapidly  In 1825  Texas had a population of approximately 3 500  with most of Mexican descent  67  By 1834  Texas had grown to approximately 37 800 people  with only 7 800 of Mexican descent  68  Many immigrants openly flouted Mexican law  especially the prohibition against slavery  Combined with United States  attempts to purchase Texas  Mexican authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued immigration from the United States  69  New laws also called for the enforcement of customs duties angering both native Mexican citizens  Tejanos  and recent immigrants  70  The Anahuac Disturbances in 1832 were the first open revolt against Mexican rule and they coincided with a revolt in Mexico against the nation s president  71 Texians sided with the federalists against the current government and drove all Mexican soldiers out of East Texas  72  They took advantage of the lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom  Texians met at the Convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood  among other issues  73  The following year  Texians reiterated their demands at the Convention of 1833  Republic Main articles  Texas Revolution and Republic of Texas Republic of Texas  The present day outlines of the U S  states superimposed on the boundaries of 1836 1845 The surrender of Mexican General Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto Proposals of 1850 for Texas northwestern boundary Within Mexico  tensions continued between federalists and centralists  In early 1835  wary Texians formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety  74  The unrest erupted into armed conflict in late 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales  75  This launched the Texas Revolution  and over the next two months  the Texians successfully defeated all Mexican troops in the region  76  Texians elected delegates to the Consultation  which created a provisional government  77  The provisional government soon collapsed from infighting  and Texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836  78  79  During this time of political turmoil  Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna personally led an army to end the revolt  80  The Mexican expedition was initially successful  General Jose de Urrea defeated all the Texian resistance along the coast culminating in the Goliad Massacre  81  Santa Anna s forces  after a thirteen day siege  overwhelmed Texian defenders at the Battle of the Alamo  News of the defeats sparked panic amongst Texas settlers  82  The newly elected Texian delegates to the Convention of 1836 quickly signed a Declaration of Independence on March 2  forming the Republic of Texas  After electing interim officers  the Convention disbanded  83  The new government joined the other settlers in Texas in the Runaway Scrape  fleeing from the approaching Mexican army  82  After several weeks of retreat  the Texian Army commanded by Sam Houston attacked and defeated Santa Anna s forces at the Battle of San Jacinto  84  Santa Anna was captured and forced to sign the Treaties of Velasco  ending the war  85  While Texas had won their independence  political battles raged between two factions of the new Republic  The nationalist faction  led by Mirabeau B  Lamar  advocated the continued independence of Texas  the expulsion of the Native Americans  and the expansion of the Republic to the Pacific Ocean  Their opponents  led by Sam Houston  advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co existence with Native Americans  The conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the Texas Archive War  86  Mexico launched two small expeditions into Texas in 1842  The town of San Antonio was captured twice and Texans were defeated in battle in the Dawson Massacre  Despite these successes  Mexico did not keep an occupying force in Texas  and the republic survived  87  The republic s inability to defend itself added momentum to Texas s eventual annexation into the United States  Statehood Main articles  Texas Annexation and Mexican American War As early as 1837  the Republic made several attempts to negotiate annexation with the United States  88  Opposition within the republic from the nationalist faction  along with strong abolitionist opposition within the United States  slowed Texas s admission into the Union  Texas was finally annexed when the expansionist James K  Polk won the election of 1844  89  On December 29  1845  Congress admitted Texas to the U S  as a constituent state of the Union  90  After Texas s annexation  Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States  While the United States claimed that Texas s border stretched to the Rio Grande  Mexico claimed it was the Nueces River  While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims  the United States had the military strength and the political will to do so  President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor south to the Rio Grande on January 13  1846  A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the Thornton Affair starting the Mexican American War  The first battles of the war were fought in Texas  the Siege of Fort Texas  Battle of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma  After these decisive victories  the United States invaded Mexican territory ending the fighting in Texas  91  After a series of United States victories  the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the two year war  In return  for US  18 250 000  Mexico gave the U S  undisputed control of Texas  ceded the Mexican Cession in 1848  most of which today is called the American Southwest  and Texas s borders were established at the Rio Grande  91  The Compromise of 1850 set Texas s boundaries at their present form  Texas ceded its claims to land which later became half of present day New Mexico  a third of Colorado  and small portions of Kansas  Oklahoma  and Wyoming to the federal government  in return for the assumption of  10 million of the old republic s debt  16  Post war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state  92  Civil War and Reconstruction Main article  Texas in the American Civil War Civil war monument in Galveston  Texas Texas was at war again after the election of 1860  Abraham Lincoln s election triggered South Carolina s declaration of secession from the Union  which was quickly followed by that of five other Lower South states  A State Convention considering secession opened in Austin on January 28  1861  On February 1  by a vote of 166 8  the Convention adopted an Ordinance of Secession from the United States  Texas voters approved this Ordinance on February 23  1861  Texas joined the Confederate States of America  ratifying the permanent C S  Constitution on March 23  1861  3  93  Not all Texans favored secession initially  although many of the same would later support the Southern cause  Texas s most notable unionist was the state Governor  Sam Houston  Not wanting to aggravate the situation  Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops to keep him in office  After refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy  Houston was deposed as governor  94  While far from the major battlefields of the American Civil War  Texas contributed large numbers of men and equipment to the rest of the Confederacy  95  Union troops briefly occupied the state s primary port  Galveston  Texas s border with Mexico was known as the  backdoor of the Confederacy  because trade occurred at the border  bypassing the Union blockade  96  The Confederacy repulsed all Union attempts to shut down this route  95  but Texas s role as a supply state was marginalized in mid 1863 after the Union capture of the Mississippi River  The final battle of the Civil War was fought near Brownsville  Texas at Palmito Ranch 97  with a Confederate victory  Texas descended into anarchy for two months between the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia and the assumption of authority by Union General Gordon Granger  Violence marked the early months of Reconstruction  98 Juneteenth commemorates the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Galveston by General Gordon Granger  over two and a half years after the original announcement  99  100  President Johnson  in 1866  declared the civilian government restored in Texas  101  Despite not meeting reconstruction requirements  Congress readmitted Texas into the Union in 1870  Social volatility continued as the state struggled with agricultural depression and labor issues  102  20th century to present Spindletop On January 10  1901  the first major oil well in Texas  Spindletop  was found south of Beaumont  Other fields were later discovered nearby in East Texas  West Texas  and under the Gulf of Mexico  The resulting  Oil Boom  transformed Texas  103  Oil production eventually averaged three million barrels per day at its peak in 1972  104  The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl dealt a double blow to the state s economy  which had significantly improved since the Civil War  Migrants abandoned the worst hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years  Especially from this period on  blacks left Texas in the Great Migration to get work in the Northern United States or California and to escape the oppression of segregation  105  In 1940  Texas was 74  Anglo  14 4  black  and 11 5  Hispanic  106  World War II had a dramatic impact on Texas  as federal money poured in to build military bases  munitions factories  POW detention camps and Army hospitals  750 000 young men left for service  the cities exploded with new industry  the colleges took on new roles  and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left for much better paying war jobs  never to return to agriculture  107  108  Texas modernized and expanded its system of higher education through the 1960s  The state created a comprehensive plan for higher education  funded in large part by oil revenues  and a central state apparatus designed to manage state institutions more efficiently  These changes helped Texas universities receive federal research funds  109  On November 22  1963  President John F  Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas  110  Government and politics The current Texas Constitution was adopted in 1876  Like many states  it explicitly provides for a separation of powers  The state s Bill of Rights is much larger than its federal counterpart  and has provisions unique to Texas  111  State government Main article  Government of Texas See also  List of Texas state agencies Texas State Capitol at night  Texas has a plural executive branch system limiting the power of the Governor  Except for the Secretary of State  voters elect executive officers independently making candidates being directly answerable to the public  not the Governor  112  This election system has led to some executive branches split between parties  When Republican President George W  Bush served as Texas s governor  the state had a Democratic Lieutenant Governor  Bob Bullock  The executive branch positions consist of the Governor  Lieutenant Governor  Comptroller of Public Accounts  Land Commissioner  Attorney General  Agriculture Commissioner  the three member Texas Railroad Commission  the State Board of Education  and the Secretary of State  112  The bicameral Texas Legislature consists of the House of Representatives  with 150 members  and a Senate  with 31 members  The Speaker of the House leads the House  and the Lieutenant Governor  the Senate  113  The Legislature meets in regular session biennially  but the Governor can call for special sessions as often as desired  114  The state s fiscal year spans from the previous calendar year s September 1 to the current year s August 31  Thus  the FY 2012 dates from September 1  2011 through August 31  2012  The judicial system of Texas is one of the most complex in the United States  with many layers and overlapping jurisdictions  Texas has two courts of last resort  the Texas Supreme Court  for civil cases  and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals  Except for some municipal benches  partisan elections select judges at all levels of the judiciary  the Governor fills vacancies by appointment  115  Texas leads the nation in executions  442 as of October 2009  see Capital punishment in Texas   The Texas Ranger Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety is a law enforcement agency with statewide jurisdiction  Over the years  the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption  They have acted as riot police and as detectives  protected the Texas governor  tracked down fugitives  and functioned as a paramilitary force both for the republic and the state  The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by Stephen F  Austin in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835  The
