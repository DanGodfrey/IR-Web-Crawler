were deported by the government of Portugal during the colonial era  18  in more recent migrations  Romani have also moved to other parts of the New World  19  The Romani language is divided into several dialects  which add up to an estimated number of speakers larger than two million  20  The total number of Romani people is at least twice as large  several times as large according to high

Rom  Romani Romani usage In the Romani language  rom is a masculine noun  meaning  man  husband   with the plural roma  Romani is the feminine adjective  while romano is the masculine adjective  Some Romanies use Rom or Roma as an ethnic name  while others  such as the Sinti  or the Romanichal  do not use this term as a self ascription for the entire ethnic group  21  Sometimes  rom and romani are spelled with a double r  i e   rrom and rromani  In this case rr is used to represent the phoneme      also written as   and rh   which in some Romani dialects has remained different from the one written with a single r  The rr spelling is common particularly in Romania  in order to distinguish from the endonym for Romanians  sg  rom n  pl  rom ni   22  English usage In the English language  according to the Oxford English Dictionary   Rom is a noun  with the plural Roma or Roms  and an adjective  while Romani  Romany  is also a noun  with the plural Romanies or Romanis  and an adjective  Both Rom and Romani have been in use in English since the 19th century as an alternative for Gypsy  Romani was initially spelled Rommany  then Romany  while today the Romani spelling is the most popular spelling  Occasionally  the double r spelling  e g   Rroma  Rromani  mentioned above is also encountered in English texts  Although Roma is used as a designation for the branch of the Romani people with historic concentrations in Eastern Europe and the Balkans  it is increasingly encountered during recent decades 23  24  as a generic term for the Romani people as a whole  25  Because all Romanies use the word Romani as an adjective  the term began to be used as a noun for the entire ethnic group  26  Today  the term Romani is used by most organizations including the United Nations  the Council of Europe  and the US Library of Congress  22  The standard assumption is that the demonyms of the Romani people  Lom and Dom share the same origin  27  28  Gypsy See also  Gypsy  term  The English term Gypsy  or Gipsy  originates from the Greek word for  Egyptian              Aigyptioi  whence modern Greek        gifti   in the belief that the Romanies  or some other Gypsy groups  such as the Balkan Egyptians   originated in Egypt  and in one narrative were exiled as punishment for allegedly harbouring the infant Jesus  29  This exonym is sometimes written with capital letter  to show that it designates an ethnic group  30  The term  gypsy  appears when international research programmes  documents and policies on the community are referred to  However  as a term  gypsy  is considered derogatory by many members of the Roma community because of negative and stereotypical associations with the term  31  As described in Victor Hugo s novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame  the medieval French referred to the Romanies as egyptiens  The term has come to bear pejorative connotations  The word Gypsy in English has become so pervasive that many Romani organizations use it in their own organizational names  In North America  the word gypsy is commonly used as a reference to lifestyle 32  or fashion  and not to the Romani ethnicity  The Spanish term gitano and the French term gitan may have the same origin as a reference to Egypt  33  Population and subgroups Main article  Romani populations This article needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   August 2011  For a variety of reasons  many Romanies choose not to register their ethnic identity in official censuses  There are an estimated four million Romani people in Europe  as of 2002   34  although some high estimates by Romani organizations give numbers as high as 14 million  35  Significant Romani populations are found in the Balkan peninsula  in some Central European states  in Spain  France  Russia and Ukraine  Several more million Romanies may live out of Europe  in particular in the Middle East and in the Americas  The Romani people recognize divisions among themselves based in part on territorial  cultural and dialectal differences and self designation  The main branches are  36  37  38  39  Roma  concentrated in central and eastern Europe and central Italy  emigrated also  mostly from the 19th century onwards  to the rest of Europe  but also on the other continents  Iberian Kale  mostly in Spain  see Romani people in Spain   but also in Portugal  see Romani people in Portugal   Southern France and Latin America  Finnish Kale  in Finland  emigrated also to Sweden  Welsh Kale  in Wales  Romanichal  in the United Kingdom  emigrated also to the United States and Australia  Sinti  in German speaking areas of Europe and some neighboring countries  Manush  in French speaking areas of Western Europe  Romanis l  in Sweden and Norway  Among Romanies there are further internal differentiations  like Bashald   Churari  Luri  Ungaritza  Lovari  Lovara  from Hungary  Machvaya  Machavaya  Machwaya  or Macwaia  from Serbia  Romungro  Modyar or Modgar  from Hungary and neighbouring Carpathian countries  Erlides  also Yerlii or Arli   Xoraxai  Horahane  from Greece Turkey  Boyash  Lingurari  Ludar  Ludari  Rudari  or Zl tari  from Romanian words for various crafts  Lingurari  spoon makers  Rudari  wood crafters or miners  40  i e

Churari above   and L utari  musicians   Some groups which are commonly thought of as Romani  either by surrounding populations or by Romani groups  do not consider themselves to be Romani  This applies to the Balkan Egyptians and the Ashkali  41  Another people who may or may not identify themselves as Roma ni  are the Quinqui or Quinquins of northern Spain and southern France  The Quinquins are of mysterious origins  although the namesake Mercheros hint of their possible Moorish Spanish ethnoancestral origins  therefore some may contend they are Moors in origin  Much of Spain was under Islamic Rule by the Moors until the Spanish Inquisition eradicated the Moors and Islam in the Iberian peninsula by the late 14th and 15th centuries  citation needed  History Main article  History of the Romani people Origins Main article  Origin of the Romani people Linguistic and genetic evidence indicates the Romanies originated from the Indian subcontinent  emigrating from India towards the northwest no earlier than the 11th century  The Romani are generally believed to have originated in central India  possibly in the modern Indian state of Rajasthan  migrating to the northwest  the Punjab region  Sindh and Baluchistan of modern day Pakistan and India  around 250 BC  In the centuries spent here  there may have been close interaction with such established groups as the Rajputs and the Jats  Their subsequent westward migration  possibly in waves  is believed to have occurred between AD 500 and AD 1000  Contemporary populations sometimes suggested as sharing a close relationship to the Romani are the Dom people of Western Asia and North Africa and the Banjara of India  42  The emigration from India likely took place in the context of the raids by Mahmud of Ghazni 43  As these soldiers were defeated  they were moved west with their families into the Byzantine Empire  The 11th century terminus post quem is due to the Romani language showing unambiguous features of the Modern Indo Aryan languages  44  precluding an emigration during the Middle Indic period  Genetic evidence supports the mediaeval migration from India  The Romanies have been described as  a conglomerate of genetically isolated founder populations   45  while a number of common Mendelian disorders among Romanies from all over Europe indicates  a common origin and founder effect   45  46  A study from 2001 by Gresham et al  suggests  a limited number of related founders  compatible with a small group of migrants splitting from a distinct caste or tribal group   47  The same study found that  a single lineage     found across Romani populations  accounts for almost one third of Romani males   47  A 2004 study by Morar et al  concluded that the Romani population  was founded approximately 32 40 generations ago  with secondary and tertiary founder events occurring approximately 16 25 generations ago   48  Possible connection with the Jat people While the South Asian origin of the Romani people has been long considered a certitude  the exact South Asian group from whom the Romanies have descended has been a matter of debate  The discovery in 2009 of the  Jat mutation  that causes a type of glaucoma in Romani populations suggests that the Romani people are the descendants of the Jat people found in Northern India and Pakistan  49  50  This relation to Jats had earlier been suggested by Michael Jan de Goeje in 1883  51  The 2009 glaucoma study however contradicts an earlier study that compared the most common haplotypes found in Romani groups with those found in Jatt Sikhs and Jats from Haryana and found no matches  52  Arrival in Europe The migration of the Romanies through the Middle East and Northern Africa to Europe  First arrival of the Romanies outside Bern in the 15th century  described by the chronicler as getoufte heiden   baptized heathens   and drawn with dark skin and wearing Saracen style clothing and weapons  Spiezer Schilling  p  749   In 1322  an Irish Franciscan monk  Symon Semeonis encountered a migrant group   the descendants of Cain   outside the town of Heraklion  Candia   in Crete  Symon s account is probably the earliest surviving description by a Western chronicler of the Romani people in Europe  In 1350  Ludolphus of Sudheim mentioned a similar people with a unique language whom he called Mandapolos  a word which some theorize was possibly derived from the Greek word mantes  meaning prophet or fortune teller   53  Around 1360  a fiefdom  called the Feudum Acinganorum was established in Corfu  which mainly used Romani serfs and to which the Romanies on the island were subservient  54  55  By the 14th century  the Romanies had reached the Balkans  by 1424  Germany  and by the 16th century  Scotland and Sweden  Some Romanies migrated from Persia through North Africa  reaching the Iberian Peninsula in the 15th century  The two currents met in France  Romanies began immigrating to North America in colonial times  with small groups recorded in Virginia and French Louisiana  Larger scale immigration to the United States began in the 1860s  with groups of Romnaichal from Britain  The largest number immigrated in the early 1900s  mainly from the Vlax group of Kalderash  Many Romanies also settled in South America  When the Romani people arrived in Europe  the initial curiosity of its residents soon changed to hostility against the newcomers  The Romani were enslaved for five centuries in Wallachia and Moldavia  until abolition in 1856  56  Elsewhere in Europe  they were subject to ethnic cleansing  abduction of their children  and forced labor  In England  Romani were sometimes hanged or expelled from small communities  in France  they were branded and their heads were shaved  in Moravia and Bohemia  the women were marked by their ears being severed  As a result  large groups of the Romani moved to the East  toward Poland  which was more tolerant  and Russia  where the Romani were treated more fairly as long as they paid the annual taxes  57  World War II Main article  Porajmos During World War II  the Nazis and the Usta a embarked on a systematic genocide of the Romani  a process known in Romani as the Porajmos  58  Romanies were marked for extermination and sentenced to forced labor and imprisonment in concentration camps  They were often killed on sight  especially by the Einsatzgruppen  mobile killing units  on the Eastern Front  citation needed  The total number of victims has been variously estimated at between 220 000 to 1 500 000  even the lowest number would make the Porajmos one of the largest mass murders in history  citation needed  Post 1945 An 1852 Wallachian poster advertising an auction of Romani slaves in Bucharest  In Communist Eastern Europe  Romanies experienced assimilation schemes and restrictions on cultural freedom  citation needed  The Romani language and Romani music were banned from public performance in Bulgaria  dubious   discuss  In Czechoslovakia  they were labeled a  socially degraded stratum   and Romani women were sterilized as part of a state policy to reduce their population  This policy was implemented with large financial incentives  threats of denying future welfare payments  with misinformation  or after administering drugs  Silverman 1995  Helsinki Watch 1991   Sinti and Roma about to be deported from Germany  May 22  1940  An official inquiry from the Czech Republic  resulting in a report  December 2005   concluded that the Communist authorities had practiced an assimilation policy towards Romanies  which  included efforts by social services to control the birth rate in the Romani community  and that  the problem of sexual sterilization carried out in the Czech Republic  either with improper motivation or illegally  exists  59  with new revealed cases up until 2004  in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia  60  Society and traditional culture A Gipsy Family   Facsimile of a woodcut in the  Cosmographie Universelle  of Munster  in folio  Basle  1552  Main article  Romani society and culture The traditional Romanies place a high value on the extended family  Virginity is essential in unmarried women  Both men and women often marry young  there has been controversy in several countries over the Romani practice of child marriage  Romani law establishes that the man s family must pay a bride price to the bride s parents  but only traditional families still follow this rule  Once married  the woman joins the husband s family  where her main job is to tend to her husband s and her children s needs  as well as to take care of her in laws  The power structure in the traditional Romani household has at its top the oldest man or grandfather  and men in general have more authority than women  Women gain respect and authority as they get older  Young wives begin gaining authority once they have children  Romani social behavior is strictly regulated by Hindu purity laws   marime  or  marhime    still respected by most Roma  and by most older generations of Sinti   This regulation affects many aspects of life  and is applied to actions  people and things  parts of the human body are considered impure  the genital organs  because they produce emissions   as well as the rest of the lower body  Clothes for the lower body  as well as the clothes of menstruating women  are washed separately  Items used for eating are also washed in a different place  Childbirth is considered impure  and must occur outside the dwelling place  The mother is considered impure for forty days after giving birth  Death is considered impure  and affects the whole family of the dead  who remain impure for a period of time  In contrast to the practice of cremating the dead  Romani dead must be buried  61  Cremation and burial are both known from the time of the Rigveda  and both are widely practiced in Hinduism today  although the tendency for higher caste groups is to burn  while lower caste groups in South India tend to bury their dead   62  Some animals are also considered impure  for instance cats because they lick themselves  63  Belonging and exclusion Main articles  Romanipen and Gadjo  non Romani  Romanipen  also romanypen  romanipe  romanype  romanimos  romaimos  romaniya  is a complicated term of Romani philosophy that means totality of the Romani spirit  Romani culture  Romani Law  being a Romani  a set of Romani strains  An ethnic Romani is considered to be a Gadjo  non Romani  in the Romani society if he has no Romanipen  Sometimes a non Romani may be considered to be a Romani if he has Romanipen   usually that is an adopted child   As a concept  Romanipen has been the subject of interest to numerous academic observers  It has been hypothesized that it owes more to a framework of culture rather than simply an adherence to historically received rules  64  Religion Muslim Romanies in Bosnia and Herzegovina  around 1900  This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Migrant Romani populations have adopted the dominant religion of their country of residence  while often preserving aspects of older belief systems and forms of worship  Most Eastern European Romanies are Roman Catholic  Orthodox Christian  or Muslim  Those in Western Europe and the United States are mostly Roman Catholic or Protestant  particularly in southern Spain many are Pentecostal   In Turkey  Egypt  and the Balkans  the Romanies are split into Christian and Muslim populations  Music Main article  Romani music Young Hungarian Romani performing a traditional dance  Romani music plays an important role in Central and Eastern European countries such as Croatia  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Serbia  Montenegro  Bulgaria  the Republic of Macedonia  Albania  Hungary  Slovenia and Romania  and the style and performance practices of Romani musicians have influenced European classical composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms  The l utari who perform at traditional Romanian weddings are virtually all Romani  Probably the most internationally prominent contemporary performers in the l utari tradition are Taraful Haiducilor  Bulgaria s popular  wedding music   too  is almost exclusively performed by Romani musicians such as Ivo Papasov  a virtuoso clarinetist closely associated with this genre and Bulgarian pop folk singer Azis  Many famous classical musicians  such as the Hungarian pianist Georges Cziffra  are Romani  as are many prominent performers of manele  Zdob  i Zdub  one of the most prominent rock bands in Moldova  although not Romanies themselves  draw heavily on Romani music  as do Spitalul de Urgen   in Romania  Shantel in Germany  Goran Bregovi  in Serbia  Darko Rundek in Croatia  Beirut and Gogol Bordello in the United States  Another tradition of Romani music is the genre of the Romani brass band  with such notable practitioners as Boban Markovi  of Serbia  and the brass l utari groups Fanfare Cioc rlia and Fanfare din Cozmesti of Romania  The distinctive sound of Romani music has also strongly influenced bolero  jazz  and flamenco  especially cante jondo  in Europe  European style gypsy jazz   jazz Manouche  or  Sinti jazz   is still widely practiced among the original creators  the Romanie People   one who acknowledged this artistic debt was guitarist Django Reinhardt  Contemporary artists in this tradition known internationally include Stochelo Rosenberg  Bir li Lagr ne  Jimmy Rosenberg  and Tchavolo Schmitt  The Romanies of Turkey have achieved musical acclaim from national and local audiences  Local performers usually perform for special holidays  Their music is usually performed on instruments such as the darbuka and g rnata  A number of nationwide best seller performers are said to be of Romani origin  citation needed  Contemporary art and culture Main article  Romani contemporary art Language Main article  Romani language Most Romanies speak one of several dialects of Romani  65  not in citation given  an Indo Aryan language  They also will often speak the languages of the countries they live in  Typically  they also incorporate loanwords and calques into Romani from the languages of those countries  especially words for terms that the Romani language does not have  Most of the Ciganos of Portugal  the Gitanos of Spain  the Romanichal of the UK  and Scandinavian Travellers have lost their knowledge of pure Romani  and respectively speak the mixed languages Cal   66 Angloromany  and Scandoromani  There are independent groups currently working toward standardizing the language  including groups in Romania  Serbia  Montenegro  the USA  and Sweden  Romani is not currently spoken in India  citation needed  Persecutions Main article  Antiziganism Historical persecution One of the most enduring persecutions against the Romani people was the enslaving of the Romanies  In the Byzantine Empire  they were slaves of the state and it seems the situation was the same in Bulgaria and Serbia until their social organization was destroyed by the Ottoman conquest  Slavery existed on the territory of present day Romania from before the founding of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in 13th 14th century  until it was abolished in stages during the 1840s and 1850s  67  Legislation decreed that all the Romanies living in these states  as well as any others who would immigrate there  were slaves  68  Most of the slaves were of Roma  Gypsy  ethnicity  The exact origins of slavery in the Danubian Principalities are not known  There is some debate over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia and Moldavia as free men or as slaves  Historian Nicolae Iorga associated the Roma people s arrival with the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era  the Romanians taking the Roma from the Mongols as slaves and preserving their status  Other historians consider that they were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars  The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols  67  While it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars  the bulk of them came from south of the Danube at the end of the 14th century  some time after the foundation of Wallachia  By then  the institution of slavery was already established in Moldavia and possibly in both principalities  but the arrival of the Roma made slavery a widespread practice  The Tatar slaves  smaller in numbers  were eventually merged into the Roma population  69  The arrival of some branches of the Romani people in Western Europe in the 15th century was precipitated by the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans  Although the Romanies themselves were refugees from the conflicts in southeastern Europe  they were mistaken by the local population in the West  because of their foreign appearance  as part of the Ottoman invasion  the German Reichstags at Landau and Freiburg in 1496 1498 declared the Romanies as spies of the Turks   In Western Europe  this resulted in a violent history of persecution and attempts of ethnic cleansing until the modern era  As time passed  other accusations were added against local Romanies  accusations specific to this area  against non assimilated minorities   like that of bringing the plague  usually sharing their burden together with the local Jews  70  One example of official persecution of the Romani is exemplified by The Great Roundup of Spanish Romanies  Gitanos  in 1749  The Spanish monarchy ordered a nationwide raid that led to separation of families and placement of all able bodied men into forced labor camps  Later in the 19th century  Romani immigration was forbidden on a racial basis in areas outside Europe  mostly in the English speaking world  in 1885 the United States outlawed the entry of the Roma  and also in some South American countries  in 1880 Argentina adopted a similar policy   70  Holocaust Main article  Porajmos Romani arrivals at the Belzec death camp await instructions  The persecution of the Romanies reached a peak during World War II in the Porajmos  the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis during the Holocaust  In 1935  the Nuremberg laws stripped the Romani people living in Nazi Germany of their citizenship  after which they were subjected to violence  imprisonment in concentration camps and later genocide in extermination camps  The policy was extended in areas occupied by the Nazis during the war  and it was also applied by their allies  notably the Independent State of Croatia  Romania and Hungary  Because no accurate pre war census figures exist for the Romanis  it is impossible to accurately assess the actual number of victims  Ian Hancock  director of the Program of Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin  proposes a figure of up to a million and a half  while an estimate of between 220 000 and 500 000 was made by Sybil Milton  formerly senior historian of the U S  Holocaust Memorial Museum  71  In Central Europe  the extermination in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was so thorough that the Bohemian Romani language became extinct  citation needed  Forced assimilation In the Habsburg Monarchy under Maria Theresa  1740 1780   a series of decrees tried to force the Romanies to permanently settle  removed rights to horse and wagon ownership  1754   renamed them as  New Citizens  and forced Romani boys into military service if they had no trade  1761   forced them to register with the local authorities  1767   and prohibited marriage between Romanies  1773   Her successor Josef II prohibited the wearing of traditional Romani clothing and the use of the Romani language  punishable by flogging  72  In Spain  attempts to assimilate the Gitanos were under way as early as 1619  when Gitanos were forcibly settled  the use of the Romani language was prohibited  Gitano men and women were sent to separate workhouses and their children sent to orphanages  Similar prohibitions took place in 1783 under King Charles III  who prohibited the nomadic lifestyle  the use of the Calo language  Romani clothing  their trade in horses and other itinerant trades  The use of the word gitano was also forbidden to further assimilation  Ultimately these measures failed  as the rest of the population rejected the integration of the Gitanos  72  73  Other examples of forced assimilation include Norway  where a law was passed in 1896 permitting the state to remove children from their parents and place them in state institutions  74  This resulted in some 1 500 Romani children being taken from their parents in the 20th century  75  Contemporary issues Main article  Modern Antiziganism Amnesty International reports continued instances of Antizigan discrimination during the 20th Century  particularly in Bulgaria  Greece  Italy  Romania  Serbia 76 Slovakia  77 Hungary  78 Slovenia  79  and Kosovo  80  Czechoslovakia carried out a policy of sterilization of Romani women  starting in 1973  81  The dissidents of the Charter 77 denounced it in 1977 78 as a  genocide   but the practice continued through the Velvet Revolution of 1989  82  A 2005 report by the Czech government s independent ombudsman  Otakar Motejl  identified dozens of cases of coercive sterilization between 1979 and 2001  and called for criminal investigations and possible prosecution against several health care workers and administrators  83  In 2008  following the brutal murder of a woman in Rome at the hands of a young man from a local Romani encampment  84  the Italian government declared that Italy s Romani population represented a national security risk and that swift action was required to address the emergenza nomadi  nomad emergency   85  Specifically  officials in the Italian government accused the Romanies of being responsible for rising crime rates in urban areas  One police raid in 2007 freed many of the children belonging to a Romani gang who used to steal by day  and who were locked in a shed by night by members of the gang  86  The 2008 deaths of Cristina and Violetta Djeordsevic  two Roma children who drowned while Italian beach goers remained unperturbed  brought international attention to the relationship between Italians and the Roma people  Forced repatriation Main article  French Romani repatriation In the summer of 2010 French authorities demolished at least 51 illegal Roma camps and began the process of repatriating their residents to their countries of origin  87  This followed tensions between the French state and Roma communities  which had been heightened after French police opened fire and killed a traveller who drove through a police checkpoint  hitting an officer  and attempted to hit two more officers at another checkpoint  In retaliation a group of Roma  armed with hatchets and iron bars  attacked the police station of Saint Aignan  toppled traffic lights and road signs and burned three cars  88  89  The French government has been accused of perpetrating these actions to pursue its political agenda  90  EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding stated that the European Commission should take legal action against France over the issue  calling the deportations  a disgrace   Purportedly  a leaked file dated 5 August  sent from the Interior Ministry to regional police chiefs included the instruction   Three hundred camps or illegal settlements must be cleared within three months  Roma camps are a priority   91  Fictional representations Main article  Fictional representations of Romani people Vincent van Gogh  The Caravans   Gypsy Camp near Arles  1888  Oil on canvas  Many fictional depictions of Romani people in literature and art present romanticized narratives of their supposed mystical powers of fortune telling or their supposed irascible or passionate temper paired with an indomitable love of freedom and a habit of criminality  Particularly notable are classics like the story Carmen by Prosper M rim e and the opera based on it by Georges Bizet  Victor Hugo s The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Miguel de Cervantes  La Gitanilla  The Romani were also heavily romanticized in the Soviet Union  a classic example being the 1975 Tabor ukhodit v Nebo  A more realistic depiction of contemporary Romani in the Balkans  featuring Romani lay actors speaking in their native dialects  although still playing with established clich s of a Romani penchant for both magic and crime  was presented by Emir Kusturica in his Time of the Gypsies  1988  and Black Cat  White Cat  1998   In contemporary literature The Romani ethnicity is often used for characters in contemporary fantasy literature  In such literature  the Romani are often portrayed as possessing archaic occult knowledge passed down through the ages  This frequent use of the ethnicity has given rise to  gypsy archetypes  in popular contemporary literature  citation needed  A UK example is the Freya
