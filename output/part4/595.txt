of the central United States  Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana  the Missouri flows east and south for 2 341 miles  3 767 km  before entering the Mississippi River north of St  Louis  Missouri  The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated  semi arid watershed of more than half a million square miles  1 300 000 km2   which includes parts of ten U S  states and two Canadian provinces  For over 12 000 years  people have depended on the Missouri and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation  More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed  most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on the enormous buffalo herds that once roamed through the Great Plains  The first Europeans discovered the river in the late seventeenth century  and the region passed through Spanish and French hands several times before finally becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase  The Missouri was long believed to be part of the Northwest Passage   a water route from the Atlantic to the Pacific   but when Lewis and Clark became the first to travel the river s entire length  they confirmed the nonexistence of the mythical pathway  The Missouri was one of the main routes for the westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century  The growth of the fur trade in the early 1800s laid much of the groundwork as trappers explored the region and blazed trails  Pioneers headed west en masse beginning in the 1830s  first by covered wagon  then by the growing numbers of steamboats entering service on the river  Former Native American lands in the watershed were taken over by settlers  leading to some of the most longstanding and violent wars against indigenous peoples in American history  During the 20th century  the Missouri River basin was extensively developed for irrigation  flood control and the generation of hydroelectric power  Fifteen dams impound the main stem of the river  with hundreds more on tributaries  Meanders have been cut and the river channelized to improve navigation  reducing its length by almost 200 miles  320 km  from pre development times  Although the lower Missouri valley is now a populous and highly productive agricultural and industrial region  heavy development has taken its toll on wildlife and fish populations as well as water quality

750 m  above sea level  on the western slopes of Mount Jefferson in the Centennial Mountains  Flowing west then north  it flows first in Hell Roaring Creek  then west into the Red Rock  swings northeast to become the Beaverhead  it finally joins with the Big Hole to form the Jefferson  The Firehole River originates at Madison Lake in Wyoming s Yellowstone National Park and joins with the Gibbon to form the Madison  while the Gallatin River rises out of Gallatin Lake  also in the national park  These two streams then flow north and northwest into Montana  9  10  Holter Lake  a reservoir on the upper Missouri River The Missouri River officially starts at the confluence of the Jefferson and Madison in Missouri Headwaters State Park near Three Forks  Montana  and is joined by the Gallatin a mile   6 km  downstream  The Missouri then passes through Canyon Ferry Lake  a reservoir west of the Big Belt Mountains  Issuing from the mountains near Cascade  the river flows northeast to the city of Great Falls  where it drops over the Great Falls of the Missouri  a series of five substantial waterfalls  It then winds east through a scenic region of canyons and badlands known as the Missouri Breaks  receiving the Marias River from the west then widening into the Fort Peck Lake reservoir a few miles above the confluence with the Musselshell River  Farther on  the river passes through the Fort Peck Dam  and immediately downstream  the Milk River joins from the north  9  10  Flowing eastwards through the plains of eastern Montana  the Missouri receives the Poplar River from the north before crossing into North Dakota where the Yellowstone River  its greatest tributary by volume  joins from the southwest  At the confluence  the Yellowstone is actually the larger river  n 1  The Missouri then meanders east past Williston and into Lake Sakakawea  the reservoir formed by Garrison Dam  Below the dam the Missouri receives the Knife River from the west and flows south to Bismarck  the capital of North Dakota  where the Heart River joins from the west  It slows into the Lake Oahe reservoir just before the Cannonball River confluence  While it continues south  eventually reaching Oahe Dam in South Dakota  the Grand  Moreau and Cheyenne Rivers all join the Missouri from the west  9  10  The Missouri makes a bend to the southeast as it winds through the Great Plains  receiving the Niobrara River and many smaller tributaries from the southwest  It then proceeds to form the boundary of South Dakota and Nebraska  then after being joined by the James River from the north  forms the Iowa Nebraska boundary  At Sioux City the Big Sioux River comes in from the north  The Missouri flows south to the city of Omaha where it receives its longest tributary  the Platte River  from the west  Downstream  it begins to define the Nebraska Missouri border  then flows between Missouri and Kansas  The Missouri swings east at Kansas City  where the Kansas River enters from the west  and so on into north central Missouri  It passes south of Columbia and receives the Osage and Gasconade Rivers from the south downstream of Jefferson City  The river then rounds the northern side of St  Louis to join the Mississippi River on the border between Missouri and Illinois  9  10   edit  Watershed There is only one river with a personality  a sense of humor  and a woman s caprice  a river that goes traveling sidewise  that interferes in politics  rearranges geography  and dabbles in real estate  a river that plays hide and seek with you today and tomorrow follows you around like a pet dog with a dynamite cracker tied to his tail  That river is the Missouri   George Fitch  circa 1840 13  With a drainage basin spanning 529 350 square miles  1 371 000 km2   6  the Missouri s catchment encompasses nearly one sixth of the area of the United States 14  or just over five percent of the continent of North America  15  Comparable to the size of the Canadian province of Quebec  the watershed encompasses most of the central Great Plains  stretching from the Rocky Mountains in the west to the Mississippi River Valley in the east and from the southern extreme of western Canada to the border of the Arkansas River watershed  Compared with the Mississippi River above their confluence  the Missouri is twice as long n 2  and drains an area three times as large  n 3  The Missouri accounts for 45 percent of the annual flow of the Mississippi past St  Louis  and as much as 70 percent in certain droughts  7  17  As of 1990  the Missouri River watershed was home to about 12 million people  6  18  This includes the entire population of the U S  state of Nebraska  parts of the U S  states of Colorado  Iowa  Kansas  Minnesota  Missouri  Montana  North Dakota  South Dakota  and Wyoming  and small southern portions of the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan  6  The watershed s largest city is Denver  Colorado  with a population of more than six hundred thousand  Denver is the main city of the Front Range Urban Corridor whose cities had a combined population of over four million in 2005  19  making it the largest metropolitan area in the Missouri River basin  18  Other major population centers   mostly located in the southeastern portion of the watershed   include Omaha  Nebraska  situated north of the confluence of the Missouri and Platte Rivers  Kansas City  Missouri   Kansas City  Kansas  located at the confluence of the Missouri with the Kansas River  and the St  Louis metropolitan area  situated south of the Missouri River just above its mouth on the Mississippi  10  In contrast  the northwestern part of the watershed is sparsely populated  However  many northwestern cities  such as Billings  Montana  are among the fastest growing in the Missouri basin  18  With more than 170 000 square miles  440 000 km2  under the plow  the Missouri River watershed includes roughly one fourth of all the agricultural land in the United States  providing more than a third of the country s wheat  flax  barley and oats  However  only 11 000 square miles  28 000 km2  of farmland in the basin is irrigated  A further 281 000 square miles  730 000 km2  of the basin is devoted to the raising of livestock  mainly cattle  Forested areas of the watershed  mostly second growth  total about 43 700 square miles  113 000 km2   Urban areas  on the other hand  comprise less than 13 000 square miles  34 000 km2  of land  Most built up areas are located along the main stem and a few major tributaries  including the Platte and Yellowstone Rivers  18  20  A relatively undeveloped reach of the river near Rocheport  Missouri Elevations in the watershed vary widely  ranging from just over 400 feet  120 m  at the Missouri s mouth 1  to the 14 278 foot  4 352 m  summit of Grays Peak in central Colorado  18  21  The river itself drops a total of 8 626 feet  2 629 m  from Brower s Spring  the farthest source  Although the plains of the watershed have extremely little local vertical relief  the land rises about 10 feet per mile  1 9 m km  from east to west  The elevation is less than 500 feet  150 m  at the eastern border of the watershed  but is over 3 000 feet  910 m  above sea level in many places at the base of the Rockies  10  The Missouri s drainage basin has highly variable weather and rainfall patterns  Overall  the watershed is defined by a Continental climate with warm  wet summers and harsh  cold winters  Most of the watershed receives an average of 8 to 10 inches  200 to 250 mm  of precipitation each year  18  However  the westernmost portions of the basin in the Rockies as well as southeastern regions in Missouri may receive as much as 40 inches  1 000 mm   18  The vast majority of precipitation occurs in winter  although the upper basin is known for short lived but intense summer thunderstorms such as the one which produced the 1972 Black Hills flood through Rapid City  South Dakota  22  Winter temperatures in Montana  Wyoming and Colorado may drop as low as  60  F   51  C   while summer highs in Kansas and Missouri have reached 120  F  49  C  at times  18  As one of the continent s most significant river systems  23  the Missouri s drainage basin borders on many other major watersheds of the United States and Canada  The Continental Divide  running along the spine of the Rocky Mountains  forms most of the western border of the Missouri watershed  23  The Clark Fork and Snake River  both part of the Columbia River basin  drain the area west of the Rockies in Montana  Idaho and western Wyoming  The Columbia  Missouri and Colorado River watersheds meet at Three Waters Mountain in Wyoming s Wind River Range  24  South of there  the Missouri basin is bordered on the west by the drainage of the Green River  a tributary of the Colorado  then on the south by the mainstem of the Colorado  Both the Colorado and Columbia Rivers flow to the Pacific Ocean  However  a large endorheic drainage called the Great Divide Basin exists between the Missouri and Green watersheds in western Wyoming  This area is sometimes counted as part of the Missouri River watershed  even though its waters do not flow to either side of the Continental Divide  25  To the north  the much lower Laurentian Divide separates the Missouri River watershed from those of the Oldman River  a tributary of the South Saskatchewan River  as well as the Souris  Sheyenne  and smaller tributaries of the Red River of the North  All of these streams are part of Canada s Nelson River drainage basin  which empties into Hudson Bay  There are also several large endorheic basins between the Missouri and Nelson watersheds in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan  23  The Minnesota and Des Moines Rivers  tributaries of the upper Mississippi  drain most of the area bordering the eastern side of the Missouri River basin  Finally  on the south  the Ozark Mountains and other low divides through central Missouri  Kansas and Colorado separate the Missouri watershed from those of the White River and Arkansas River  also tributaries of the Mississippi River  23   edit  Major tributaries The Yellowstone River  the fifth longest tributary of the Missouri  which it joins in North Dakota Main article  List of tributaries of the Missouri River Over 95 significant tributaries and hundreds of smaller ones feed the Missouri River  with most of the larger ones coming in as the river draws close to the mouth  26  Most rivers and streams in the Missouri River basin flow from west to east  following the incline of the Great Plains  however  some eastern tributaries such as the James  Big Sioux and Grand River systems flow from north to south  18  The Missouri s largest tributaries by runoff are the Yellowstone in Montana and Wyoming  the Platte in Wyoming  Colorado  and Nebraska  and the Kansas Republican Smoky Hill and Osage in Kansas and Missouri  Each of these tributaries drains an area greater than 10 000 square miles  26 000 km2   and has an average discharge greater than 5 000 cu ft s  140 m3 s   16  27  The Yellowstone River has the highest discharge  even though the Platte is longer and drains a larger area  In fact  the Yellowstone s flow is about 13 800 cu ft s  390 m3 s  28    accounting for sixteen percent of total runoff in the Missouri basin and nearly double that of the Platte  29  On the other end of the scale is the tiny Roe River in Montana  which at 201 feet  61 m  long is commonly held to be the world s shortest river  30  Longest

their respective catchment areas and flows  Length is measured to the hydrologic source  regardless of naming convention  The main stem of the Kansas River  for example  is 148 miles  238 km  long  31  However  including the longest headwaters tributaries  the 453 mile  729 km  Republican River and the 156 mile  251 km  Arikaree River  brings the total length to 749 miles  1 205 km   31  Similar naming issues are encountered with the Platte River  whose longest tributary  the North Platte River  is more than twice as long as its mainstream  31  The Missouri s headwaters above Three Forks extend much farther upstream than the main stem  Measured to the farthest source at Brower s Spring  the Jefferson River is 298 miles  480 km  long  18  Thus measured to its highest headwaters  the Missouri River stretches for 2 639 miles  4 247 km   When combined with the lower Mississippi  the Missouri and its headwaters form part of the fourth longest river system in the world  at 3 745 miles  6 027 km   41   edit  Discharge Nebraska s Fort Calhoun Nuclear Generating Station was inundated when the Missouri River flooded in 2011 By discharge  the Missouri is the ninth largest river of the United States  after the Mississippi  St  Lawrence  Ohio  Columbia  Niagara  Yukon  Detroit  and St  Clair  The latter two  however  are sometimes considered part of a strait between Lake Huron and Lake Erie  42  Among rivers of North America as a whole  the Missouri is thirteenth largest  after the Mississippi  Mackenzie  St  Lawrence  Ohio  Columbia  Niagara  Yukon  Detroit  St  Clair  Fraser  Slave  and Koksoak  42  43  As the Missouri drains a predominantly semi arid region  its discharge is much lower and more variable than other North American rivers of comparable length  Before the construction of dams  the river flooded twice each year   once in the  April Rise  or  Spring Fresh   with the melting of snow on the plains of the watershed  and in the  June Rise   caused by snowmelt and summer rainstorms in the Rocky Mountains  The latter was far more destructive  with the river increasing to over ten times its normal discharge in some years  44  45  The Missouri s discharge is affected by over 17 000 reservoirs with an aggregate capacity of some 141 million acre feet  173 9 km3   18  By providing flood control  the reservoirs dramatically reduce peak flows and increase low flows  Evaporation from reservoirs significantly reduces the river s runoff  causing an annual loss of over three million acre feet  3 8 km3  from mainstem reservoirs alone  18  Monthly

Geology High silt content makes the Missouri River  left  noticeably lighter than the Mississippi River  right  at their confluence north of St  Louis  The Rocky Mountains of southwestern Montana at the headwaters of the Missouri River first rose in the Laramide Orogeny  a mountain building episode that occurred from around 70 to 45 million years ago  the end of the Mesozoic through the early Cenozoic   55  This orogeny uplifted Cretaceous rocks along the western side of the Western Interior Seaway  a vast shallow sea that stretched from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico  and deposited the sediments that now underlie much of the drainage basin of the Missouri River  56  57  58  This Laramide uplift caused the sea to retreat and laid the framework for a vast drainage system of rivers flowing from the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains  the predecessor of the modern day Mississippi watershed  59  60  61  The Laramide Orogeny is essential to modern Missouri River hydrology  as snow and ice melt from the Rockies provide the majority of the flow in the Missouri and its tributaries  62  The Missouri and many of its tributaries cross the Great Plains  flowing over or cutting into the Ogallala Group and older mid Cenozoic sedimentary rocks  The lowest major Cenozoic unit  the White River Formation  was deposited between roughly 35 and 29 million years ago 63  64  and consists of claystone  sandstone  limestone  and conglomerate  64  65  Channel sandstones and finer grained overbank deposits of the fluvial 66 Arikaree Group were deposited between 29 and 19 million years ago  63  The Miocene age Ogallala and the slightly younger Pliocene age Broadwater Formation deposited atop the Arikaree Group  and are formed from material eroded off of the Rocky Mountains during a time of increased generation of topographic relief  63  67  these formations stretch from the Rocky Mountains nearly to the Iowa border and give the Great Plains much of their gentle but persistent eastward tilt  and also constitute a major aquifer  68  Immediately before the Quaternary Ice Age  the Missouri River was likely split into three segments  an upper portion that drained northwards into Hudson Bay  69  70  and middle and lower sections that flowed eastward down the regional slope  71  As the Earth plunged into the Ice Age  a pre Illinoian  or possibly the Illinoian  glaciation diverted the Missouri River southeastwards towards its present confluence with the Mississippi and caused it to integrate into a single river system that cuts across the regional slope  72  In western Montana  the Missouri River is thought to have once flowed north then east around the Bear Paw Mountains  Sapphires are found in some spots along the river in western Montana  73  74  Advances of the continental ice sheets diverted the river and its tributaries  causing them to pool up into large temporary lakes such as Glacial Lakes Great Falls  Musselshell and others  As the lakes rose the water in them often spilled across adjacent local drainage divides  creating now abandoned channels and coulees including the Shonkin Sag  100 miles  160 km  long  When the glaciers retreated  the Missouri flowed in a new course along the south side of the Bearpaws and the lower part of the Milk River tributary took over the original main channel  75  The Missouri s nickname  the  Big Muddy   was inspired by its enormous loads of sediment or silt   some of the largest of any North American river  2  76  In its pre development state  the river transported some 175 320 million short tons  193 290 million t  per year  77  The construction of dams and levees has drastically reduced this to 20 25 million short tons  18 23 million t  in the present day  78  Much of this sediment is derived from the river s floodplain  also called the meander belt  every time the river changed course  it would erode tons of soil and rocks from its banks  However  damming and channeling the river has kept it from reaching its natural sediment sources along most of its course  Reservoirs along the Missouri trap roughly 36 4 million short tons  32 9 million t  of sediment each year  18  Despite this  the river still transports more than half the total silt that empties into the Gulf of Mexico  the Mississippi River Delta  formed by sediment deposits at the mouth of the Mississippi  constitutes a majority of sediments carried by the Missouri  78  79   edit  First peoples See also  Plains Indians Archaeological evidence  especially in Missouri  suggests that man first made his presence in the watershed of the Missouri River between 10 000 and 12 000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene  80  During the end of the last glacial period  a great migration of humans began  traveling via the Bering land bridge from Eurasia into and throughout the Americas  As they traveled slowly over centuries  the Missouri River formed one of the main migration paths  Most settled in the Ohio Valley and the lower Mississippi River Valley  but many  including the Mound builders  stayed along the Missouri  becoming the ancestors of the later indigenous peoples of the Great Plains  81  Karl Bodmer  A Mandan Village  c  1840 1843 The Native Americans that lived along the Missouri had access to ample food  water  and shelter  Many migratory animals inhabited the plains at the time  providing them meat  clothing  and other everyday items  there were also great riparian areas in the river s floodplain that provided them with natural herbs and staple foods  82  No written records from the tribes and peoples of the pre European period exist because they did not use writing  According to the writings of explorers  some of the major tribes along the Missouri River included the Otoe  Missouria  Omaha  Ponca  Brul   Lakota  Sioux  Arikara  Hidatsa  Mandan  Assiniboine  Gros Ventres and Blackfeet  83  Natives used the Missouri  at least to a limited extent  as a path of trade and transport  In addition  the river and its tributaries formed tribal boundaries  Lifestyles of the indigenous mostly centered around a semi nomadic culture  many tribes would have different summer and winter camps  However  the center of Native American wealth and trade lay along the Missouri River in the Dakotas region on its great bend south  84  A large cluster of walled Mandan  Hidatsa and Arikara villages situated on bluffs and islands of the river was home to thousands  and later served as a market and trading post used by early French and British explorers and fur traders  85  Following the introduction of horses to Missouri River tribes  possibly from feral European introduced populations  natives  way of life changed dramatically  The use of the horse allowed them to travel greater distances  and thus facilitated hunting  communications and trade  86  Once  tens of millions of American bison  commonly called buffalo   one of the keystone species of the Great Plains and the Ohio Valley  roamed the plains of the Missouri River basin  87  Most Native American groups in the basin relied heavily on the bison as a food source  and their hides and bones served to create other household items  In time  the species came to benefit from the indigenous peoples  periodic controlled burnings of the grasslands surrounding the Missouri to clear out old and dead growth  The large bison population of the region gave rise to the term great bison belt  an area of rich annual grasslands that extended from Alaska to Mexico along the eastern flank of the Continental Divide  88  However  after the arrival of Europeans in North America  both the bison and the Native Americans saw a rapid decline in population  89  Hunting eliminated bison populations east of the Mississippi River by 1833 and reduced the numbers in the Missouri basin to a mere few hundred  Foreign diseases such as smallpox raged across the land  decimating Native American populations  Left without their primary source of sustenance  many of the remaining indigenous people were amalgamated into resettlement areas and reservations  90   edit  Early explorers The Missouri in North Dakota  which was the furthest upstream that French explorers managed on the river In May 1673  the French explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette left the settlement of St  Ignace on Lake Huron and traveled down the Wisconsin and Mississippi Rivers  aiming to reach the Pacific Ocean  In late June  Jolliet and Marquette became the first documented European discoverers of the Missouri River  which according to their journals was in full flood  91   I never saw anything more terrific   Jolliet wrote   a tangle of entire trees from the mouth of the Pekistanoui  Missouri  with such impetuosity that one could not attempt to cross it without great danger  The commotion was such that the water was made muddy by it and could not clear itself   92  93  They recorded Pekitanoui or Pekistanoui as the local name for the Missouri  However  the party never explored the Missouri beyond its mouth  nor did they linger in the area  In addition  they later learned that the Mississippi drained into the Gulf of Mexico and not the Pacific as they had originally presumed  the expedition turned back about 440 miles  710 km  short of the Gulf at the confluence of the Arkansas River with the Mississippi  92  In 1682  France expanded its territorial claims in North America to include land on the western side of the Mississippi River  which included the lower portion of the Missouri  However  the Missouri itself remained formally unexplored until  tienne de Veniard  Sieur de Bourgmont commanded an expedition in 1714 that reached at least as far as the mouth of the Platte River  It is unclear exactly how far Bourgmont traveled beyond there  he described the blond haired Mandans in his journals  so it is likely he reached as far as their villages in present day North Dakota  94  Later that year  Bourgmont published The Route To Be Taken To Ascend The Missouri River  the first known document to use the name  Missouri River   many of the names he gave to tributaries  mostly for the native tribes that lived along them  are still in use today  The expedition s discoveries eventually found their way to cartographer Guillaume Delisle  who used the information to create a map of the lower Missouri  95  In 1718  Jean Baptiste Le Moyne  Sieur de Bienville requested that the French government bestow upon Bourgmont the Cross of St  Louis because of his  outstanding service to France   95  Massacre of the Villasur Expedition  painted c  1720 Bourgmont had in fact been in trouble with the French colonial authorities since 1706  when he deserted his post as commandant of Fort Detroit after poorly handling an attack by the Ottawa that resulted in thirty one deaths  96  However  his reputation was enhanced in 1720 when the Pawnee   who had earlier been befriended by Bourgmont   massacred the Spanish Villasur expedition near present day Columbus  Nebraska on the Missouri River and temporarily ending Spanish encroachment on French Louisiana  97  Bourgmont established Fort Orleans  the first European settlement of any kind on the Missouri River  near present day Brunswick  Missouri  in 1723  The following year Bourgmont led an expedition to enlist Comanche support against the Spanish  who continued to show interest in taking over the Missouri  In 1725 Bourgmont brought the chiefs of several Missouri River tribes to visit France  There he was raised to the rank of nobility and did not accompany the chiefs back to North America  Fort Orleans was either abandoned or its small contingent massacred by Native Americans in 1726  95  98  The French and Indian War erupted when territorial disputes between France and Great Britain in North America reached a head in 1754  By 1763  France was defeated by the much greater strength of the British army and was forced to cede its Canadian possessions to the English and Louisiana to the Spanish in the Treaty of Paris  amounting to most of its colonial holdings in North America  99  Initially  the Spanish did not extensively explore the Missouri and let French traders continue their activities under license  However  this ended after news of the British Hudson s Bay Company incursions in the upper Missouri River watershed was brought back following an expedition by Jacques D Eglise in the early 1790s  100  In 1795 the Spanish chartered the Company of Discoverers and Explorers of the Missouri  popularly referred to as the  Missouri Company   and offered a reward for the first person to reach the Pacific Ocean via the Missouri  In 1794 and 1795 expeditions led by Jean Baptiste Truteau and Antoine Simon Lecuyer de la Jonch re did not even make it as far north as the Mandan villages in central North Dakota  101  Arguably the most successful of the Missouri Company expeditions was that of James MacKay and John Evans  102  The two set out along the Missouri  and established Fort Charles about 20 miles  32 km  south of present day Sioux City as a winter camp in 1795  At the Mandan villages in North Dakota  they expelled several British traders  and while talking to the populace they pinpointed the location of the Yellowstone River  which was called Roche Jaune   Yellow Rock   by the French  Although MacKay and Evans failed to accomplish their original goal of reaching the Pacific  they did create the first accurate map of the upper Missouri River  101  103  In 1795  the young United States and Spain signed Pinckney s Treaty  which recognized American rights to navigate the Mississippi River and store goods for export in New Orleans  104  Three years later  Spain revoked the treaty and in 1800 secretly returned Louisiana to Napoleonic France in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso  This transfer was so secret that the Spanish continued to administer the territory  In 1801  Spain restored rights to use the Mississippi and New Orleans to the United States  105  Map of western North America drawn by Lewis and Clark Fearing that the cutoffs could occur again  President Thomas Jefferson proposed to buy the port of New Orleans from France for  10 million  Instead  faced with a debt crisis  Napoleon offered to sell the entirety of Louisiana  including the Missouri River  for  15 million   amounting to less than 3  per acre  The deal was signed in 1803  doubling the size of the United States with the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory  106  In 1803  Jefferson instructed Meriwether Lewis to explore the Missouri and search for a water route to the Pacific Ocean  By then  it had been discovered that the Columbia River system  which drains into the Pacific  had a similar latitude as the headwaters of the Missouri River  and it was widely believed that a connection or short portage existed between the two  107  However  Spain balked at the takeover  citing that they had never formally returned Louisiana to the French  Spanish authorities warned Lewis not to take the journey and forbade him from seeing the MacKay and Evans map of the Missouri  although Lewis eventually managed to gain access to it  108  109  Meriwether Lewis and William Clark began their famed expedition in 1804 with a party of thirty three people in three boats  110  Although they became the first Europeans to travel the entire length of the Missouri and reach the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia  they found no trace of the Northwest Passage  The maps made by Lewis and Clark  especially those of the Pacific Northwest region  provided a foundation for future explorers and emigrants  They also negotiated relations with multiple Native American tribes and wrote extensive reports on the climate  ecology and geology of the region  Many present day names of geographic features in the upper Missouri basin originated from their expedition  111   edit  American frontier  edit  Fur trade Fur Traders on Missouri River  painted by George Caleb Bingham c  1845 As early as the 18th century  fur trappers entered the extreme northern basin of the Missouri River in the hopes of finding populations of beaver and river otter  the sale of whose pelts drove the thriving North American fur trade  They came from many different places   some from the Canadian fur corporations at Hudson Bay  some from the Pacific Northwest  see also Maritime Fur Trade   and some from the midwestern United States  Most did not stay in the area for long  as they failed to find significant resources  112  The first glowing reports of country rich with thousands of game animals came in 1806 when Meriwether Lewis and William Clark returned from their two year expedition  Their journals described lands rich with thousands of buffalo  beaver  and river otter  and also an abundant population of sea otters on the Pacific Northwest coast  In 1807  explorer Manuel Lisa organized an expedition which would lead to the explosive growth of the fur trade in the upper Missouri River country  Lisa and his crew traveled up the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers  trading manufactured items in return for furs from local Native American tribes  and established a fort at the confluence of the Yellowstone and a tributary  the Bighorn  in southern Montana  Although the business started small  it quickly grew into a thriving trade  113  114  Lisa s men started construction of Fort Raymond  which sat on a bluff overlooking the confluence of the Yellowstone and Bighorn  in the fall of 1807  The fort would serve primarily as a trading post for bartering with the Native Americans for furs  115  This method was unlike that of the Pacific Northwest fur trade  which involved trappers hired by the various fur enterprises  namely Hudson s Bay  Fort Raymond was later replaced by Fort Lisa at the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone in North Dakota  a second fort also called Fort Lisa was built downstream on the Missouri River in Nebraska  In 1809 the St  Louis Missouri Fur Company was founded by Lisa in conjunction with William Clark and Pierre Choteau  among others  116  117  In 1828  the American Fur Company founded Fort Union at the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers  Fort Union gradually became the main headquarters for the fur trade in the upper Missouri basin  118  Fur trapping activities in the early 19th century encompassed nearly all of the Rocky Mountains on both the eastern and western slopes  Trappers of the Hudson s Bay Company  St  Louis Missouri Fur Company  American Fur Company  Rocky Mountain Fur Company  North West Company and other outfits worked thousands of streams in the Missouri watershed as well as the neighboring Columbia  Colorado  Arkansas  and Saskatchewan river systems  During this period  the trappers  also called mountain men  blazed trails through the wilderness that would later form the paths pioneers and settlers would travel by into the West  Transport of the thousands of beaver pelts required ships  providing one of the first large motives for river transport on the Missouri to start  119  As the 1830s drew to a close  the fur industry slowly began to die as silk replaced beaver fur as a desirable clothing item  By this time  also  the beaver population of streams in the Rocky Mountains had been decimated by intense hunting  Furthermore  frequent Native American attacks on trading posts made it dangerous for employees of the fur companies  In some regions  the industry continued well into the 1840s  but in others such as the Platte River valley  declines of the beaver population contributed to an earlier demise  120  The fur trade finally disappeared in the Great Plains around 1850  with the primary center of industry shifting to the Mississippi Valley and central Canada  Despite the demise of the once prosperous trade  however  its legacy led to the opening of the American West and a flood of settlers  farmers  ranchers  adventurers  hopefuls  financially bereft  and entrepreneurs took their place  121   edit  Settlers and pioneers See also  Department of the Missouri and Indian Wars The river roughly defined the American frontier in the 19th century  particularly downstream from Kansas City  where it takes a sharp eastern turn into the heart of the state of Missouri  The major trails for the opening of the American West all have their starting points on the river  including the California  Mormon  Oregon  and Santa Fe trails  The first westward leg of the Pony Express was a ferry across the Missouri at St  Joseph  Missouri  Similarly  most emigrants arrived at the eastern terminus of the First Transcontinental Railroad via a ferry ride across the Missouri between Council Bluffs  Iowa and Omaha  122  123  The Hannibal Bridge became the first bridge to cross the Missouri River in 1869  and its location was a major reason why Kansas City became the largest city on the river upstream from its mouth at St  Louis  124  True to the then ideal of Manifest Destiny  over 500 000 people set out from the river town of Independence  Missouri to their various destinations in the American West from the 1830s to the 1860s  These people had many reasons to embark on this strenuous year long journey   economic crisis  and later gold strikes including the California Gold Rush  for example  125  For most  the route took them up the Missouri to Omaha  Nebraska  where they would set out along the Platte River  which flows from the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming and Colorado eastwards through the Great Plains  An early expedition led by Robert Stuart from 1812 to 1813 proved the Platte impossible to navigate by the dugout canoes they used  let alone the large sidewheelers and sternwheelers that would later ply the Missouri in increasing numbers  One explorer remarked that the Platte was  too thick to drink  too thin to plow   126  Nevertheless  the Platte provided an abundant and reliable source of water for the pioneers as they headed west  Covered wagons  popularly referred to as prairie schooners  provided the primary means of transport until the beginning of regular boat service on the river in the 1850s  127  During the 1860s  gold strikes in Montana  Colorado  Wyoming and northern Utah attracted another wave of hopefuls to the region  Although some freight was hauled overland  most transport to and from the gold fields was done through the Missouri and Kansas Rivers  as well as the Snake River in western Wyoming and the Bear River in Utah  Idaho and Wyoming  128  It is estimated that of the passengers and freight hauled from the Midwest to Montana  over 80 percent were transported by boat  a journey that took 150 days in the upstream direction  A route more directly west into Colorado lay along the Kansas River and its tributary the Republican River as well as pair of smaller Colorado streams  Big Sandy Creek and the South Platte River  to near Denver  The gold rushes precipitated the decline of the Bozeman Trail as a popular emigration route  as it passed through land held by often hostile Native Americans  Safer paths were blazed to the Great Salt Lake near Corinne  Utah during the gold rush period  which led to the large scale settlement of the Rocky Mountains region and eastern Great Basin  129  Karl Bodmer  Fort Pierre and the Adjacent Prairie  c  1833 As settlers expanded their holdings into the Great Plains  they ran into land conflicts with Native American tribes  This resulted in frequent raids  massacres and armed conflicts  leading to the federal government creating multiple treaties with the Plains tribes  which generally involved establishing borders and reserving lands for the indigenous  As with many other treaties between the U S  and Native Americans  they were soon broken  leading to huge wars  Over 1 000 battles  big and small  were fought between the U S  military and Native Americans before the tribes were forced out of their land onto reservations  130  131  Conflicts between natives and settlers over the opening of the Bozeman Trail in the Dakotas  Wyoming and Montana led to Red Cloud s War  in which the Lakota and Cheyenne fought against the U S  Army  The fighting resulted in a complete Native American victory  132  In 1868  the Treaty of Fort Laramie was signed  which  guaranteed  the use of the Black Hills  Powder River Country and other regions surrounding the northern Missouri River to Native Americans without white intervention  133  Another significant military engagement on the Missouri River during this period was the 1861 Battle of Boonville  which did not affect Native Americans but rather was a turning point in the American Civil War that allowed the Union to seize control of transport on the river  discouraging the state of Missouri from joining the Confederacy  134  However  the peace and freedom of the Native Americans did not last for long  The Great Sioux War of 1876 77 was sparked when American miners discovered gold in the Black Hills of western South Dakota and eastern Wyoming  These lands were originally set aside for Native American use by the Treaty of Fort Laramie  133  When the settlers intruded onto the lands  they were attacked by Native Americans  U S  troops were sent to the area to protect the miners  and drive out the natives from the new settlements  During this bloody period  both the Native Americans and the U S  military won victories in major battles  resulting in the loss of nearly a thousand lives  The war eventually ended in an American victory  and the Black Hills were opened to settlement  Native Americans of that region were relocated to reservations in Wyoming and southeastern Montana  135   edit  Dam building era Holter Dam  a run of the river structure on the upper Missouri  shortly after completion in 1918 Further information  List of dams in the Missouri River watershed In the late 19th and early 20th centuries  a great number of dams were built along the course of the Missouri  transforming 35 percent of the river into a chain of reservoirs  6  River development was stimulated by a variety of factors  first by growing demand for electricity in the rural northwestern parts of the basin  and also by floods and droughts that plagued rapidly growing agricultural and urban areas along the lower Missouri River  136  Small  privately owned hydroelectric projects have existed since the 1890s  but the large flood control and storage dams that characterize the middle reaches of the river today were not constructed until the 1950s  18  136  Between 1890 and 1940  five dams were built in the vicinity of Great Falls to generate power from the Great Falls of the Missouri  a chain of giant waterfalls formed by the river in its path through western Montana  Black Eagle Dam  built in 1891 on Black Eagle Falls  was the first dam of the Missouri  137  Replaced in 1926 with a more modern structure  the dam was little more than a small weir atop Black Eagle Falls  diverting part of the Missouri s flow into the Black Eagle power plant  138  The largest of the five dams  Ryan Dam  was built in 1913  The dam lies directly above the 87 foot  27 m  Great Falls  the largest waterfall of the Missouri  139  Black Eagle Dam is dynamited in 1908 to save Great Falls from the floodwave caused by the failure of Hauser Dam In the same period  several private establishments   most notably the Montana Power Company   began to develop the Missouri River above Great Falls and below Helena for power generation  A small run of the river structure completed in 1898 near the present site of Canyon Ferry Dam became the second dam to be built on the Missouri  This rock filled timber crib dam generated seven and a half megawatts of electricity for Helena and the surrounding countryside  140  The nearby steel Hauser Dam was finished in 1907  but failed in 1908 because of structural deficiencies  causing catastrophic flooding all the way downstream past Craig  At Great Falls  a section of the Black Eagle Dam was dynamited to save nearby factories from inundation  141  Hauser was rebuilt in 1910 as a concrete gravity structure  and stands to this day  142  143  Holter Dam  about 45 miles  72 km  downstream of Helena  was the third hydroelectric dam built on this stretch of the Missouri River  144  When completed in 1918 by the Montana Power Company and the United Missouri River Power Company  its reservoir flooded the Gates of the Mountains  a limestone canyon which Meriwether Lewis described as  the most remarkable clifts that we have yet seen  the tow er ing and projecting rocks in many places seem ready to tumble on us   145  In 1949  the U S  Bureau of Reclamation  USBR  began construction on the modern Canyon Ferry Dam to provide flood control to the Great Falls area  By 1954  the rising waters of Canyon Ferry Lake submerged the old 1898 dam  whose powerhouse still stands underwater about 1 5 miles  2 4 km  upstream of the present day dam  146    The Missouri s temperament was  uncertain as the actions of a jury or the state of a woman s mind   Sioux City Register  March 28  1868 147  The Missouri basin suffered a series of catastrophic floods around the turn of the 20th century  most notably in 1844  1881  and 1926 1927  148  In 1940  as part of the Great Depression era New Deal  the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  USACE  completed Fort Peck Dam in Montana  Construction of this massive public works project provided jobs for more than 50 000 laborers during the Depression and was a major step in providing flood control to the lower half of the Missouri River  149  However  Fort Peck only controls runoff from 11 percent of the Missouri River watershed  and had little effect on a severe snowmelt flood that struck the lower basin three years later  This event was particularly destructive as it submerged manufacturing plants in Omaha and Kansas City  greatly delaying shipments of military supplies in World War II  148  150  Map showing major features of the Pick Sloan Plan  other dams and their reservoirs are denoted by triangles Fort Peck Dam  the uppermost dam of the Missouri River Mainstem System Flooding damages on the Mississippi Missouri river system were one of the primary reasons for which Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1944  opening the way for the USACE to develop the Missouri on a massive scale  151  152  The 1944 act authorized the Pick Sloan Missouri Basin Program  Pick Sloan Plan   which was a composite of two widely varying proposals  The Pick plan  with an emphasis on flood control and hydroelectric power  called for the construction of large storage dams along the main stem of the Missouri  The Sloan plan  which stressed the development of local irrigation  included provisions for roughly 85 smaller dams on tributaries  136  153  In the early stages of Pick Sloan development  tentative plans were made to build a low dam on the Missouri at Riverdale  North Dakota and 27 smaller dams on the Yellowstone River and its tributaries  154  This was met with controversy from inhabitants of the Yellowstone basin  and eventually the USBR proposed a solution  to greatly increase the size of the proposed dam at Riverdale   today s Garrison Dam  thus replacing the storage that would have been provided by the Yellowstone dams  Because of this decision  the Yellowstone is now the longest free flowing river in the contiguous United States  155  In the 1950s  construction commenced on the five mainstem dams   Garrison  Oahe  Big Bend  Fort Randall and Gavins Point   proposed under the Pick Sloan Plan  136  Along with Fort Peck  which was integrated as a unit of the Pick Sloan Plan in the 1940s  these dams now form what is known as the Missouri River Mainstem System  156  The six dams of the Mainstem System  chiefly Fort Peck  Garrison and Oahe  are among the largest dams in the world by volume  their sprawling reservoirs also rank within the biggest of the nation  157  Holding up to 74 1 million acre feet  91 4 km3  in total  the six reservoirs can store more than three year s worth of the river s flow as measured below Gavins Point  the lowermost dam  18  This enormous capacity makes it the largest reservoir system in the United States and one of the largest in North America  158  In addition to storing irrigation water  the system also includes an annual flood control reservation of 16 3 million acre feet  20 1 km3   156  Mainstem power plants generate about 9 3 billion KWh annually   equal to a constant output of almost 1 100 megawatts  159  Along with nearly 100 smaller dams on tributaries  namely the Bighorn  Platte  Kansas  and Osage Rivers  the system provides irrigation water to nearly 7 500 sq mi  19 000 km2  of land

illustration  Boat travel on the Missouri started with the wood framed canoes and bull boats of the Native Americans  which were used for thousands of years before the introduction of larger craft to the river upon colonization of the Great Plains  173  The first steamboat on the Missouri was the Independence  which started running between St  Louis and Keytesville  Missouri around 1819  174  By the 1830s  large mail and freight carrying vessels were running regularly between Kansas City and St  Louis  and many traveled even farther upstream  A handful  such as the Western Engineer and the Yellowstone  were able to make it up the river as far as eastern Montana  173  175  During the early 19th century  at the height of the fur trade  steamboats and keelboats began traveling nearly the whole length of the Missouri from Montana s rugged Missouri Breaks to the mouth  carrying beaver and buffalo furs to and from the areas that the trappers frequented  176  This resulted in the development of the Missouri River mackinaw  which specialized in carrying furs  Since these boats could only travel downriver  they were dismantled and sold for lumber upon their arrival at St  Louis  173  Water transport increased through the 1850s with multiple craft ferrying pioneers  emigrants and miners  many of these runs were from St  Louis or Independence to near Omaha  There  most of these people would set out overland along the large but shallow and unnavigable Platte River  which was described by pioneers as  a mile wide and an inch deep  and  the most magnificent and useless of rivers   177  Steamboat navigation peaked in 1858 with over 130 boats operating full time on the Missouri  with many more smaller vessels  178  Many of the earlier vessels were built on the Ohio River before being transferred to the Missouri  Side wheeler steamboats were preferred over the larger sternwheelers used on the Mississippi and Ohio because of their greater maneuverability  176  The industry s success  however  did not guarantee safety  In the early decades before the river s flow was controlled by man  its sketchy rises and falls and its massive amounts of sediment  which prevented a clear view of the bottom  wrecked some 300 vessels  Because of the dangers of navigating the Missouri River  the average ship s lifespan was short  only about four years  178  The development of the Transcontinental and Northern Pacific Railroads marked the beginning of the end of steamboat commerce on the Missouri  Outcompeted by trains  the number of boats slowly dwindled  until there was almost nothing left by the 1890s  Transport of agricultural and mining products by barge  however  saw a revival in the early twentieth century  179  180   edit  Passage to Sioux City Since the beginning of the 20th century  the Missouri River has been extensively engineered for water transport purposes  and about 32 percent of the river now flows through artificially straightened channels  6  In 1912  the USACE was authorized to maintain the Missouri to a depth of six feet  1 8 m  from Kansas City to the mouth  a distance of 368 miles  592 km   10  This was accomplished by constructing levees and wing dams to direct the river s flow into a straight  narrow channel and prevent sedimentation  In 1925  the USACE began a project to widen the river s navigation channel to 200 feet  61 m   two years later  they began dredging a deep water channel from Kansas City to Sioux City  These modifications have reduced the river s length from some 2 540 miles  4 090 km  in the late 19th century to 2 341 miles  3 767 km  in the present day  5  181  Gavins Point Dam at Yankton  South Dakota is the uppermost obstacle to navigation from the mouth on the Missouri today  Construction of dams on the Missouri under the Pick Sloan Plan in the mid twentieth century was the final step in aiding navigation  The large reservoirs of the Mainstem System help provide a dependable flow to maintain the navigation channel year round  and are capable of halting most of the river s annual freshets  182  However  high and low water cycles of the Missouri   notably the protracted early 21st century drought in the Missouri River basin 183  and historic floods in 1993 184  and 2011 185    are difficult for even the massive Mainstem System reservoirs to control  185  In 1945  the USACE began the Missouri River Bank Stabilization and Navigation Project  which would permanently increase the river s navigation channel to a width of 300 feet  91 m  and a depth of nine feet  2 7 m   During work that continues to this day  the 735 mile  1 183 km  navigation channel from Sioux City to St  Louis has been controlled by building rock dikes to direct the river s flow and scour out sediments  sealing and cutting off meanders and side channels  and dredging the riverbed  186  However  the Missouri has often resisted the efforts of the USACE to control its depth  In 2006  several U S  Coast Guard boats ran aground in the Missouri River because the navigation channel had been severely silted  187  The USACE was blamed for failing to maintain the channel to the minimum depth  188  The Missouri River near New Haven  Missouri  looking upstream   note the riprap wing dam protruding into the river from the left to direct its flow into a narrower channel The Missouri River at Sioux City  IA  near the upper most navigable reach of the river today In 1929  the Missouri River Navigation Commission estimated the total amount of goods shipped on the river annually at 15 million tons  13 6 million metric tons   providing widespread consensus for the creation of a navigation channel  However  shipping traffic has since been far lower than expected   shipments of commodities including produce  manufactured items  lumber  and oil averaged only 683 000 tons  616 000 t  per year from 1994 to 2006  189  By tonnage of transported material  Missouri is by far the largest user of the river accounting for 83 percent of river traffic  while Kansas has 12 percent  Nebraska three percent and Iowa two percent  Almost all of the barge traffic on the Missouri River ships sand and gravel dredged from the lower 500 miles  800 km  of the river  the remaining portion of the shipping channel now sees little to no use by commercial vessels  189   edit  Traffic decline Tonnage of goods shipped by barges has seen a serious decline from the 1960s to the present on the Missouri River  In the 1960s  the USACE predicted an increase to 12 million short tons  10 8 million t  per year by 2000  but instead the opposite has happened  The amount of goods plunged from 3 3 million short tons  3 million t  in 1977 to just 1 3 million short tons  1 18 million t  in 2000  190  One of the largest drops has been in agricultural products  especially wheat  Part of the reason is that irrigated land along the Missouri has only been developed to a fraction of its potential  191  In 2006  barges on the Missouri hauled only 200 000 short tons  180 000 t  of products which is equal to the amount of daily freight traffic on the Mississippi  191  Drought conditions in the early 21st century and competition from other modes of transport   mainly railroads   are the primary reason for decreasing river traffic on the Missouri  The failure of the USACE to consistently maintain the navigation channel has also hampered the industry  Currently  efforts are being made to revive the shipping industry on the Missouri River  because of the efficiency and cheapness of river transport to haul agricultural products  and the overcrowding of alternative transportation routes  Solutions such as expanding the navigation channel and releasing more water from reservoirs during the peak of the navigation season are being considered  192  193  Drought conditions lifted in 2010  in which about 334 000 short tons  301 000 t  were barged on the Missouri  representing the first significant increase in shipments since 2000  However  flooding in 2011 closed record stretches of the river to boat traffic    wash ing  away hopes for a bounce back year   194   edit  Ecology  edit  Natural history Freshwater ecoregions of the Missouri basin Historically  the thousands of square miles that comprised the floodplain of the Missouri River supported a wide range of plant and animal species  Biodiversity generally increased proceeding downstream from the cold  subalpine headwaters in Montana to the temperate  moist climate of Missouri  Today  the river s riparian zone consists primarily of cottonwoods  willows and sycamores  with several other types of trees such as maple and ash  195  Average tree height generally increases farther from the riverbanks for a limited distance  as land adjacent to the river is vulnerable to soil erosion during floods  Because of its large sediment concentrations  the Missouri does not support many aquatic invertebrates  195  However  the basin does support about 300 species of birds 195  and 150 species of fish  196  some of which are endangered such as the Pallid sturgeon  The Missouri s aquatic and riparian habitats also support several species of mammals  such as minks  river otters  beavers  muskrats  and raccoons  147  The World Wide Fund For Nature divides the Missouri River watershed into three freshwater ecoregions  the Upper Missouri  Lower Missouri and Central Prairie  The Upper Missouri  roughly encompassing the area within Montana  Wyoming  southern Alberta and Saskatchewan  and North Dakota  comprises mainly semiarid shrub steppe grasslands with sparse biodiversity because of Ice Age glaciations  There are no known endemic species within the region  Except for the headwaters in the Rockies  there is little precipitation in this part of the watershed  197  The Middle Missouri ecoregion  extending through Colorado  southwestern Minnesota  northern Kansas  Nebraska  and parts of Wyoming and Iowa  has greater rainfall and is characterized by temperate forests and grasslands  Plant life is more diverse in the Middle Missouri  which is also home to about twice as many animal species  198  Finally  the Central Prairie ecoregion is situated on the lower part of the Missouri  encompassing all or parts of Missouri  Kansas  Oklahoma and Arkansas  Despite large seasonal temperature fluctuations  this region has the greatest diversity of plants and animals of the three  Thirteen species of crayfish are endemic to the lower Missouri  199   edit  Human impacts Since the beginning of river commerce and industrial development in the 1800s  the Missouri has been severely polluted and its water quality degraded by human activity  Most of the river s floodplain habitat is long gone  replaced by irrigated agricultural land  Development of the floodplain has led to increasing amounts of people and infrastructure within areas at high risk of inundation  Levees have been constructed along more than a third of the river in order to keep floodwater within the channel  but with the consequences of faster stream velocity and a resulting increase of peak flows in downstream areas  Fertilizer runoff  which causes elevated levels of nitrogen and other nutrients  is a major problem along the Missouri River  especially in Iowa and Missouri  This form of pollution also heavily affects the upper Mississippi  Illinois and Ohio Rivers  Low oxygen levels in rivers and the vast Gulf of Mexico dead zone at the end of the Mississippi Delta are both results of high nutrient concentrations in the Missouri and other tributaries of the Mississippi  200  201  Agricultural fields dominate most of the former floodplain  including this area around the Missouri s confluence with the Nishnabotna River in western Missouri  Channelization of the lower Missouri waters has made the river narrower  deeper and less accessible to riparian flora and fauna  Numerous dams and bank stabilization projects have been constructed to facilitate the conversion of 300 000 acres  1 200 km2  of Missouri River floodplain to agricultural land  Channel control has significantly reduced the volume of sediment transported downstream by the river and eliminated critical habitat for fish  birds and amphibians  202  By the early 21st century  declines in populations of native species prompted the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service to issue a biological opinion recommending restoration of river habitats for federally endangered bird and fish species  203  The USACE began work on ecosystem restoration projects along the lower Missouri River in the early 21st century  Because of the low use of the shipping channel in the lower Missouri maintained by the USACE  it is now considered feasible to remove some of the levees  dikes  and wing dams that constrict the river s flow  thus allowing it to naturally restore its banks  202  As of 2001  there were 87 000 acres  350 km2  of riverside floodplain undergoing active restoration  204  Restoration projects have re mobilized some of the sediments that had been trapped behind bank stabilization structures  prompting concerns of exacerbated nutrient and sediment pollution locally and downstream in the northern Gulf of Mexico  A 2010 National Research Council report assessed the roles of sediment in the Missouri River  evaluating current habitat restoration strategies and alternative ways to manage sediment  205  The report found that a better understanding of sediment processes in the Missouri River  including the creation of a  sediment budget    an accounting of sediment transport  erosion  and deposition volumes for the length of the Missouri River   would provide a foundation for projects to improve water quality standards and protect endangered species  206   edit  Tourism and recreation Part of the Missouri National Recreational River  a 98 mile  158 km  preserved stretch of the Missouri on the border of South Dakota and Nebraska With over 1 500 sq mi  3 900 km2  of open water  the six reservoirs of the Missouri River Mainstem System provide some of the main recreational areas within the basin  Visitation has increased from 10 million visitor hours in the mid 1960s to over 60 million visitor hours in 1990  191  Development of visitor facilities was spurred by the Federal Water Project Recreation Act of 1965  which required the USACE to build and maintain boat ramps  campgrounds and other public facilities along major reservoirs  18  Recreational use of Missouri River reservoirs is estimated to contribute  85 100 million to the regional economy each year  207  The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail  some 3 700 miles  6 000 km  long  follows nearly the entire Missouri River from its mouth to its source  retracing the route of the Lewis and Clark Expedition  Extending from Wood River  Illinois in the east to Astoria  Oregon in the west  it also follows portions of the Mississippi and Columbia Rivers  The trail  which spans through eleven U S  states  is maintained by various federal and state government agencies  it passes through some 100 historic sites  notably archaeological locations including the Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site  208  209  Parts of the river itself are designated for recreational or preservational use  The Missouri National Recreational River consists of portions of the Missouri downstream from Fort Randall and Gavins Point Dams that total 98 miles  158 km   210  211  These reaches exhibit islands  meanders  sandbars  underwater rocks  riffles  snags  and other once common features of the lower river that have now disappeared under reservoirs or have been destroyed by channeling  About forty five steamboat wrecks are scattered along these reaches of the river  212  213  Downstream from Great Falls  Montana  about 149 miles  240 km  of the river course through a rugged series of canyons and badlands known as the Missouri Breaks  This part of the river  designated a U S  National Wild and Scenic River in 1976  flows within the Upper Missouri Breaks National Monument  a 375 000 acre  1 520 km2  preserve comprising steep cliffs  deep gorges  arid plains  badlands  archaeological sites  and whitewater rapids on the Missouri itself  The preserve includes a wide variety of plant and animal life  recreational activities include boating  rafting  hiking and wildlife observation  214  215  In north central Montana  some 1 100 000 acres  4 500 km2  along over 125 miles  201 km  of the Missouri River  centering around Fort Peck Lake  comprise the Charles M  Russell National Wildlife Refuge  216  The wildlife refuge consists of a native northern Great Plains ecosystem that has not been heavily affected by human development  except for the construction of Fort Peck Dam  Although there are few designated trails  the whole preserve is open to hiking and camping  217  Many U S  national parks  such as Glacier National Park  Rocky Mountain National Park  Yellowstone National Park and Badlands National Park are in the watershed  Parts of other rivers in the basin are set aside for preservation and recreational use   notably the Niobrara National Scenic River  which is a 76 mile  122 km  protected stretch of the Niobrara River  one of the Missouri s longest tributaries  218  The Missouri flows through or past many National Historic Landmarks  which include Three Forks of the Missouri  219 Fort Benton  Montana  220 Big Hidatsa Village Site  221 Fort Atkinson  Nebraska 222  and Arrow Rock Historic District  223  The Missouri River in Upper Missouri Breaks National Monument  Montana  at the confluence with Cow Creek  edit  See also
