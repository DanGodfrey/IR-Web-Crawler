List of The Spectacular Spider Man characters From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Character designs to some of the main characters in The Spectacular Spider Man  Left to right  Mary Jane Watson  Gwen Stacy  Harry Osborn  Spider Man  Peter Parker  J  Jonah Jameson  Dr  Curt Connors and Eddie Brock  The animated television series The Spectacular Spider Man features an extensive cast of characters originally created by Stan Lee  Steve Ditko and other comic book creators  1 Greg Weisman and Victor Cook and the rest of the crew redesigned these classic characters in the series to be more modern but still to be true to its characters in the comics  2  Most of these characters are based on the original mainstream universe but there have been characters that have been introduced from the Ultimate Marvel universe such as Kenny  King  Kong and characters from Sam Raimi s film series such as Benard Houseman as well  The majority of the villains that have debuted in the show have started out as supporting characters before becoming villains  3  The character s portrayals in the shows have mainly gained positive reviews from TV critics  Contents 1 Role in The Spectacular Spider Man 2 Creation and concept 3 Main characters 3 1 Peter Parker Spider Man 3 2 Gwen Stacy 3 3 Harry Osborn 3 4 J  Jonah Jameson 3 5 Mary Jane Watson 3 6 Flash Thompson 3 7 Liz Allan 3

protagonist of the series is Peter Parker  a young teenager who is still in high school but is also secretly a superhero called Spider Man  4  In school his two classmates are Gwen Stacy and Harry Osborn  3  He and his classmates are constantly being bullied and teased by the more popular Flash Thompson and his classmates  Ironically enough  much to Peter s dismay  Flash Thompson is also one of Spider Man s biggest fans  3  Also at school  Peter s feelings wrestle between Gwen Stacy and Liz Allan  5  Peter Parker soon finds himself getting a job at the Daily Bugle as a freelance photographer working with characters such as J  Jonah Jameson  Robbie Robertson  Betty Brant  Ned Lee and Frederick Foswell  Parker as Spider Man fights a lot of villains in the series as the majority of his rogues gallery in the comics are introduced in this series  Season one introduces supervillains such as Vulture  Electro  Lizard  Shocker  Sandman  Rhino  Green Goblin  Doctor Octopus and Venom  3  It also introduces crime lords such as Hammerhead and Tombstone who are partly responsible for the supervillains  Season two expanded on the villains already introduced  excluding the Lizard  and also introduces the supervillains Mysterio  Kraven the Hunter  and Molten Man  3  5  It also introduced another crime lord called Silvermane  The role of the antagonist s between these villains in the series shifts and changes as the series progresses  4   edit  Creation and concept We re retooling and redesigning things for the modern day but we want the characters to still be iconic  We want you to see our updated version of the Vulture and still say   yep  that s the Vulture  and  yeah  that s the Green Goblin    It s a contemporary version but the changes aren t there just for the sake of making changes  It s still true to what Lee  Ditko and Romita did  Greg Weisman  2  As story editor  Greg Weisman approached the character by going and buying the first seven volumes of The Essential Spider Man and reread them  The creator Greg Weisman originally grew up on Stan Lee and John Romita Sr  and When the creators Greg Weisman created the characters and he later went back and read the original Stan Lee  Steve Ditko stories  He then re read them and took copious notes and tried to get the voice of those early stories  He then put his own spin on some of the origins and the costume designs  He wanted to create something that was coherent  cohesive  contemporary and classic  2  Greg Weisman stated   Peter s life has a lot of interesting characters and we wanted to bring them in    the important ones and the most obscure   2  Because Sally Avril s character was later developed in Untold Tales of Spider Man the creators used her  In Season 2  he used Bernard Houseman from the movie  The creators didn t want to wait several seasons to bring in Gwen Stacy or Harry Osborn or Mary Jane Watson  The creators didn t meet those characters in comics until Peter was in college  The creators wanted to stay true to it and ask   What kind of guy would Harry Osborn have been back in high school   Greg Weisman stated that  It doesn t mean taking his college character and just sticking it in high school  it means extrapolating what he may have been like back then  Same thing with Gwen Stacy  and later with Mary Jane  We included those characters because they meant a lot in Peter s life and were iconic    2  As for having guest stars in the show  the creators didn t want the show to be guest star of the week  The creators felt that if they started bringing people in too early  viewers would keep asking  well  who s gonna show up next   and it would be a distraction from their main characters who are so interesting  Greg Weisman stated  The Marvel Universe was basically built on the fly  Since we re starting this cartoon from scratch  we have the luxury of building a more cohesive universe from day one because we know where we re going to go with these characters and who s going to come later  2  The characters that the creators decided to put on the show came from some kind of source and were never intended to be original characters  The characters either came from the mainstream comics  the Ultimate Spider Man comics or in the Spider Man films  6  As for the characters the characters had to do some conflating with their introductions  They didn t want to wait to have Harry Osborn  Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson when Peter got out of high school  like in the comics  so they introduced them in high school and try to figure what they would have been like in high school instead  7   edit  Main characters The main characters featured in the opening credits   edit  Peter Parker Spider Man Main article  Spider Man Peter Parker Spider Man  voiced by Josh Keaton  8  9   The protagonist of the series  bitten by a genetically altered spider  Peter donned a spider costume and sought to fight crime after allowing a burglar to escape  only to have that same criminal   later identified in this series as Walter Hardy   who was thought to have killed his Uncle Ben  He learned that  with great power comes great responsibility   a phrase that now drives him to act as a super hero  The series focuses on the character struggles while leading a double life as Peter Parker in Midtown High and as the superhero   Spider Man  He is depicted as good natured  He gets a job at the Daily Bugle so he can support his Aunt May with financial troubles  Despite their financial troubles  16 year old Peter Parker and his Aunt May have a great relationship  His best friends in school are mainly Gwen Stacy and Harry Osborn  He as Peter Parker is often bullied and being referred to as  Puny Parker  by his peers  even still Peter s newfound powers has given him confidence  4  10  Josh Keaton  the voice of the character  stated   I grew up reading comic books and Spider Man was always one of my favorites  I felt that I always identified with him  Spider Man is awesome  I definitely was a huge Spider Man fan growing up and still am    11  Before he was chosen for Spider Man  he auditioned for the role of Harry Osborn and Eddie Brock as well  11   edit  Gwen Stacy Main article  Gwen Stacy Gwen Stacy   voiced by Lacey Chabert  Gwen is the deuteragonist and is the main love interest of Peter Parker in the show  Gwen is the daughter of police captain George Stacy  and is one of Peter Parker s best friends and intellectual equal  Although initially fairly shy and unconcerned with her appearance  she gradually evolves into a more confident and attractive character more closely resembling her comic book counterpart  She is always supportive of Peter  Although she is Peter s best friend  her weakness is that she has a colossal crush on Peter  12   edit  Harry Osborn Main article  Harry Osborn Harry Osborn   voiced by James Arnold Taylor  Harry is portrayed as Peter s best friend and is the son of industrialist Norman Osborn  He constantly lives in his father s shadow and considers Peter a good friend  though at times also resents him for earning Norman s respect  which Harry has never been able to do  Being ignored by his father and overprotective of his mother and just like Peter  he is an unpopular kid at school  With his lack of approval he is prone to do anything to get it  12   edit  J  Jonah Jameson Main article  J  Jonah Jameson J  Jonah Jameson   voiced by Daran Norris  Jameson is portrayed as a loudmouth  egotistical publisher and editor of the Daily Bugle  a major tabloid newspaper  Showing excessive pride in his son  John Jameson  he is obsessed with exposing fraudulent claims to heroism  and is therefore always demanding pictures of Spider Man so that he can continue his smear campaign against the vigilante  Even though he loves to sell newspapers of Spider Man he feels that the real heroes are ones that have nothing to hide such as his son  John Jameson  And will do anything to get him on the spotlight instead of Spider Man  12   edit  Mary Jane Watson Main article  Mary Jane Watson Mary Jane Watson   voiced by Vanessa Marshall 13   Mary Jane is portrayed as the niece of Aunt May s friend  Anna Watson  She attends the Fall Formal as Peter s date before ultimately switching schools to be at Midtown  Mary Jane befriends Peter and Gwen  and is initially determined to stay single  desiring to be a  free agent   Vanessa Marshall  the voice of the character states  I always make sure my choices for Mary Jane are that of an independent thinker  that she s not concerned with what the people around her think  which is an uncommon trait in teenage girls  There s a distinct confidence about her that I try to emulate    13  She also explained about the character she played  Mary Jane s character is incredibly complex  Her strength plays a major part in Peter s growth and maturation she really keeps him on the straight and narrow  Even though our characters are still only in high school during this cartoon  and you re not going to get a lot of that character development at this point of the series  I know it s going to be there in the future and so that has an effect on how I play her now    13   edit  Flash Thompson Main article  Flash Thompson Flash Thompson   voiced by Joshua LeBar 14   Flash is a star football player at Midtown High  While he idolizes Spider Man  he frequently bullies and harasses Peter Parker  believing him to be a  stuck up egghead   15  despite the fact that they had originally been friends when they were much younger  16  Even though he is the bully of Peter Parker  he idolizes the superhero Spider Man  being one of his biggest and most loyal fans  17  The voice of the character  Joshua LeBar  said this about the character he played   I think Flash has a certain brashness  but he also has a likeability  so he s not a complete doof that you hate  He s a dichotomy   he s got a few different sides  and he surprises people  I was both a theatre guy and a football guy in high school  and people tried to stick me into that one note category  depending on how they knew me   and I didn t like being stereotyped  So when the  Spider Man  show gives me the opportunity to represent his other sides  like this week when you see Flash s compassion rather than just all that testosterone  I really enjoy showcasing that part of his character because I can relate to his situation    14   edit  Liz Allan Main article  Liz Allan Liz Allan   voiced by Alanna Ubach 18   Liz is depicted as a popular cheerleader at Midtown High  Instead of the comic book mainstream version where she is caucasian and a blonde  she is depicted as more hispanic in this series  She is initially the girlfriend of Flash Thompson and shows great resentment towards Peter  19  As the series progresses  her true feelings become apparent as she demonstrates a much more open and accepting side  She commonly refers to Peter as  Petey   Peter and her begin to date for some time until Peter gets honest with himself about who he really wants to be with  20   edit  George Stacy Main article  George Stacy George Stacy   voiced by Clancy Brown 21   George  just like in the comics is depicted as Gwen s protective father and a police captain  He is open minded  believing in Spider Man when others like J  Jonah Jameson dismiss his vigilante activities  Just like in the comics  it seems apparent that he knows that Peter is Spider Man by giving him strong signals and helping him out with rough situations  22   edit

carefully at the fictional character and said   Who is this guy  What is it that s iconic about Shocker  What is it that really matters   And according to Weisman it was the powers  the suit  the relationship with Spider Man  And he and the creators felt that the identity of Herman Schultz didn t have that  He stated that  he s not Otto Octavius and he sure as hell ain t Norman Osborn   He

costume retained  some nice visual nods to the Electro many of us grew up with   Liz Allan s characterization  though  he found confusing  with the character s accent and background unclear  27  Goldman also praised the Lizard s design  calling it  the most visually familiar villain the show had introduced yet   28  Goldman enjoyed the design of Shocker which he felt stayed true to his original design and was  intrigued  by changing his secret identity  29  Goldman also praised the unveiling of Tombstone and Mary Jane Watson  30  Goldman gave a mixed response about Green Goblin   noting that he is  perhaps a bit hyper sensitive on how he s portrayed    considering the design  while similar to the comics  be more of an exact version of it  Goldman considered the character s personality was  a bit too evocative of the Joker   the iconic villain from DC s Batman comics  but believed that his  malice side  worked  Goldman also praised Mary Jane Watson for being  much like Stan Lee created her   a quick witted  fun loving girl   He also applauded the mysterious factors of Green Goblin s true identity  30  Goldman opted that Jonah s hatred of Spider Man that was formed in the episode was  perhaps the most understandable and best way it s ever been portrayed before    31  Season Elliot  senior editor of iF Magazine  wrote  The Lizard himself was a nice update of the original Lizard and he was still in his torn pants  shirt  and lab coat   Elliot praised the design for differentiating itself from that used for Spider Man or Spider Man  The New Animated Series  and that he  can t wait for the action figure of this guy    32  He also stated  Even the Shocker was more interesting on this show  so I continue to have high hopes for future episodes  characters  and villains   When talking about the change of Shocker s secret identity  he quoted that it  saves the writers from having to come up with a completely different origin for a character that pretty much is a second tier villain anyways    33  Elliot was  pleased  with the portrayal of Rhino as an unintelligent brute  he also enjoyed the change of the  Big Man s  identity from that of the comics   where he was a Bugle reporter named Frederic Foswell   and found it humorous to have Foswell be the reporter to tell Peter who the  Big Man  is rumored to be  34  35  Similar to Goldman  27  Elliot
