in the South Central region of the United States of America  Oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 United States  The state s name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma  meaning  red people   5  and is known informally by its nickname  The Sooner State  Formed by the combination of Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory on November 16  1907  Oklahoma was the 46th state to enter the union  Its residents are known as Oklahomans or  informally  Okies   and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City  A major producer of natural gas  oil  and agriculture  Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation  energy  telecommunications  and biotechnology  6  It has one of the fastest growing economies in the nation  ranking among the top states in per capita income growth and gross domestic product growth  7  8  Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma s primary economic anchors  with nearly 60 percent of Oklahomans living in their metropolitan statistical areas  9  With small mountain ranges  prairie  and eastern forests  most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains and the U S  Interior Highlands a region especially prone to severe weather  10  In addition to having a prevalence of German  Irish  English  Scottish  and Native American ancestry  more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma  the most of any state  11  It is located on a confluence of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives  a destination for southern settlers  and a government sanctioned territory for Native Americans  Part of the Bible Belt  widespread belief in evangelical Christianity makes it one of the most politically conservative states  though Oklahoma has more voters registered with the Democratic Party than with any other party  12  Contents 1 Etymology 2 Geography 2 1 Topography 2 2 Flora and fauna 2 3 Protected lands 2 4 Climate 3 History 4 Economy 4 1 Industry

Oklahoma comes from the phrase okla humma  literally meaning red people  Choctaw Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government regarding the use of Indian Territory  in which he envisioned an all Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs  Equivalent to the English word Indian  okla humma was a phrase in the Choctaw language used to describe the Native American race as a whole  Oklahoma later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory  and it was officially approved in 1890  two years after the area was opened to white settlers  5  13  14   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Oklahoma The state s high plains stretch behind a greeting sign in the Oklahoma Panhandle  Oklahoma is the 20th

six states on the Frontier Strip  and lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states  Arkansas and Missouri bound it on the east  on the north by Kansas  on the northwest by Colorado  on the far west by New Mexico  and on the south and near west by Texas   edit  Topography See also  Lakes in Oklahoma Oklahoma is between the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf of Mexico watershed  16  generally sloping from the high plains of its western boundary to the low wetlands of its southeastern boundary  17  18  Its highest and lowest points follow this trend  with its highest peak  Black Mesa  at 4 973 feet  1 516 m  above sea level  situated near its far northwest corner in the Oklahoma Panhandle  The state s lowest point is on the Little River near its far southeastern boundary near the town of Idabel  OK  which dips to 289 feet  88 m  above sea level  19  A river carves a canyon in the Wichita Mountains  Among the most geographically diverse states  Oklahoma is one of four to harbor more than 10 distinct ecological regions  with 11 in its borders   more per square mile than in any other state  10  Its western and eastern halves  however  are marked by extreme differences in geographical diversity  Eastern Oklahoma touches eight ecological regions and its western half contains three  10  The Ouachita Mountains cover much of southeastern Oklahoma  Oklahoma has four primary mountain ranges  the Ouachita Mountains  the Arbuckle Mountains  the Wichita Mountains  and the Ozark Mountains  17  Contained within the U S  Interior Highlands region  the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains mark the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians  20  A portion of the Flint Hills stretches into north central Oklahoma  and in the state s southeastern corner  Cavanal Hill is regarded by the Oklahoma Tourism  amp  Recreation Department as the world s tallest hill  at 1 999 feet  609 m   it fails their definition of a mountain by one foot  21  The semi arid high plains in the state s northwestern corner harbor few natural forests  Oklahoma has a rolling to flat landscape with intermittent canyons and mesa ranges like the Glass Mountains  Partial plains interrupted by small mountain ranges like the Antelope Hills and the Wichita Mountains dot southwestern Oklahoma  and transitional prairie and woodlands cover the central portion of the state  The Ozark and Ouachita Mountains rise from west to east over the state s eastern third  gradually increasing in elevation in an eastward direction  18  22  More than 500 named creeks and rivers make up Oklahoma s waterways  and with 200 lakes created by dams  it holds the highest number of artificial reservoirs in the nation  21  Most of the state lies in two primary drainage basins belonging to the Red and Arkansas rivers  though the Lee and Little rivers also contain significant drainage basins  22   edit  Flora and fauna Populations of American Bison inhabit the state s prairie ecosystems  Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma 21  and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass  mixed grass  and tallgrass prairie  harbor expansive ecosystems in the state s central and western portions  although cropland has largely replaced native grasses  23  Where rainfall is sparse in the western regions of the state  shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems  though pinyon pines  red cedar  junipers   and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the far western reaches of the panhandle  23 Marshlands  cypress forests and mixtures of shortleaf pine  loblolly pine and deciduous forests dominate the state s southeastern quarter  while mixtures of largely post oak  elm  white cedar  Thuja  and pine forests cover northeastern Oklahoma  22  23  24  The state holds populations of white tailed deer  coyotes  bobcats  elk  and birds such as quail  doves  cardinals  bald eagles  red tailed hawks  and pheasants  In prairie ecosystems  American bison  greater prairie chickens  badgers  and armadillo are common  and some of the nation s largest prairie dog towns inhabit shortgrass prairie in the state s panhandle  The Cross Timbers  a region transitioning from prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma  harbors 351 vertebrate species  The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear  red fox  grey fox  and river otter populations  which coexist with a total of 328 vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma  Also  in southeastern Oklahoma lives the American Alligator

state parks  25  six national parks or protected regions  26  two national protected forests or grasslands  27  and a network of wildlife preserves and conservation areas  Six percent of the state s 10 million acres  40 000 km2  of forest is public land  24  including the western portions of the Ouachita National Forest  the largest and oldest national forest in the Southern United States  28  With 39 000 acres  158 km2   the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in north central Oklahoma is the largest protected area of tallgrass prairie in the world and is part of an ecosystem that encompasses only

trails  the Fort Smith and Washita Battlefield national historic sites  and the Oklahoma City National Memorial  26   edit  Climate Oklahoma is located in a temperate region and experiences occasional extremes of temperature and precipitation typical in a continental climate  34  Most of the state lies in an area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold and warm air masses producing severe weather  19  An average 54 tornadoes strike the state per year one of the highest rates in the world  35  Because of its position between zones of differing prevailing temperature and winds  weather patterns within the state can vary widely between relatively short distances and can change drastically in a short time  19  As an example  on November 11  1911  the temperature at Oklahoma City reached 83  F  28  C  in the afternoon  the record high for that date   then an incoming squall line resulted in a drop to 17  F   8  C  at midnight  the record low for that date   thus  both the record high and record low for November 11 were set on the same day  36  Oklahoma s climate is prime for thunderstorm development  The humid subtropical climate  Koppen Cfa  of the eastern part of Oklahoma influenced heavily by southerly winds bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico  but transitions progressively to a semi arid zone  Koppen BSk  in the high plains of the Panhandle and other western areas from about Lawton westward less frequently touched by southern moisture  34  Precipitation and temperatures fall from east to west accordingly  with areas in the southeast averaging an annual temperature of 62  F  17  C  and an annual rainfall of 56 inches  1 420 mm   while areas of the panhandle average 58  F  14  C   with an annual rainfall under 17 inches  430 mm   19  All of the state frequently experiences temperatures above 100  F  38  C  or below 0  F   18  C   34  and snowfall ranges from an average of less than 4 inches  10 cm  in the south to just over 20 inches  51 cm  on the border of Colorado in the panhandle  19  The state is home to the Storm Prediction Center  the National Severe Storms Laboratory  and the Warning Decision Training Branch  all part of the National Weather Service and located in Norman  37  Oklahoma s highest recorded temperature of 120  F  49  C  was recorded at Tipton on June 27  1994 and the lowest recorded

ice age  40  but the state s first permanent inhabitants settled in communities accentuated with mound like structures near the Arkansas border between 850 and 1450 AD  41  42  Spaniard Francisco V squez de Coronado traveled through the state in 1541  43  but French explorers claimed the area in the 1700s 44  and it remained under French rule until 1803  when all the French territory west of the Mississippi River was purchased by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase  43  During the 19th century  thousands of Native Americans were expelled from their ancestral homelands from across North America and transported to the area including and surrounding present day Oklahoma  The Choctaw was the first of the  Five Civilized Tribes  to be removed from the southeastern United States  The phrase  Trail of Tears  originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831  although the term is usually used for the Cherokee removal  45  About 17 000 Cherokees   along with approximately 2 000 black slaves owned by Cherokees   were removed from their homes  46  The area  already occupied by Osage and Quapaw tribes  was called for the Choctaw Nation until revised Native American and then later American policy redefined the boundaries to include other Native Americans  By 1890  more than 30 Native American nations and tribes had been concentrated on land within Indian Territory or  Indian Country   47  Many Native Americans served in the Union and Confederate military during the American Civil War  The Cherokee Nation had an internal civil war  48  Slavery in Oklahoma was not abolished until 1866  49  In the period between 1866 and 1899  43  cattle ranches in Texas strove to meet the demands for food in eastern cities and railroads in Kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner  Cattle trails and cattle ranches developed as cowboys either drove their product north or settled illegally in Indian Territory  43  In 1881  four of five major cattle trails on the western frontier traveled through Indian Territory  50  Increased presence of white settlers in Indian Territory prompted the United States Government to establish the Dawes Act in 1887  which divided the lands of individual tribes into allotments for individual families  encouraging farming and private land ownership among native Americans but expropriating land to the federal government  In the process  railroad companies took nearly half of Indian held land within the territory for outside settlers and for purchase  51  The Dust Bowl sent thousands of farmers into poverty during the 1930s  Major land runs  including the Land Run of 1889  were held for settlers on the hour that certain territories were opened to settlement  Usually  land was open to settlers on a first come first served basis  52  Those who broke the rules by crossing the border into the territory before it was allowed were said to have been crossing the border sooner  leading to the term sooners  which eventually became the state s official nickname  53  Delegations to make the territory into a state began near the end of the 19th century  when the Curtis Act furthered the allotment of Indian tribal land  Attempts to create an all Indian state named Oklahoma and a later attempt to create an all Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 eventually laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention  which took place two years later  54  On November 16  1907  Oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the Union  The bombing of the Alfred P  Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was one of the deadliest acts of terrorism in American history  The new state became a focal point for the emerging oil industry  as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth  Tulsa eventually became known as the  Oil Capital of the World  for most of the 20th century and oil investments fueled much of the state s early economy  55  In 1927  an Oklahoman businessman Cyrus Avery  known as the  Father of Route 66   began the campaign to create U S  Route 66  Using a stretch of highway from Amarillo  Texas to Tulsa  Oklahoma to form the original portion of Highway 66  Avery spearheaded the creation of the U S  Highway 66 Association to oversee the planning of Route 66  based in his hometown of Tulsa  56  Oklahoma also has a rich African American history  There were many black towns that thrived in the early 20th century because of black settlers moving from neighboring states  especially Kansas  The politician Edward P  McCabe encouraged black settlers to come to what was then Indian Territory  He discussed with President Theodore Roosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma a majority black state  By the early 20th century  the Greenwood neighborhood of Tulsa was one of the most prosperous African American communities in the United States  57 Jim Crow laws had established racial segregation since before the turn of the century  but the blacks had created a thriving area  Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915  The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921  with whites attacking blacks  In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history  sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed   1 8 million in property damage  and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people  58  By the late 1920s  the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state  59  During the 1930s  parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practices  extended drought and high winds  Known as the Dust Bowl  areas of Kansas  Texas  New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall and abnormally high temperatures  sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States  60  Over a twenty year period ending in 1950  the state saw its only historical decline in population  dropping 6 9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl  Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams  they built hundreds of reservoirs and man made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation  By the 1960s  Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes  the most in the nation  10  61  In 1995  Oklahoma City was the site of the worst act of domestic terrorism in American history  The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19  1995  in which Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols detonated an explosive outside of the Alfred P  Murrah Federal Building  killed 168 people  including 19 children  The two men were convicted of the bombing  McVeigh was sentenced to death and executed by the federal government on June 11  2001  his partner Nichols is serving a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole  62   edit  Economy The BOK Tower of Tulsa  Oklahoma s second tallest building  serves as the world headquarters for
