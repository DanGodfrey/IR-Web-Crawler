its large reserves of petroleum and natural gas  Iran has the second largest proven natural gas reserves in the world and the fourth largest proven petroleum reserves  20  Iran is home to one of the world s oldest civilizations  21  The first dynasty in Iran formed during the Elamite kingdom in 2800 BC  The Iranian Medes unified Iran into an empire in 625 BC  1  They were succeeded by the Iranian Achaemenid Empire  the Hellenic Seleucid Empire and two subsequent Iranian empires  the Parthians and the Sassanids  before the Muslim conquest in 651 AD  Iranian post Islamic dynasties and empires

Land of the Aryans   first attested in Zoroastrianism s Avesta tradition  33  34  35  36  The term  r n is found to refer to Iran in a 3rd century Sassanid inscription  and the Parthian inscription that accompanies it uses the Parthian term  ary n  in reference to Iranians  37  However historically Iran has been referred to as Persia or similar  La Perse  Persien  Perzi   etc   by the Western world  mainly due to the writings of Greek historians who called Iran Persis           meaning land of the Persians  In 1935 Rez  Sh h requested that the international community should refer to the country as Iran  Opposition to the name change led to the reversal of the decision  and in 1959 both names were to be used interchangeably  38  Since the Iranian Revolution in 1979 the official name of the country has been the  Islamic Republic of Iran   Geography Main article  Geography of Iran See also  Agriculture in Iran and Wildlife of Iran Topography of Iran Iran is the eighteenth largest

Babol  Iran consists of the Iranian Plateau with the exception of the coasts of the Caspian Sea and Khuzestan Province  It is one of the world s most mountainous countries  its landscape dominated by rugged mountain ranges that separate various basins or plateaux from one another  The populous western part is the most mountainous  with ranges such as the Caucasus  Zagros and Alborz Mountains  the last contains Iran s highest point  Mount Damavand  Amol at 5 610 m  18 406 ft   which is also the highest mountain on the Eurasian landmass west of the Hindu Kush  43  The northern part of Iran is covered by dense rain forests called Shomal or the Jungles of Iran  The eastern part consists mostly of desert basins such as the Dasht e Kavir  Iran s largest desert  in the north central portion of the country  and the Dasht e Lut  in the east  as well as some salt lakes  This is because the mountain ranges are too high for rain clouds to reach these regions  The only large plains are found along the coast of the Caspian Sea and at the northern end of the Persian Gulf  where Iran borders the mouth of the Shatt al Arab  or the Arvand R d  river  Smaller  discontinuous plains are found along the remaining coast of the Persian Gulf  the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman  Climate Simplified Climatic Map of Iran   Caspian Mild   Mountains   Arid and Semi Arid Iran s climate ranges from arid or semiarid  to subtropical along the Caspian coast and the northern forests  On the northern edge of the country  the Caspian coastal plain  temperatures rarely fall below freezing and the area remains humid for the rest of the year  Summer temperatures rarely exceed 29  C  84 2  F   44  45  Annual precipitation is 680 mm  26 8 in  in the eastern part of the plain and more than 1 700 mm

Iranian Cheetah  whose numbers were greatly reduced after the Iranian Revolution  Today there are ongoing efforts to increase its population and introduce it back in India  Iran had lost all its Asiatic Lion and the now extinct Caspian Tigers by the earlier part of the 20th century  46  Provinces and cities Main articles  Provinces of Iran and Counties of Iran See also  List of Iranian cities

cultural remains of Neanderthal man dating back to the Middle Paleolithic period  which have been found mainly in the Zagros region and less frequently in central Iran at sites such as Shanidar  Kobeh  Kunji  Bisetun  Tamtama  Warwasi  Palegawra  and Yafteh Cave  55  Discovery of human skeletons in the Huto cave and the adjacent Kamarband cave near the town of Behshahr in the Mazandaran Province and Amol old city north of Iran  south of the Caspian Sea in Iran  suggest human habitation of the area as early as 75 000 years ago  56  However  recent studies in the valleys of Shuresh  around the earlier mentioned caves  led to the discovery of 400 000 year old stone tools  57  Evidence for Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic periods are known mainly from the Zagros region in the caves of Kermanshah and Khorramabad  Early agricultural communities such as Chogha Bonut in 8000 BC  58  59 Susa  now a city still existing since 7000 BC  60  61  and Chogha Mish dating back to 6800 BC  62  63

Chalcolithic  The emergence of written records from around 3000 BC also parallels Mesopotamian history  In the Old Elamite period  Middle Bronze Age   from around 2800 BC  Elam consisted of kingdoms on the Iranian plateau  centered in Anshan  and from the mid 2nd millennium BC  it was centered in Susa in the Khuzestan lowlands  Elamite kingdom continued its existence until the emergence of Median and Achaemenid Empires  Proto Iranians first emerged following the separation of Indo Iranians  and are traced to the Andronovo culture  67 Proto Iranian tribes arrived in the Iranian plateau in the third and second millennium BC  probably in more than one wave of emigration  and settled as nomads  Further separation of Proto Iranians into  Eastern  and  Western  groups occurred due to migration  By the first millennium BC  Medes  Persians  Bactrians and Parthians populated the western part  while Cimmerians  Sarmatians and Alans populated the steppes north of the Black Sea  Other tribes began to settle on the eastern edge  as far as on the mountainous frontier of the north western Indian subcontinent and into the area which is now Balochistan  Others  such as the Scythian tribes  spread as

 the largest of its day  until Cyrus the Great established a unified empire of the Medes and Persians leading to the Achaemenid Empire  559 330  BC   and further unification between peoples and cultures  After Cyrus  death  his son Cambyses II continued his father s work of conquest  making significant gains in Egypt  Following a power struggle after Cambyses  death  Darius the Great was declared king  ruled 522 486 BC   Under Cyrus and Darius  the Persian Empire eventually became the largest and most powerful empire in human history up until that point  68  The borders of the Persian empire stretched from the Indus and Oxus Rivers in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west  extending through Anatolia  modern day Turkey  and Egypt  The Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent  at about 500 BC In 499 BC  Athens lent support to a revolt in Miletus which resulted in the sacking of Sardis  This led to an Achaemenid campaign against Greece known as the Greco Persian Wars which continued through the first half of the 5th century BC  During the Greco Persian Wars Persia made some major advances and razed Athens in 480 BC  but after a string of Greek victories the Persians were forced to withdraw  Fighting ended with the peace of Callias in 449 BC  The rules and ethics emanating from Zoroaster s teachings were strictly followed by the Achaemenids who introduced and adopted policies based on human rights  equality and banning of slavery  citation needed  Zoroastrianism spread unimposed during the time of the Achaemenids and through contacts with the exiled Jewish people in Babylon freed by Cyrus  Zoroastrian concepts further propagated and influenced the Abrahamic religions  The Golden Age of Athens marked by Aristotle  Plato and Socrates also came about during the Achaemenid period while their contacts with Persia and the Near East abounded  The peace  tranquility  security and prosperity that were afforded to the people of the Near East and Southeast Europe proved to be a rare historical occurrence  an unparalleled period where commerce prospered and the standard of living for all people of the region improved  69  In 334 BC  Alexander the Great invaded the Achaemenid Empire  defeating the last Achaemenid Emperor Darius III at the Battle of Issus in 333 BC  He left the annexed territory in 328 327  In each of the former Achaemenid territories he installed his own officers as caretakers  which led to friction and ultimately to the partitioning of the former empire after Alexander s death  and the subsequent formation of the Seleucid Empire  A bust from the National Museum of Iran of Musa of Parthia The Parthian Empire  238 BC 226 AD   led by the Arsacid Dynasty  was the third Iranian kingdom to dominate the Iranian plateau  after defeating the Greek Seleucid Empire  beginning in the late 3rd century BC  and intermittently controlled Mesopotamia between ca  150 BC and 224 AD  This was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran and lasted five centuries  After the conquests of Media  Assyria  Babylonia and Elam  the Parthians had to organize their empire  The former elites of these countries were Greek  and the new rulers had to adapt to their customs if they wanted their rule to last  As a result  the cities retained their ancient rights and civil administrations remained more or less undisturbed  Parthia was the arch enemy of the Roman Empire in the east  limiting Rome s expansion beyond Cappadocia  central Anatolia   By using a heavily armed and armoured cataphract cavalry  and lightly armed but highly mobile mounted archers  the Parthians  held their own against Rome for almost 300 years   70  Rome s acclaimed general Mark Antony led a disastrous campaign against the Parthians in 36 BC  in which he lost 32 000 men  By the time of Roman emperor Augustus  Rome and Parthia were settling some of their differences through diplomacy  By this time  Parthia had acquired an assortment of golden eagles  the cherished standards of Rome s legions  captured from Mark Antony  and Crassus  who was defeated by General Surena in the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC  71  Persian and Median soldiers at Persepolis The end of the Parthian Empire came in 224 AD  when the empire was loosely organized and the last king was defeated by Ardashir I  one of the empire s vassals  Ardashir I then went on to create the Sassanid Empire  Soon he started reforming the country both economically and militarily  The Sassanids established an empire roughly within the frontiers achieved by the Achaemenids  referring to it as Er nshahr or Iranshahr     Dominion of the Iranians    i e  of Iranians   with their capital at Ctesiphon  72  Unlike the diadochic Seleucids and the succeeding Arsacids  who used a vassalary system  the Sassanids like the Achaemenids had a system of governors  MP  shahrab  personally appointed by the Emperor and directed by the central government  The Romans suffered repeated losses particularly by Ardashir I  Shapur I  and Shapur II  73  During their reign  Sassanid battles with the Roman Empire caused such pessimism in Rome that the historian Cassius Dio wrote

Here was a source of great fear to us  So formidable does the Sassanid king seem to our eastern legions  that some are liable to go over to him  and others are unwilling to fight at all  74    In 632 raiders from the Arab peninsula began attacking the Sassanid Empire  Iran was defeated in the Battle of al Q disiyyah  paving way for the Muslim conquest of Persia  During the Parthian and later Sassanid eras  trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the great civilizations of China  Egypt  Mesopotamia  Persia  Indian subcontinent  and Rome  and helped to lay the foundations for the modern world  Parthian remains display classical Greek influences in some instances and retain their oriental mode in others  a clear expression of the cultural diversity that characterized Parthian art and life  75  The Parthians were innovators of many architecture designs such as that of Ctesiphon  which later influenced European Romanesque architecture  76  77  Under the Sassanids  Iran expanded relations with China  Arts  music  and architecture greatly flourished  and centers such as the School of Nisibis and Academy of Gundishapur became world renowned centers

provinces and Transoxiana  came under Islamic rule  78  Many provinces in Iran defended themselves against the Arab invaders  although none in the end were able to repulse the invaders  However  when the Arabs had subdued the country  many of the cities rose in rebellion  killing Arab governors  although reinforcement by Arab armies succeeded in putting down the rebellions  However  the Iranians  conversion to Islam was a complex process and is generally considered to have been gradual  the notion of force has largely been discredited  79  although occasional acts of violence did take place  with Zoroastrian scriptures being burned and Zoroastrian priests being executed  78  80  By the 9th century  Islam became a dominant religion in Persia and the conversion of Iranians to Islam brought profound changes to their life and culture  78  However  in some regions  such as the Fars province  Zoroastrianism remained strong up to the 9th century  although Sufis such as Abu Eshaq Kazeruni  the founder of Kazeruni Sufi order  brought mass conversion of Zoroastrians to Islam in the 10th century  78  During the Abbasid caliphate decline  independent 81  82  and semi independent native Iranian dynasties arose in different parts of Persia including the Tahirids  Saffarids  Samanids  Afrighids  Ghurids  Sallarids  Justanids  Shaddadids and Buyids  Socially  the Arabs abolished the previous social class system of Sassanians while later  especially under the Ummayyads  another form of discrimination and exclusion against non Arabs evolved  83  In reaction to these  Abu Moslem  an Iranian 84  85  general  expelled the Umayyads from Damascus and helped the Abbasid caliphs to conquer Baghdad  The Abbasid caliphs frequently chose their Iranians as their  wazirs   viziers   and Iranian governors acquired a certain amount of local autonomy  Thus in 822  the governor of Khorasan  Tahir  proclaimed his independence and founded a new Persian dynasty of Tahirids  And by the Samanid era  Iran s efforts to regain its independence had been well solidified  86  Attempts at Arabization thus never succeeded in Iran  and movements such as the Shu ubiyya became catalysts for Iranians to regain their independence in their relations with the Arab invaders  87  Other notable major revolts  some by Iranian Muslims and others by practitioners of old Iranian religions against Arab rule were led by Al Muqanna  Sunpadh  Khurramites  Babak Khorramdin  Maziar  Mardavij  Ustadh Sis and Ya qub i Laith Saffari  The cultural revival of the post Abbasid period led to a resurfacing of Iranian national identity  The resulting cultural movement reached its peak during the 9th and 10th centuries  The most notable effect of the movement was the continuation of the Persian language  the official language of Iran to the present day  Ferdowsi  Iran s greatest epic poet  is regarded today as the most important figure in maintaining the Persian language  After an interval of silence Iran re emerged as a separate  different and distinctive element within Islam  Khwarezmid Empire around 1200 In 1218  the eastern Khwarazmid provinces of Transoxiana and Khorasan suffered a devastating invasion by Genghis Khan  During this period more than half of Iran s population was killed  88  turning the streets of Persian cities such as Nishapur into  rivers of blood   as the severed heads of men  women  and children were  neatly stacked into carefully constructed pyramids around which the carcasses of the city s dogs and cats were placed   89  According to Steven R  Ward   Overall  the Mongol violence and depredations killed up to three fourths of the population of the Iranian plateau  possibly 10 to 15 million people  Some historians have estimated that Iran s population did not again reach its pre Mongol levels until the mid 20th century   90  In a letter to King Louis IX of France  Holaku  one of the Genghis Khan s grandsons  took sole responsibility for 200 000 deaths in his raids of Iran and the Caliphate  91  He was followed by yet another conqueror  Tamerlane  who established his capital in Samarkand  92  The waves of devastation prevented many cities such as Nishapur from reaching their pre invasion population levels until the 20th century  eight centuries later  93  In 1387  Tamerlane avenged a revolt in Isfahan by massacring 70 000 people  94  But both Hulagu  Tamerlane  and their successors soon came to adopt the ways and customs of that which they had conquered  choosing to surround themselves with a culture that was distinctively Persian  95  The mid 14th century Black Death killed about 30  of the country s population  96  Illustration from Jami  Rose Garden of the Pious   dated 1553  The image blends Persian poetry and Persian miniature into one  as is the norm for many works of the Timurid era  Iran was gradually Islamized after the collapse of the Sassanid Empire  however  it was not Arabized  Iranian culture re emerged with a separate and distinctive character and made an immense contribution to the Islamic civilization  97  98  When Islam came through Iran  what developed was an Iranian Islam or Persian Islam rather than the original Arab Islam  and this new Islam is sometimes referred to by scholars as Islam i Ajam  Persian Islam   97  99  It was this Persian Islam and Sufism which was brought to new areas and new peoples such as the Turks of Central Asia  the Ottoman Empire  and the Indian subcontinent  97  Among the major Iranian Muslims who cultivated Sufism and helped the spread of Islam through Sufism  one can mention Habib Ajami  Hallaj  Hasan Basri  Junayd Baghdadi  Bayazid Bastami  Maruf Karkhi  Abdul Qadir Gilani  Moinuddin Chishti  Jalaluddin Rumi  Najmuddin Kubra  and Baha ud Din Naqshband Bukhari  Note should also be made of Abu Hanifa  the founder of the Hanafi school of thought which is followed by most Muslims today  Arabic writer Ibn Khaldun has remarked that the sedentary culture which was necessary for the development of civilization was rooted in the Persian empire  100  One of the main developments after the advent of Islam in Iran was the rise of the New Persian language as an important Indo European language  The New Persian language was an evolution of Middle Persian  which in turn was derived from Old Persian  New Persian absorbed a considerable amount of Arabic vocabulary 101  102  during this era  although the Arabic vocabulary that was Persianized 103  often took a different meaning than the Arabic origin  In terms of contribution to the Arabic language  Iranians like Sibawayhi 104  pioneered writing books of grammar of the Arabic language  Tamerlane defeating the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt  Culturally  Iranians preserved their language  while they used Arabic for scientific and philosophical discourses  105  this enabled them to reach a worldwide audience for the first time  105  After the 10th century  Persian  written in the modified Perso Arabic script alongside Arabic  was used for scientific  philosophical  historical  mathematical  musical  and medical works  as important Iranian writers such as Nasir al Din al Tusi  Avicenna  Qotb al Din Shirazi  Gurgani  Nasir Khusraw  Biruni  Abd al Qadir Maraghi made contributions to Persian scientific writing  During this era  Iranians continued on a much larger scale the cultural and scientific enterprises set up by the Sassanids  106  The blossoming Persian literature  philosophy  medicine  and art became major elements in the forming Muslim civilization  The Islamic Golden Age  which is characterized by developments in science  owed to a large extent its importance to vital contributions made by Iranians  107  The Islamic Golden Age reached its peak in the 10th and 11th centuries  during which Persia was the main theatre of scientific activity  106  The Persian influence of this period relied heavily upon the achievements of the Sassanids  and the weight of this influence has led the Muslim world to accept Islamic civilization as the Perso Islamic civilization  108  Even in the development of Arabic scientific prose itself  which differs in style from that of the Quran  Persian scholars such as Abdullah Ibn al Muqaffa  had a major role  Indeed  the class of clerks and civil administrators that was responsible for the cultivation of the sciences in the early Islamic centuries consisted mostly of Persians  109  The contributions of Iranians to the Arabic language are however not limited to scientific prose but are also found in Arabic poetry  The contributions by Iranians are characterised as  the lively and graceful fancy  elegance of diction  depth and tenderness of feeling  and a rich store of ideas   110  Iranian philosophy after the Islamic conquest is characterized by different interactions with Old Iranian philosophy  with Ancient Greek philosophy  and with the development of Islamic philosophy  Illuminationism and transcendent theosophy are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of this era in Persia  These movements continued well into the 11th century  during which the Nizamiyya University was founded  and hundreds of Iranian scholars and scientists contributed greatly to technology  science  and medicine  later influencing the rise of European sciences during the Renaissance  111  Early modern era

soon became a major political power and promoted the flow of bilateral state contacts  The Safavid peak was during the rule of Shah Abbas The Great  29  The Safavid dynasty frequently warred with the Ottoman Empire  Uzbek tribes and the Portuguese Empire  The Safavids moved their capital from Tabriz to Qazvin and then to Isfahan  where their patronage for the arts propelled Iran into one of its most aesthetically productive eras  Under their rule  the state became highly centralized  the first attempts to modernize the military were made  and even a distinct style of architecture developed  In 1722 Pashtun rebels headed by the Hotakis of Kandahar defeated Sultan Husayn and ended the Safavid dynasty  but in 1735  Nader Shah successfully drove out the Pashtuns from Isfahan and established the Afsharid Dynasty  Sattar Khan was a key figure in the Persian Constitutional Revolution He then staged an incursion into India in 1738  securing the Peacock Throne  Koh i Noor  and Darya ye Noor among other royal treasures  His rule did not last long  however  as he was assassinated in 1747  The Mashhad based Afshar Dynasty was succeeded by the Zand dynasty in 1750  founded by Karim Khan  who established his capital at Shiraz  His rule brought a period of relative peace and renewed prosperity  The Zand dynasty lasted three generations  until Aga Muhammad Khan executed Lotf Ali Khan  and founded his new capital in Tehran  marking the dawn of the Qajar dynasty in 1794  The Qajar chancellor Amir Kabir established Iran s first modern college system  among other modernizing reforms  Iran suffered several wars with Imperial Russia during the Qajar era  resulting in Iran losing almost half of its territories to Imperial Russia and the British Empire  via the treaties of Gulistan  Turkmenchay and Akhal  The Great Persian Famine of 1870 1871 is believed to have caused the death of 2 million persons  112  In spite of The Great Game Iran managed to maintain her sovereignty and was never colonized  unlike neighbouring states in the region  Repeated foreign intervention and a corrupt and weakened Qajar rule led to various protests and constitutionalization efforts which eventually resulted in the establishment of the nation s first parliament in 1906  This was followed by the Jangal movement of Gilan which lead to the short lived Gilan Republic  Pahlavi dynasty  1925

 Mohammad Reza Pahlavi  In 1951  after the assassination of prime minister Ali Razmara  Dr  Mohammad Mosaddegh was elected prime minister by a parliamentary vote which was then ratified by the Shah  As prime minister  Mosaddegh became enormously popular in Iran after he nationalized Iran s petroleum industry and oil reserves  In response  the British government  headed by Winston Churchill  embargoed Iranian oil and successfully enlisted the United States to join in a plot to depose the democratically elected government of Mosaddegh  In 1953 US President Dwight D  Eisenhower authorized Operation Ajax  The operation was successful  and Mosaddegh was arrested on 19 August 1953  The coup was the first time the US had openly overthrown an elected  civilian government  113  Mohammad Reza

Shah fled the country in January 1979 and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from exile to Tehran  The Pahlavi dynasty collapsed ten days later  on 11 February  when Iran s military declared itself  neutral  after guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting  Iran officially became an Islamic Republic on 1 April 1979  when Iranians overwhelmingly approved a national referendum to make it so  30  31  In parallel nation wide uprisings against the new regime erupted in Kordestan  Khuzestan  Balochistan and other areas  though were eventually subdued  with some lasting until late 1980  In December 1979  the country approved a theocratic constitution  whereby Khomeini became Supreme Leader of the country  The speed and success of the revolution surprised many throughout the world  118  as it had not been precipitated by a military defeat  a financial crisis  or a peasant rebellion  119  Although both nationalists and Marxists joined with Islamic traditionalists to overthrow the Shah  tens of thousands were killed and executed by the Islamic regime afterward  and the revolution ultimately resulted in an Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini  120  Ayatollah Khomeini  founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran Iran   United States relations deteriorated rapidly during the revolution  On 4 November 1979  a group of Iranian students seized US embassy personnel  labeling the embassy a  den of spies   121  They accused its personnel of being CIA agents plotting to overthrow the revolutionary government  as the CIA had done to Mosaddegh in 1953  While the student ringleaders had not asked for permission from Khomeini to seize the embassy  Khomeini nonetheless supported the embassy takeover after hearing of its success  122  While most of the female and African American hostages were released within the first months  122  the remaining 52 hostages were held for 444 days  Subsequent attempts by the Jimmy Carter administration to negotiate or rescue were unsuccessful  In January 1981 the hostages were set free according to the Algiers Accords  Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein decided to take advantage of what he perceived to be disorder in the wake of the Iranian Revolution and its unpopularity with Western governments  The once strong Iranian military had been disbanded during the revolution  Saddam sought to expand Iraq s access to the Persian Gulf by acquiring territories that Iraq had claimed earlier from Iran during the Shah s rule  Of chief importance to Iraq was Khuzestan  which not only has a substantial Arab population  but boasted rich oil fields as well  On the unilateral behalf of the United Arab Emirates  the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs became objectives as well  On 22 September 1980 the Iraqi army invaded Iran at Khuzestan  precipitating the Iran Iraq War  Iranian child soldier  An estimated 95 000 Iranian children were killed during the Iran Iraq war  123  Although Saddam Hussein s forces made several early advances  by 1982  Iranian forces managed to push the Iraqi army back into Iraq  allying with the Iraqi Kurds  who rose up in rebellion against Saddam  Khomeini sought to export his Islamic revolution westward into Iraq  especially on the majority Shia Arabs living in the country  The war then continued for six more years until 1988  when Khomeini  in his words   drank the cup of poison  and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations  The total Iranian casualties of the war were estimated to be anywhere between 500 000 and 1 000 000  with more than 100 000 Iranians being victims of Iraq s chemical weapons  124  verification needed  Almost all relevant international agencies have confirmed that Saddam engaged

Iran Iraq War President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his administration concentrated on a pragmatic pro business policy of rebuilding and strengthening the economy without making any dramatic break with the ideology of the revolution  Rafsanjani served until 1997 when he was succeeded by the moderate reformist Mohammad Khatami  During his two terms as president  Khatami advocated freedom of expression  tolerance and civil society  constructive diplomatic relations with other states including European Union and Asian governments  and an economic policy that supported free market and foreign investment  However  Khatami is widely regarded as having been unsuccessful in achieving his goal of making Iran more free and democratic  128  In the 2005 presidential elections  Iran made yet another change in political direction  when conservative populist candidate Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected over Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani  129  A significant challenge to Ahmadinejad s political power  and the foundations of the Islamic Republic itself occurred during the 2009 Iranian presidential election that was held on 12 June 2009  130  the tenth presidential election to be held in the

historical period in Iran as Iranian culture influenced China  India and Roman civilization considerably  136  and so influenced as far as Western Europe and Africa  137  This influence played a prominent role in the formation of both Asiatic and European medieval art  138  This influence carried forward to the Islamic world  Much of what later became known as Islamic learning  such as philology  literature  jurisprudence  philosophy  medicine  architecture and the sciences were based on some of the practises taken from the Sassanid Persians to the broader Muslim world  139  140  141  After Islamization of Iran Islamic rituals have penetrated in the Iranian culture  The most noticeable one of them is commemoration of Husayn ibn Ali  Every year in Day of Ashura most of Iranians

further step in the dethronement of Arabic from being the sole lingua franca of educated and polite society in the Middle East  Coming as they did through a Transoxania which was still substantially Iranian and into Persia proper  the Seljuqs with no high level Turkish cultural or literary heritage of their own   took over that of Persia  so that the Persian language became the administration and culture in their land of Persia and Anatolia  The Persian culture of the Rum Seljuqs was particularly splendid  and it was only gradually that Turkish emerged there as a parallel language in the field

but it was not Arabized  Persians remained Persians  And after an interval of silence  Iran reemerged as a separate  different and distinctive element within Islam  eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself  Culturally  politically  and most remarkable of all even religiously  the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance  The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor  including Arabic poetry  to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution  In a sense  Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself  a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam i Ajam  It was this Persian Islam  rather than the original Arab Islam  that was brought to new areas and new peoples  to the Turks  first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey  and of course to India  The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the

Franz Rosenthal  N  J  Dawood  Published by Princeton University Press  1969    Professor  Gilbert Lazard  The language known as New Persian  which usually is called at this period  early Islamic times  by the name of Dari or Parsi Dari  can be classified linguistically as a continuation of Middle Persian  the official religious and literary language of Sassanian Iran  itself a continuation of Old Persian  the language of the Achaemenids  Unlike the other languages and dialects  ancient and modern  of the Iranian group such as Avestan  Parthian  Soghdian  Kurdish  Pashto  etc   Old Middle and New Persian represent one and the same language at three states of its history  It had its origin in Fars  the true Persian country from the historical point of view  and is differentiated by
