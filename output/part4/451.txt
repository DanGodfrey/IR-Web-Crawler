America  Situated on the isthmus connecting North and South America  it is bordered by Costa Rica to the west  Colombia to the southeast  the Caribbean to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south  The capital is Panama City  Explored and settled by the Spanish in the 16th century  Panama broke with Spain in 1821 and joined a union of Nueva Granada  Ecuador  and Venezuela  named the Republic of Gran Colombia  When the latter dissolved in 1830  Panama and Nueva Granada remained joined  Nueva Granada later became the Republic of Colombia  With the backing of the United States  Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903  allowing the Panama Canal to be built by the U S  Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914  In 1977  an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the United States to Panama by the end of the century  4  Revenue from canal tolls represent today a significant portion of Panama s GDP  Panama has the third  or fourth largest economy in Central America and 5  it is also the fastest growing economy and the largest per capita consumer in Central America  6  7  In 2010 Panama ranked 4th among Latin American countries in terms of the Human Development Index  and 54th in the world in 2010  8  As of 2010  Panama is the second most competitive economy in Latin America as well according to the Global Competitiveness Index from the World Economic Forum  WEF   Panama s jungle is home to an abundance of tropical plants  animals and birds   some of them to be found nowhere else in the world  9  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2 1 Pre Columbian period 2 2

 Etymology There are several theories about the origin of the name  Panama   Some believe that the country was named after a commonly found species of trees  Others believe that the first settlers arrived in Panama in August  when butterflies abound  and that the name means  many butterflies  in an indigenous language  The best known version is that a fishing village and its nearby beach bore the name  Panam    which meant  an abundance of fish   Captain Antonio Tello de Guzm n  while exploring the Pacific side in 1515  stopped in the small indigenous fishing town  This was communicated to the Crown and in 1517 Don Gaspar De Espinosa  a Spanish lieutenant  decided to settle a post there  In 1519  Pedrarias D vila decided to establish the Empire s Pacific city in this site  The new settlement replaced Santa Mar a La Antigua del Dari n  which had lost its function within the Crown s global plan after the beginning of the Spanish exploitation of the riches in the Pacific  Blending all of the above together  Panamanians believe in general that the word Panama means  abundance of fish  trees and butterflies   This is the official definition given in social studies textbooks approved by the Ministry of Education in Panama  However  others believe the word Panama comes from the Kuna word  bannaba  which means  distant  or  far away   10   edit  History Main article  History of Panama The earliest known inhabitants of Panama were the Cuevas and the Cocl  tribes  but they were massacred and wiped out by Spanish who arrived in the 16th century   edit  Pre Columbian period The Isthmus of Panama was formed in a very long process that started 20 million years ago  up to about 3 million years ago when the isthmus finally closed and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions  Mayo 2004  9 10   11  Dolores Piperno  1984  12  has located the human occupancy of the isthmus at around the Late Glacial Period  cited in Mayo 2004  13   11  Olga Linares   13  points out in turn that the existence of the isthmus had an impact on the dispersal of people  agriculture and technology throughout the American continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities  cited in Cooke and S nchez 2004  3   14  Richard Cooke and Luis S nchez  2004  4  41 42  14  emphasize the permanence of peoples in the terrestrial bridge of Western America  and the higher probability that Pre Columbian peoples in the isthmus satisfied their needs by the exchange of goods  by commercial exchange and through social relationships with neighbouring communities  rather than by long distance exchanges  Cooke and S nchez 2004  41   14  Dendrograms proposed by genetists and linguists and available information about styles and iconography of ceramic and stone objects point to a successively complex dispersal of a population of millenary permanence in the isthmus and neighbouring areas  see  for example  Corrales 2000  cited in Cooke and Sanchez 2004  39   14  Cooke and S nchez  2004  4  14  argue therefore that Panama is a singular example of diversity and endemism  and that Christopher Columbus  observations  1501 02  that  although dense  every  village  has a different language and they don t understand one another   quoted in Jane 1988  describe the ethnographic phenomenon of scattering and diversification of peoples that had inhabited the isthmus for several thousands of years  The earliest traces of these indigenous peoples include fluted projectile points  Central Panama was home to some of the first pottery making villages in the Americas  such as the Monagrillo culture dating to about 2500 1700 BC  These evolved into significant populations that are best known through the spectacular burials of the Conte site  dating to c  AD 500 900  and the beautiful polychrome pottery of the Cocl  style  The monumental monolithic sculptures at the Barriles  Chiriqu   site were another important clue of the ancient isthmian cultures  Prior to the arrival of Europeans  Panama was widely settled by Chibchan  Chocoan  and Cueva peoples  among whom the largest group were the Cueva  whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented   There is no accurate knowledge of the size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of the European conquest  Estimates range as high as two million people  but more recent studies place that number closer to 200 000  Archeological finds as well as testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people already conditioned by regular regional routes of commerce   edit  Conquest era The chronology in this section seems to be out of order   You can help  The discussion page may contain suggestions   January 2012  Vasco N  ez de Balboa  a recognized and popular figure of Panamanian history   New Caledonia   the ill fated Scottish Darien scheme colony in the Bay of Caledonia  west of the Gulf of Darien  Rodrigo de Bastidas  sailing westward from Venezuela in 1501 in search of gold  was the first European to explore the isthmus of Panama  A year later  Christopher Columbus visited the isthmus and established a short lived settlement in the Darien  Vasco N  ez de Balboa s tortuous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the Isthmus was  indeed  the path between the seas  and Panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of Spain s empire in the New World  Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America  hauled across the isthmus  and loaded aboard ships for Spain  The route became known as the Camino Real  or Royal Road  although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces  Road of the Crosses  because of the abundance of gravesites along the way  Panama was part of the Spanish empire for 300 years  1538 1821   From the outset  Panamanian identity was based on a sense of  geographic destiny   and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus  The colonial experience also spawned Panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society  the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism  In 1538  the Real Audiencia de Panama was established  initially with jurisdiction from Nicaragua to Cape Horn before the conquest of Peru  A Real Audiencia  royal audiency  was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court  Each audiencia had oidores  Spanish  hearer  a judge   Spanish authorities exercised little control over much of the territory of Panama  large sections managing to resist conquest until very late in the colonial era  Because of this  indigenous people of the area were often referred to as  indios de guerra   war Indians   and resisted Spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them  However  Panama was enormously important to Spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in Peru to Europe  Silver cargos were landed at Panama  and then taken overland to Portobello or Nombre de Dios on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment  Because of the incomplete Spanish control  the Panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates  mostly Dutch and English  and from  new world  Africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the Camino Real in Panama s Interior  and on some of the islands off Panama s Pacific coast  One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under Bayano  which emerged in the 1552 to 1558  Sir Francis Drake s famous raids on Panama in 1572 73 were aided by Panama cimarrons  and Spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582  15  Panama was the site of the ill fated Darien scheme  which set up a Scottish colony in the region in 1698  This failed for a number of reasons  and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of England and Scotland in 1707  When Panama was colonized  the indigenous peoples who survived many diseases  massacres and enslavement of the conquest ultimately fled into the forest and nearby islands  Indian slaves were replaced by Africans  The prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries  1540 1740  while contributing to colonial growth  the placing of extensive regional judicial authority  Real Audiencia  as part of its jurisdiction  and the pivotal role it played at the height of the Spanish Empire  the first modern global empire  helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within Panama well before the rest of the colonies  In 1744  Bishop Francisco Javier de Luna Victoria DeCastro established the College of San Ignacio de Loyola and on June 3  1749 founded La Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Javier  By this time  however  Panama s importance and influence had become insignificant as Spain s power dwindled in Europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted to round Cape Horn in order to reach the Pacific  While the Panama route was short it was also labor intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden down trek required to get from the one coast to the other  During the last half of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century  migrations to the countryside decreased Panama City s population and the isthmus  economy shifted from the tertiary to the primary sector  In 1717  the viceroyalty of New Granada  northern South America  was created in response to other Europeans trying to take Spanish territory in the Caribbean region  The Isthmus of Panama was placed under its jurisdiction  However  the remoteness of Santa Fe de Bogot  proved a greater obstacle than the Spanish crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority  closer proximity  previous ties to the viceroyalty of Lima and even Panama s own initiative  This uneasy relationship between Panama and Bogot  would persist for a century or two  Modern Panamanian history has been shaped by its transisthmian canal  which had been a dream since the beginning of Spanish colonization  From 1880 to 1890  a French company under Ferdinand de Lesseps attempted unsuccessfully to construct a sea level canal on the site of the present Panama Canal  On the other hand  the Panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolishment of the encomienda system in Azuero  set forth by the Spanish Crown  in 1558 because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population  In its stead  a system of medium and smaller sized landownership was promoted  thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and small sized proprietors  The end of the encomienda system in Azuero  however  sparked the conquest of Veraguas in that same year  Under the leadership of Francisco V zquez  the region of Veraguas passed into Castillan rule in 1558  In the newly conquered region  the old system of encomienda was imposed   edit  1800s Santo Domingo Church  On November 10  1821  the Grito de La Villa de Los Santos  Cry From the Town of Saints  occurred  It was a unilateral decision by the residents of Azuero  without backing from Panama City  to declare their separation from the Spanish Empire  In both Veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain  although on differing levels  To Veraguas  it was the ultimate act of treason  while to the capital  it was seen as inefficient and irregular  and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans  The Grito was an event that shook the isthmus to the core  It was a sign  on the part of the residents of Azuero  of their antagonism towards the independence movement in the capital  who in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt  since the separatists in Panama believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting selfishly for their right to rule  once the peninsulares  Spaniards born in the Iberian peninsula  were long gone  It was an incredibly brave move on the part of Azuero  which lived in fear of Colonel Jos  de F brega  and with good reason  the Colonel was a staunch loyalist  and had the entirety of the isthmus  military supplies in his hands  They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists  What they had counted on  however  was the influence of the separatists in the capital  Ever since October 1821  when the former Governor General  Juan de la Cruz Murge n  left the isthmus on a campaign in Quito and left the Veraguan colonel in charge  the separatists had been slowly converting F brega to the separatist side  As such  by November 10  F brega was now a supporter of the independence movement  Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos  F brega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city s support for independence  No military repercussions occurred because of the skillful bribing of royalist troops   edit  Post colonial Panama See also  Separation of Panama from Colombia President Carter shakes hands with General Torrijos of Panama after signing the Panama Canal Treaty  In the first eighty years following independence from Spain  Panama was a department of Colombia  since voluntarily becoming part of it at the end of 1821  The people of the isthmus made several attempts to secede and came close to success in 1831  and again during the Thousand Days War of 1899 1902  When the Senate of Colombia rejected the Hay Herran Treaty  the United States decided to support the Panamanian independence movement  In November 1903  Panama proclaimed its independence and concluded the Hay Bunau Varilla Treaty with the United States  The treaty granted rights to the United States  as if it were sovereign  in a zone roughly 10 miles  16 km  wide and 50 miles  80 km  long  In that zone  the U S  would build a canal  then administer  fortify  and defend it  in perpetuity   In 1914  the United States completed the existing 83 km  52 mi  canal  The early 1960s saw the beginning of sustained pressure in Panama for the renegotiation of this treaty  From 1903 until 1968  Panama was a constitutional democracy dominated by a commercially oriented oligarchy  During the 1950s  the Panamanian military began to challenge the oligarchy s political hegemony  Amidst negotiations for the Robles Johnson treaty  Panama held elections in 1967  The candidates were Dr  Arnulfo Arias Madrid  Antonio Gonz lez Revilla  and Engineer David Samudio  who had the government s support  Samudio was the candidate of Alianza del Pueblo   People s Alliance    Arias Madrid was the candidate of Uni n Nacional   National Union    and Gonz lez Revilla was the candidate of Democracia Cristiana   Christian Democrats    see Pizzurno Gel s and Ara z  Estudios sobre el Panam  republicano 508   16  Arias Madrid was declared the winner of elections that were marked by violence and accusations of fraud against Alianza del Pueblo  On October 1  1968  Arias Madrid took office as president of Panama  promising to lead a government of  national union  that would end the reigning corruption and pave the way for a new Panama  A week and a half later  on October 11  1968  the National Guard  Guardia Nacional  ousted Arias and initiated the downward spiral that would culminate with the United States  invasion in 1989  Arias  who had promised to respect the hierarchy of the National Guard  broke the pact and started a large restructuring of the Guard  To preserve the Guard s interests  Lieutenant Colonel Omar Torrijos Herrera and Major Boris Mart nez commanded the first coup of a military force against a civilian government in Panamanian republican history  see Pizzurno Gel s and Ara z  Estudios sobre el Panam  republicano 523   16  The military justified itself by declaring that Arias Madrid was trying to install a dictatorship  and promised a return to constitutional rule  In the meantime  the Guard began a series of populist measures that would gain support for the coup  Amongst them were the freezing of prices on food  medicine 17  and other goods until January 31  1969  the freezing of renting prices  and the legalization of the permanence of squatting families in boroughs surrounding the historic site of Panama Viejo  16  Parallel to this  the military began a policy of repression against the opposition  who were labeled communists  The military appointed a Provisional Government Junta that would arrange new elections  However  the National Guard would prove to be very reluctant to abandon power and soon began calling itself El Gobierno Revolucionario   The Revolutionary Government     edit  Post 1970 During Omar Torrijos s control  the military regime transformed the political and economic structure of the country by initiating massive coverage of social security services and expanding public education  The constitution was changed in 1972  For the reform to the constitution  the military created a new organization  the Assembly of Corregimiento Representatives  which replaced the National Assembly  The new assembly  also known as the Poder Popular   Power of the People    was composed of 505 members selected by the military without the participation of political parties  which had been eliminated by the military  The new constitution proclaimed Omar Torrijos the  Maximum Leader of the Panamanian Revolution   and conceded him unlimited power for six years  although  to keep a fa ade of constitutionality  Demetrio B  Lakas was appointed president for the same period  Pizzurno Gel s and Ara z  Estudios sobre el Panam  republicano 541   16  In 1981  Torrijos died in a planecrash  It has been widely speculated that his death was a CIA assassination due to his resistance to renegotiate the Panama Canal Treaty  negotiated under the Carter administration  with President Ronald Reagan  18  Torrijos  death altered the tone of Panama s political evolution  Despite the 1983 constitutional amendments  which proscribed a political role for the military  the Panama Defense Forces  PDF   as they were then known  continued to dominate Panamanian political life  By this time  General Manuel Noriega was firmly in control of both the PDF and the civilian government  In the 1984 elections  the candidates were Nicol s Ardito Barletta Vallarino  supported by the military in a union called UNADE  Dr  Arnulfo Arias Madrid  for the opposition union ADO  the ex General Rub n Dar o Paredes  who had been forced to an early retirement by Noriega  running for Partido Nacionalista Popular PNP   Popular Nationalist Party    and Carlos Iv n Z  iga  running for Partido Acci n Popular  PAPO  meaning  Popular Action Party   Nicol s Ardito Barleta was declared the winner of elections that had been clearly won by Arnulfo Arias Madrid  Ardito Barletta inherited a country in economic ruin and hugely indebted to the IMF and the World Bank  Amidst the economic crisis and Barletta s efforts to calm the country s creditors  street protests arose  and so did military repression  Meanwhile  Noriega s regime had fostered the development of a well hidden criminal economy that operated as a parallel source of income for the military and their allies  providing revenues from drugs and money laundering  Towards the end of the military dictatorship  a new wave of Chinese migrants arrived on the isthmus in the hope of migrating to the United States  The smuggling of Chinese became an enormous business  with revenues of up to 200 million dollars for Noriega s regime  see Mon 167   19  The military dictatorship  at that time supported by the United States  perpetrated the assassination and torture of more than one hundred Panamanians and forced into exile at least another hundred dissidents  see Z rate 15   20  Noriega also began playing a double role in Central America under the supervision of the CIA  While the Contadora group conducted diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region  Noriega supplied the Nicaraguan Contras and other guerrillas in the region with weapons and ammunition  Pizzurno Gel s and Ara z  Estudios sobre el Panam  republicano 602   16  On June 6  1987  the recently retired Colonel Roberto D az Herrera  resentful for Noriega s violation of the  Torrijos Plan  of succession that would turn him into the chief of the military after Noriega  decided to denounce the regime  He revealed details of the electoral fraud  accused Noriega of planning Torrijos s death  declared that Torrijos had received 12 million dollars from the Shah of Iran so that Panama would give the exiled Iranian leader asylum  and blamed Noriega for the assassination by decapitation of opposition leader Dr  Hugo Spadafora  Pizzurno Gel s and Ara z  Estudios sobre el Panam  republicano 618   16  On the night of June 9  1987  the Cruzada Civilista   Civic Crusade   was created and began organizing actions of civil disobedience  The Crusade called for a general strike  In response  the military suspended constitutional rights and declared a state of emergency in the country  On July 10  the Civic Crusade called for a massive demonstration that was violently repressed by the  Dobermans   the military s special riot control unit  That day  later known as El Viernes Negro   Black Friday    left six hundred people injured and another six hundred detained  many of whom were later tortured and raped  United States President Ronald Reagan began a series of sanctions against the military regime  The United States froze economic and military assistance to Panama in the summer of 1987 in response to the domestic political crisis in Panama and an attack on the U S  Embassy  Yet these sanctions did little to overthrow Noriega but instead severely damaged Panama s economy  The sanctions hit the Panamanian population hard and caused the Gross Domestic Product  GDP  to decline almost 25 percent between 1987 1989  see Acosta n p    21  On February 5  1988  General Manuel Antonio Noriega was accused of drug trafficking by federal juries in Tampa and Miami  In April 1988  the U S  President Ronald Reagan invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act  freezing Panamanian government assets in all U S  organizations  In May 1989 Panamanians voted overwhelmingly for the anti Noriega candidates  The Noriega regime promptly annulled the election and embarked on a new round of repression  Aftermath of urban warfare during the U S  invasion of Panama  On December 19  President George H  W  Bush decided to use force against Panama  declaring that the operation was necessary to safeguard the lives of U S  citizens in Panama  defend democracy and human rights  combat drug trafficking  and secure the functioning of the Canal as required by the Torrijos Carter Treaties  New York Times  A Transcript of President Bush s Address n p    22  Operation Just Cause was justified by the United States as necessary to secure the functioning of the Canal and re establish democracy in the country  Although described as a surgical maneuver  the action led to civilian deaths whose estimated numbers range from 400 to 4 000 during the two weeks of armed activities in the largest United States military operation since the end of the Vietnam War  For some commentators  the action was not intended only to rid Panama of the dictatorship but served also to reinforce United States authority over the region right at the end of the Cold War  as well as use Panama as practice field for weapons and strategies that would shortly after be used in the Gulf War  Cajar P ez 22   23  The urban population  living below the poverty level  was greatly affected by the 1989 invasion  becoming the  collateral cost  of the democratization of the country  As pointed out in 1995 by a UN Technical Assistance Mission to Panama  the bombardments during the invasion caused the displacement of 20 000 persons  The most stricken district was El Chorrillo where several blocks of apartments were completely destroyed  El Chorrillo had been since Canal construction days a series of wooden barracks  these easily caught fire under the United States attack  According to the Technical Mission  the displaced were segregated to unfinished USAID dwellings  far from communications and basic services  or were sent back to live in El Chorrillo s new low standard multi family buildings constructed hastily by the Panamanian government in replacement of their lost homes  see Committee on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  n p    As stated by respondents in a 2005 survey conducted in El Chorrillo  after the invasion  crime and drug trafficking increased  and living conditions in the neighborhood worsened  Coleen Acosta points out that  the intervention added further to  Panama s  economic decline  Some sections of Panama City were heavily damaged  leaving thousands homeless  and subsequent looting left businesses with damages in the hundreds of millions  The economic damage caused by the invasion and subsequent civil disobedience has been estimated to be between 1 5 and 2 billion dollars     Unemployment rose to record highs as the government infrastructure was left in chaos  According to the Chamber of Commerce  10 000 employees lost their jobs in the aftermath of the war  n p    21  The U S  troops involved in Operation Just Cause achieved their primary objectives  and Noriega eventually surrendered to U S  authorities  He completed his sentence for drug trafficking charges in September 2007  In August 2007  a U S  federal court in Miami found Noriega extraditable to France  where he was convicted in absentia for money laundering  Noriega was extradited to France on April 26  2010 and his trial started on June 28  2010 in Paris  France  On July 7  2010  Noriega was convicted by the 11th chamber of the Tribunal Correctionnel de Paris  and sentenced to seven years in jail  The prosecutor in the case had sought a ten year prison term  In addition   2 3 million  approximately US 3 6 million  that has long been frozen in Noriega s French bank accounts was ordered to be seized   edit  Post invasion era Though Panama suffered heavy economic upheavals because of military warfare  it has managed to rebuild its economy as one of the fastest growing in the world  Panama s Electoral Tribunal moved quickly to rebuild the civilian constitutional government  reinstated the results of the May 1989 election on December 27  1989  and confirmed the victory of President Guillermo Endara and Vice Presidents Guillermo Ford and Ricardo Arias Calderon  During its five year term  the often fractious government struggled to meet the public s high expectations  Its new police force was a major improvement over its predecessor but was not fully able to deter crime  Ernesto P rez Balladares was sworn in as President on September 1  1994  after an internationally monitored election campaign  Perez Balladares ran as the candidate for a three party coalition dominated by the Democratic Revolutionary Party  PRD   the erstwhile political arm of military dictatorships  Perez Balladares worked skillfully during the campaign to rehabilitate the PRD s image  emphasizing the party s populist Torrijos roots rather than its association with Noriega  He won the election with only 33  of the vote when the major non PRD forces splintered into competing factions  His administration carried out economic reforms and often worked closely with the U S  on implementation of the Canal treaties  On September 1  1999  Mireya Moscoso  the widow of former President Arnulfo Arias Madrid  took office after defeating PRD candidate Martin Torrijos  son of Omar Torrijos  in a free and fair election  During her administration  Moscoso attempted to strengthen social programs  especially for child and youth development  protection  and general welfare  Moscoso s administration successfully handled the Panama Canal transfer and was effective in the administration of the Canal  The PRD s Martin Torrijos won the presidency and a legislative majority in the National Assembly in 2004  Torrijos ran his campaign on a platform of  among other pledges  a  zero tolerance  for corruption  a problem endemic to the Moscoso and Perez Balladares administrations  After taking office  Torrijos passed a number of laws which made the government more transparent  He formed a National Anti Corruption Council whose members represented the highest levels of government  as well as civil society  labor organizations  and religious leadership  In addition  many of his closest Cabinet ministers were non political technocrats known for their support for the Torrijos government s anti corruption aims  Despite the Torrijos administration s public stance on corruption  many high profile cases  particularly involving political or business elites  were never acted upon  Conservative supermarket magnate Ricardo Martinelli was elected to succeed Martin Torrijos with a landslide victory at the May 2009 presidential election  Mr  Martinelli s business credentials drew voters worried by slowing growth due to the world financial crisis  24  Standing for the four party opposition Alliance for Change  Mr  Martinelli gained 60  of the vote  against 37  for the candidate of the governing left wing Democratic Revolutionary Party   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Panama Then presidents Mart n Torrijos and George W  Bush at the Oval Office  Friday  February 16  2007  Panama s politics take place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic  whereby the President of Panama is both head of state and head of government  and of a multi party system  Executive power is exercised by the government  Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly  The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature  For all people national elections are universal and mandatory for all citizens 18 years and older  National elections for the executive and legislative branches take place every five years  Members of the judicial branch  justices  are appointed by the head of state  Panama s National Assembly is elected by proportional representation in fixed electoral districts  so many smaller parties are represented  Presidential elections do not require a simple majority  out of the four last presidents only one  the incumbent president  was elected with over 50  of the popular vote  25  Since the U S  invasion and the end of the 21 year military dictatorship  Panama has successfully completed four peaceful transfers of power to opposing political factions  The political landscape is dominated by two major

Geography Main article  Geography of Panama The crater rim around Santa F   Veraguas Province    Panama is located in Central America  bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean  between Colombia and Costa Rica  It mostly lies between latitudes 7  and 10 N  and longitudes 77  and 83 W  a small area lies west of 83    Some people consider the territory east of the Panama Canal as part of South America citation needed  although this is rare  Its location on the Isthmus of Panama is strategic  By 2000  Panama controlled the Panama Canal which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea to the North of the Pacific Ocean  Panama  at 75 515 km2  is ranked 118th worldwide on the basis of land size  For comparison  Panama is slightly smaller than the U S  state of South Carolina or slightly larger than the Canadian province of New Brunswick  The dominant feature of the country s landform is the central spine of mountains and hills that forms the continental divide  The divide does not form part of the great mountain chains of North America  and only near the Colombian border are there highlands related to the Andean system of South America  The spine that forms the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom  in which peaks were formed by volcanic intrusions  The mountain range of the divide is called the Cordillera de Talamanca near the Costa Rican border  Farther east it becomes the Serran a de Tabasar   and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus  where the Panama Canal is located  is often called the Sierra de Veraguas  As a whole  the range between Costa Rica and the canal is generally referred to by geographers as the Cordillera Central  The highest point in the country is the Volc n Bar   formerly known as the Volc n de Chiriqu    which rises to 3 475 metres  11 401 ft   A nearly impenetrable jungle forms the Darien Gap between Panama and Colombia where Colombian guerrilla and drug dealers are operating with hostage taking  This and forest protection movements create a break in the Pan American Highway  which otherwise forms a complete road from Alaska to Patagonia  Panama s wildlife holds the most diversity of all the countries in Central America  It is home to many South American species as well as North American wildlife   edit  Waterways The Chagres River  Nearly 500 rivers lace Panama s rugged landscape  Mostly unnavigable  many originate as swift highland streams  meander in valleys  and form coastal deltas  However  the R o Chagres  Rio Chagres  is one of the few wide rivers and a source of enormous hydroelectric power  The river is located in central Panama  The central part of the river is dammed by the Gatun Dam and forms Gatun Lake  an artificial lake that constitutes part of the Panama Canal  The lake was created between 1907 and 1913 by the building of the Gatun Dam across the Chagres River  At the time it was created  Gatun Lake was the largest man made lake in the world  and the dam was the largest earth dam  It drains northwest into the Caribbean  The Kampia and Madden Lakes  also filled with water from the R o Chagres  provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former Canal Zone  The R o Chepo  another source of hydroelectric power  is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific  These Pacific oriented rivers are longer and slower running than those of the Caribbean side  Their basins are also more extensive  One of the longest is the R o Tuira which flows into the Golfo de San Miguel and is the nation s only river navigable by larger vessels  Col n  Panama   edit  Harbors The Caribbean coastline is marked by several good natural harbors  However  Crist bal  at the Caribbean terminus of the canal  had the only important port facilities in the late 1980s  The numerous islands of the Archipi lago de Bocas del Toro  near the Beaches of Costa Rica  provide an extensive natural roadstead and shield the banana port of Almirante  The over 350 San Blas Islands  near Colombia  are strung out for more than 160 km along the sheltered Caribbean coastline  Currently  the terminal ports located at each end of the Panama Canal  namely the Port of Cristobal and the Port of Balboa  are ranked second and third respectively in Latin America in terms of numbers of containers units  TEU  handled  26  The Port of Balboa covers 182 hectares and contains four berths for containers and two multi purpose berths  In total  the berths are over 2 4 thousand meters long with alongside depth of 15 meters  The Port of Balboa has 18 super post Panamax and Panamax quay cranes and 44 gantry cranes  The Port of Balboa also contains 2 1 thousand square meters of warehouse space  27  The Ports of Cristobal  encompassing the container terminals of Panama Ports Cristobal  Manzanillo International Terminal and Colon Container Terminal  handled 2 210 720 TEU in 2009  second only to the Port of Santos  Brazil

Atlantic  near Panama s western border with Costa Rica  The Trans Panama Pipeline  running across the isthmus with a length of 131 km  has been operating between Charco Azul and Chiriqu  Grande since 1979  28   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Panama Cold climate is usual near and in the Panamanian highlands  Panama has a tropical climate  Temperatures are uniformly high as is the relative humidity and there is little seasonal variation  Diurnal ranges are low  on a typical dry season day in the capital city  the early morning minimum may be 24  C  75 2  F  and the afternoon maximum 30  C  86 0  F   The temperature seldom exceeds 32  C  89 6  F  for more than a short time  Temperatures on the Pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the Caribbean  and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country  Temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges  and frosts occur in the Cordillera de Talamanca in western Panama  Climatic regions are determined less on the basis of temperature than on rainfall  which varies regionally from less than 1 300 millimeters  51 2 in  to more than 3 000 millimeters  118 1 in  per year  Almost all of the rain falls during the rainy season  which is usually from April to December  but varies in length from seven to nine months  In general  rainfall is much heavier on the Caribbean than on the Pacific side of the continental divide  The annual average in Panama City is little more than half of that in Col n  Although rainy season thunderstorms are common  the country is outside of the hurricane belt  Panama s tropical environment supports an abundance of plants  Forests dominate  interrupted in places by grasslands  scrub  and crops  Although nearly 40  of Panama is still wooded  deforestation is a continuing threat to the rain drenched woodlands  Tree cover has been reduced by more than 50  since the 1940s  Subsistence farming  widely practiced from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands  consists largely of corn  bean  and tuber plots  Mangrove swamps occur along parts of both coasts  with banana plantations occupying deltas near Costa Rica  In many places  a multi canopied rain forest abuts the swamp on one side of the country and extends to the lower reaches of slopes in the other   edit  Demographics Kuna woman sewing  Col n s Christ Church by

formerly the Guaym    Kuna  Naso and Bribri  More than half the population lives in the Panama City Col n metropolitan corridor  30  The culture  customs  and language of the Panamanians are predominantly Caribbean and Spanish  Spanish is the official and dominant language  About 93  speak Spanish as their first language  though there are many citizens who speak both English and Spanish or native languages  such as Ng bere  31  Some new statistics show that as second language  English is spoken by 8   French by 4  and Arabic by 1  citation needed   The private educational system also offers German  Portuguese and Italian  Panama  because of its historical reliance on commerce  is above all an ethnic salad bowl  This is shown  for instance  by its considerable population of Afro Antillean and Chinese origin  The first Chinese immigrated to Panama from southern China to help build the Panama Railroad in the 19th century  They were followed by several waves of immigrants whose descendants number around 50 000  Starting in the 1970s  a further 80 000 have immigrated from other parts of China as well  32  33  Afro Panamanians have played a significant role in the creation of the republic  Some historians have estimated that up to 50  of the population of Panama has some African ancestry  The descendants of the Africans who arrived during the colonial era are intermixed in the general population or are found in small Afro Panamanian communities along the Atlantic Coast and in villages within the Dari n jungle  Most of the people in Darien are fishermen or small scale farmers growing crops such as bananas  rice and coffee as well as raising livestock  Other Afro Panamanians are the descendants of later migrants from the Caribbean who came to work on railroad construction projects  commercial agricultural enterprises  and especially the canal  Important Afro Caribbean community areas include towns and cities such as Col n  Cristobal and Balboa  in the former Canal Zone  as well as the R o Abajo area of Panama City  Another region with a large Afro Caribbean population is the province of Bocas del Toro on the Caribbean coast just south of Costa Rica  34  Most of the Panamanian population of West Indian descent owe their presence in the country to the monumental efforts to build the Panama Canal in the late 19th and early 20th centuries  Three quarters of the 50 000 workers who built the canal were Afro Caribbean migrants from the British West Indies  Thousands of Afro Caribbean workers were recruited from Jamaica  Barbados and Trinidad  34  Panama is the smallest Spanish speaking Latin American country in terms of population The most common religion in Panama is Roman Catholicism   various sources estimate that 75 85  of the population identifies itself as Roman Catholic and 15 25  as evangelical Christian  35  The Bah    Faith community of Panama is estimated at 2 00  of the national population  or about 60 000 36  and is home to one of the seven Baha i Houses of Worship  35  Smaller religious groups include Jewish and Muslim communities with approximately 10 000 members each  and small groups of Hindus  Buddhists and Rastafarians  35  Indigenous religions include Ibeorgun  among Kuna  and Mamatata  among Ng be Bugl    35   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of Panama Rub n Blades  The culture of Panama derived from European music  art and traditions that were brought over by the Spanish to Panama  Hegemonic forces have created hybrid forms of this by blending African and Native American culture with European culture  For example  the tamborito is a Spanish dance that was blended with Native American rhythms  themes and dance moves  37  Dance is a symbol of the diverse cultures that have coupled in Panama  The local folklore can be experienced through a multitude of festivals  dances and traditions that have been handed down from generation to generation  Local cities host live Reggae en Espa ol  Cuban  Reggaeton  Kompa  Colombian  jazz  blues  salsa  reggae  chombera  passa passa  jerk  disambiguation needed   and rock performances  Outside of Panama City  regional festivals take place throughout the year featuring local musicians and dancers  Another example of Panama s blended culture is reflected in the traditional products  such as woodcarvings  ceremonial masks and pottery  as well as in its architecture  cuisine and festivals  In earlier times  baskets were woven for utilitarian uses  but now many villages rely almost exclusively on the baskets they produce for tourists  An example of undisturbed  unique culture in Panama is that of the Kuna Indians who are known for molas  Mola is the Kuna Indian word for blouse  but the term mola has come to mean the elaborate embroidered panels that make up the front and back of a Kuna woman s blouse  Molas are works of art created by the women of the Kuna tribe  They are several layers of cloth  varying in color  that are loosely stitched together  made using an appliqu  process referred to as  reverse appliqu    The Christmas parade  known as El desfile de Navidad  is celebrated in the capital  Panama City  This holiday is celebrated on December 25  The floats in the parade are decorated with the Panamanian colors  and the women dress in dresses called Pollera while the men dress in the traditional Montuno  In addition  the marching band in the parade  consisting of drummers  keeps the crowds entertained  In the city  a big Christmas tree is lit with Christmas lights  and everybody surrounds the tree and sings Christmas carols  38  The traditional Panamanian dish for Christmas usually includes chicken tamales  arroz con pollo  chicken and rice   puerca asada  pernil  pavo  turkey   and relleno  stuffing   Bowls of fruits and fruitcake are set out on the tables along with the dishes  Along with these foods and dessert  a traditional drink is served  called Ron Ponche  eggnog   consisting of two cans of condensed milk  three cans of evaporated milk  six eggs  and a half a bottle of rum and nutmeg for some extra flavor  The traditional Panamanian women s clothing  the pollera  originated in Spain in the 16th century  Later on  the pollera was used as a typical dress in Panama in the early 1800s  The pollera was worn by women servants or maids   it was especially the dress of the wet nurses who nursed the children of the family   De Zarate 5   As years went on  upper class women adopted the dress  The original pollera consists of a ruffled blouse that is worn off the shoulders  The skirt is on the waistline with gold buttons  The skirt also has ruffle  so that when she lifts it up  it looks like a peacock s tail or a mantilla fan  The designs on the skirt and blouse are usually flowers or birds  Two large matching mota  pom poms  are on the front and back  four ribbons are hanging from the back and the front on the waist line  caberstrillos  five chains of gold  are hanging from the neck to the waist  a gold cross or medallion on a black ribbon is worn as a choker  and a silk purse is worn the waistline  Zaricillos  earrings  are usually gold or coral  and to complete the outfit  the female wears slippers which match the color of her pollera  Her hair is usually worn in a bun  held with three large gold combs that have some pearls  and is worn like a crown  The best pollera can usually cost up to ten thousand dollars  and may take a year to complete  The men also wear traditional clothing  Their outfits consist of white cotton shirts  trousers and woven straw hat  This traditional clothing can be worn in parades  where the females and males do a traditional dance  The females do a gentle sway and twirl their skirts  while the men hold their hats in their hands and dance behind the females  A pollera is made with a  cambric  or  fine linen   Baker 177   The color of the pollera is always white  and it is usually about thirteen yards of material  Today  there are different types of polleras  the pollera de gala consists of a short sleeved ruffle skirt blouse  two full length skirts and a petticoat  The girls wear tembleques in their hair   a gold and tortoiseshell comb with pearls in it  Gold coins and jewelry are added to the outfit  The pollera montuna is a daily dress  with a blouse  a skirt with a solid color  a single gold chain  and pendant earrings  The hair piece is a natural flower in the hair  This pollera is slightly different from the rest  because instead of an off the shoulder blouse  the females wear a fitted white jacket  shoulder pleats  and a flared hem  39   edit  Literature According to Professor Rodrigo Mir   the first story about Panama was written by Gonzalo Fern ndez de Oviedo y Vald s and published as

Indigenous religions include Ibeorgun  among Kuna  and Mamatata  among Ngobe   35  There is also a small number of Rastafarians  35   edit  Sports The U S  influence in Panama can be seen in the country s sports  Baseball is the National Sport of Panama and has regional teams and a national team that represents them in international events  Many Panamanians have played on professional teams in the United States  including Rod Carew  who was one of the game s greatest hitters  and Mariano Rivera  who is widely considered the best closer of all time  From the List of Major League Baseball players from Panama it can be seen that no other Central American nation has had as many Major Leaguers as Panama  At least 140 Panamanian players have played professional baseball in the United States  43  In boxing  four Panamanians are in the International Boxing Hall of Fame  Roberto Dur n  Eusebio Pedroza  Ismael Laguna and Panama Al Brown  Panama presently has three reigning world boxing champions  Guillermo Jones  Celestino Caballero and Anselmo Moreno  Basketball is popular in Panama  there are regional teams as well as a squad that competes internationally  Among Panama s most prominent basketball players are Rolando Blackman  four time NBA All Star  and Harlem Globetrotters  star Kevin Daley  Long jumper Irving Saladino became the first Panamanian Olympic champion in 2008  Other popular sports include volleyball  football  golf  and tennis  A long distance hiking trail called the TransPanama Trail is being built from Colombia to Costa Rica   edit  Education Main article  Education in Panama School children in Panama In 2000  it was estimated that 91 9  of the population was literate  92 5  of males and 91 2  of females   44  Education in Panama is compulsory for the children of age group between 6 and 15  In recent decades  school enrollment at all levels  but especially at upper levels  has increased significantly  Originally  during the 16th century  education in Panama was provided by Jesuit priests  Public education  as a national and governmental institution  began only in 1903  The principles underlying this early education system were that children should receive different types of education in accordance with their social class and therefore the position they were expected to occupy in society   edit  Economy Main article  Economy of Panama A Panamax ship in transit through the Miraflores locks  Panama Canal  According to the CIA World Factbook  as of 2011 Panama had an unemployment rate of 2 7   4  A food surplus was registered in August 2008  On the Human Development Index Panama was ranked at number 60  2008   In recent years  Panama s economy has experienced an economic boom  with growth in real gross domestic product  GDP  averaging over 10 4  from 2006 2008  The Panamanian economy has been among the fastest growing and best managed in Latin America  Latin Business Chronicle has predicted that Panama will be the fastest growing economy in Latin America in the five year period 2010 14  matching Brazil s 10  rate  45  Like most countries in the region  Panama is feeling the impact of the global financial crisis  which threatens to undermine the social gains made in the past few years  The expansion project of the Panama Canal  combined with the conclusion of a free trade agreement with the United States  is expected to boost and extend economic expansion for some time  Despite Panama s status as an upper middle income nation   as measured by per capita GDP   it remains a country of stark contrasts  Perpetuated by dramatic educational disparities  over one third of Panama s population lived in poverty in 2008 and 14 4  in extreme poverty  46   edit  Economic sectors El Valle de Ant n Panama s economy  because of its key geographic location  is mainly based on a well developed service sector heavily weighted towards banking  commerce  tourism  and trading  The handover of the Canal and military installations by the United States has given rise to large construction projects  A referendum regarding the building of a third set of locks for the Panama Canal was approved overwhelmingly  with low voter turnout  however  on October 22  2006  The official estimated cost of the building of the third set of locks is US 5 25 billion  The canal is of major economic importance since it pumps millions of dollars from toll revenue to the national economy and provides massive employment  The United States had a monopoly over the Panama Canal for 85 years but the Torrijos Carter Treaties signed in 1977 began the process of returning the canal to the Panamanian government by 1999  Copper and gold deposits are being developed by foreign investors  to the dismay of some environmental groups  as all of the projects are located within protected areas  47   edit  Tourism An apartment building in Coronado  Tourism in the Republic of Panama kept its growth during the past 5 years due to the government offering tax and price discounts to foreign guests and retirees  These economic incentives caused Panama to be regarded as a relatively good place to retire in the world  Real estate developers in Panama have increased the amount of tourism destinations in the past five years because of the interest for these visitor incentives  48  The amount of tourists arriving between January and September 2008 totalled 1 110 000  This was a significant increase of 13 1   128 452  over the previous high of 982 640 during the same period in 2007  The arrival of tourists from Europe to Panama grew by 23 1  during the first nine months of 2008  According to the Tourism Authority of Panama  ATP   between January and September  71 154 tourists from the Old Continent entered the country that is 13 373 more than figures for same period last year  Most of the Europeans who have visited Panama were Spaniards  14 820   followed by Italians  13 216   French  10 174  and British  8 833   From Germany  the most populous country in the European Union  6997 tourists arrived  Europe has become one of the key markets to promote Panama as a tourist destination  In 2007  1 445 5 million entered into the Panamanian economy as a result of tourism  This accounted for 9 5  of gross domestic product in the country  surpassing other productive sectors  Panama s Law No  9 is still the most modern and comprehensive law for the promotion of tourism investment in Latin America and the Caribbean  In so called Special Tourism Zones  Law 8 offers incentives such as 100  exemption from income tax  real estate tax  import duties for construction materials and equipment  and other taxes  Panama has declared different parts of the country as Special Tourism Zones which are benefited with multiple tax exemptions and tax holidays   edit  Currency The Panamanian currency is officially the balboa  fixed at parity with the United States dollar since independence in 1903  In practice  however  the country is dollarized  Panama has its own coinage but uses U S  dollars for all its paper currency  According to the Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean  Panama s inflation as measured by weight CPI was 2 0  in 2006  49  Panama has traditionally experienced low inflation  as it shares currencies with the U S  The balboa replaced the Colombian peso in 1904 following the country s independence  The balboa has been tied to the United States dollar  which is legal tender in Panama  at an exchange rate of 1 1 since its introduction and has always circulated alongside dollars  Panamanian banknotes  denominated in balboas  were printed in 1941 by President Arnulfo Arias  They were recalled several days later  giving them the name  The Seven Day Dollar   The notes were burned after the seven days but occasionally balboa notes can be found with collectors  These were the only banknotes issued by Panama and U S  notes have circulated both before and since   edit  International trade Traditional coffee drying at the Alto Boquete plant of Cafe Ruiz  The high levels of Panamanian trade are in large part from the Col n Free Trade Zone  the largest free trade zone in the Western Hemisphere  Last year the zone accounted for 92  of Panama s exports and 64  of its imports  according to an analysis of figures from the Colon zone management and estimates of Panama s trade by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean  Panama s economy is also very much supported by the trade and exportation of coffee and other agricultural products  The Bilateral Investment Treaty  BIT  between the governments of the United States and Panama was signed on October 27  1982  The treaty protects U S  investment and assists Panama in its efforts to develop its economy by creating conditions more favorable for U S  private investment and thereby strengthening the development of its private sector  The BIT with Panama was the first such treaty signed by the U S  in the Western Hemisphere  50  A Trade Promotion Agreement between the United States and Panama was signed by both governments in 2007  but neither country has yet approved or implemented the agreement  51   edit  See also Geography portal North America portal Central America portal Latin America portal Panama portal Outline of Panama Index of Panama related
