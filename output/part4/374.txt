in college newspapers and independent magazines   Can we get a rewrite    Preceding unsigned comment added by Scottux  talk   contribs  13 59  3 April 2011  UTC  This article seems to ignore the many controversies surrounding Lee s career  e g   his relationship with Jack Kirby  allegations of financial improprieties  etc   Pervious edits acknowledging these things seem to have disappeared  Do others feel it is overly sanitized   Preceding unsigned comment added by 207 108 214 186  talk  05 33  August 30  2007  UTC  Hmm    the bio seems a bit wrong  It says that Lee got his start because his uncle Robbie Solomon  the brother in law of Martin Goodman  Then it says that Lee s cousin Jean was married to Goodman  Should it be that Solomon is the father in law of Goodman  This is way out of my league  but didn t Mr  Lee have a big lawsuit against Marvel  Shoud that be in here Me mi mo 10 37  13 January 2007  UTC  It s already there   Tenebrae 00 35  17 January 2007  UTC  Perhaps someone should put up a more recent picture of Mr  Lee  I would  but I haven t had much luck with figuring out the image uploading policy  Komodo 22 21  14 September 2006  UTC  Why does everyone always want a newer picture  Wouldn t it make more sense to have a picture of him when he was most notable  i e   the early 1960s   Anyway  see below   Chowbok 01 21  15 September 2006  UTC  Because he looks grotesque in the current picture   CyberGhostface 23 30  17 October 2006  UTC  You are missing the point  I m not talking about the quality of the current picture  I m just saying that if we re wishing for an ideal picture  why do we want a new one   Chowbok 23 53  17 October 2006  UTC  Why wouldn t we     CyberGhostface 01 14  18 October 2006  UTC  This is more a general Wikipedia discussion at this point  Moving to your talk page  and mine  presumably    Chowbok 01 17  18 October 2006  UTC  That picture should definetley be changed  if not to a newer one than at least to one in wich doesn t look so weird  DaGrob 16 07  17 October 2006  UTC  Is there any truth to the rumor that Stan Lee is the dad of actor Jason Lee  jengod 18 24  May 17  2004  UTC  I doubt it  I don t recall any mention of Jason Lee when I read Stan Lee s biography and autobiography  For what it s worth  Stan was born Stanley Lieber  Gamaliel 21 08  29 Jun 2004  UTC  Category  comics writer should really be Category  Comic book writers  and if you re going to put in a new  cat  you should create it  khaosworks 15 12  20 Aug 2004  UTC  How can there be a encyclopedia page about Stan Lee without mentioning that he really wasn t the driving force behind Marvel but capitalized on his status as Editor  which he got because his uncle owned the company  Easy  we stick to the verifiable facts  and leave the opinions and speculation out of it  The article mentions his relationship to Goodman  for example  it s up to the reader to conclude whether that s the reason he got the job  It also mentions that there is disagreement about how much of Marvel s success was due to Lee vs  other creators  Tverbeek 21 29  4 Jan 2005  UTC  Also  if you go to this wikilink  you ll see different quotes from books by both Lee and Joe Simon that refutes the nepotism charge  Also  Martin Goodman wasn t Lee s uncle  but his cousin by marriage  And it was Simon  according to Simon  who did the hiring  24 199 120 207 01 26  7 October 2005  UTC  Opinions should be fine if they re cited opinions from other industry professionals his colleagues  not the opinions OR of wikipedians  Tehw1k1  talk  03 31  13 February 2009  UTC  The page mentions Striperella  but not the lawsuit against Lee Regarding the creation of Striperella  It doesn t mention the facts that artists such as Ditko and Kirby dispute his claims of sole creation of these characters either  This is smelling like a whitewash to me  History has to record ALL the facts  including ones that makes the people you see as heroes look like villians  unsigned comment from 66 190 70 147 If we have made omissions in this article  please feel free to add information  I doubt anyone here is interested in a whitewash  All articles here are a work in progess and it s most likely something that no one has gotten around to adding yet  Also  you can sign your comments with four tildes      Gamaliel 01 52  5 Jan 2005  UTC  Don t assume that Lee is my  or anyone else s  hero  just because we don t describe him here as a villain  As a matter of fact  the article does mention the disputes regarding Kirby and Ditko s role in creating those characters   See the paragraph that begins   Because of this system      It s pretty brief  probably because the more you say  the more opportunity there is to say something that violates neutrality  Instead it simply reports what  some observers argue   Maybe more detail is needed  If there are facts missing  then please add them  that s how a wiki works  Just keep in mind that Wikipedia is supposed to be written from a neutral point of view  so anything that smells like a witchhunt  like some of your judgmental edits to Spider Man  is going to get edited to tone it down  just the same as anything that smells like a whitewash should be   P S  It helps if you register before making edits  so people can see that you re here as a positive contributor and not just an anonymous troublemaker   Tverbeek 02 24  5 Jan 2005  UTC   edit  Silver Surfer not created by Stan Lee  I dispute that the Silver Surfer wasnt co created by Stan Lee  I remember him having dialogue in issue  48 of  The Fantastic Four  his first appearence  so would have to of been scripted by Stan Lee  Additionally he is officially credited to this day as the Co Creator with Kirby  Additionally his whole history  where he come from and who he is as a character I suspect would of come from Stans Lees writing  But if what you say is true  which it could be   The Silver Surfer page will require some changes too    The guy who made the change  sorry forgot I wasnt logged in    UnlimitedAccess  Many are familiar with the often repeated story of how Lee was presented with the penciled pages to FF  48  only to be surprised by the new character in the story   I googled this up quickly from http   www twomorrows com kirby articles 23notes html  Not sure of the source of the story  Origins of Marvel Comics    but it s a very common and famous one  Gamaliel 00 07  2 May 2005  UTC  It troubles me that still to this day that the character is officially credited by Marvel as a Lee Kirby creation  I think its worth noting  Okay  then how about this   Lee is credited for officially creating the Incredible Hulk  the Silver Surfer  Iron Man  the Mighty Thor and the X Men with Kirby  Daredevil with Bill Everett  and Doctor Strange and Marvel s most successful character  Spider Man with Steve Ditko   The Silver Surfer page goes into sufficient detail about this anyway  But the Silver Surfer page could have one alteration  where it says at the top  Created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee  could read something like  Officially created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby   I know its a bit semantical  but as an encylodpedia it s worth including  What do you think  UnlimitedAccess Perhaps we should just leave SS off that list entirely and just deal with the indepth discussion for the Silver Surfer Article  To say he s  credited officially  with creating all those characters may lead the reader to suspect that he played a role in none of them  while in reality SS is probably the only one where he played no role at all   And if you really want to get into it  you could say SL is a creator since he fleshed out the character and adopted SS as a pet project   Gamaliel 17 46  2 May 2005  UTC  Well okay  I just felt that if someone is researching Stan Lee the article should at least point to this dispute of SL JK creating Silver Surfer  particarly because of the  official  status that still stands and because of the final point you made in your last post   UnlimitedAccess This whole debacule with people saying  OH STAN SHOULDN T GET A CO CREATOR CREDIT  is very upsetting to me  Let us take the case of Silver Surfer then  If Lee was infact caught completely off guard by the apprence of the character  he would still have a hand in its creation  as he wrote the diologe and one can easily say that the diologe of a character is its personaility in a comic serireis  BUT you maintaim that because Kerby desinged the look should recive full credit  While Lee activly worked with Marvel he had his hands in almost everything that was going on  so therefore one could say he was co creator of just about everything marvel put out during those years  I belive that Lee should be credited as co creator  but if it is that important to some out there  perhaps his name should come first  as the Last name in a Co creator credit is usually the more noticed      Iorek Brynson Your right  his look is only 50  of his character  but your forgetting Jack Kirby in SS first apperance wrote and scripted his dialogue as well  thus giving him his personality  Stan Lee and Jack Kirby after then both worked on SS for the next several years giving flesh to the character  and because of that Stan Lee is officially credited as a co creator  But technically  SS was exclusively created by Kirby  I still stand by initial statement though  that it is worth including on this page of his involvement with the character    UnlimitedAccess 04 10  26 May 2005  UTC  Kirby wrote and scripted   Can you give support for that      Beardo 03 19  9 June 2006  UTC  I don t believe anyone has ever claimed that Kirby wrote the dialog for any issue of Fantastic Four  and the style of Kirby s scripting for his Fourth World titles and elsewhere is wildly different from anything in FF  Lee himself has stated in many interviews that Kirby came up with the concept of the Surfer and deserves full credit for that  But just as Spider Man  say  is credited as a co Lee Ditko creation  since the concept  the visuals  and the characterization all play a part  the converse seems true here   that the Surfer is a co Lee Kirby creation     Tenebrae 11 45  9 June 2006  UTC  I believe I remember reading somewhere or other that Kirby s version of the Surfer s origin was totally different  and that Kirby s idea was for him to be an energy being created by Galactus out of nothing  Anyone have an idea where that s from 65 92 154 5 23 53  3 September 2006  UTC  Yes  Kirby wanted the Surfer to be totally non human which was why he was so fascinated with human emotions and the like in his early appearances  Lee took the Silver Surfer away from Kirby and did a book with John Buscema that told a completely different origin than Kirby had envisioned  This is generally looked at as one of the things that drove Kirby away from Marvel  He did not like the way Lee took control over things that Kirby had a larger hand in creating  There is a Mark Evanier book on Kirby that goes into this as well as numerous other books on the story behind the scenes in the comic industry  Vaginsh  talk  00 09  1 September 2009  UTC   Kirby wanted the Surfer to be totally non human which was why he was so fascinated with human emotions and the like in his early appearances  Lee took the Silver Surfer away from Kirby and did a book with John Buscema that told a completely different origin than Kirby had envisioned   That pretty well confirms that Lee should be regarded as one of the primary creators of the Surfer  The Surfer is primarily noted by fans because of the character which Lee built around him as the one who gave up Shalla Bal to save the planet Zennla  Take away all of that and turn him into what Kirby wanted and no one would remember him today  Kirby was never very good at creating plots or writing scripts  Lee has to be regarded as an essential inventor of the character of the Silver Surfer   Preceding unsigned comment added by 207 69 137 38  talk  12 45  10 February 2010  UTC  Stan Lee may have laid out the words and dialog and story of the characters  but that was in conjunction with the many characters that Kirby created  There s been a huge dispute for which created who  but from documentaries and written reports that are in the internet  I can see why stan Lee can be see as a charlatan of Kirby s creations  Even Neal Adams  whom everyone that s worked with him regard him as one of the honest people working in the industry  carries a particular amount of credibility considering his fight for Simon and Schuster s  not the publishing company  creation of Superman  The Village Voice did an article  I was told  on the big controversy in regard to Stan Lee and how he was never in charge and in fact almost lost his job if Kirby didn t step in to save Marvel  I think  in my opinion  since this has been a downplayed event  it s going to be even tougher now that Disney owns Marvel    Preceding unsigned comment added by 70 107 252 153  talk   contribs   edit  Cameos This needs fix  Lee s cameos are listed twice  Its highly likely that Stan Lee will make a cameo in  Iron Man   due for release in May 2008  and also in  The Incredible Hulk   also due out in 2008  as he helped to create both those characters Did you know that Stan Lee made a cameo in episode 19 of Heroes  released 19 February 2007  where he played as a bus driver   Preceding unsigned comment added by 72 49 168 229  talk  14 07  14 October 2008  UTC   edit  Age   Clinton According to this article  Lee began writing filler in 1941  when he d have been 18 or 19  then graduated from this eventually become editor when he was 17  How did that work  exactly  Go to this wikilink for the answers  Lee was born 12 28 22  and got his assistant job in mid to late 1939 at what he says was 16 1 2  after having graduated high school early  per his autobiography and other sources   Editor Joe Simon left Marvel sometime in 1942  so Lee would have been about 19 1 2  24 199 120 207 01 34  7 October 2005  UTC  Also  is this bit true   a conspiracy by Bill Clinton to divert Paul s Japanese partner s multimillion dollar investment from Stan Lee Media to a new Clinton company   I have commented out the Clinton paragraph  without erasing it  and ask for objective citations for it  It contains non NPOV statements  and claims that don t appear to be supported by the References or External Links  What is the  Hillary Clinton Accountability Project   Iis it a non partisan  academic  historical project or something else  There are inflammatory statements here  and also some that would seem to require verification  such as  the largest fundraising event for Hillary Clinton s 2000 Senate campaign   Is there an objective  news media statement giving facts and figures to support this  Tenebrae 01 38  7 October 2005  UTC  The Clinton paragraph came back  this time with an unlinked reference citing WorldNetDaily com  That Web site is a right wing blog  not an accredited  journalistic news source  If the alleged information about Lee and Clinton is real and accurate  then the editor posting it should have no problem citing and quoting established  credible news sources and not have to rely on such a clearly biased and thus non journalistic site     Tenebrae 16 01  28 June 2006  UTC  The Clinton paragraph was deceptively written to imply that Lee had a prominent role in a Clinton finance scandal  There is no evidence to support this whatsoever   The preceding unsigned comment was added by User 71 242 118 162  talk   contribs     edit  Web award  In the part about Stan Lee Media  in  Later career    I removed the POV

edit  Net Worth  So  what is ole Stan worth these days with all the movies and stuff  More than you  I also don t believe any of that  tyrant  bullshit  I mean  Steve Ditko created THE CREEPER  That means Stan Lee created Spider Man entirely by himself  Because the creeper sucks donkey balls  Oh  and don t even remind about those awful and completely forgettable Charlton comics characters  Steve Ditko doesn t have the creativity to have done all he says he has done  168 243 218 2 That would be  opinion   not  fact   Dr Archeville 18 24  22 March 2006  UTC   edit  Stan Lee and Ringo Starr Stan was collaborating with Ringo Starr to produce a super Ringo character  eg  magic rings  etc  Has anyone heard any further details on this   edit  Stan Lee s religion I would like to know the religion of Stan Lee  I see him eulogizing a Christian manga     a clean  inspiring Christian comic done in a hip  contemporary way  I think you ve really got a winner    1   Stan Lee  was born into a jewish family   originally named Stanley Lieber  but I don t know if he practices or not   edit  Balance between periods It seems odd that the period since 1991 gets more space than 1960 1990   surely the 1960s are his most influential period and should get most coverage      Beardo 03 11  9 June 2006  UTC  Well  one reason was that some PR type inserted entire paragraphs from a hype filled POW  press release  I ve boiled the information down to the facts  but there s still an awful lot of unencyclopedia language and crystal balling     Tenebrae 11 59  9 June 2006  UTC  It could also be argued that some of that ground is covered in the article on Marvel Comics as well as those of the characters Lee co created     Pennyforth 18 07  1 August 2006  UTC   edit  Stan Lee s Appearance in the  Minus 1

Footnotes   which are not BOTH used   Notes  or  Footnotes  contain  well  footnotes   References  are additional general sources used to support the article  and  External links   used correctly here  are  for further reading  links  Some tweaking on this article s overall refs may still be necessary  but not wholesale changes contrary to Wiki guidelines    Tenebrae  talk  21 47  24 November 2007  UTC  I don t understand  To my knowledge  I was following accepted formatting conventions per Wikipedia Guide to layout Standard appendices and descriptions  I did not use BOTH  Notes  and  Footnotes  sections  there was a  References  section and a  Notes  section  where  explanations or comments on any part of the main text  can be placed  I was being bold  trying to improve what is in my opinion a very messy eyesore  and decided that a combined  Notes and references  section was not desirable in the case of this article   Nowhere can I find support for the  Footnotes  section naming you reverted to   Several featured articles use the convention I followed  It seems to me that your description of a distinction between  Footnotes  and  References  corresponds to what are referred to as  Citations  and  References  in WP CITE Short footnote citations with full references  I did not feel that it was necessary to resort to separate  Citations  and  References  sections  as article size is not a major issue  and the referencing isn t so complex as to merit it  As it was  most of the material listed under references did not seem to correspond to any in text citations in such a way that indicated that the references were actually being used as sources for article information  so I either used them in new in text citations  moved them to the external links section  or simply removed them  I left in a few orphaned listings with the understanding that they may have been used as sources  and just lacked corresponding citations  If they weren t  they don t belong  the  References  section is not for indiscriminate listing of  Further reading  material  The extended commentary footnote mentioned that Joe Simon s autobiography The Comic Book Makers was cited in the References section  it wasn t  I corrected that  The link in one of the citations was dead  I fixed that  too  I honestly don t see how my edits were inappropriate  Dancter  talk  02 36  26 November 2007  UTC  Thanks for the detailed rationale  It s always good to be able to respond to specifics  I think we may be stuck on a nomenclature thing  What you changed to call  References  were footnotes  so there were both  Notes  and  Footnotes   And  yes  I hear you and sympathize  The various overlapping and occasionally changing policies and guidelines at WP CITE  WP SOURCE  WP FOOT and WP GTL  among other pages is labyrinthine and confusing and occasionally contradictory  From longtime reading of these pages and of their talk pages  here are a couple of points that  as you say  can be hard to find  WP Cite Footnote referencing   A footnote is a note placed at the bottom of a page of a document to comment on a part of the main text  or to provide a reference for it  or both  The connection between the relevant text and its footnote is indicated by a number or symbol which appears both after the relevant text and before the footnote reference   WP GTL     Notes   is only for footnotes  explanations or comments on any part of the main text    Comic book databases are listed under  References  since any referenced comic book title issue   can be looked up  it s not necessary to clutter the page with a footnote for every single issue mentioned  Likewise  a book that provides a general history is often used as support material for footnoted citations  this is preferable to having two citations for the same thing  over and over throughout the page  Because you yourself    or  rather  any editor oneself    may not see how a particular source under References is relevant doesn t mean that it s not  If you question a source  please ask about it on the talk page  I can t speak for other editors  but anything I ve put under References was used in my portions of writing the article  Many of us longtime editors have found that folks tend to bring out Be Bold as a catch all rationale  It s a more complex and subtle guideline  One editor to another  thank you for fixing the missing Simon intro and the dead link  I hope this provides good background and addresses your points  I m certainly open to discussing this more if you d like  and to any response  Thanks    Tenebrae  talk  04 44  26 November 2007  UTC  While I appreciate your civil tone  to be honest  I m still feeling a bit patronized  here  I agree that there is some issue with nomenclature  Yes  what I split off into  References  were footnotes  and as described by the guidelines  what put I put under  Notes  were footnotes  too  That doesn t mean that either are synonymous with  Footnotes   which would encompass both  Although I did miss one  Note  that had still remained in the  References  section  I otherwise made sure the sections were properly distinguished  As I mentioned in my last post  I could not find anything in the guidelines on using  Footnotes  for a heading title   Notes and references  seems to be the accepted convention for a combined section  Regardless  my main point was that the combined section doesn t work well for this article  Some of the footnotes have their own citations  and since Cite php references cannot be embedded in other Cite php references  it forces an inconsistent citation style  I also happen to think it looks ugly  especially when one particularly long footnote wraps into a second column  While it is not necessary to have a separate citation for every item in a list  my style preferences do not favor lists in encyclopedia articles except in rare cases  anyway   simply listing works in a references section is normally not enough  Broad reliance on particular sources does not obviate citing them in text  specific citations are especially important when referencing intensive works such as books  that would benefit from details like page numbers  Readers should not be forced to search through entire works just to verify a particular fact in the article  It s true that a source isn t irrelevant just because an editor may not see how it s relevant  but one thing that does help illustrate the relevance of a reference is corresponding in text citations  If redundancy in citation is the issue here  then a separate  Citations  section may indeed be warranted  with specific  abbreviated  footnoted citations to complement full general references in a  References  section  Granted  this approach cannot be applied so readily for a source such as the UHBMCC  and the content it is probably being used for  but if extensive reliance on a database is necessary for sourcing portions of article content  it does call into question the salience of that content in what is supposed to be a cohesive and contextualized overview of the subject  The concept of  significant coverage  is usually referenced in discussing the notability of an article subject  but I feel it also applies to the salience of content within an article  If a fact is worth mentioning in an article about the subject  it stand to reason that a reliable secondary reference would be available to point out its significance  This was not my reasoning for changing the UHBMCC link  but even if I may have misunderstood the purpose of that link  I m still not convinced of its appropriateness as it was  I don t want to dwell too much on that  because it wasn t the main purpose of my edits  In my experience  it s actually quite common for items to be added to a  References  section that aren t being used for verifying article content  the section can be almost as much of a spam magnet as the  External links  section  With the POW  Entertainment and Stan Lee Web links  I can t think of a good reason to resort to generalized  References  listings rather than specific citations  which shouldn t be that complicated  You re implying that I have somehow misunderstood the principle of  be bold   Could you point out how I violated it here  I feel that I was acting according to both the letter and the spirit of the guideline  My edits were actually fairly conservative  looking back at my changes  there was only thing in the article that I deleted straight out  which was the fan site link  Everything else was left in  one way or another  and aside from the aforementioned footnotes and links  the actual text of the article was not altered at all  As far as I could tell  the formatting was not subject to any heavy controversy  collaboration  or discussion such that I was being carelessly disruptive  I was bold  you reverted  presumably without any difficulty   and now we re discussing  I truly did not expect this much resistance to my changes  and certainly not on the basis that I don t understand Wikipedia guidelines and policies  Dancter  talk  21 24  26 November 2007  UTC  You describe a genuine issue with both posts such as these and with e mail  which is that because one can t convey tone of voice  politesse can be taken  by certain people  as being patronizing  What can one say to a charge like that  other than it doesn t imply a good faith reading  Why not consider that maybe I am just trying to speak politely  Regarding  be bold   There is a difference between being bold  in terms of actual action  and saying   I was just being bold  as a catch all rationale  Where do we do go from here  Short of double  or triple footnoting points with specific pages of the books now listed under  Reference    said books supporting and confirming the more easily looked up online citations   I think we re actually agreed that putting all those footnotes and all those reference books  and official sites  etc   mashed together in a  Notes and References  section is ungainly and impractical  I think in general that if something falls within guidelines  and I did provide links and quotes from those links  so I m certainly showing good faith effort  and there s no talk page clamor for changing it  I m not sure there s any urgent need to    Tenebrae  talk

general audience reader to which Wikipedia is aimed  this essentially means the characters widely known outside of comic books   which in a practical sense means the characters on which major studio movies were based  Also  I deleted the Silver Surfer per the long settled debate above on this page  as that character is not a clear and unambiguous example among the countless examples available

page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in this Wikipedia article constitutes fair use  In addition to the boilerplate fair use template  you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use  Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale  Using one of the templates at Wikipedia Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy  but remember that you must complete the template  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page  If there is other fair use media  consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page  Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation can be deleted one week after being tagged  as described on criteria for speedy

assessment I ve done the B class assessment and it doesn t quite make it  There were already existing requests four sources and I ve added some more to the main points which I feel need addressing   this should be easy enough to sort out  However  there is a broader problem   Film and television appearances  is largely unreferenced  the obvious answer would be to use IMDB but  as recent discussion on this shows  we can t  I am unsure how we can address this but unreferenced it could be seen as original research  which is a pity  Could we find a source we can use that gives the screen credits or a reliable site that perhaps lists his appearances   Fictional portrayals  is always going to be a tricky section  because just stating the issue they appeared in isn t enough  unless it is very obviously him  then it needs referencing  Parodies are always going to be tricky as you d need someone saying  I based this on him  a clear sign is the use of weasel words   created the character Funky Flashman as a possible parody of Stan Lee   Also a problem I see is that some of the parodies are bordering on WP BLP violations   Moore s alter ego  Affable Al  parodies Lee and his allegedly unfair treatment of artists  and  an exploitative publisher who relies on Lee s gung ho style and  Bullpen  mythology to motivate his stable of naive and underpaid creators   Some of these probably need removing or a quote inserted which takes it away from a boldly stated fact to one person s opinion  So both those sections are problematic and are going to stop the article from advancing any further until they are dealt with somehow   Emperor  talk  18 27  5 August 2008  UTC    edit  Image copyright problem with Image FF10 jpg The image Image FF10 jpg is used in this article under a claim

the inside  You d think it d be worthy of a mention  Looking around  Fantastic Fiction list the author as this Lee  However  I found this  Copywriter Stanley R  Lee became the Creative Director for DDB in Los Angeles in 1966  but returned to the New York headquarters not long after  In 1973 he was promoted to Senior Vice President  During a company mandated vacation after working on the notoriously demanding Volkswagen account  Lee and many of his colleagues were laid off in 1974 because DDB had just lost a major account worth millions of dollars  The frustrated novelist at that point had plenty of time to write  In 1984 Harper  amp  Row published Lee s political thriller  Dunn s Conundrum  which sold respectably well and was also optioned as a film property  In 1990 Grove   Atlantic published another political thriller by Lee titled  The God Project  that featured an advertising man with unique skills who is recruited by the President of the United States to work on a special mission  shades of DDB in  64    According to Lee s widow  Bernice Lee  the author was working on a non fiction novel about the military when he died after falling in their apartment in 1997
