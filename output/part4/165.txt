country located at the crossroads of Central and Southeastern Europe  on the Lower Danube  within and outside the Carpathian arch  bordering on the Black Sea  9  Romania shares a border with Hungary and Serbia to the west  Ukraine and Moldova to the northeast and east  and Bulgaria to the south  At 238 400 square kilometers  92 000 sq mi   Romania is the ninth largest country of the European Union by area  and has the seventh largest population of the European Union with approximately 19 million people  2  Its capital and largest city is Bucharest  the tenth largest city in the EU with about two million people  The Kingdom of Romania emerged when the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia were united under Prince Alexander Ioan Cuza in 1859  Independence from the Ottoman Empire was declared on May 9  1877  and was internationally recognized the following year  At the end of World War I  Transylvania  Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the Kingdom of Romania  Greater Romania emerged into an era of progression and prosperity that would continue until World War II  By the end of the War  many north eastern areas of Romania s territories were occupied by the Soviet Union  and Romania forcibly became a socialist republic and a member of the Warsaw Pact  With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the 1989 Revolution  Romania began its transition towards democracy and a capitalist market economy  After a decade of post revolution economic problems  extensive reforms fostered economic recovery making Romania now an upper middle income country with high human development  10  Romania joined NATO on March 29  2004  the European Union on January 1  2007 and is also a member of the Latin Union  of the Francophonie  of the OSCE  of the WTO  of the BSEC and of

The name of Romania  Rom nia  comes from rom n  previously rum n    Romanian   which in turn is a derivative of the Latin romanus  meaning  citizen of Rome   12  The fact that Romanians call themselves a derivative of romanus is first mentioned in the 16th century by Italian humanists travelling in Transylvania  Moldavia and Wallachia  13  14  15  16  The first written record of a Romance language spoken in the Middle Ages in the Balkans was written by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor in the 6th century about a military expedition against the Avars from 587  when a Vlach muleteer accompanying the Byzantine army noticed that the load was falling from one of the animals and shouted to a companion Torna  torna fratre   Return  return brother     The oldest surviving document written in Romanian is a 1521 letter known as the  Letter of Neac u from C mpulung   17  Among other firsts  this text is also notable for having the first documented occurrence of a Romanian word denoting the country s name  Wallachia is mentioned under the name of  eara Rum neasc    The Romanian Land    eara from the terra   land   current spelling   ara Rom neasc    In the following centuries  Romanian documents use interchangeably two spelling forms  rom n and rum n  note 1  Socio linguistic evolutions in the late 17th century led to a process of semantic differentiation  the form rum n  presumably usual among the lower classes  received the meaning of  bondsman   while the form rom n kept an ethno linguistic meaning  18  After the abolition of serfdom in 1746  the form rum n gradually disappears and the spelling definitively stabilises to the form rom n  rom nesc  note 2 Tudor Vladimirescu  a revolutionary leader of the early 19th century  used the term Rum nia to refer exclusively to the principality of Wallachia  the southern part of modern Romania  19  The name Rom nia as common homeland of all Romanians is documented in the early 19th century  note 3  This name has been officially in use since 11 December 1861  20  English language sources still used the terms Rumania or Roumania  borrowed from the French spelling Roumanie  as recently as World War II  21  but since then those terms have largely been replaced with the official spelling Romania  22   edit  History Main article  History of Romania  edit  Prehistory Main articles  Prehistoric Romania  Cucuteni culture  and Hamangia culture Characteristic Cucuteni Trypillian zoomorphic representation  with meticulous decorations Some 42 000 year old human remains were discovered in the  Cave With Bones   and being Europe s oldest remains of Homo sapiens  they may represent the first modern humans to have entered the continent  23  Among the oldest traces of human existence and activity found in Romania include those dating from the Paleolithic  These remains were found at Bugiule ti  V lcea County   Ohaba Ponor  Hunedoara County  or Valea D rjovului  Olt County   belonging to some of the more distant human ancestors  According to studies of historical anthropology  these hominids used carved stone tools  were gatherers  fishermen and hunters  lived organized in bands and were sheltered in caves and hollows  The first manifestations of prehistoric art on current Romanian territory are the cave drawings from L pu   Maramure  County  and Cuciulat  S laj County   Statues  such as those from Hamangia  Tulcea County  for example  are representations of male and female deities  expressions of the cult of fecundity predominantly in the Stone Age  The Neolithic Age Cucuteni area in Northeast Romania was the Western region of the earliest European civilization 24  25  known as the Cucuteni Trypillian culture   edit  Antiquity Main articles  Ancient history of Romania  Getae  Dacians  Dacia  and Roman Dacia Emperor Trajan s annexation of Dacia in 106 set the stage for the ethnogenesis of modern Romanians The Helmet of Co ofene ti   a full gold Geto Dacian helmet dating from the first half of the 4th century BC  currently at the National Museum of Romanian History The earliest written evidence of people living in the territory of the present day Romania  the Getae  comes from Herodotus  in his Histories book IV  c  440 BC   26  Territories located north of the Danube were inhabited by Dacian tribes  including Carpi  Apuli  Tyragetae  Costoboci  Burs  Krobyzoi and Suci and other peoples  Dacians  like the majority of Thracians  were henotheists  the main deities being  Zalmoxis  Gebeleizis  Bendis  Derzelas and Kotys  Dacians  considered a part of the Getae tribes mentioned by Herodotus  were a branch of Thracians who inhabited Dacia  corresponding mostly to present day Romania   He describes the Getae as  the most brave and honest amongst all Thracians   The Dacian kingdom reached its peak between 82 44 BC during the reign of Burebista  Over the next century  relations between the Dacian tribes and Rome were relatively peaceful  however the ascent to the throne of Rome of emperor Domitian  81 AD  damaged relations between the Roman Empire and Dacia  He led military campaigns in the region between 87 88 AD at Tapae  Roman incursions continued in 101 102 AD and 105 106 AD under Trajan  who successfully defeated Dacia and annexed its south western parts to the vast Roman Empire  The Dacian population subsequently underwent the ethno linguistic process of Romanization and the conquered parts became an imperial province  Due to Dacia s rich ore deposits  especially gold and silver   27  Rome brought colonists from all over the empire  28  This introduced Vulgar Latin and started a period of intense romanization that would give birth to the Proto Romanian language  29  30  During the 3rd century AD  with the invasions of migratory populations  the Roman Empire was forced to pull out of Dacia around 271 AD  making it the first province to be abandoned  31  32  After the Roman army and administration left Dacia  the territory was invaded by various migratory populations including Goths  33 Huns  34 Gepids  35 Avars  36 Bulgars  35 Pechenegs  37  and Cumans  38  Several competing theories have been generated to explain the origin of modern Romanians  Linguistic and geo historical analysis tend to indicate that Romanians have coalesced as a major ethnic group both South and North of the Danube in the regions previously colonized by Romans  39   edit  Middle Ages Main articles  Romania in the Early Middle Ages and Romania in the Middle Ages Bran Castle was built in 1212  and became commonly known as Dracula s Castle after the myths of being home of Vlad III the Impaler  Gesta Hungarorum  also known as the Chronicle of Anonymus  mentioned the existence of three voivodeships in Transylvania in the 9th century  the Voivodeship of Gelou  the Voivodeship of Glad  originally from Vidin  then inhabited by Proto Romanians citation needed   and the Voivodeship of Menumorut  The anonymous author describes the first as Vlach  40  Another voivodeship  ruled by Gyula  was mentioned in the 11th century  It was mentioned as being large and prosperous   Jatissimum et opulentisimum    citation needed  It is known to have included the strongholds of D b ca  More ti  on the Mure  River   Moigrad and B lgrad  near Alba Iulia   Gyula was described as being an Orthodox Christian  therefore he was very probably either Romanian or Slav  A 1176 Slavonic inscription attests the existence of a  upan Dimitri that ruled over Dobrogea in 943  In the Alexiad  Byzantine princess Anna Komnene mentioned the political entities led by Sesthlav  Satza and Tatos  all in Southern Dobrogea  in 1086  41  In the Middle Ages  Romanians lived in three distinct principalities

the Kingdom of Hungary  42  and became independent as the Principality of Transylvania from the 16th century  43  until 1711  44  In Wallachia and Moldavia many small local states with varying degrees of independence developed  but only in the 14th century did the larger principalities of Wallachia  1310  and Moldavia  around 1352  emerge to fight the threat of the Ottoman Empire  Both territories

Michael the Brave on July 6  1600  after the battles of  elimb r  1599  and Bac u  1600   By 1541  the entire Balkan peninsula and most of Hungary became Ottoman provinces  Moldavia  Wallachia  and Transylvania were under Ottoman suzerainty  preserving partial full internal autonomy until middle of the 19th century  Transylvania to 1699   During this period the Romanian lands were characterised by the slow disappearance of the feudal system  A few rulers of present day Romanian territories distinguished themselves  these rulers include Stephen the Great  Vasile Lupu  and Dimitrie Cantemir in Moldavia  Matei Basarab  Vlad III the Impaler  and Constantin Br ncoveanu in Wallachia  and John Hunyadi  Ioannes Corvinus  and Gabriel Bethlen in Transylvania  47  In 1600  the principalities of Wallachia  Moldova and Transylvania were simultaneously headed by the Wallachian prince Michael the Brave  Mihai Viteazul   Ban of Oltenia  but the chance for a unity dissolved after Mihai was killed  only one year later  by the soldiers of Austrian army general Giorgio Basta  After his death  as vassal tributary states  Moldova and Wallachia had complete internal autonomy and external independence  which was finally lost in the 18th century  In 1699  Transylvania became a territory of the Habsburgs  Austrian empire following the Austrian victory over the Turks in the Great Turkish War  The Habsburgs in turn expanded their empire in 1718 to include an important part of Wallachia  called Oltenia  which was only returned in 1739  and in 1775 over the north western part of Moldavia  later called Bukovina  The eastern half of the Moldavian principality  called Bessarabia  was occupied in 1812 by Russia  47  Territorial changes of Romania since 1859 until present  edit  Independence and

Transylvania and Ottoman suzerainty over Wallachia and Moldavia  most Romanians were in the situation of being second class citizens or even non citizens 48  in a territory where they formed the majority of the population  49  50  In some Transylvanian cities  such as Bra ov  at that time a Saxon citadel   Romanians were not even allowed to reside within the city walls  51  Proclamation of the Moldo Wallachian union  painting by Theodor Aman Following the Wallachian uprising of 1821  more uprisings followed in 1848 in Wallachia as well as Moldavia  The flag adopted for Wallachia by the revolutionaries was a blue yellow red tricolour  with blue above  in line with the meaning  Liberty  Justice  Fraternity    52  while Romanian students in Paris hailed the new government with the same flag  as a symbol of union between Moldavians and Muntenians   53  54  This flag would later become the adopted as the flag of Romania  But after the failed 1848 Revolution  the Great Powers did not support the Romanians  expressed desire to officially unite in a single state  which forced Romania to proceed alone against the Ottomans  The electors in both Moldavia and Wallachia chose in 1859 the same person  Alexander John Cuza  as prince  Domnitor in Romanian   55  Thus  Romania was created as a personal union  albeit without including Transylvania  There  the upper class and the aristocracy remained mainly Hungarian and enjoyed strong support from Austria  and the establishment of the Austro Hungarian Dual Monarchy in 1867 kept the Hungarians firmly in control as the Romanians were by far the most numerous ethnic Transylvanian group and constituted the absolute majority  In a 1866 coup d  tat  Cuza was exiled and replaced by Prince Karl of Hohenzollern Sigmaringen  who became known as Prince Carol of Romania  During the Russo Turkish War Romania fought on the Russian side  56  and in the Treaty of San Stefano and the Treaty of Berlin  Romania was recognized as an independent state by the Ottoman Empire and the Great Powers  57  58  In return  Romania ceded three southern districts of Bessarabia to Russia and acquired Dobruja  In 1881  the principality was raised to a kingdom and Prince Carol became King Carol I  citation needed  The 1878 1914 period was one of stability and progress for Romania  During the Second Balkan War  Romania joined Greece  Serbia

Romanian hands after the invading forces were stopped in 1917  Total deaths from 1914 to 1918  military and civilian  within contemporary borders  were estimated at 748 000  61  By the war s end  Austria Hungary and the Russian Empire had collapsed and disintegrated  Bessarabia  Bukovina and Transylvania proclaimed unions with the Kingdom of Romania in 1918  By the 1920 Treaty of Trianon  Hungary was forced to renounce in favour of Romania all the claims of the Austro Hungarian Monarchy over Transylvania  62  The union of Romania with Bukovina was ratified in 1919 in the Treaty of Saint Germain  63  and with Bessarabia in 1920 by the Treaty of Paris  64  The Romanian expression Rom nia Mare  literal translation  Great Romania   but more commonly rendered  Greater Romania    generally refers to the Romanian state in the interwar period  and by extension  to the territory Romania covered at the time  Romania achieved at that time its greatest territorial extent  almost 300 000 km2 120 000 sq mi   65  managing to unite essentially all of the territories inhabited by Romanians  65  During the Second World War  Romania tried again to remain neutral  but on 28 June 1940  it received a Soviet ultimatum with an implied threat of invasion in the event of non compliance  66  Under Nazi and Soviet pressure  the Romanian administration and the army were forced to retreat from Bessarabia as well from northern Bukovina to avoid war  67  This  in combination with other factors  prompted the government to join the Axis  Thereafter  southern Dobruja was ceded to Bulgaria  while Hungary received Northern Transylvania as result of an Axis arbitration  68  The authoritarian King Carol II abdicated in 1940  and succeeded by the National Legionary State  in which power was shared by Ion Antonescu and the Iron Guard  Within months  Antonescu had crushed the Iron Guard  and the subsequent year Romania entered the war on the side of the Axis powers  During the war  Romania was the most important source of oil for Nazi Germany  69  which attracted multiple bombing raids by the Allies  By means of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union  Romania recovered Bessarabia and northern Bukovina from Soviet Russia  under the leadership of general Ion Antonescu  The Antonescu regime played a major role in the Holocaust  70  following to a lesser extent the Nazi policy of oppression and massacre of the Jews  and Romma  primarily in the Eastern territories Romania recovered or occupied from the Soviet Union  Transnistria  and in Moldavia  71 Jewish holocaust victims totaled at least 280 000 and 11 000 Romani victims  72  In August 1944  Antonescu was toppled and arrested by King Michael I of Romania and Romania changed sides and joined the Allies  But its role in the defeat of Nazi Germany was not recognized by the Paris Peace Conference of 1947  73  even though the Romanian Army had suffered 170 000 casualties after switching sides  74   edit  Communism Main article  Communist Romania During the Soviet occupation of Romania  the Communist dominated government called new elections  which were won with 80  of the vote  75  They thus rapidly established themselves as the dominant political force  76  In 1947  the Communists forced King Michael I to abdicate and leave the country  and proclaimed Romania a people s republic  77  78  Romania remained under the direct military occupation and economic control of the USSR until the late 1950s  During this period  Romania s vast natural resources were continuously drained by mixed Soviet Romanian companies  SovRoms  set up for exploitative purposes  79  80  81  In 1948  the state began to nationalize private firms  and to collectivize agriculture the following year  82  From the late 1940s to the early 1960s  the Communist government established a reign of terror  carried out mainly through the Securitate  the new secret police   During this time they launched several campaigns to eliminate  enemies of the state   in which numerous individuals were killed or imprisoned for political or economic reasons  83  Punishment included deportation  internal exile  and internment in forced labour camps and prisons  dissent was vigorously suppressed  A notorious experiment in this period took place in the Pite ti prison  where a group of political opponents were put into a program of reeducation through torture  Historical records show hundreds of thousands of abuses  deaths and incidents of torture against a wide range of people  from political opponents to ordinary citizens  84  Nevertheless  Romanian armed opposition to communist rule was one of the longest lasting in the Eastern Bloc  85  Nicolae Ceau escu condemning the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in front of a

with West Germany the same year  economic links having been set up in 1963  86  Also  close ties with the Arab countries  and the PLO  allowed Romania to play a key role in the Israel Egypt and Israel PLO peace processes  87  But as Romania s foreign debt sharply increased between 1977 and 1981  from 3 to 10 billion US dollars   88  the influence of international financial organisations such as the IMF or the World Bank grew  conflicting with Nicolae Ceau escu s autocratic policies  He eventually initiated a project of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing policies that impoverished Romanians and exhausted the Romanian economy  while also greatly extending the authority of the police state  and imposing a cult of personality  Although these led to a dramatic decrease in Ceau escu s popularity and culminated in his overthrow and execution in the bloody Romanian Revolution of 1989  by that time Romania s foreign debt was almost completely paid off  A 2006 Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania estimated that the number of direct victims clarification needed  of communist repression at two million people  This number does not include people who died in liberty as a result of their treatment in communist prisons  nor does it include people who died because of the dire economic circumstances in which the country found itself  89  90   edit  Present day democracy Main articles  History of Romania since 1989 and 2007 enlargement of the European Union The flag of Communist Romania with its coat of arms cut out became a symbol of the 1989 revolution and is still used occasionally in anti government protests  After the revolution  the National Salvation Front  NSF   led by Ion Iliescu  took partial multi party democratic and free market measures  91  92  Several major political parties of the pre war era were resurrected  After major political rallies  in April 1990  a sit in protest contesting the results of the recently held parliamentary elections began in University Square  Bucharest  accusing the NSF of being made up of former Communists and members of the Securitate  The protesters called the election undemocratic and asked for the exclusion from political life of former high ranking Communist Party members  such as Iliescu himself  The protest rapidly grew to become what president Iliescu called the Golaniad  The peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence  prompting the intervention of coal miners  summoned by Iliescu in June 1990  from the Jiu Valley  This episode has been documented widely by both local 93  and foreign media  94  and is remembered as the June 1990 Mineriad  95  96  The subsequent disintegration of the Front produced several political parties including the Social Democratic Party  the Democratic Party and the Alliance for Romania  The former governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with Ion Iliescu as head of state  Since then there have been several democratic changes of government  in 1996 the democratic liberal opposition and its leader Emil Constantinescu acceded to power  in 2000 the Social Democrats returned to power  with Iliescu once again president  and in 2004 Traian B sescu was elected president  with an electoral coalition called Justice and Truth Alliance  B sescu was

human development  102  The country has been successful in reducing internal poverty and establishing a functional democracy  103  However  Romania s development suffered a major setback during the late 2000s recession as a large gross domestic product contraction and a large budget deficit in 2009 led to Romania borrowing heavily  104  eventually becoming the largest debtor to the International

national referendum on 8 December 1991  131  A plebiscite held in October 2003 approved 79 amendments to the Constitution  bringing it into conformity with European Union legislation  131  The country is governed on the basis of multi party democratic system and of the segregation of the legislative  executive and judicial powers  131  Romania is a semi presidential republic where executive functions are held by both government and the president  The president is elected by popular vote for a maximum of two terms  and since the amendments in 2003  each term lasts five years  131  He appoints the prime minister  who in turn appoints the Council of Ministers  based at Victoria Palace   131  The legislative branch of the government  collectively known as the Parliament  residing at the Palace of the Parliament   consists of two chambers   the Senate with 140 members  and the Chamber of Deputies with 346 members  131  The members of both chambers are elected every four years under a system of party list proportional representation  131  The justice system is independent of the other branches of government  and is made up of a hierarchical system of courts culminating in the High Court of Cassation and Justice  which is the supreme court of Romania  132  There are also courts of appeal  county courts and local courts  The Romanian judicial system is strongly influenced by the French model  131  133  considering that it is based on civil law and is inquisitorial in nature  The Constitutional Court  Curtea Constitu ional   is responsible for judging the compliance of laws and other state regulations to the Romanian Constitution  which is the fundamental law of the country  The constitution  which was introduced in 1991  can be amended by only a public referendum  the last of which took place in 2003  Since this amendment  the court s decisions cannot be overruled by any majority of the parliament  The country s entry into the European Union in 2007 134  has been a significant influence on its domestic policy  As part of the process  Romania has instituted reforms including judicial reform  increased judicial cooperation with other member states  and measures to combat corruption  Nevertheless  in 2006 Brussels report  Romania and Bulgaria were described as the two most corrupt countries in the EU  135  and Romania was ranked  together

military presence at several Romanian facilities primarily in the eastern part of the country  140  In May 2009  U S  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that  Romania is one of the most trustworthy and respectable partners of the USA  during a visit of the Romanian foreign minister  141  Relations with Moldova are a special case  considering that the two countries practically share the same language  and a fairly common historical background  137  A movement for unification of Romania and Moldova appeared in the early 1990s after both countries achieved emancipation from communist rule  142  but lost ground in the mid 1990s when a new Moldovan government pursued an agenda towards preserving a Moldovan republic independent of Romania  143  Romania remains interested in Moldovan affairs and has officially rejected the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact  142  but the two countries have been unable so far to reach agreement on a basic bilateral treaty  144  After the 2009

international economic exchange in Europe  However  because of insufficient investment  maintenance and repair  the transport infrastructure does not meet the current needs of a market economy and lags behind Western Europe  179  Nevertheless  these conditions are rapidly improving and catching up with the standards of Trans European transport networks  Several projects have been started with funding from grants from ISPA and several loans from International Financial Institutions  World Bank  IMF  etc   guaranteed by the state  to upgrade the main road corridors  Also  the Government is actively pursuing new external financing or public private partnerships to further upgrade the main roads  and especially the country s motorway network  179  Romania has a relatively well developed
