Jewish family  6  His mother  Leah Adler  n e Posner   7  was a restaurateur and concert pianist  and his father  Arnold Spielberg  was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers  8  He spent his childhood in Haddon Township  New Jersey  where he saw one of his first films in a theater  as well as in Scottsdale  Arizona  9  Throughout his early teens  Spielberg made amateur 8 mm  adventure  films with his friends  the first of which he shot at the Pinnacle Peak Patio restaurant in Scottsdale  He charged admission  25 cents  to his home films  which involved the wrecks he staged with his Lionel train set  while his sister sold popcorn  In 1958  he became a Boy Scout  and fulfilled a requirement for the photography merit badge by making a nine minute 8 mm film entitled The Last Gunfight  10  Spielberg recalled years later to a magazine interviewer   My dad s still camera was broken  so I asked the scoutmaster if I could tell a story with my father s movie camera  He said yes  and I got an idea to do a Western  I made it and got my merit badge  That was how it all started   11  At age 13  Spielberg won a prize for a 40 minute war film he titled Escape to Nowhere which was based on a battle in east Africa  In 1963  at age 16  Spielberg wrote and directed his first independent film  a 140 minute science fiction adventure called Firelight  which would later inspire Close Encounters   The film  which had a budget of US 500  was shown in his local cinema and generated a profit of  1  12  He also made several WWII films inspired by his father s war stories  After his parents divorced  he moved to Saratoga  California with his father  His three sisters and mother remained in Arizona  He attended Arcadia High School in Phoenix  Arizona for three years  Spielberg graduated from Saratoga High School in 1965  It was during this time Spielberg attained the rank of Eagle Scout  Spielberg attended Hebrew school from 1953 to 1957  in classes taught by Rabbi Albert L  Lewis  13  who would later be memorialized as the main character in Mitch Albom s Have a Little Faith  As a child  Spielberg faced difficulty reconciling being an Orthodox Jew with the perception of him by other children he played with   It isn t something I enjoy admitting   he once said   but when I was 7  8  9 years old  God forgive me  I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews  I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parents  Jewish practices  I was never really ashamed to be Jewish  but I was uneasy at times  My grandfather always wore a long black coat  black hat and long white beard  I was embarrassed to invite my friends over to the house  because he might be in a corner davening  praying   and I wouldn t know how to explain this to my WASP friends   14  Spielberg also said he suffered from acts of anti Semitic prejudice in his early life  he later said   In high school  I got smacked and kicked around  Two bloody noses  It was horrible   15  After moving to California  he applied to attend the film school at University of Southern California School of Theater  Film and Television two separate times  but was unsuccessful  He subsequently became a student at California State University  Long Beach  While attending Long Beach State in the 1960s  Spielberg became a member of Theta Chi Fraternity  His actual career began when he returned to Universal Studios as an unpaid  seven day a week intern and guest of the editing department  uncredited   After Spielberg became famous  USC awarded him an honorary degree in 1994  and in 1996 he became a trustee of the university  16  17  In 2002  thirty five years after starting college  Spielberg finished his degree via independent projects at CSULB  and was awarded a B A  in Film Production and Electronic Arts with an option in Film Video Production  17  As an intern and guest of Universal Studios  Spielberg made his first short film for theatrical release  the 26 minute Amblin   1968   8  the title of which Spielberg later took as the name of his production company  Amblin Entertainment  After Sidney Sheinberg  then the vice president of production for Universal s TV arm  saw the film  Spielberg became the youngest director ever to be signed for a long term deal with a major Hollywood studio  Universal   He dropped out of Long Beach State in 1969 to take up the television director contract at Universal Studios and began his career as a professional director  citation needed  In 1969  Variety announced that Spielberg would direct his first full length film  Malcolm Winkler  written by Claudia Salter  produced by John Orland  with Frank Price being the executive producer  However  because of the difficulty in casting the key male role  the film was not made  Steven Spielberg also attended Brookdale Community College for undergrad  Career Early career  1969 75  His first professional TV job came when he was hired to do one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of Night Gallery  The segment   Eyes   starred Joan Crawford  and she and Spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death  The episode is unusual in his body of work  in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later  more  mature  films  After this  and an episode of Marcus Welby  M D   Spielberg got his first feature length assignment  an episode of The Name of the Game called  L A  2017   This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract  He did another segment on Night Gallery and did some work for shows such as Owen Marshall  Counselor at Law and The Psychiatrist before landing the first series episode of Columbo  previous episodes were actually TV films   Based on the strength of his work  Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films  The first was a Richard Matheson adaptation called Duel  The film is about a psychotic Peterbilt 281 tanker truck driver who chases a terrified driver  Dennis Weaver  of a small Plymouth Valiant and tries to run him off the road  Special praise of this film by the influential British critic Dilys Powell was highly significant to Spielberg s career  Another TV film  Something Evil  was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of The Exorcist  then a major best selling book which had not yet been released as a film  He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film length pilot of a show called Savage  starring Martin Landau  Spielberg s debut feature film was The Sugarland Express  about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby  Spielberg s cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers  and The Hollywood Reporter stated that  a major new director is on the horizon   18  However  the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release  Studio producers Richard D  Zanuck and David Brown offered Spielberg the director s chair for Jaws  a thriller horror film based on the Peter Benchley novel about an enormous killer shark  Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible  Despite the film s ultimate  enormous success  it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over runs  But Spielberg persevered and finished the film  It was an enormous hit  winning three Academy Awards  for editing  original score and sound  and grossing more than  470 million worldwide at the box office  It also set the domestic record for box office gross  leading to what the press described as  Jawsmania   19 Jaws made him a household name  as well as one of America s youngest multi millionaires  and allowed Spielberg a great deal of autonomy for his future projects  20  It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg s first of three collaborations with actor Richard Dreyfuss  Mainstream breakthrough  1975 93  Rejecting offers to direct Jaws 2  21 King Kong and Superman  Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re convened to work on a film about UFOs  which became Close Encounters of the Third Kind  1977   One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg  Close Encounters was a critical and box office hit  giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other Academy Awards nominations  It won Oscars in two categories  Cinematography  Vilmos Zsigmond  and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing  Frank E  Warner   This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg s rise  His next film  1941  a big budgeted World War II farce  was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over  92 4 million dollars worldwide  and did make a small profit for co producing studios Columbia and Universal  it was seen as a disappointment  mainly with the critics  Spielberg then revisited his Close Encounters project and  with financial backing from Columbia Pictures  released Close Encounters  The Special Edition in 1980  For this  Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also  at the behest of Columbia  and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film  shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film  a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery   Nevertheless  the re release was a moderate success  while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending  Next  Spielberg teamed with Star Wars creator and friend George Lucas on an action adventure film  Raiders of the Lost Ark  the first of the Indiana Jones films  The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by Harrison Ford  whom Lucas had previously cast in his Star Wars films as Han Solo   The film was considered an homage to the cliffhanger serials of the Golden Age of Hollywood  It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981  and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director  Spielberg s second nomination  and Best Picture  the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture   Raiders is still considered a landmark example of the action adventure genre  The film also led to Ford s casting in Ridley Scott s Blade Runner  22  Steven Spielberg with President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan after a showing of E T  at the White House A year later  Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with E T  the Extra Terrestrial  It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends  who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home  E T  the Extra Terrestrial went on to become the top grossing film of all time  E T  was also nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director  Between 1982 and 1985  Spielberg produced three high grossing films  Poltergeist  for which he also co wrote the screenplay   a big screen adaptation of The Twilight Zone  for which he directed the segment  Kick The Can    23  and The Goonies  Spielberg  executive producer  also wrote the story on which the screenplay was based   24  His next directorial feature was the Raiders prequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom  Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford  the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script  This film and the Spielberg produced Gremlins led to the creation of the PG 13 rating due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences  In spite of this  Temple of Doom is rated PG by the MPAA  even though it is the darkest and  possibly  most violent Indy film  Nonetheless  the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984  It was on this project that Spielberg also met his future wife  actress Kate Capshaw  In 1985  Spielberg released The Color Purple  an adaptation of Alice Walker s Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name  about a generation of empowered

Ballard s autobiographical novel Empire of the Sun  starring John Malkovich and a young Christian Bale  The film garnered much praise from critics and was nominated for several Oscars  but did not yield substantial box office revenues  Reviewer Andrew Sarris called it the best film of the year and later included it among the best films of the decade  25  After two forays into more serious dramatic films  Spielberg then directed the third Indiana Jones film  1989 s Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  Once again teaming up with Lucas and Ford  Spielberg also cast actor Sean Connery in a supporting role as Indy s father  The film earned generally positive reviews and was another box office success  becoming the highest grossing film worldwide that year  its total box office receipts

with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances  In an AFI interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extra terrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films  Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood  71  and his interest came from his father  a science fiction fan  and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest  but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge  72  A strong consistent theme in his family friendly work is a childlike  even na ve  sense of wonder and faith  as attested by works such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind  E T  the Extra Terrestrial  Hook  and A I  Artificial Intelligence  According to Warren Buckland  73  these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots  which have become one of Spielberg s directing trademarks  In the cases when his films include children  E T  the Extra Terrestrial  Empire of the Sun  Jurassic Park  etc    this type of shot is more apparent  but it is also used in films like Munich  Saving Private Ryan  The Terminal  Minority Report  and Amistad  If one views each of his films  one will see this shot utilized by the director  notably the water scenes in Jaws are filmed from the low angle perspective of someone swimming  Another child oriented theme in Spielberg s films is that of loss of innocence and coming of age  In Empire of the Sun  Jim  a well groomed and spoiled English youth  loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China  Similarly  in Catch Me If You Can  Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them  The most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent child relationships  Parents  often fathers  are reluctant  absent or ignorant  Peter Banning in Hook starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married to his work parent who through the course of his film regains the respect of his children  The notable absence of Elliott s father in E T   is the most famous example of this theme  In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father  who is a professor of medieval literature  as his father always seemed more interested in his work  specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail  than in his own son  although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy  he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son  self reliance   which is not how Indy saw it   Even Oskar Schindler  from Schindler s List  is reluctant to have a child with his wife  Munich depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter  There are of course exceptions  Brody in Jaws is a committed family man  while John Anderton in Minority Report is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son  This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg s films  since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents  divorce as a child and by the absence of his father  Furthermore to this theme  protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents  most notably E T  the Extra Terrestrial  protagonist Elliot s mother is divorced  and Catch Me If You Can  Frank Abagnale s mother and father split early on in the film   Little known also is Tim in Jurassic Park  early in the film  another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex s parents  divorce   The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well  Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures  Tim looks to Dr  Alan Grant as a father figure  Initially  Dr  Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim  However  by the end of the film  he has changed  and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders  Most of his films are generally optimistic in nature  Critics frequently accuse his films of being overly sentimental  though Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised  The influence comes from directors Frank Capra and John Ford  74  Contemporaries In terms of casting and production itself  Spielberg has a known penchant for working with actors and production members from his previous films  For instance  he has cast Richard Dreyfuss in several films  Jaws  Close Encounters of the Third Kind  and Always  Aside from his role as Indiana Jones  Spielberg also cast Harrison Ford as a headteacher in E T  the Extra Terrestrial  though the scene was ultimately cut   Although Spielberg directed him only once  in Raiders of the Lost Ark  for which he voiced many of the animals   veteran voice actor Frank Welker has lent his voice in a number of productions Spielberg has executively produced from Gremlins to its sequel Gremlins 2  The New Batch  as well as The Land Before Time  and lending his voice to its sequels which Spielberg had no involvement in   Who Framed Roger Rabbit  and television shows such as Tiny Toons  Animaniacs  and SeaQuest DSV  Recently Spielberg has used Tom Hanks on several occasions and has cast him in Saving Private Ryan  Catch Me If You Can  and The Terminal  Spielberg also has collaborated with Tom Cruise twice on Minority Report and War of the Worlds  Spielberg has also cast Shia LaBeouf in five films  Transformers  Eagle Eye  Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  Transformers  Revenge of the Fallen  and Transformers  Dark of the Moon  Spielberg prefers working with production members with whom he has developed an existing working relationship  An example of this is his production relationship with Kathleen Kennedy who has served as producer on all his major films from E T  the Extra Terrestrial to the recent Munich  Other working relationships include Allen Daviau  a childhood friend and cinematographer who shot the early Spielberg film Amblin and most of his films up to Empire of the Sun  Janusz Kami ski who has shot every Spielberg film since Schindler s List  see List of film director and cinematographer collaborations   and the film editor Michael Kahn who has edited every film directed by Spielberg from Close Encounters to Munich  except E T  the Extra Terrestrial   Most of the DVDs of Spielberg s films have documentaries by Laurent Bouzereau  A famous example of Spielberg working with the same professionals is his long time collaboration with John Williams and the use of his musical scores in all of his films since The Sugarland Express  except The Color Purple and Twilight Zone  The Movie   One of Spielberg s trademarks is his use of music by John Williams to add to the visual impact of his scenes and to try and create a lasting picture and sound of the film in the memories of the film audience  These visual scenes often uses images of the sun  e g  Empire of the Sun  Saving Private Ryan  the final scene of Jurassic Park  and the end credits of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  where they ride into the sunset   of which the last two feature a Williams score at that end scene  Spielberg is a contemporary of filmmakers George Lucas  Francis Ford Coppola  Martin Scorsese  John Milius  and Brian De Palma  collectively known as the  Movie Brats   Aside from his principal role as a director  Spielberg has acted as a producer for a considerable number of films  including early hits for Joe Dante and Robert Zemeckis  Personal life Marriages and children From 1985 to 1989 Spielberg was married to actress Amy Irving  In their 1989 divorce settlement  she received  100 million from Spielberg after a judge controversially vacated a

Max Samuel  Spielberg subsequently developed a relationship with actress Kate Capshaw  whom he met when he cast her in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom  They married on October 12  1991  Capshaw

Shone has said of Spielberg   If you have to point to any one director of the last twenty five years in whose work the medium of film was most fully itself   where we found out what it does best when left to its own devices  it has to be that guy   142  Jess Cagle  the managing editor of Entertainment Weekly  called Spielberg     arguably  well  who would argue   the greatest filmmaker in history   143  However  Spielberg is not without his critics many of whom complain that his films are overly sentimental and tritely moralistic  144  145  146  In his book Easy Riders  Raging Bulls  How the Sex  n  Drugs  n  Rock  n  Roll Generation Saved Hollywood  Peter Biskind summarized the views of Spielberg s detractors  accusing the director of  infantilizing the audience  reconstituting the spectator as child  then overwhelming him and her with sound and spectacle  obliterating irony  aesthetic self consciousness  and critical reflection   147  Critics of mainstream film such as Ray Carney and American artist and actor Crispin Glover  who starred in the Spielberg produced Back to the Future and also sued Spielberg for using Glover s likeness in Back to the Future Part II  148  claim that Spielberg s films lack depth and do not take risks  149  150  French New Wave filmmaker Jean Luc Godard stated that he holds Spielberg partly responsible for the lack of artistic merit in mainstream cinema and accused Spielberg of using his film Schindler s List to make a profit of tragedy while Schindler s wife  Emilie Schindler  lived in poverty in Argentina  151  In defense of Spielberg  critic Roger Ebert said  Has Godard or any other director living or dead done more than Spielberg  with his Holocaust Project  to honor and preserve the memories of the survivors   152  Author Thomas Keneally has also disputed claims that Emilie Schindler was never paid for her contributions to the film   not least because I had recently sent Emilie a check myself   153  The late film critic  Pauline Kael  who had championed Spielberg s films in the 1970s  expressed disappointment in his later development  stating that  he s become  I think  a very bad director     And I m a little ashamed for him  because I loved his early work      H e turned to virtuous movies  And he s become so uninteresting now     I think that he had it in him to become more of a fluid  far out director  But  instead  he s become a melodramatist   154  Imre Kert sz  Hungarian Jewish author  Nazi concentration camp survivor  and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature  criticized Spielberg s depiction of the Holocaust in Schindler s List as kitsch  saying  I regard as kitsch any representation of the Holocaust that is incapable of understanding or unwilling to understand the organic connection between our own deformed mode of life and the very possibility of the Holocaust   155  Veteran documentary filmmaker and professor Claude Lanzmann also labeled Schindler s List  pernicious in its impact and influence  and  very sentimental   156  Stephen Rowley wrote an extensive essay about Spielberg and his career in Senses of Cinema  In it he discussed Spielberg s strengths as a film maker  saying  there is a welcome complexity of tone and approach in these later films that defies the lazy stereotypes often bandied about his films  and that  Spielberg continues to take risks  with his body of work continuing to grow more impressive and ambitious   concluding that he has only received  limited  begrudging recognition  from critics  146  Other In 1999  Spielberg  then a co owner of DreamWorks  was involved in a heated debate in which the studio proposed building on wetlands near Los Angeles  California  though development was later dropped for economic reasons  157  In August 2007  Ai Weiwei  artistic designer for the Beijing Olympic Stadium  known as the  Bird s Nest   accused those choreographing the Olympic opening ceremony  including Spielberg  of failing to live up to their responsibility as artists  Ai said   It s disgusting  I don t like anyone who shamelessly abuses their profession  who makes no moral judgment   158  Filmography Main article  Steven Spielberg
