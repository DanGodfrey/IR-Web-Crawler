mountain range in western North America  The Rocky Mountains stretch more than 3 000 miles  4 830 km  from the northernmost part of British Columbia  in western Canada  to New Mexico  in the southwestern United States  Within the North American Cordillera  the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west  The Rocky Mountains were formed from 80 million to 55 million years ago by the Laramide orogeny  Since then  erosion by water and glaciers have sculpted the mountain range into dramatic valleys and peaks  At the end of the last ice age  humans started to inhabit the mountain range  After Europeans  such as Sir Alexander MacKenzie and the Lewis and Clark expedition  started to explore the range  minerals and furs drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains  although the range itself never became densely populated  Currently  much of the mountain range is protected by public parks and forest lands  and is a popular tourist destination  especially for hiking  camping  mountaineering  fishing  hunting  mountain biking  skiing  and snowboarding  Contents 1 Geography 2

Columbia south to the Rio Grande in New Mexico  Other mountain ranges continue beyond those two rivers  including the Selwyn Range in Yukon  the Brooks Range in Alaska  and the Sierra Madre in Mexico  but those are not part of the Rockies  though they are part of the American cordillera  The United States definition of the Rockies  however  includes the Cabinet and Salish Mountains of Idaho and Montana  whereas their counterparts north of the Kootenai River  the Columbia Mountains  are considered a separate system in Canada  lying to the west of the huge Rocky Mountain Trench  which runs the length of British Columbia from its beginnings in the middle Flathead River valley in western Montana to the south bank of the Liard River  1  The Rockies vary in width from 70 to 300 miles  110 to 480 kilometers   Also west of the Rocky Mountain Trench  farther north and facing the Muskwa Range across the trench  are the Stikine Ranges and Omineca Mountains of the Interior Mountains system of British Columbia  A small area east of Prince George  British Columbia on the eastern side of the Trench  the McGregor Plateau  resembles the Rockies but is considered part of the Interior Plateau  The Rocky Mountains arise abruptly from the Great Plains near Greenwood Village  Colorado The eastern edge of the Rockies rises dramatically above the Interior Plains of central North America  including the Front Range of Colorado  the Wind River Range and Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming  the Absaroka Beartooth ranges and Rocky Mountain Front of Montana  and the Clark Range of Alberta  In Canada geographers define three main groups of ranges  the Continental Ranges  Hart Ranges and Muskwa Ranges  the latter two flank the Peace River  the only river to pierce the Rockies  and are collectively referred to as the Northern Rockies   The Muskwa and Hart Ranges together comprise what is known as the Northern Rockies  the Mackenzie Mountains north of the Liard River are sometimes referred to as being part of the Rockies but this is an unofficial designation   Mount Elbert in Colorado  is the highest peak in the Rocky Mountains  The western edge of the Rockies includes ranges such as the Wasatch near Salt Lake City and the Bitterroots along the Idaho Montana border  The Great Basin and Columbia River Plateau separate these sub ranges from distinct ranges further to the west  most prominent among which are the Sierra Nevada  Cascade Range and Coast Mountains  The Rockies do not extend into the Yukon or Alaska  or into central British Columbia  where the Rocky Mountain System  but not the Rocky Mountains  includes the Columbia Mountains  the southward extension of which is considered part of the Rockies in the United States  The Rocky Mountain System within the United States is a United States physiographic region  the Rocky Mountain System is known in Canada as the Eastern System  The Rocky Mountains are notable for containing the highest peaks in central North America  The range s highest peak is Mount Elbert located in Colorado at 14 440 feet  4 401 m  above sea level  Mount Robson in British Columbia  at 12 972 feet  3 954 m   is the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies  Mount Robson in British Columbia  Canada  The Continental Divide is located in the Rocky Mountains and designates the line at which waters flow either to the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans  Triple Divide Peak  8 020 feet  2 440 m   in Glacier National Park  U S   is so named because water that falls on the mountain reaches not only the Atlantic and Pacific  but Hudson Bay as well  Farther north in Alberta  the Athabasca and other rivers feed the basin of the Mackenzie River  which has its outlet on the Beaufort Sea of the Arctic Ocean  See Rivers of the Rocky Mountains for a list of rivers  Human population is not very dense in the Rocky Mountains  with an average of four people per square kilometer  10 per square mile  and few cities with over 50 000 people  However  the human population grew rapidly in the Rocky Mountain states between 1950 and 1990  The 40 year statewide increases in population range from 35  in Montana to about 150  in Utah and Colorado  The populations of several mountain towns and communities have doubled in the last 40 years  Jackson Hole  Wyoming  increased 260   from 1 244 to 4 472 residents  in 40 years  2   edit  Geology See also  Geology of the Rocky Mountains The rocks in the Rocky Mountains were formed before the mountains were raised by tectonic forces  The oldest rock is Precambrian metamorphic rock that forms the core of the North American continent  There is also Precambrian sedimentary argillite  dating back to 1 7 billion years ago  During the Paleozoic  western North America lay underneath a shallow sea  which deposited many kilometers of limestone and dolomite  3  In the southern Rocky Mountains  near present day Colorado  these ancestral rocks were disturbed by mountain building approximately 300Ma  during the Pennsylvanian  This mountain building produced the Ancestral Rocky Mountains  They consisted largely of Precambrian metamorphic rock forced upward through layers of the limestone laid down in the shallow sea  4  The mountains eroded throughout the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic  leaving extensive deposits of sedimentary rock  Terranes started to collide with the western edge of North America in the Mississippian  approximately 350 million years ago   causing the Antler orogeny  5  For 270 million years  the effects of plate collisions were focused very near the edge of the North American plate boundary  far to the west of the Rocky Mountain region  5  It was not until 80 Ma that these effects began to reach the Rockies  6  The current Rocky Mountains were raised in the Laramide orogeny from between 80 to 55 Ma  6  For the Canadian Rockies  the mountain building is analogous to a rug being pushed on a hardwood floor  3  the rug bunches up and forms wrinkles  mountains   In Canada  the terranes and subduction are the foot pushing the rug  the ancestral rocks are the rug  and the Canadian Shield in the middle of the continent is the hardwood floor  3  Further south  the growth of the Rocky Mountains in the United States was probably caused by an unusual subduction  where the Farallon plate dove at a shallow angle below the North American plate  7  This low angle moved the focus of melting and mountain building much farther inland than the normal 200 to 300 miles  300 to 500 km   7  It is postulated that the shallow angle of the subducting plate greatly increased the friction and other interactions with the thick continental mass above it  Tremendous thrusts piled sheets of crust on top of each other  building the extraordinarily broad  high Rocky Mountain range  7  Tilted slabs of sedimentary rock in Colorado The current southern Rockies were forced upwards through the layers of Pennsylvanian and Permian sedimentary remnants of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains  Such sedimentary remnants were often tilted at steep angles along the flanks of the modern range  they are now visible in many places throughout the Rockies  and are prominently shown along the Dakota Hogback  an early Cretaceous sandstone formation that runs along the eastern flank of the modern Rockies  Immediately after the Laramide orogeny  the Rockies were like Tibet  a high plateau  probably 6 000 metres  20 000 ft  above sea level  In the last 60 million years  erosion stripped away the high rocks  revealing the ancestral rocks beneath  and forming the current landscape of the Rockies  3  Glaciers  such as Jackson Glacier as shown here  have dramatically shaped the Rocky Mountains  Periods of glaciation occurred from the Pleistocene Epoch  1 8 million   70 000 years ago  to the Holocene Epoch  fewer than 11 000 years ago   The ice ages left their mark on the Rockies  forming extensive glacial landforms  such as U shaped valleys and cirques  Recent glacial episodes included the Bull Lake Glaciation that began about 150 000 years ago and the Pinedale Glaciation that probably remained at full glaciation until 15 000 20 000 years ago  2  8  All of the geological processes  above  have left a complex set of rocks exposed at the surface  For example  volcanic rock from the Tertiary  65 million   2 6 million years ago  occurs in the San Juan Mountains and in other areas  Millennia of severe erosion in the Wyoming Basin transformed intermountain basins into a relatively flat terrain  The Tetons and other north central ranges contain folded and faulted rocks of Paleozoic and Mesozoic age draped above cores of Proterozoic and Archean igneous and metamorphic rocks ranging in age from 1 2 billion  e g   Tetons  to more than 3 3 billion years  Beartooth Mountains   2   edit  Ecology and climate Main article  Ecology of the Rocky Mountains There are a wide range of environmental factors in the Rocky Mountains  The Rockies range in latitude between the Liard River in British Columbia  at 59  N  and the Rio Grande in New Mexico  at 35  N   Prairie occurs at or below 1 800 feet  550 m   while the highest peak in the range is Mount Elbert at 14 440 feet  4 400 m   Precipitation ranges from 10 inches  250 mm  per year in the southern valleys 9  to 60 inches  1 500 mm  per year locally in the northern peaks  10  Average January temperatures can range from 20  F   7  C  in Prince George  British Columbia to 43  F  6  C  in Trinidad  Colorado  11  Therefore  there is not a single monolithic ecosystem for the entire Rocky Mountain Range  Tundra in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado Instead  ecologists divide the Rocky Mountain into a number of biotic zones  Each zone is defined by whether it can support trees  and the presence of one or more indicator species  Two zones that do not support trees are the Plains and the Alpine tundra  The Great Plains lie to the east of the Rockies  and is characterized by prairie grasses  below roughly 1 800 feet  550 m    Alpine tundra occurs in regions above the treeline for the Rocky Mountains  which varies from 12 000 feet  3 700 m  in New Mexico to 2 500 feet  760 m  at the northern end of the Rocky Mountains  near the Yukon   11  The USGS defines ten forested zones in the Rocky Mountains  2  Zones in more southern  warmer  or drier areas are defined by the presence of pinyon pines junipers  ponderosa pines  or oaks mixed with pines  In more northern  colder  or wetter areas  zones are defined by Douglas firs  Cascadian species  such as western hemlock   lodgepole pines quaking aspens  or firs mixed with spruce  Near treeline  zones can consist of white pines  such as whitebark pine or bristlecone pine   or a mixture of white pine  fir  and spruce that appear as shrub like krummholz  Finally  rivers and canyons can create a unique forest zone in more arid parts of the mountain range  2  Bighorn sheep  such as this lamb in Alberta  have declined dramatically since European American settlement of the Rocky Mountains  The Rocky Mountains are important habitat for a great deal of well known wildife  such as elk  moose  mule and white tailed deer  pronghorns  mountain goats  bighorn sheep  black bears  grizzly bears  coyotes  lynxes  and wolverines  2  For example  North America s largest herds of moose is in the Alberta British Columbia foothills forests  The status of most species in the Rocky Mountains is unknown  due to incomplete information  European American settlement of the mountains has adversely impacted native species  Examples of some species that have declined include western toads  greenback cutthroat trouts  white sturgeons  white tailed ptarmigans  trumpeter swans  and bighorn sheep  In the United States portion of the mountain range  apex predators such as grizzly bears and gray wolves had been extirpated from their original ranges  but have partially recovered due to conservation measures and reintroduction  Other recovering species include the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon  2   edit  Human history  edit  First Nations Since the last great ice age  the Rocky Mountains were home first to the indigenous peoples  including the Apache  Arapaho  Bannock  Blackfoot  Cheyenne  Crow Nation  Flathead  Shoshone  Sioux  Ute  Kutenai  Ktunaxa in Canada   Sekani  Dunne za  and others  2  Paleo Indians hunted the now extinct mammoth and ancient bison  an animal 20  larger than modern bison  in the foothills and valleys of the mountains  Like the modern tribes that followed them  Paleo Indians probably migrated to the plains in fall and winter for bison and to the mountains in spring and summer for fish  deer  elk  roots  and berries  In Colorado  along the crest of the Continental Divide  rock walls that Native Americans built for driving game date back 5 400 5 800 years  2  A growing body of scientific evidence indicates that indigenous people had significant effects on mammal populations by hunting and on vegetation patterns through deliberate burning  2   edit  European exploration Recent human history of the Rocky Mountains is one of more rapid change  2  The Spanish explorer Francisco V squez de Coronado with a group of soldiers  missionaries  and African slaves marched into the Rocky Mountain region from the south in 1540  The introduction of the horse  metal tools  rifles  new diseases  and different cultures profoundly changed the Native American cultures  Native American populations were extirpated from most of their historical ranges by disease  warfare  habitat loss  eradication of the bison   and continued assaults on their culture  2  In 1739  French fur traders Pierre and Paul Mallet  while journeying through the Great Plains  discovered a range of mountains at the headwaters of the Platte River  which local American Indian tribes called the  Rockies   becoming the first Europeans to report on this uncharted mountain range  12  Sir Alexander MacKenzie in 1800 Sir Alexander MacKenzie  1764 March 11  1820  became the first European to cross the Rocky Mountains in 1793  He found the upper reaches of the Fraser River and reached the Pacific coast of what is now Canada on July 20 of that year  completing the first recorded transcontinental crossing of North America north of Mexico  He arrived at Bella Coola  British Columbia  where he first reached saltwater at South Bentinck Arm  an inlet of the Pacific Ocean  The Lewis and Clark Expedition  1804 1806  was the first scientific reconnaissance of the Rocky Mountains  Specimens were collected for contemporary botanists  zoologists  and geologists  2  The expedition was said to have paved the way to  and through  the Rocky Mountains for European Americans from the East  although Lewis and Clark met at least 11 European American mountain men during their travels  2  Mountain men  primarily French  Spanish  and British  roamed the Rocky Mountains from 1720 to 1800 seeking mineral deposits and furs  The fur trading North West Company established Rocky Mountain House as a trading post in what is now the Rocky Mountain Foothills of present day Alberta in 1799  and their business rivals the Hudson s Bay Company established Acton House nearby  These posts served as bases for most European activity in the Canadian Rockies in the early 19th century  Among the most notable are the expeditions of David Thompson  explorer   who followed the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean  On his 1811 expedition  he camped at the junction of the Columbia River and the Snake River and erected a pole and notice claiming the area for Great Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a fort at the site  By the Anglo American Convention of 1818  which established the 49th parallel north as the international boundary west from Lake of the Woods to the  Stony Mountains   the UK and the USA agreed to what has since been described as  joint occupancy  of lands further west to the Pacific Ocean  Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues  the Oregon dispute  was deferred until a later time  In 1819  Spain ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States  though these rights did not include possession and also included obligations to Britain and Russia concerning their claims in the same region   edit  Settlement After 1802  American fur traders and explorers ushered in the first widespread Caucasian presence in the Rockies south of the 49th parallel  The more famous of these include Americans William Henry Ashley  Jim Bridger  Kit Carson  John Colter  Thomas Fitzpatrick  Andrew Henry  and Jedediah Smith  On July 24  1832  Benjamin Bonneville led the first wagon train across the Rocky Mountains by using Wyoming s South Pass  2  Similarly  in the wake of Mackenzie s 1793 expedition  fur trading posts were established west of the Northern Rockies in a region of the northern Interior Plateau of British Columbia which came to be known as New Caledonia  beginning with Fort McLeod  today s community of McLeod Lake  and Fort Fraser  but ultimately focused on Stuart Lake Post  today s Fort St  James   Negotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the Oregon Dispute became important in geopolitical diplomacy between the British Empire and the new American Republic  Disputed joint occupancy by Britain and the U S A   lasted until June 15  1846  when Britain ceded their claims to this land with the Oregon Treaty  In 1841 James Sinclair  Chief Factor of the Hudson s Bay Company  guided some 200 settlers from the Red River Colony west to bolster settlement around Fort Vancouver in an attempt to retain the Columbia District for Britain  The party crossed the Rockies into the Columbia Valley  a region of the Rocky Mountain Trench near present day Radium Hot Springs  British Columbia  then traveled south  Despite such efforts  in 1846  Britain ceded all claim to Columbia District lands south of the 49th parallel to the United States  as resolution to the Oregon boundary dispute by the Oregon Treaty  Cherokee Trail near Fort Collins  Colorado  from a sketch taken 7 June 1859  Thousands passed through the Rocky Mountains on the Oregon Trail beginning in 1842  The Mormons began to settle near the Great Salt Lake in 1847  From 1859 to 1864  gold was discovered in Colorado  Idaho  Montana  and British Columbia  sparking several gold rushes bringing thousands of prospectors and miners to explore every mountain and canyon and to create the Rocky Mountains  first major industry  The Idaho gold rush alone produced more gold than the California and Alaska gold rushes combined and was important in the financing of the Union Army during the American Civil War  The transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869  and Yellowstone National Park was established as the world s first national park in 1872  Meanwhile  a transcontinental railroad in Canada was originally promised in 1871  Though political complications pushed its completion to 1885  the Canadian Pacific Railway eventually followed the Kicking Horse and Rogers Passes to the Pacific Ocean  Canadian railway officials also convinced Parliament to set aside vast areas of the Canadian Rockies as Jasper  Banff  Yoho  and Waterton Lakes National Parks  laying the foundation for a tourism industry which thrives to this day  Glacier National Park  MT  was established with a similar relationship to tourism promotions by the Great Northern Railway  While settlers filled the valleys and mining towns  conservation and preservation ethics began to take hold  U S  President Harrison established several forest reserves in the Rocky Mountains in 1891 1892  In 1905  U S  President Theodore Roosevelt extended the Medicine Bow Forest Reserve to include the area now managed as Rocky Mountain National Park  2  Economic development began to center on mining  forestry  agriculture  and recreation  as well as on the service industries that support them  2  Tents and camps became ranches and farms  forts and train stations became towns  and some towns became cities  2   edit  Economy  edit  Industry and development Economic resources of the Rocky Mountains are varied and abundant  Minerals found in the Rocky Mountains include significant deposits of copper  gold  lead  molybdenum  silver  tungsten  and zinc  The Wyoming Basin and several smaller areas contain significant reserves of coal  natural gas  oil shale  and petroleum  For example  the Climax mine  located near Leadville  Colorado  was the largest producer of Molybdenum in the world  Molybdenum is used in heat resistant steel in such things as cars and planes  The Climax mine employed over 3 000 workers  The Coeur d Alene mine of northern Idaho produces silver  lead  and zinc  Canada s largest coal mines are near Fernie  British Columbia and Sparwood  British Columbia  additional coal mines exist near Hinton  Alberta  2  and in the Northern Rockies surrounding Tumbler Ridge  British Columbia  Abandoned mines with their wakes of mine tailings and toxic wastes dot the Rocky Mountain landscape  In one major example  eighty years of zinc mining profoundly polluted the river and bank near Eagle River in north central Colorado  High concentrations of the metal carried by spring runoff harmed algae  moss  and trout populations  An economic analysis of mining effects at this site revealed declining property values  degraded water quality  and the loss of recreational opportunities  The analysis also revealed that cleanup of the river could yield  2 3 million in additional revenue from recreation  In 1983  the former owner of the zinc mine was sued by the Colorado Attorney General for the  4 8 million cleanup costs  five years later  ecological recovery was considerable  2  13  A drilling rig drills for natural gas just west of the Wind River Range in the Wyoming Rockies The Rocky Mountains contain several sedimentary basins that are rich in coalbed methane  Coalbed methane is natural gas that arises from coal  either through bacterial action  or through exposure to high temperature  Coalbed methane supplies 7 percent of the natural gas used in the United States  The largest coalbed methane sources in the Rocky Mountains are in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and Colorado and the Powder River Basin in Wyoming  These two basins are estimated to contain 38 trillion cubic feet of gas  Coalbed methane can be recovered by dewatering the coal bed  and separating the gas from the water  or injecting water to fracture the coal to release the gas  so called hydraulic fracturing   14  Agriculture and forestry are major industries  Agriculture includes dryland and irrigated farming and livestock grazing  Livestock are frequently moved between high elevation summer pastures and low elevation winter pastures  2  a practice known as transhumance   edit  Tourism Castle Geyser in Yellowstone National Park See also  List of U S  Rocky Mountain ski resorts  List of Alberta ski resorts  List of B C  ski resorts Every year the scenic areas and recreational opportunities of the Rocky Mountains draw millions of tourists  2  The main language of the Rocky Mountains is English  But there are also linguistic pockets of Spanish and Native American languages  French is another official language in Canada s national parks  People from all over the world visit the sites to hike  camp  or engage in mountain sports  2  In the
