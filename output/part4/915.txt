securing Gaelic as an official language of Scotland  commanding  equal respect  with English  11  3 Historically  the use of  Scotch  as an adjective comparable to  Scottish  or  Scots  was commonplace  particularly outwith Scotland  However  the modern use of the term describes only products of Scotland  usually food or drink related  4 Scotland s head of state is the monarch of the United Kingdom  currently Queen Elizabeth II  since 1952   Scotland has limited self government within the United Kingdom as well as representation in the UK Parliament  It is also a UK electoral region for the European Parliament  Certain executive and legislative powers have been devolved to  respectively  the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh  5 Also

Occupying the northern third of the island of Great Britain  it shares a border with England to the south and is bounded by the North Sea to the east  the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west  and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the southwest  In addition to the mainland  Scotland constitutes over 790 islands 15  including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides  Edinburgh  the country s capital and second largest city  is one of Europe s largest financial centres  16  Edinburgh was the hub of the Scottish Enlightenment of the 18th century  which transformed Scotland into one of the commercial  intellectual and industrial powerhouses of Europe  Glasgow  Scotland s largest city  was once one of the world s leading industrial cities and now lies at the centre of the Greater Glasgow conurbation  Scottish waters consist of a large sector 17  of the North Atlantic and the North Sea  containing the largest oil reserves in the European Union  This has given Aberdeen  the third largest city in Scotland  the title of Europe s oil capital  18  The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707  although it had been in a personal union with the kingdoms of England and Ireland since James VI of Scotland succeeded to the English and Irish thrones in 1603  On 1 May 1707  Scotland entered into an incorporating political union with England to create the united Kingdom of Great Britain  19  20  This union resulted from the Treaty of Union agreed in 1706 and enacted by the twin Acts of Union passed by the Parliaments of both countries  despite widespread protest across Scotland  21  22  Scotland s legal system continues to be separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland  and Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in public and in private law  23  The continued existence of legal  educational and religious institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the Union  24  In 1999  a devolved legislature  the Scottish Parliament  was founded with authority over many areas of home affairs following a successful referendum in 1997  In 2011  the Scottish National Party  SNP  won an overall majority in parliament and intends to hold a referendum on independence 25  in the autumn of 2014

Scotland is derived from the Latin Scoti  the term applied to Gaels  people from what is now Scotland and Ireland  and the D l Riata who are thought to have originated from Ireland and migrated to western Scotland  Accordingly  the Late Latin word Scotia   land of the Gaels   was initially used to refer to Ireland  27  By the 11th century at the latest  Scotia was being used to refer to  Gaelic speaking  Scotland north of the river Forth  alongside Albania or Albany  both derived from the Gaelic Alba  28  The use of the words Scots and Scotland to encompass all of what is now Scotland became common in the Late Middle Ages  19  History Main article  History of Scotland Early history Main article  Prehistoric Scotland Repeated glaciations  which covered the entire land mass of modern Scotland  destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the Mesolithic period  It is believed that the first post glacial groups of hunter gatherers arrived in Scotland around 12 800 years ago  as the ice sheet retreated after the last glaciation  29  30  Skara Brae  a Neolithic settlement  located in the Bay of Skaill  Orkney  Groups of settlers began building the first known permanent houses on Scottish soil around 9500 years ago  and the first villages around 6000 years ago  The well preserved village of Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney dates from this period  Neolithic habitation  burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the Northern Isles and Western Isles  where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone  31  The discovery in Scotland of a 4000 year old tomb with burial treasures at Forteviot  near Perth  the capital of a Pictish Kingdom in the 8th and 9th centuries AD  is unrivalled anywhere in Britain  It contains the remains of an early Bronze Age ruler laid out on white quartz pebbles and birch bark  It was also discovered for the first time that early Bronze Age people placed flowers in their graves  32  33  Scotland may have been part of a Late Bronze Age maritime trading culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included the other Celtic nations  England  France  Spain and Portugal  34  35  36  37  Roman influence Main article  Scotland during the Roman Empire The written protohistory of Scotland began with the arrival of the Roman Empire in southern and central Great Britain  when the Romans occupied what is now England and Wales  administering it as a province called Britannia  Roman invasions and occupations of southern Scotland were a series of brief interludes  According to the Roman historian Tacitus  the Caledonians  turned to armed resistance on a large scale   attacking Roman forts and skirmishing with their legions  In a surprise night attack  the Caledonians very nearly wiped out the whole 9th Legion until it was saved by Agricola s cavalry  38  Vallum of the Antonine Wall  near Falkirk In AD 83 84 the general Gnaeus Julius Agricola defeated the Caledonians at the Battle of Mons Graupius  Before the battle Tacitus wrote that the Caledonian leader Calgacus  gave a rousing speech in which he called his people the  last of the free  and accused the Romans of  making the world a desert and calling it peace   38  After the Roman victory Roman forts were briefly set along the Gask Ridge close to the Highland line  only Cawdor near Inverness is known to have been constructed beyond that line   Three years after the battle the Roman armies had withdrawn to the Southern Uplands  39  The Romans erected Hadrian s Wall to control tribes on both sides of the wall  40  and the Limes Britannicus became the northern border of the empire  although the army held the Antonine Wall in the Central Lowlands for two short periods the last of these during the time of Emperor Septimius Severus from 208 until 210  41  The Roman military occupation of a significant part of northern Scotland only lasted about 40 years  although their influence on the southern section of the country  occupied by Brythonic tribes such as the Votadini and Damnonii  would still have been considerable between the first and fifth centuries  The Welsh term Hen Ogledd   Old North   is used by scholars to describe the North of England and South of Scotland during its habitation by Brythonic speaking people around AD 500 to 800  40  In the 400s  Gaels from Ireland established the kingdom of D l Riata  42  43  Medieval period A replica of the Pictish Hilton of Cadboll Stone  Main articles  Scotland in the Early Middle Ages  Scotland in the High Middle Ages  and Scotland in the Late Middle Ages The Kingdom of the Picts  based in Fortriu by the 6th century  was the state that eventually became known as  Alba  or  Scotland   The development of  Pictland   according to the historical model developed by Peter Heather  was a natural response to Roman imperialism  44  Another view places emphasis on the Battle of Dun Nechtain  and the reign of Bridei m  Beli  671 693   with another period of consolidation in the reign of  engus mac Fergusa  732 761   45  The Kingdom of the Picts as it was in the early 8th century  when Bede was writing  was largely the same as the kingdom of the Scots in the reign of Alexander I  1107 1124   However  by the tenth century  the Pictish kingdom was dominated by what we can recognise as Gaelic culture  and had developed a traditional story of an Irish conquest around the ancestor of the contemporary royal dynasty  Cin ed mac Ailp n  Kenneth MacAlpin   2  46  47  From a base of territory in eastern Scotland north of the River Forth and south of the River Oykel  the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the north and south  By the 12th century  the kings of Alba had added to their territories the English speaking land in the south east and attained overlordship of Gaelic speaking Galloway and Norse speaking Caithness  by the end of the 13th century  the kingdom had assumed approximately its modern borders  However  processes of cultural and economic change beginning in the 12th century ensured Scotland looked very different in the later Middle Ages  The impetus for this change was the reign of David I and the Davidian Revolution  Feudalism  government reorganisation and the first legally recognised towns  called burghs  began in this period  These institutions and the immigration of French and Anglo French knights and churchmen facilitated cultural osmosis  whereby the culture and language of the low lying and coastal parts of the kingdom s original territory in the east became  like the newly acquired south east  English speaking  while the rest of the country retained the Gaelic language  apart from the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland  which remained under Norse rule until 1468  48  49  50  The Scottish state entered a largely successful and stable period between the 12th and 14th centuries  there was relative peace with England  trade and educational links were well developed with the Continent and at the height of this cultural flowering John Duns Scotus was one of Europe s most important and influential philosophers  The Wallace Monument commemorates William Wallace  the 13th century Scottish hero  The death of Alexander III in March 1286  followed by that of his granddaughter Margaret  Maid of Norway  broke the centuries old succession line of Scotland s kings and shattered the 200 year golden age that began with David I  Edward I of England was asked to arbitrate between claimants for the Scottish crown  and he organised a process known as the Great Cause to identify the most legitimate claimant  John Balliol was pronounced king in the Great Hall of Berwick Castle on 17 November 1292 and inaugurated at Scone on 30 November  St  Andrew s Day  Edward I  who had coerced recognition as Lord Paramount of Scotland  the feudal superior of the realm  steadily undermined John s authority  51  In 1294 Balliol and other Scottish lords refused Edward s demands to serve in his army against the French  Instead the Scottish parliament sent envoys to France to negotiate an alliance  Scotland and France sealed a treaty on 23 October 1295  that came to be known as the Auld Alliance  1295 1560   War ensued and King John was deposed by Edward who took personal control of Scotland  Andrew Moray and William Wallace initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to English rule in what became known as the Wars of Scottish Independence  1296 1328   52  The nature of the struggle changed significantly when Robert the Bruce  Earl of Carrick  killed rival John Comyn on 10 February 1306 at Greyfriars Kirk in Dumfries  53  He was crowned king  as Robert I  less than seven weeks later  Robert I battled to restore Scottish Independence as King for over 20 years  beginning by winning Scotland back from the Norman English invaders piece by piece  Victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 proved that the Scots had regained control of their kingdom  In 1315 Edward Bruce  brother of the King  was briefly appointed High King of Ireland during an ultimately unsuccessful Scottish invasion of Ireland aimed at strengthening Scotland s position in its wars against England  In 1320 the world s first documented declaration of independence  the Declaration of Arbroath  won the support of Pope John XXII  leading to the legal recognition of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown  However  war with England continued for several decades after the death of Bruce  and a civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long term Comyn Balliol rivals lasted until the middle of the 14th century  Although the Bruce dynasty was successful  David II s lack of an heir allowed his half nephew Robert II to come to the throne and establish the Stuart Dynasty  49  54  The Stewarts ruled Scotland for the remainder of the Middle Ages  The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the Reformation  The Education Act of 1496 made Scotland the first country since Sparta in classical Greece to implement a system of general public education  55  This was despite continual warfare with England  the increasing division between Highlands and Lowlands  and a large number of royal minorities  54  56  This period was the height of the Franco Scottish alliance  The Scots Guard   la Garde  cossaise   was founded in 1418 by Charles VII of France  The Scots soldiers of the Garde  cossaise fought alongside Joan of Arc against England during the Hundred Years War  57  In March 1421 a Franco Scots force under John Stewart  2nd Earl of Buchan  and Gilbert de Lafayette  defeated a larger English army at the Battle of Baug   Three years later  at the Battle of Verneuil  the Scots lost around 6000 men  but the Scottish intervention bought France valuable time and likely saved the country from defeat  58  Early modern era Main article  Scotland in the Early Modern Era In 1502  James IV of Scotland signed the Treaty of Perpetual Peace with Henry VII of England  He also married Henry s daughter  Margaret Tudor  setting the stage for the Union of the Crowns  For Henry  the marriage into one of Europe s most established monarchies gave legitimacy to the new Tudor royal line  59  A decade later James made the fateful decision to invade England in support of France under the terms of the Auld Alliance  He was the last British monarch to die in battle  at the Battle of Flodden  60  Within a generation the Auld Alliance was ended by the Treaty of Edinburgh  France agreed to withdraw all land and naval forces and in the same year  1560  the revolution of John Knox achieved its ultimate goal of convincing the Scottish parliament to revoke papal authority in Scotland  61 Mary  Queen of Scots  a Catholic and former queen of France  was forced to abdicate in 1567  62  David Morier s depiction of the Battle of Culloden  In 1603  James VI  King of Scots inherited the thrones of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Ireland  and became King James I of England and Ireland  and left Edinburgh for London  63  With the exception of a short period under the Protectorate  Scotland remained a separate state  but there was considerable conflict between the crown and the Covenanters over the form of church government  The Glorious Revolution of 1688 89 saw the overthrow of the King James II of England by the English Parliament in favour of William and Mary  As late as the 1690s  Scotland experienced famine  which reduced the population of parts of the country by at least 20 percent  64  In 1698  the Scots attempted an ambitious project to secure a trading colony on the Isthmus of Panama  Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare is said to have invested in the Darien scheme  Its failure bankrupted these landowners  but not the burghs  which remained cash rich  Nevertheless  the nobles  bankruptcy  along with the threat of an English invasion  played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England  65  66  On 22 July 1706  the Treaty of Union was agreed between representatives of the Scots Parliament and the Parliament of England and the following year twin Acts of Union were passed by both parliaments to create the united Kingdom of Great Britain with effect from 1 May 1707  20  18th century With trade tariffs with England now abolished  trade blossomed  especially with Colonial America  The clippers belonging to the Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia  Until the American War of Independence in 1776  Glasgow was the world s premier tobacco port  dominating world trade  67  The disparity between the wealth of the merchant classes of the Scottish Lowlands and the ancient clans of the Scottish Highlands grew  amplifying centuries of division  St  Kildans sitting on the village street  1886  The deposed Jacobite Stuart claimants had remained popular in the Highlands and north east  particularly amongst non Presbyterians  However  two major Jacobite risings launched in 1715 and 1745 failed to remove the House of Hanover from the British throne  The threat of the Jacobite movement to the United Kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the Battle of Culloden  Great Britain s last pitched battle  This defeat paved the way for large scale removals of the indigenous populations of the Highlands and Islands  known as the Highland Clearances  The Scottish Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution made Scotland into an intellectual  commercial and industrial powerhouse  68  So much so that Voltaire said  We look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilisation   69  With the demise of Jacobitism and the advent of the Union thousands of Scots  mainly Lowlanders  took up numerous positions of power in politics  civil service  the army and navy  trade  economics  colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent British Empire  Historian Neil Davidson notes that  after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life  particularly outside Scotland   Davidson also states that  far from being  peripheral  to the British economy  Scotland   or more precisely  the Lowlands   lay at its core   70  19th century Scotland became known across the world for its excellence in engineering  as typified by the Clyde built ships and locomotives built in Glasgow  Prefabricated cast iron buildings made in Scotland are still in use in India  South America and Australia  71  Prominent scientists  engineers and architects of the industrial age included David Dale  Joseph Black  Thomas Telford  Robert Stevenson  James Watt  James Nasmyth  Robert Adam and John MacAdam  Scottish diaspora Scots born migrants also played a leading role in the foundation and principles of the United States  John Witherspoon  John Paul Jones  Andrew Carnegie  John Muir   72  Canada  John A MacDonald  James Murray  Tommy Douglas   73  Australia  Lachlan Macquarie  Thomas Brisbane  Andrew Fisher   74  and New Zealand  James Mckenzie  Peter Fraser   75  20th century First and Second World Wars Royal Scots with captured Japanese flag  Burma  January 1945  Scotland played a major role in the British effort in the First World War  It especially provided manpower  ships  machinery  fish and money  76  With a population of 4 8 million in 1911  Scotland sent over half a million men to the war  of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease  and 150 000 were seriously wounded  77 Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was Britain s commander on the Western Front  The war saw the emergence of a radical movement called  Red Clydeside  led by militant trades unionists  Formerly a Liberal stronghold  the industrial districts switched to Labour by 1922  with a base among the Irish Catholic working class districts  Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues  However  the  Reds  operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s  78  The shipbuilding industry expanded by a third and expected renewed prosperity  but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 and it did not fully recover until 1939  The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas  and high unemployment  79  Indeed  the war brought with it deep social  cultural  economic  and political dislocations  Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension  as the main social indicators such as poor health  bad housing  and long term mass unemployment  pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best  or even a downward spiral  Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people  who left Scotland permanently  The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem  and no one offered workable solutions  The despair reflected what Finlay  1994  describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralized government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War  80  The Second World War brought renewed prosperity  despite extensive bombing of cities by the Luftwaffe  It saw the invention of radar by Robert Watson Watt  which was invaluable in the Battle of Britain as was the leadership at RAF Fighter Command of Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding  81  Since 1945 After 1945  Scotland s economic situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition  inefficient industry  and industrial disputes  82  Only in recent decades has the country enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance  Economic factors that have contributed to this recovery include a resurgent financial services industry  electronics manufacturing   see Silicon Glen   83  and the North Sea oil and gas industry  84  The introduction in 1989 by Margaret Thatcher s government of the Community Charge  widely known as the Poll Tax  one year before the rest of the United Kingdom  contributed to a growing movement for a return to direct Scottish control over domestic affairs  85  Following a referendum on devolution proposals in 1997  the Scotland Act 1998 86  was passed by the United Kingdom Parliament to establish a devolved Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government with responsibility for most laws specific to Scotland  87  Government and politics Main articles  Politics of Scotland  Scottish Parliament  and Scottish Government The 2011 cabinet of the Scottish Government Scotland s head of state is the monarch of the United Kingdom  currently Queen Elizabeth II  since 1952   The title Elizabeth II caused controversy around the time of the queen s coronation  as there had never been an Elizabeth I in Scotland  A legal case  MacCormick v  Lord Advocate  1953 SC 396   was taken to contest the right of the Queen to title herself Elizabeth II within Scotland  arguing that to do so would be a breach of Article 1 of the Treaty of Union  The Lord Advocate won the case and it was decided that future British monarchs would be numbered according to either their English or Scottish predecessors  whichever number is higher  88  Hence  any future King James would be styled James VIII  since the last Scottish King James was James VII  also James II of England  etc    while the next King Henry would be King Henry IX throughout the UK despite the fact that there have been no Scottish kings of the name  Scotland has partial self government within the United Kingdom as well as representation in the UK Parliament  Executive and legislative powers have been devolved to  respectively  the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh  The United Kingdom Parliament retains power over a set list of areas explicitly specified in the Scotland Act 1998 as reserved matters  including  for example  levels of UK taxes  social security  defence  international relations and broadcasting  89  The Scottish Parliament has legislative authority for all other areas relating to Scotland  as well as limited power to vary income tax  Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown  in a BBC Scotland interview  indicated that the Scottish Parliament could be given more tax raising powers  90  The Scottish Parliament can give legislative consent over devolved matters back to Westminster by passing a Legislative Consent Motion if United Kingdom wide legislation is considered to be more appropriate for a certain issue  The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence in the provision of public services compared to the rest of the United Kingdom  For instance  the costs of a university education  and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland  while fees are paid in the rest of the UK  Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places  91  The debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament Building The Scottish Parliament is a unicameral legislature comprising 129 Members  73 of whom represent individual constituencies and are elected on a first past the post system  56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the additional member system  serving for a four year period  The Queen appoints one Member of the Scottish Parliament   MSP   on the nomination of the Parliament  to be First Minister  Other Ministers are also appointed by the First Minister and serve at his her discretion  together they make up the Scottish Government  the executive arm of government  92  In the 2011 election  the Scottish National Party  SNP  formed a majority government after winning 69 of the 129 seat Parliament  This was the first majority government since the modern post devolutionary Scottish Parliament was established in 1999  The leader of the SNP  Alex Salmond  continued as First Minister  The Labour Party continued as the largest opposition party  with the Conservative Party  the Liberal Democrats  and the Green Party also represented in the Parliament  Margo MacDonald is the only independent MSP sitting in Parliament  The next Scottish Parliament general election will be held on 5 May 2016  The Scotland Bill  put forward by the Calman Commission and cleared by the UK House of Commons  proposes devolving more power to Scotland  The bill has yet to be put into legislation  The Scottish National Party  who did not take part in the consultation  believe the bill does not devolve enough powers to the Scottish Parliament  93  Scotland is represented in the British House of Commons by 59 MPs elected from territory based Scottish constituencies  The Scotland Office represents the UK government in Scotland on reserved matters and represents Scottish interests within the UK government  94  The Scotland office is led by the Secretary of State for Scotland  who sits in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom  the current incumbent being Michael Moore  Administrative subdivisions Main article  Subdivisions of Scotland Glasgow City Chambers  viewed from George Square Historical subdivisions of Scotland included the mormaerdom  stewartry  earldom  burgh  parish  county and regions and districts  These names are still sometimes used as geographical descriptors  Modern Scotland is subdivided in various ways depending on the purpose  For local government  there have been 32 council areas since 1996  95  whose councils are unitary authorities responsible for the provision of all local government services  Community councils are informal organisations that represent specific sub divisions of a council area  For the Scottish Parliament  there are 73 constituencies and eight regions  For the Parliament of the United Kingdom  there are 59 constituencies  The Scottish fire brigades and police forces are still based on the system of regions introduced in 1975  For healthcare and postal districts  and a number of other governmental and non governmental organisations such as the churches  there are other long standing methods of subdividing Scotland for the purposes of administration  City status in the United Kingdom is conferred by letters patent  96  There are seven cities in Scotland  Aberdeen  Dundee  Edinburgh  Glasgow  Inverness  Stirling and Perth  97  Scotland within the UK The welcome sign at the Scottish border on the A1  A policy of devolution had been advocated by the three main UK parties with varying enthusiasm during recent history  The late Labour leader John Smith described the revival of a Scottish parliament as the  settled will of the Scottish people   98  The constitutional status of Scotland is nonetheless subject to ongoing debate  In 2007  the Scottish Government established a  National Conversation  on constitutional issues  proposing a number of options such as increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament  federalism  or a referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom  In rejecting the last option  the three main opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament have proposed a separate Scottish Constitutional Commission to investigate the distribution of powers between devolved Scottish and UK wide bodies  99  In August 2009 the SNP proposed a referendum bill to hold a referendum on independence in November 2010  Immediate opposition from all other major parties led to an expected defeat  100  101  These plans were put on hold by the Scottish National Party until after the 2011 Scottish Parliament elections  102  With the outcome of the May 2011 elections allowing an SNP majority in the Scottish Parliament  a referendum on Scotland s future within the UK is to be held in Autumn 2014  with the Scottish Government launching its consultation on 25 January 2012  Law and criminal justice Main article  Scots law Parliament House  in Edinburgh  is the home of the Court of Session  Scots law has a basis derived from Roman law  103  combining features of both uncodified civil law  dating back to the Corpus Juris Civilis  and common law with medieval sources  The terms of the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 guaranteed the continued existence of a separate legal system in Scotland from that of England and Wales  104  Prior to 1611  there were several regional law systems in Scotland  most notably Udal law in Orkney and Shetland  based on old Norse law  Various other systems derived from common Celtic or Brehon laws survived in the Highlands until the 1800s  105  Scots law provides for three types of courts responsible for the administration of justice  civil  criminal and heraldic  The supreme civil court is the Court of Session  although civil appeals can be taken to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom  or before 1 October 2009  the House of Lords   The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court in Scotland  The Court of Session is housed at Parliament House  in Edinburgh  which was the home of the pre Union Parliament of Scotland with the High Court of Justiciary and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at the Lawnmarket  The sheriff court is the main criminal and civil court  hearing most of the cases  There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country  106 District courts were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims  The Court of the Lord Lyon regulates heraldry  For many decades the Scots legal system was unique for a period in being the only legal system without a parliament  This ended with the advent of the Scottish Parliament  which legislates for Scotland  Many features within the system have been preserved  Within criminal law  the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts   guilty    not guilty  and  not proven   Both  not guilty  and  not proven  result in an acquittal with no possibility of retrial  107  Many laws differ between Scotland and the rest of Britain  whereas many terms differ  Manslaughter  in England and Wales  becomes culpable homicide in Scotland  and arson becomes wilful fireraising  Procedure also differs  Scots juries consist of fifteen  not twelve jurors as is more common in English speaking countries  The civil legal system has however attracted much recent criticism from a senior Scottish Judge who referred to it as being  Victorian  and antiquated  108  The Scottish Prison Service  SPS  manages the prisons in Scotland  which collectively house over 8 500 prisoners  109  The Cabinet Secretary for Justice is responsible for the Scottish Prison Service within the Scottish Government  Geography and natural history Main article  Geography of Scotland Loch Tummel in Perth and Kinross The mainland of Scotland comprises the northern third of the land mass of the island of Great Britain  which lies off the northwest coast of Continental Europe  The total area is 78 772 km2  30 414 sq mi   110  comparable to the size of the Czech Republic  Scotland s only land border is with England  and runs for 96 kilometres  60 mi  between the basin of the River Tweed on the east coast and the Solway Firth in the west  The Atlantic Ocean borders the west coast and the North Sea is to the east  The island of Ireland lies only 30 kilometres  19 mi  from the southwestern peninsula of Kintyre  111  Norway is 305 kilometres  190 mi  to the east and the Faroes  270 kilometres  168 mi  to the north  The territorial extent of Scotland is generally that established by the 1237 Treaty of York between Scotland and the Kingdom of England 112  and the 1266 Treaty of Perth between Scotland and Norway  20  Important exceptions include the Isle of Man  which having been lost to England in the 14th century is now a crown dependency outside of the United Kingdom  the island groups Orkney and Shetland  which were acquired from Norway in 1472  110  and Berwick upon Tweed  lost to England in 1482  The geographical centre of Scotland lies a few miles from the village of Newtonmore in Badenoch  113  Rising to 1 344 metres  4 409 ft  above sea level  Scotland s highest point is the summit of Ben Nevis  in Lochaber  while Scotland s longest river  the River Tay  flows for a distance of 190 kilometres  118 mi   114  115  Geology and geomorphology Main article  Geology of Scotland Relief map of Scotland The whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and the landscape is much affected by glaciation  From a geological perspective the country has three main sub divisions  Highlands and islands The Highlands and Islands lie to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault  which runs from Arran to Stonehaven  This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the Cambrian and Precambrian  which were uplifted during the later Caledonian Orogeny  It is interspersed with igneous intrusions of a more recent age  the remnants of which have formed mountain massifs such as the Cairngorms and Skye Cuillins  A significant exception to the above are the fossil bearing beds of Old Red Sandstones found principally along the Moray Firth coast  The Highlands are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here  Scotland has over 790 islands  which are divided into four main groups  Shetland  Orkney  and the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides  There are numerous bodies of freshwater including Loch Lomond and Loch Ness  Some parts of the coastline consist of machair  a low lying dune pasture land  Central lowlands The Central Lowlands is a rift valley mainly comprising Paleozoic formations  Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland s industrial revolution are to be found  This area has also experienced intense volcanism  Arthur s Seat in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano  This area is relatively low lying  although even here hills such as the Ochils and Campsie Fells are rarely far from view  Southern uplands The Southern Uplands are a range of hills almost 200 kilometres  124 mi  long  interspersed with broad valleys  They lie south of a second fault line  the Southern Uplands fault  that runs from Girvan to Dunbar  116  117  118  119  The geological foundations largely comprise Silurian deposits laid down some 4 500 million years ago  The high point of the Southern Uplands is Merrick with an elevation of 843 m  2 766 ft   19  120  121  122  The Southern Uplands is home to the UK s highest village  Wanlockhead  430 m 1 411 ft above sea level   119  Climate Main article  Climate of Scotland Tiree  one of the sunniest locations in Scotland The climate of Scotland is temperate and oceanic  and tends to be very changeable  It is warmed by the Gulf Stream from the Atlantic  and as such has much milder winters  but cooler  wetter summers  than areas on similar latitudes  for example Labrador  Moscow  or the Kamchatka Peninsula on the opposite side of Eurasia  However  temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK  with the coldest ever UK temperature of  27 2  C   16 96  F  recorded at Braemar in the Grampian Mountains  on 11 February 1895  123  Winter maximums average 6  C  42 8  F  in the lowlands  with summer maximums averaging 18  C  64 4  F   The highest temperature recorded was 32 9  C  91 22  F  at Greycrook  Scottish Borders on 9 August 2003  124  In general  the west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east  owing to the influence of Atlantic ocean currents and the colder surface temperatures of the North Sea  Tiree  in the Inner Hebrides  is one of the sunniest places in the country  it had more than 300 hours of sunshine in May 1975  124  Rainfall varies widely across Scotland  The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest place  with annual rainfall exceeding 3 000 mm  118 1 in   125  In comparison  much of lowland Scotland receives less than 800 mm  31 5 in  annually  126  Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands  but becomes more common with altitude  Braemar experiences an average of 59 snow days per year  127  while many coastal areas average fewer than 10 days of lying snow per annum  126  Flora and fauna Main articles  Fauna of Scotland and Flora of Scotland Mountain Hare Scotland s wildlife is typical of the north west of Europe  although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx  brown bear  wolf  elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times  There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as gannets  128  The golden eagle is something of a national icon  129  On the high mountain tops species including ptarmigan  mountain hare and stoat can be seen in their white colour phase during winter months  130  Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist 131  and within these areas the Scottish crossbill  the UK s only endemic bird species and vertebrate  can be found alongside capercaillie  wildcat  red squirrel and pine marten  132  133  134  In recent years various animals have been re introduced  including the white tailed sea eagle in 1975  the red kite in the 1980s  135  136  and more recently there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar  137  138  The flora of the country is varied incorporating both deciduous and coniferous woodland and moorland and tundra species  However  large scale commercial tree planting and the management of upland moorland habitat for the grazing of sheep and commercial field sport activities impacts upon the distribution of indigenous plants and animals  139  The UK s tallest tree is a grand fir planted beside Loch Fyne  Argyll in the 1870s  and the Fortingall Yew may be 5 000 years old and is probably the oldest living thing in Europe  140  141  142  Although the number of native vascular plants is low by world standards  Scotland s substantial bryophyte flora is of global importance  143  144  Economy and infrastructure Main article  Economy of Scotland A drilling rig located in the North Sea Scotland has a western style open mixed economy that is closely linked with the rest of Europe and the wider world  Traditionally  the Scottish economy has been dominated by heavy industry underpinned by the shipbuilding in Glasgow  coal mining and steel industries  Petroleum related industries associated with the extraction of North Sea oil have also been important employers from the 1970s  especially in the north east of Scotland  De industrialisation during the 1970s and 1980s saw a shift from a manufacturing focus towards a more service oriented economy  Edinburgh is the financial services centre of Scotland and the sixth largest financial centre in Europe in terms of funds under

this honour falls to Glasgow  The Greater Glasgow conurbation  with a population of almost 1 2 million  is home to nearly a quarter of Scotland s population  159  The Central Belt is where most of the main towns and cities are located  Glasgow is to the west  while Edinburgh and Dundee lie on the east coast  with Perth  its city status restored in 2012  lying 20 miles upstream on the River Tay from Dundee  Scotland s only major city outside the Central Belt is Aberdeen  on the east coast to the north  The Highlands are sparsely populated  although the city of Inverness has experienced rapid growth in recent years  In general only the more accessible and larger islands retain human populations  and fewer than 90 are currently inhabited  The Southern Uplands are essentially rural in nature and dominated by agriculture and forestry  160  161  Because of housing problems in Glasgow and Edinburgh  five new towns were created between 1947 and 1966  They are East Kilbride  Glenrothes
