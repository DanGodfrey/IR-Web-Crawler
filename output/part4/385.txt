1789 with the convocation of the Estates General in May  The first year of the Revolution saw members of the Third Estate proclaiming the Tennis Court Oath in June  the assault on the Bastille in July  the passage of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August  and an epic march on Versailles that forced the royal court back to Paris in October  The next few years were dominated by tensions between various liberal assemblies and a right wing monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms  A republic was proclaimed in September 1792 and King Louis XVI was executed the next year  External threats also played a dominant role in the development of the Revolution  The French Revolutionary Wars started in 1792 and ultimately featured spectacular French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula  the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine   achievements that had defied previous French governments for centuries  Internally  popular sentiments radicalized the Revolution significantly  culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins and virtual dictatorship by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror from 1793 until 1794 during which between 16 000 and 40 000 people were killed  1  After the fall of the Jacobins and the execution of Robespierre  the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 and held power until 1799  when it was replaced by the Consulate under Napoleon Bonaparte  After the Napoleonic Wars and ensuing rise and fall of Napoleon s First French Empire  a restoration of absolutist monarchy was followed by two further successful smaller revolutions  1830 and 1848   This meant the 19th century and process of modern France taking shape saw France again

government of King Louis XVI of France faced a fiscal crisis in the 1780s  Adherents of most historical models identify many of the same features of the Ancien R gime as being among the causes of the Revolution  Economic factors included hunger and malnutrition in the most destitute segments of the population  due to rising bread prices  from a normal 8 sous for a four pound loaf to 12 sous by the end of 1789   3  after several years of poor grain harvests  Bad harvests  caused in part by extreme weather from El Ni o along with volcanic activity at Laki and Gr msv tn in 1783 1784   rising food prices  and an inadequate transportation system that hindered the shipment of bulk foods from rural areas to large population centers contributed greatly to the destabilization of French society in the years leading up to the Revolution  Another cause was the state s effective bankruptcy due to the enormous cost of previous wars  particularly the financial strain caused by French participation in the American Revolutionary War  The national debt amounted to some 1 000 2 000 million citation needed livres  The social burdens caused by war included the huge war debt  made worse by the loss of France s colonial possessions in North America and the growing commercial dominance of Great Britain  France s inefficient and antiquated financial system was unable to manage the national debt  something which was both partially caused and exacerbated by the burden of an inadequate system of taxation  To obtain new money to head off default on the government s loans  the king called an Assembly of Notables in 1787  Meanwhile  the royal court at Versailles was seen as being isolated from  and indifferent to  the hardships of the lower classes  While in theory King Louis XVI was an absolute monarch  in practice he was often indecisive and known to back down when faced with strong opposition  While he did reduce government expenditures  opponents in the parlements successfully thwarted his attempts at enacting much needed reforms  Those who were opposed to Louis  policies further undermined royal authority by distributing pamphlets  often reporting false or exaggerated information  that criticized the government and its officials  stirring up public opinion against the monarchy  4  Many other factors involved resentments and aspirations given focus by the rise of Enlightenment ideals  These included resentment of royal absolutism  resentment by peasants  laborers and the bourgeoisie toward the traditional seigneurial privileges possessed by the nobility  resentment of the Church s influence over public policy and institutions  aspirations for freedom of religion  resentment of aristocratic bishops by the poorer rural clergy  aspirations for social  political and economic equality  and  especially as the Revolution progressed  republicanism  hatred of Queen Marie Antoinette  who was falsely accused of being a spendthrift and an Austrian spy  and anger toward the King for firing finance minister Jacques Necker  among others  who were popularly seen as representatives of the people  5  Pre revolution Financial crisis Caricature of the Third Estate carrying the First Estate  clergy  and the Second Estate  nobility  on its back  Louis XVI ascended to the throne amidst a financial crisis  the state was nearing bankruptcy and outlays outpaced income  6  This was because of France s financial obligations stemming from involvement in the Seven Years War and its participation in the American Revolutionary War  7  In May 1776  finance minister Turgot was dismissed  after he failed to enact reforms  The next year  Jacques Necker  a foreigner  was appointed Comptroller General of Finance  He could not be made an official minister because he was a Protestant  8  Necker realized that the country s extremely regressive tax system subjected the lower classes to a heavy burden  8  while numerous exemptions existed for the nobility and clergy  9  He argued that the country could not be taxed higher  that tax exemptions for the nobility and clergy must be reduced  and proposed that borrowing more money would solve the country s fiscal shortages  Necker published a report to support this claim that underestimated the deficit by roughly 36 million livres  and proposed restricting the power of the parlements  8  This was not received well by the King s ministers and Necker  hoping to bolster his position  argued to be made a minister  The King refused  Necker was fired  and Charles Alexandre de Calonne was appointed to the Comptrollership  8  Calonne initially spent liberally  but he quickly realized the critical financial situation and proposed a new tax code  10  The proposal included a consistent land tax  which would include taxation of the nobility and clergy  Faced with opposition from the parlements  Calonne organised the summoning of the Assembly of Notables  But the Assembly failed to endorse Calonne s proposals and instead weakened his position through its criticism  In response  the King announced the calling of the Estates General for May 1789  the first time the body had been summoned since 1614  This was a signal that the Bourbon monarchy was in a weakened state and subject to the demands of its people  11  Estates General of 1789 Main article  Estates General of 1789 The Estates General was organized into three estates  the clergy  the nobility  and the rest of France  12  On the last occasion that the Estates General had met  in 1614  each estate held one vote  and any two could override the third  The Parlement of Paris feared the government would attempt to gerrymander an assembly to rig the results  Thus  they required that the Estates be arranged as in 1614  13  The 1614 rules differed from practices of local assemblies  where each member had one vote and third estate membership was doubled  For example  in the Dauphin  the provincial assembly agreed to double the number of members of the third estate  hold membership elections  and allow one vote per member  rather than one vote per estate  14  The  Committee of Thirty   a body of liberal Parisians  began to agitate against voting by estate  This group  largely composed of the wealthy  argued for the Estates General to assume the voting mechanisms of Dauphin   They argued that ancient precedent was not sufficient  because  the people were sovereign   15  Necker convened a Second Assembly of Notables  which rejected the notion of double representation by a vote of 111 to 333  15  The King  however  agreed to the proposition on 27 December  but he left discussion of the weight of each vote to the Estates General itself  16  Elections were held in the spring of 1789  suffrage requirements for the Third Estate were for French born or naturalised males only  at least 25 years of age  who resided where the vote was to take place and who paid taxes  Pour  tre  lecteur du tiers  tat  il faut avoir 25 ans   tre fran ais ou naturalis    tre domicili  au lieu de vote et compris au r le des impositions  17  Strong turnout produced 1 201 delegates  including   291 nobles  300 clergy  and 610 members of the Third Estate   16  To lead delegates   Books of grievances   cahiers de dol ances  were compiled to list problems  12  The books articulated ideas which would have seemed radical only months before  however  most supported the monarchical system in general  Many assumed the Estates General would approve future taxes  and Enlightenment ideals were relatively rare  13  18  Pamphlets by liberal nobles and clergy became widespread after the lifting of press censorship  15  The Abb  Siey s  a theorist and Catholic clergyman  argued the paramount importance of the Third Estate in the pamphlet Qu est ce que le tiers  tat    What is the Third Estate     published in January 1789  He asserted   What is the Third Estate  Everything  What has it been until now in the political order  Nothing  What does it want to be  Something   13  19  The meeting of the Estates General on 5 May 1789 in Versailles  The Estates General convened in the Grands Salles des Menus Plaisirs in Versailles on 5 May 1789 and opened with a three hour speech by Necker  The Third Estate demanded that the verification of deputies  credentials should be undertaken in common by all deputies  rather than each estate verifying the credentials of its own members internally  negotiations with the other estates failed to achieve this  18  The commoners appealed to the clergy who replied they required more time  Necker asserted that each estate verify credentials and  the king was to act as arbitrator   20  Negotiations with the other two estates to achieve this  however  were unsuccessful  21  National Assembly  1789  Main article  National Assembly  French Revolution  The National Assembly taking the Tennis Court Oath  sketch by Jacques Louis David   On 10 June 1789  Abb  Siey s moved that the Third Estate  now meeting as the Communes  English   Commons    proceed with verification of its own powers and invite the other two estates to take part  but not to wait for them  They proceeded to do so two days later  completing the process on 17 June  22  Then they voted a measure far more radical  declaring themselves the National Assembly  an assembly not of the Estates but of  the People   They invited the other orders to join them  but made it clear they intended to conduct the nation s affairs with or without them  23  In an attempt to keep control of the process and prevent the Assembly from convening  Louis XVI ordered the closure of the Salle des  tats where the Assembly met  making an excuse that the carpenters needed to prepare the hall for a royal speech in two days  Weather did not allow an outdoor meeting  so the Assembly moved their deliberations to a nearby indoor real tennis court  where they proceeded to swear the Tennis Court Oath  20 June 1789   under which they agreed not to separate until they had given France a constitution  24  A majority of the representatives of the clergy soon joined them  as did 47 members of the nobility  By 27 June  the royal party had overtly given in  although the military began to arrive in large numbers around Paris and Versailles  Messages of support for the Assembly poured in from Paris and other French cities  24  National Constituent Assembly  1789 1791  Main article  National Constituent Assembly Storming of the Bastille Main article  Storming of the Bastille By this time  Necker had earned the enmity of many members of the French court for his overt manipulation of public opinion  Marie Antoinette  the King s younger brother the Comte d Artois  and other conservative members of the King s privy council urged him to dismiss Necker as financial advisor  On 11 July 1789  after Necker published an inaccurate account of the government s debts and made it available to the public  the King fired him  and completely restructured the finance ministry at the same time  25  Many Parisians presumed Louis s actions to be aimed against the Assembly and began open rebellion when they heard the news the next day  They were also afraid that arriving soldiers   mostly foreign mercenaries   had been summoned to shut down the National Constituent Assembly  The Assembly  meeting at Versailles  went into nonstop session to prevent another eviction from their meeting place  Paris was soon consumed by riots  chaos  and widespread looting  The mobs soon had the support of some of the French Guard  who were armed and trained soldiers  26  The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 26 August 1789 On 14 July  the insurgents set their eyes on the large weapons and ammunition cache inside the Bastille fortress  which was also perceived to be a symbol of royal power  After several hours of combat  the prison fell that afternoon  Despite ordering a cease fire  which prevented a mutual massacre  Governor Marquis Bernard de Launay was beaten  stabbed and decapitated  his head was placed on a pike and paraded about the city  Although the fortress had held only seven prisoners  four forgers  two noblemen kept for immoral behavior  and a murder suspect   the Bastille served as a potent symbol of everything hated under the Ancien R gime  Returning to the H tel de Ville  city hall   the mob accused the pr v t des marchands  roughly  mayor  Jacques de Flesselles of treachery and butchered him  27  The King  alarmed by the violence  backed down  at least for the time being  The Marquis de la Fayette took up command of the National Guard at Paris  Jean Sylvain Bailly  president of the Assembly at the time of the Tennis Court Oath  became the city s mayor under a new governmental structure known as the commune  The King visited Paris  where  on 17 July he accepted a tricolore cockade  to cries of Vive la Nation   Long live the Nation   and Vive le Roi   Long live the King    28  Necker was recalled to power  but his triumph was short lived  An astute financier but a less astute politician  Necker overplayed his hand by demanding and obtaining a general amnesty  losing much of the people s favour  As civil authority rapidly deteriorated  with random acts of violence and theft breaking out across the country  members of the nobility  fearing for their safety  fled to neighboring countries  many of these  migr s  as they were called  funded counter revolutionary causes within France and urged foreign monarchs to offer military support to a counter revolution  29  By late July  the spirit of popular sovereignty had spread throughout France  In rural areas  many commoners began to form militias and arm themselves against a foreign invasion  some attacked the ch teaux of the nobility as part of a general agrarian insurrection known as  la Grande Peur    the Great Fear    In addition  wild rumours and paranoia caused widespread unrest and civil disturbances that contributed to the collapse of law and order  30  Working toward a constitution Main article  French Revolution from the abolition of feudalism to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy On 4 August 1789  the National Constituent Assembly abolished feudalism  although at that point there had been sufficient peasant revolts to almost end feudalism already   in what is known as the August Decrees  sweeping away both the seigneurial rights of the Second Estate and the tithes gathered by the First Estate  In the course of a few hours  nobles  clergy  towns  provinces  companies and cities lost their special privileges  On 26 August 1789  the Assembly published the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen  which comprised a statement of principles rather than a constitution with legal effect  The National Constituent Assembly functioned not only as a legislature  but also as a body to draft a new constitution  Necker  Mounier  Lally Tollendal and others argued unsuccessfully for a senate  with members appointed by the crown on the nomination of the people  The bulk of the nobles argued for an aristocratic upper house elected by the nobles  The popular party carried the day  France would have a single  unicameral assembly  The King retained only a  suspensive veto   he could delay the implementation of a law  but not block it absolutely  The Assembly eventually replaced the historic provinces with 83 d partements  uniformly administered and roughly equal in area and population  Amid the Assembly s preoccupation with constitutional affairs  the financial crisis had continued largely unaddressed  and the deficit had only increased  Honor  Mirabeau now led the move to address this matter  and the Assembly gave Necker complete financial dictatorship  Women s March on Versailles Main article  The Women s March on Versailles Engraving of the Women s March on Versailles  5 October 1789 Fueled by rumors of a reception for the King s bodyguards on 1 October 1789 at which the national cockade had been trampled upon  on 5 October 1789 crowds of women began to assemble at Parisian markets  The women first marched to the H tel de Ville  demanding that city officials address their concerns  31  The women were responding to the harsh economic situations they faced  especially bread shortages  They also demanded an end to royal efforts to block the National Assembly  and for the King and his administration to move to Paris as a sign of good faith in addressing the widespread poverty  Getting unsatisfactory responses from city officials  as many as 7 000 women joined the march to Versailles  bringing with them cannons and a variety of smaller weapons  Twenty thousand National Guardsmen under the command of La Fayette responded to keep order  and members of the mob stormed the palace  killing several guards  32  La Fayette ultimately persuaded the king to accede to the demand of the crowd that the monarchy relocate to Paris  On 6 October 1789  the King and the royal family moved from Versailles to Paris under the  protection  of the National Guards  thus legitimizing the National Assembly  Revolution and the Church Main articles  Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution and Civil Constitution of the Clergy In this caricature  monks and nuns enjoy their new freedom after the decree of 16 February 1790 The Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Roman Catholic Church to the state  Under the Ancien R gime  the Church had been the largest single landowner in the country  owning about 10  of the land in the kingdom  33  The Church was exempt from paying taxes to the government  while it levied a tithe a 10  tax on income  often collected in the form of crops on the general population  which it then redistributed to the poor  33  The power and wealth of the Church was highly resented by some groups  A small minority of Protestants living in France  such as the Huguenots  wanted an anti Catholic regime and revenge against the clergy who discriminated against them  Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire helped fuel this resentment by denigrating the Catholic Church and destabilizing the French monarchy  34  As historian John McManners argues   In eighteenth century France throne and altar were commonly spoken of as in close alliance  their simultaneous collapse     would one day provide the final proof of their interdependence   35  This resentment toward the Church weakened its power during the opening of the Estates General in May 1789  The Church composed the First Estate with 130 000 members of the clergy  When the National Assembly was later created in June 1789 by the Third Estate  the clergy voted to join them  which perpetuated the destruction of the Estates General as a governing body  36  The National Assembly began to enact social and economic reform  Legislation sanctioned on 4 August 1789 abolished the Church s authority to impose the tithe  In an attempt to address the financial crisis  the Assembly declared  on 2 November 1789  that the property of the Church was  at the disposal of the nation   37  They used this property to back a new currency  the assignats  Thus  the nation had now also taken on the responsibility of the Church  which included paying the clergy  caring for the poor  the sick and the orphaned  38  In December  the Assembly began to sell the lands to the highest bidder to raise revenue  effectively decreasing the value of the assignats by 25  in two years  39  In autumn 1789  legislation abolished monastic vows and on 13 February 1790 all religious orders were dissolved  40 Monks and nuns were encouraged to return to private life and a small percentage did eventually marry  41  The Civil Constitution of the Clergy  passed on 12 July 1790  turned the remaining clergy into employees of the state  This established an election system for parish priests and bishops and set a pay rate for the clergy  Many Catholics objected to the election system because it effectively denied the authority of the Pope in Rome over the French Church  Eventually  in November 1790  the National Assembly began to require an oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution from all the members of the clergy  41  This led to a schism between those clergy who swore the required oath and accepted the new arrangement and those who remained loyal to the Pope  Overall  24  of the clergy nationwide took the oath  42  Widespread refusal led to legislation against the clergy   forcing them into exile  deporting them forcibly  or executing them as traitors   39 Pope Pius VI never accepted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy  further isolating the Church in France  During the Reign of Terror  extreme efforts of de Christianization ensued  including the imprisonment and massacre of priests and destruction of churches and religious images throughout France  An effort was made to replace the Catholic Church altogether  with civic festivals replacing religious ones  The establishment of the Cult of Reason was the final step of radical de Christianization  These events led to a widespread disillusionment with the Revolution and to counter rebellions across France  Locals often resisted de Christianization by attacking revolutionary agents and hiding members of the clergy who were being hunted  Eventually  Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety were forced to denounce the campaign  43  replacing the Cult of Reason with the deist but still non Christian Cult of the Supreme Being  The Concordat of 1801 between Napoleon and the Church ended the de Christianization period and established the rules for a relationship between the Catholic Church and the French State that lasted until it was abrogated by the Third Republic via the separation of church and state on 11 December 1905  The persecution of the Church led to a counter revolution known as the Revolt in the Vend e  whose suppression is considered by some to be the first modern genocide citation needed   Intrigues and radicalism Factions within the Assembly began to clarify  The aristocrat Jacques Antoine Marie de Cazal s and the abb  Jean Sifrein Maury led what would become known as the right wing  the opposition to revolution  this party sat on the right hand side of the Assembly   The  Royalist democrats  or monarchiens  allied with Necker  inclined toward organising France along lines similar to the British constitutional model  they included Jean Joseph Mounier  the Comte de Lally Tollendal  the comte de Clermont Tonnerre  and Pierre Victor Malouet  comte de Virieu  The  National Party   representing the centre or centre left of the assembly  included Honor  Mirabeau  La Fayette  and Bailly  while Adrien Duport  Barnave and Alexandre Lameth represented somewhat more extreme views  Almost alone in his radicalism on the left was the Arras lawyer Maximilien Robespierre  Abb  Siey s led in proposing legislation in this period and successfully forged consensus for some time between the political centre and the left  In Paris  various committees  the mayor  the assembly of representatives  and the individual districts each claimed authority independent of the others  The increasingly middle class National Guard under La Fayette also slowly emerged as a power in its own right  as did other self generated assemblies  The F te de la F d ration on 14 July 1790 celebrated the establishment of the constitutional monarchy The Assembly abolished the symbolic paraphernalia of the Ancien R gime  armorial bearings  liveries  etc    which further alienated the more conservative nobles  and added to the ranks of the  migr s  On 14 July 1790  and for several days following  crowds in the Champ de Mars celebrated the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille with the F te de la F d ration  Talleyrand performed a mass  participants swore an oath of  fidelity to the nation  the law  and the king   the King and the royal family actively participated  44  The electors had originally chosen the members of the Estates General to serve for a single year  However  by the terms of the Tennis Court Oath  the communes had bound themselves to meet continuously until France had a constitution  Right wing elements now argued for a new election  but Mirabeau prevailed  asserting that the status of the assembly had fundamentally changed  and that no new election should take place before completing the constitution  citation needed  In late 1790  the French army was in considerable disarray  The military officer corps was largely composed of noblemen  who found it increasingly difficult to maintain order within the ranks  In some cases  soldiers  drawn from the lower classes  had turned against their aristocratic commanders and attacked them  At Nancy  General Bouill  successfully put down one such rebellion  only to be accused of being anti revolutionary for doing so  This and other such incidents spurred a mass desertion as more and more officers defected to other countries  leaving a dearth of experienced leadership within the army  45  This period also saw the rise of the political  clubs  in French politics  Foremost among these was the Jacobin Club  152 members had affiliated with the Jacobins by 10 August 1790  The Jacobin Society began as a broad  general organization for political debate  but as it grew in members  various factions developed with widely differing views  Several of these fractions broke off to form their own clubs  such as the Club of  89  46  Meanwhile  the Assembly continued to work on developing a constitution  A new judicial organisation made all magistracies temporary and independent of the throne  The legislators abolished hereditary offices  except for the monarchy itself  Jury trials started for criminal cases  The King would have the unique power to propose war  with the legislature then deciding whether to declare war  The Assembly abolished all internal trade barriers and suppressed guilds  masterships  and workers  organisations  any individual gained the right to practice a trade through the purchase of a license  strikes became illegal  47  In the winter of 1791  the Assembly considered  for the first time  legislation against the  migr s  The debate pitted the safety of the Revolution against the liberty of individuals to leave  Mirabeau prevailed against the measure  which he referred to as  worthy of being placed in the code of Draco   45  But Mirabeau died on 2 April 1791 and  before the end of the year  the new Legislative Assembly adopted this draconian measure  48  Royal flight to Varennes Main article  Flight to Varennes The return of the royal family to Paris on 25 June 1791  after their failed flight to Varennes Louis XVI  egged on by Marie Antoinette and other members of his family  opposed the course of the Revolution  but rejected the potentially treacherous aid of the other monarchs of Europe  He cast his lot with General Bouill   who condemned both the emigration and the Assembly  and promised him refuge and support in his camp at Montm dy  On the night of 20 June 1791  the royal family fled the Tuileries Palace dressed as servants  while their servants dressed as nobles  However  late the next day  the King was recognised and arrested at Varennes  in the Meuse d partement   He and his family were brought back to Paris under guard  still dressed as servants  P tion  Latour Maubourg  and Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave  representing the Assembly  met the royal family at  pernay and returned with them  From this time  Barnave became a counselor and supporter of the royal family  When they returned to Paris  the crowd greeted them in silence  The Assembly provisionally suspended the King  He and Queen Marie Antoinette remained held under guard  49  50  51  52  53  Completing the constitution Main article  The Last Days of the National Constituent Assembly As most of the Assembly still favoured a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic  the various groups reached a compromise which left Louis XVI as little more than a figurehead  he was forced to swear an oath to the constitution  and a decree declared that retracting the oath  heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation  or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to abdication  54  However  Jacques Pierre Brissot drafted a petition  insisting that in the eyes of the nation Louis XVI was deposed since his flight  An immense crowd gathered in the Champ de Mars to sign the petition  Georges Danton and Camille Desmoulins gave fiery speeches  The Assembly called for the municipal authorities to  preserve public order   The National Guard under La Fayette s command confronted the crowd  The soldiers responded to a barrage of stones by firing into the crowd  killing between 13 and 50 people  55  In the wake of this massacre the authorities closed many of the patriotic clubs  as well as radical newspapers such as Jean Paul Marat s L Ami du Peuple  Danton fled to England  Desmoulins and Marat went into hiding  citation needed  Meanwhile  a new threat arose from abroad  Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II  Frederick William II of Prussia  and the King s brother Charles Philippe  comte d Artois  issued the Declaration of Pillnitz  which considered the cause of Louis XVI as their own  demanded his absolute liberty and implied an invasion of France on his behalf if the revolutionary authorities refused its conditions  56  The French people expressed no respect for the dictates of foreign monarchs  and the threat of force merely hastened their militarisation  57  Even before the  Flight to Varennes   the Assembly members had determined to debar themselves from the legislature that would succeed them  the Legislative Assembly  They now gathered the various constitutional laws they had passed into a single constitution  showed remarkable strength in choosing not to use this as an occasion for major revisions  and submitted it to the recently restored Louis XVI  who accepted it  writing  I engage to maintain it at home  to defend it from all attacks from abroad  and to cause its execution by all the means it places at my disposal   The King addressed the Assembly and received enthusiastic applause from members and spectators  With this capstone  the National Constituent Assembly adjourned in a final session on 30 September 1791  58  Mignet argued that the  constitution of 1791    was the work of the middle class  then the strongest  for  as is well known  the predominant force ever takes possession of institutions    In this constitution the people was the source of all powers  but it exercised none   54  Legislative Assembly  1791 1792  Failure of the constitutional monarchy Main article  The Legislative Assembly and the fall of the French monarchy Under the Constitution of 1791  France would function as a constitutional monarchy  The King had to share power with the elected Legislative Assembly  but he still retained his royal veto and the ability to select ministers  The Legislative Assembly first met on 1 October 1791  and degenerated into chaos less than a year later  In the words of the 1911 Encyclop dia Britannica   In the attempt to govern  the Assembly failed altogether  It left behind an empty treasury  an undisciplined army and navy  and a people debauched by safe and successful riot   59  The Legislative Assembly consisted of about 165 Feuillants  constitutional monarchists  on the right  about 330 Girondists  liberal republicans  and Jacobins  radical revolutionaries  on the left  and about 250 deputies unaffiliated with either faction  citation needed  Early on  the King vetoed legislation that threatened the  migr s with death and that decreed that every non juring clergyman must take within eight days the civic oath

stormed the Tuileries Palace and massacred the Swiss Guards On the night of 10 August 1792  insurgents and popular militias  supported by the revolutionary Paris Commune  assailed the Tuileries Palace and massacred the Swiss Guards who were assigned for the protection of the king  The royal family ended up prisoners and a rump session of the Legislative Assembly suspended the monarchy  little more than a third of the deputies were present  almost all of them Jacobins  60  What remained of a national government depended on the support of the insurrectionary Commune  The Commune sent gangs into the prisons to try arbitrarily and butcher 1400 victims  and addressed a circular letter to the other cities of France inviting them to follow this example  The Assembly could offer only feeble resistance  This situation persisted until the Convention  elected by universal male suffrage and charged with writing a new constitution  met on 20 September 1792 and became the new de facto government of France  The next day it abolished the monarchy and declared a republic  This date was later retroactively adopted as the beginning of Year One of the French Republican Calendar  War and Counter Revolution  1792 1797  Main articles  French Revolutionary Wars and French Counter Revolution A uniform from the French Revolution period  The politics of the period inevitably drove France towards war with Austria and its allies  The King  many of the Feuillants and the Girondins specifically wanted to wage war  The King  and many Feuillants with him  expected war would increase his personal popularity  he also foresaw an opportunity to exploit any defeat  either result would make him stronger  The Girondins wanted to export the Revolution throughout Europe and  by extension  to defend the Revolution within France  The forces opposing war were much weaker  Barnave and his supporters among the Feuillants feared a war they thought France had little chance to win and which they feared might lead to greater radicalization of the revolution  On the other end of the political spectrum Robespierre opposed a war on two grounds  fearing that it would strengthen the monarchy and military at the expense of the revolution  and that it would incur the anger of ordinary people in Austria and elsewhere  The Austrian emperor Leopold II  brother of Marie Antoinette  may have wished to avoid war  but he died on 1 March 1792  61  France preemptively declared war on Austria  20 April 1792  and Prussia joined on the Austrian side a few weeks later  The invading Prussian army faced little resistance until checked at the Battle of Valmy  20 September 1792   and forced to withdraw  The new born Republic followed up on this success with a series of victories in Belgium and the Rhineland in the fall of 1792  The French armies defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November  and had soon taken over most of the Austrian Netherlands  This brought them into conflict with Britain and the Dutch Republic  which wished to preserve the independence of the southern Netherlands from France  After the king s execution in January 1793  these powers  along with Spain and most other European states  joined the war against France  Almost immediately  French forces faced defeat on many fronts  and were driven out of their newly conquered territories in the spring of 1793  At the same time  the republican regime was forced to deal with rebellions against its authority in much of western and southern France  But the allies failed to take advantage of French disunity  and by the autumn of 1793 the republican regime had defeated most of the internal rebellions and halted the allied advance into France itself  The stalemate was broken in the summer of 1794 with dramatic French victories  They defeated the allied army at the Battle of Fleurus  leading to a full Allied withdrawal from the Austrian Netherlands  They followed up by a campaign which swept the allies to the east bank of the Rhine and left the French  by the beginning of 1795  conquering Holland itself  The House of Orange was expelled and replaced by the Batavian Republic  a French satellite state  These victories led to the collapse of the coalition against France  Prussia  having effectively abandoned the coalition in the fall of 1794  made peace with revolutionary France at Basel in April 1795  and soon thereafter Spain  too  made peace with France  Of the major powers  only Britain and Austria remained at war with France  La Marseillaise The French national anthem La Marseillaise was written during the revolution in 1792  Problems listening to this file  See media help  It was during this time that La Marseillaise was first sung  Originally titled Chant de guerre pour l Arm e du Rhin   War Song for the Army of the Rhine    the song was written and composed by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle in 1792  It was adopted in 1795 as the nation s first anthem  National Convention  1792 1795  Main article  National Convention Execution of Louis XVI Execution of Louis XVI in what is now the Place de la Concorde  facing the empty pedestal where the statue of his grandfather  Louis XV  had stood  Main article  Execution of Louis XVI See also  Robespierre and the Execution of Louis XVI In the Brunswick Manifesto  the Imperial and Prussian armies threatened retaliation on the French population if it were to resist their advance or the reinstatement of the monarchy  This among other things made Louis appear to be conspiring with the enemies of France  17 January 1793 saw Louis condemned to death for  conspiracy against the public liberty and the general safety  by a close majority in Convention  361 voted to execute the king  288 voted against  and another 72 voted to execute him subject to a variety of delaying conditions  The former Louis XVI  now simply named Citoyen Louis Capet  Citizen Louis Capet   was executed by guillotine on 21 January 1793 on the Place de la R volution  former Place Louis XV  now called the Place de la Concorde  62  Royalty across Europe was horrified and many heretofore neutral countries soon joined the war against revolutionary France  Economy When war went badly  prices rose and the sans culottes   poor labourers and radical Jacobins   rioted  counter revolutionary activities began in some regions  This encouraged the Jacobins to seize power through a parliamentary coup  backed up by force effected by mobilising public support against the Girondist faction  and by utilising the mob power of the Parisian sans culottes  An alliance of Jacobin and sans culottes elements thus became the effective centre of the new government  Policy became considerably more radical  as  The Law of the Maximum  set food prices and led to executions of offenders  63  This policy of price control was coeval with the Committee of Public Safety s rise to power and the Reign of Terror  The Committee first attempted to set the price for only a limited number of grain products but  by September 1793  it expanded the  maximum  to cover all foodstuffs and a long list of other goods  64  Widespread shortages and famine ensued  The Committee reacted by sending dragoons into the countryside to arrest farmers and seize crops  This temporarily solved the problem in Paris  but the rest of the country suffered  By the spring of 1794  forced collection of food was not sufficient to feed even Paris and the days of the Committee were numbered  When Robespierre went to the guillotine in July of that year the crowd jeered   There goes the dirty maximum   65  Reign of Terror Main article  Reign of Terror Satirical cartoon from England lampooning the excesses of the Revolution as symbolized through the guillotine  between 18 000 and 40 000 people were executed during the Reign of Terror Queen Marie Antoinette on the way to the guillotine on 16 October 1793  drawing by Jacques Louis David  The Committee of Public Safety came under the control of Maximilien Robespierre  a lawyer  and the Jacobins unleashed the Reign of Terror  1793 1794   According to archival records  at least 16 594 people died under the guillotine or otherwise after accusations of counter revolutionary activities  66  A number of historians note that as many as 40 000 accused prisoners may have been summarily executed without trial or died awaiting trial  66  67  On 2 June 1793  Paris sections   encouraged by the enrag s   enraged ones   Jacques Roux and Jacques H bert   took over the Convention  calling for administrative and political purges  a low fixed price for bread  and a limitation of the electoral franchise to sans culottes alone  68  With the backing of the National Guard  they managed to persuade the Convention to arrest 31 Girondin leaders  including Jacques Pierre Brissot  Following these arrests  the Jacobins gained control of the Committee of Public Safety on 10 June  installing the revolutionary dictatorship  On 13 July  the assassination of Jean Paul Marat   a Jacobin leader and journalist known for his bloodthirsty rhetoric   by Charlotte Corday  a Girondin  resulted in further increase of Jacobin political influence  Georges Danton  the leader of the August 1792 uprising against the King  undermined by several political reversals  was removed from the Committee and Robespierre   the Incorruptible   became its most influential member as it moved to take radical measures against the Revolution s domestic and foreign enemies  69  Meanwhile  on 24 June  the Convention adopted the first republican constitution of France  variously referred to as the French Constitution of 1793 or Constitution of the Year I  It was progressive and radical in several respects  in particular by establishing universal male suffrage  It was ratified by public referendum  but normal legal processes were suspended before it could take effect  70  War in the Vend e Main article  War in the Vend e The War in the Vend e was a royalist uprising that was suppressed by the republican forces in 1796 In Vend e  peasants revolted against the French Revolutionary government in 1793  They resented the changes imposed on the Roman Catholic Church by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy  1790  and broke into open revolt in defiance of the Revolutionary government s military conscription  71  This became a guerrilla war  known as the War in the Vend e  72  North of the Loire  similar revolts were started by the so called Chouans  royalist rebels   73  After the defeat at Savenay  when regular warfare in the Vend e was at an end  the French general Francois Joseph Westermann is argued by some historians to have penned a letter  its veracity is disputed  74  75  to the Committee of Public Safety  stating   There is no more Vend e  It died with its wives and its children by our free sabres  I have just buried it in the woods and the swamps of Savenay  According to the orders that you gave me  I crushed the children under the feet of the horses  massacred the women who  at least for these  will not give birth to any more brigands  I do not have a prisoner to reproach me  I have exterminated all  The roads are sown with corpses  At Savenay  brigands are arriving all the time claiming to surrender  and we are shooting them non stop    Mercy is not a revolutionary sentiment   76  77  Other historians doubt the authenticity of this document and point out that the claims in it were patently false   there were in fact thousands of living Vendean prisoners  the revolt had been far from crushed  and the Convention had explicitly decreed that women  children and unarmed men were to be treated humanely  78  It has been hypothesized that if the letter is authentic  Westermann may have been attempting to exaggerate the intensity of his actions and his success  because he was eager to avoid being purged for his opposition to sans culotte generals  he was later guillotined together with Danton s group   79  The revolt and its suppression  including both combat casualties and massacres and executions on both sides  are thought to have taken between 117 000 and 250 000 lives  170 000 according to the latest estimates   80  Because of the extremely brutal forms that the Republican repression took in many places  certain historians such as Reynald Secher have called the event a  genocide   This description has become popular in the mass media  81  but has largely been rejected by mainstream scholars  82  Facing local revolts and foreign invasions in both the East and West of the country  the most urgent government business was the war  On 17 August  the Convention voted for general conscription  the lev e en masse  which mobilized all citizens to serve as soldiers or suppliers in the war effort  The National Convention subsequently enacted more legislation  voting on 9 September to establish sans culottes paramilitary forces  revolutionary armies  and to force farmers to surrender grain demanded by the government  On 17 September  the Law of Suspects was passed  which authorized the charging of counter revolutionaries with  crimes against liberty   On 29 September  the Convention extended price limits from grain and bread to other household goods and established the Law of the Maximum  intended to prevent price gouging and supply food to the cities  83  The guillotine as a symbol The guillotine became the symbol of a string of executions  Louis XVI had already been guillotined before the start of the terror  Queen Marie Antoinette  Barnave  Bailly  Brissot and other leading Girondins  Philippe  galit   despite his vote for the death of the King   Madame Roland and many others were executed by guillotine  The Revolutionary Tribunal summarily condemned thousands of people to death by the guillotine  while mobs beat other victims to death  At the peak of the terror  the slightest hint of counter revolutionary thoughts or activities  or  as in the case of Jacques H bert  revolutionary zeal exceeding that of those in power  could place one under suspicion  and trials did not always proceed according to contemporary standards of due process  Sometimes people died for their political opinions or actions  but many for little reason beyond mere suspicion  or because some others had a stake in getting rid of them  Most of the victims received an unceremonious trip to the guillotine in an open wooden cart  the tumbrel   In the rebellious provinces  the government representatives had unlimited authority and some engaged in extreme repressions and abuses  For example  Jean Baptiste Carrier became notorious for the Noyades   drownings   he organized in Nantes  84  his conduct was judged unacceptable even by the Jacobin government and he was recalled  85  Another anti clerical uprising was made possible by the installment of the Republican Calendar on 24 October 1793  Against Robespierre s concepts of Deism and Virtue  H bert s  and Chaumette s  atheist movement initiated a religious campaign to dechristianize society  The climax was reached with the celebration of the flame of Reason in Notre Dame Cathedral on 10 November  86  The Festival of the Supreme Being on 8 June 1794 The Reign of Terror ultimately weakened the revolutionary government  while temporarily ending internal opposition  The Jacobins expanded the size of the army  and Carnot replaced many aristocratic officers with soldiers who had demonstrated their patriotism  if not their ability  The Republican army was able to throw back the Austrians  Prussians  British  and Spanish  At the end of 1793  the army began to prevail and revolts were defeated with ease  The Vent se Decrees  February March 1794  proposed the confiscation of the goods of exiles and opponents of the Revolution  and their redistribution to the needy  However this policy was never fully implemented  87  In the spring of 1794  both extremist enrag s such as H bert and moderate Montagnard indulgents such as Danton were charged with counter revolutionary activities  tried and guillotined  On 7 June Robespierre  who had previously condemned the Cult of Reason  advocated a new state religion and recommended the Convention acknowledge the existence of the  Supreme Being   88  Thermidorian Reaction Main article  Thermidorian Reaction The execution of Robespierre on 28 July 1794 marked the end of the Reign of Terror On 27 July 1794  the Thermidorian Reaction led to the arrest and execution of Robespierre  Louis de Saint Just  and other leading Jacobins  The new government was predominantly made up of Girondists who had survived the Terror  and after taking power  they took revenge as well by persecuting even those Jacobins who had helped to overthrow Robespierre  banning the Jacobin Club  and executing many of its former members in what was known as the White Terror  89  90  In the wake of excesses of the Terror  the Convention approved the new  Constitution of the Year III  on 22 August 1795  A French plebiscite ratified the document  with about 1 057 000 votes for the constitution and 49 000 against  91  The results of the voting were announced on 23 September 1795  and the new constitution took effect on 27 September 1795  91  The Constitutional Republic  The Directory  1795 1799  Main article  French Directory The new constitution created the Directoire  English  Directory  and the first bicameral legislature in French history  92  The parliament consisted of two houses  the Conseil des Cinq Cents  Council of the Five Hundred   with 500 representatives  and the Conseil des Anciens  Council of Elders   with 250 senators  Executive power went to five  directors   named annually by the Conseil des Anciens from a list submitted by the Conseil des Cinq Cents  Furthermore  the universal male suffrage of 1793 was replaced by limited suffrage based on property  93  With the establishment of the Directory  contemporary observers might have assumed that the Revolution was finished  Citizens of the war weary nation wanted stability  peace  and an end to conditions that at times bordered on chaos  Those who wished to restore the monarchy and the Ancien R gime by putting Louis XVIII on the throne  and those who would have renewed the Reign of Terror were insignificant in number  The possibility of foreign interference had vanished with the failure of the First Coalition  The earlier atrocities had made confidence or goodwill between parties impossible  The same instinct of self preservation which had led the members of the Convention to claim so large a part in the new legislature and the whole of the Directory impelled them to keep their predominance  However  many French citizens distrusted the Directory  94  and the directors could achieve their purposes only by extraordinary means  They habitually disregarded the terms of the constitution  and  even when the elections that they rigged went against them  the directors routinely used draconian police measures to quell dissent  Moreover  to prolong their power the directors were driven to rely on the military  which desired war and grew less and less civic minded  95  Other reasons influenced them in the direction of war  State finances during the earlier phases of the Revolution had been so thoroughly ruined that the government could not have met its expenses without the plunder and the tribute of foreign countries  If peace were made  the armies would return home and the directors would have to face the exasperation of the rank and file who had lost their livelihood  as well as the ambition of generals who could  in a moment  brush them aside  Barras and Rewbell were notoriously corrupt themselves and screened corruption in others  The patronage of the directors was ill bestowed  and the general maladministration heightened their unpopularity  96  Napol on Bonaparte in the coup d  tat of 18 Brumaire  which marked the end of the revolution The constitutional party in the legislature desired toleration of the nonjuring clergy  the repeal of the laws against the relatives of the  migr s  and some merciful discrimination toward the  migr s themselves  The directors baffled all such endeavours  On the other hand  the socialist conspiracy of Babeuf was easily quelled  Little was done to improve the finances  and the assignats continued to fall in value  citation needed  The new r gime met opposition from remaining Jacobins and the royalists  The army suppressed riots and counter revolutionary activities  In this way the army and its successful general  Napoleon Bonaparte eventually gained total power  On 9 November 1799  18 Brumaire of the Year VIII  Napoleon Bonaparte staged the coup of 18 Brumaire which installed the Consulate  This effectively led to Bonaparte s dictatorship and eventually  in 1804  to his proclamation as Empereur  emperor   which brought to a close the specifically republican phase of the French Revolution  97  Symbolism in the French Revolution Early depiction of the tricolour in the hands of a sans culotte during the French Revolution The French Revolution was a time of upheaval  especially towards traditional ideology  in almost every sense  the current monarch  King Louis XVI  was executed  the Catholic Church was all but abolished  a new calendar was created  and a new Republican government was established  In order to effectively illustrate the differences between the new Republic and the old regime  the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbolism  To this end  symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined  while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics  These revised symbols were used to instill in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic  98  Fasces Fasces  likes many other symbols of the French Revolution  are Roman in origin  Fasces are a bundle of birch rods containing an axe  In Roman times  the fasces symbolized the power of magistrates who could order the beating of a criminal  representing union and accord with the Roman Republic  98  The French Republic continued this Roman symbol to represent state power  justice  and unity  During the French Revolution the fasces image is seen in conjunction with many other symbols  This is seen with many emblems of the French Revolution  Though seen throughout the French Revolution  perhaps the most well known French reincarnation of the fasces is the Fasces surmounted by a Phrygian cap  This image has no display of an axe or a strong central state  rather  it symbolizes the power of the liberated people by placing the Liberty Cap on top of the classical symbol of power  98  Liberty cap The Liberty cap  also known as the Phrygian cap  or pileus  is a brimless  felt cap that is conical in shape with the tip pulled forward  The cap was originally worn by ancient Romans and Greeks  99  The cap implies ennobling effects  as seen in its association with Homer s Ulysses and the mythical twins  Castor and Pollux  The emblem s popularity during the French Revolution is due in part to its importance in ancient Rome  its use alludes to the Roman ritual of manumission of slaves  in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty  The Roman tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus incited the slaves to insurrection by displaying a pileus as if it were a standard  100  The pileus cap is often red in color  This type of cap was worn by revolutionaries at the fall of the Bastille  According to the Revolutions de Paris  it became  the symbol of the liberation from all servitudes  the sign for unification of all the enemies of despotism   98  The pileus competed with the Phrygian cap  a similar cap that covered the ears and the nape of the neck  for popularity  The Phrygian cap eventually supplanted the pileus and usurped its symbolism  becoming synonymous with republican liberty  98  Liberty Tree The Liberty Tree  officially adopted in 1792  is a symbol of the everlasting Republic  national freedom  and political revolution  98  It has historic roots in revolutionary France as well as America  as a symbol that was shared by the two nascent republics  101  The tree was chosen as a symbol of the French Revolution because it is a symbol of fertility in French folklore  102  which provided a simple transition from revering it for one reason to another  The American colonies also used the idea of a Liberty Tree to celebrate their own acts of insurrection against the British  starting with the Stamp Act riot in 1765  103  The riot culminated in the hanging in effigy of two Stamp Act politicians on a large elm tree  The elm tree began to be celebrated as a symbol of Liberty in the American colonies  103  It was adopted as a symbol that needed to be living and growing  along with the Republic  To that end  the tree is portrayed as a sapling  usually of an oak tree in French interpretation  104  The Liberty Tree serves as a constant celebration of the spirit of political freedom  Hercules The symbol of Hercules was first adopted by the Old Regime to represent the monarchy  105  Hercules was an ancient Greek hero who symbolized strength and power  The symbol was used to represent the sovereign authority of the King over France during the reign of the Bourbon monarchs  106  However  the monarchy was not the only ruling power in French history to use the symbol of Hercules to declare its power  During the Revolution  the symbol of Hercules was revived to represent nascent revolutionary ideals  The first use of Hercules as a revolutionary symbol was during a festival celebrating the National Assembly s victory over federalism on 10 August 1793  107  This Festival of Unity consisted of four stations around Paris which featured symbols representing major events of the Revolution which embodied revolutionary ideals of liberty  unity  and power  108  The statue of Hercules  placed at the station commemorating the fall of Louis XVI  symbolized the power of the French people over their former oppressors  The statue s foot was placed on the throat of the Hydra  which represented the tyranny of federalism which the new Republic had vanquished  107  In one hand  the statue grasped a club  a symbol of power  while in the other grasping the fasces which symbolized the unity of the French people  109  The image of Hercules assisted the new Republic in establishing its new Republican moral system  108  Hercules thus evolved from a symbol of the sovereignty of the monarch into a symbol of the new sovereign authority in France  the French people  110  This transition was made easily for two reasons  First  because Hercules was a famous mythological figure  and had previously been used by the monarchy  he was easily recognized by educated French observers  106  It was not necessary for the revolutionary government to educate the French people on the background of the symbol  Additionally  Hercules recalled the classical age of the Greeks and the Romans  a period which the revolutionaries identified with republican and democratic ideals  These connotations made Hercules an easy choice to represent the powerful new sovereign people of France  During the more radical phase of the Revolution from 1793 to 1794  the usage and depiction of Hercules changed  These changes to the symbol were due to revolutionary leaders believing the symbol was inciting violence among the common citizens  111  The triumphant battles of Hercules and the overcoming of enemies of the Republic became less prominent  In discussions over what symbol to use for the Seal of the Republic  the image of Hercules was considered but eventually ruled out in favor of Marianne  111  Hercules was on the coin of the Republic  111  However  this Hercules was not the same image as that of the pre Terror phases of the Revolution  The new image of Hercules was more domesticated  He appeared more paternal  older  and wiser  rather than the warrior like images in the early stages of the French Revolution  111  Unlike his 24 foot statue in the Festival of the Supreme Being  he was now the same size as Liberty and Equality  111  Also the language on the coin with Hercules was far different than the rhetoric of pre revolutionary depictions  On the coins the words   uniting Liberty and Equality  were used  111  This is opposed to the forceful language of early Revolutionary rhetoric and rhetoric of the Bourbon monarchy  By 1798  the Council of Ancients had discussed the  inevitable  change from the problematic image of Hercules  and Hercules was eventually phased out in favor of an even more docile image  111  Role of women Women had no political rights in pre Revolutionary France  they couldn t vote or hold any political office  They were considered  passive  citizens  forced to rely on men to determine what was best for them in the government  It was the men who defined these categories  and women were forced to accept male domination in the political sphere  112  The Encyclop die  published by a group of philosophers over the years 1751 1777  summarized French male beliefs of women  A woman was a  failed man   the fetus not fully developed in the womb   Women s testimony is in general light and subject to variation  this is why it is taken more seriously than that of men  as opposed to men  upon whom  Nature seems to have conferred  the right to govern   In general   men are more capable than women of ably governing particular matters   113  Instead  women were taught to be committed to their husbands and  all his interests   to show  attention and care   and  sincere and discreet zeal for his salvation   A woman s education often consisted of learning to be a good wife and mother  as a result women were not supposed to be involved in the political sphere  as the limit of their influence was the raising of future citizens  114  When the Revolution opened  some women struck forcefully  using the volatile political climate to assert their active natures  In the time of the Revolution  women could not be kept out of the political sphere  they swore oaths of loyalty   solemn declarations of patriotic allegiance   and  affirmations of the political responsibilities of citizenship   Throughout the Revolution  women such as Pauline L on and her Society of Revolutionary Republican Women fought for the right to bear arms  used armed force and rioted  115  Even before L on  some liberals had advocated equal rights for women including women s suffrage  Nicolas de Condorcet was especially noted for his advocacy  in his articles published in the Journal de la Soci t  de 1789  and by publishing De l admission des femmes au droit de cit    For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women   in 1790  Feminist agitation Main article  Militant Feminism in the French Revolution The March to Versailles is but one example of feminist militant activism during the French Revolution  While largely left out of the thrust for increasing rights of citizens  as the question was left indeterminate in the Declaration of the Rights of Man  116  activists such as Pauline L on and Th roigne de M ricourt agitated for full citizenship for women  117  Women were  nonetheless   denied political rights of  active citizenship   1791  and democratic citizenship  1793    116  Pauline L on  on 6 March 1792  submitted a petition signed by 319 women to the National Assembly requesting permission to form a garde national in order to defend Paris in case of military invasion  117  L on requested permission be granted to women to arm themselves with pikes  pistols  sabers and rifles  as well as the privilege of drilling under the French Guards  Her request was denied  118  Later in 1792  Th roigne de M ricourt made a call for the creation of  legions of amazons  in order to protect the revolution  As part of her call  she claimed that the right to bear arm would transform women into citizens  119  On 20 June 1792 a number of armed women took part in a procession that  passed through the halls of the Legislative Assembly  into the Tuilleries Gardens  and then through the King s residence   120  Militant women also assumed a special role in the funeral of Marat  following his murder on 13 July 1793  As part of the funeral procession  they carried the bathtub in which Marat had been murdered as well as a shirt stained with Marat s blood  121  The most radical militant feminist activism was practiced by the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women  which was founded by L on and her colleague  Claire Lacombe on 10 May 1793  122  The goal of the club was  to deliberate on the means of frustrating the projects of the enemies of the Republic   Up to 180 women attended the meetings of the Society  123  Of special interest to the Society was  combating hoarding  of grain and other staples  and inflation   124  Later  on 20 May 1793  women were at the fore of a crowd that demanded  bread and the Constitution of 1793   125  When their cries went unnoticed  the women went on a rampage   sacking shops  seizing grain and kidnapping officials   126  Most of these outwardly activist women were punished for their actions  The kind of punishment received during the Revolution included public denouncement  arrest  execution  or exile  Th roigne de M ricourt was arrested  publicly flogged and then spent the rest of her life sentenced to an insane asylum  Pauline L on and Claire Lacombe were arrested  later released  and continued to receive ridicule and abuse for their activism  Many of the women of the Revolution were even publicly executed for  conspiring against the unity and the indivisibility of the Republic   127  These are but a few examples of the militant feminism that was prevalent during the French Revolution  While little progress was made toward gender equality during the Revolution  the activism of French feminists was bold and particularly significant in Paris  citation needed  Women writers Olympe de Gouges was the author of the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen in 1791 While some women chose a militant  and often violent  path  others chose to influence events through writing  publications  and meetings  Olympe de Gouges wrote a number of plays  short stories  and novels  Her publications emphasized that women and men are different  but this shouldn t stop them from equality under the law  In her  Declaration on the Rights of Woman  she insisted that women deserved rights  especially in areas concerning them directly  such as divorce and recognition of illegitimate children  De Gouges also expressed non gender political views  even before the start of the terror  Olympe de Gouges addressed Robespierre using the pseudonym  Polyme  calling him the Revolution s  infamy and shame   She warned of the Revolution s building extremism saying that leaders were  preparing new shackles if  the French people s liberty were to  waver   Stating that she was willing to sacrifice herself by jumping into the Seine if Robespierre were to join her  de Gouges desperately attempted to grab the attention of the French citizenry and alert them to the dangers that Robespierre embodied  128  In addition to these bold writings  her defense of the king was one of the factors leading to her execution  An influential figure  one of her suggestions early in the Revolution  to have a voluntary  patriotic tax  was adopted by the National Convention in 1789  129  Madame Roland  aka Manon or Marie Roland  was another important female activist  Her political focus was not specifically on women or their liberation  She focused on other aspects of the government  but was a feminist by virtue of the fact that she was a woman working to influence the world  Her personal letters to leaders of the Revolution influenced policy  in addition  she often hosted political gatherings of the Brissotins  a political group which allowed women to join  While limited by her gender  Madame Roland took it upon herself to spread Revolutionary ideology and spread word of events  as well as to assist in formulating the policies of her political allies  Though unable to directly write policies or carry them through to the government  Roland was able to influence her political allies and thus promote her political agenda  Roland attributed women s lack of education to the public view that women were too weak or vain to be involved in the serious business of politics  She believed that it was this inferior education that turned them into foolish people  but women  could easily be concentrated and solidified upon objects of great significance  if given the chance  130  As she was led to the scaffold  Madame Roland shouted  O liberty  What crimes are committed in thy name   Witnesses of her life and death  editors  and readers helped to finish her writings and several editions were published posthumously  While she did not focus on gender politics in her writings  by taking an active role in the tumultuous time of the Revolution  Roland took a stand for women of the time and proved they could take an intelligent active role in politics  131  Though women did not gain the right to vote as a result of the Revolution  they still greatly expanded their political participation and involvement in governing  They set precedents for generations of feminists to come  Counter revolutionary women A major aspect of the French Revolution was the dechristianisation movement  a movement that many common people did not agree with  Especially for women living in rural areas of France  the demise of the Catholic Church meant a loss of normalcy  For instance  the ringing of Church bells resonating through the town called people to confession and was a symbol of unity for the community  132  With the onset of the dechristianisation campaign the Republic silenced these bells and sought simultaneously to silence the religious fervor of the majority Catholic population  132  When these revolutionary changes to the Church were implemented  it spawned a counter revolutionary movement  particularly amongst women  Although some of these women embraced the political and social amendments of the Revolution  they opposed the dissolution of the Catholic Church and the formation of revolutionary cults like the Cult of the Supreme Being advocated by Robespierre  133  As Olwen Hufton argues  these women began to see themselves as the  defenders of faith   134  They took it upon themselves to protect the Church from what they saw as a heretical change to their faith  enforced by revolutionaries  Counter revolutionary women resisted what they saw as the intrusion of the state into their lives  135  Economically  many peasant women refused to sell their goods for assignats because this form of currency was unstable and was backed by the sale of confiscated Church property  134  By far the most important issue to counter revolutionary women was the passage and the enforcement of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in 1790  In response to this measure  women in many areas began circulating anti oath pamphlets and refused to attend masses held by priests who had sworn oaths of loyalty to the Republic  135  This diminished the social and political influence of the juring priests because they presided over smaller congregations and counter revolutionary women did not seek them for baptisms  marriages or confession  136  Instead  they secretly hid nonjuring priests and attended clandestine traditional masses  137  These women continued to adhere to traditional practices such as Christian burials and naming their children after saints in spite of revolutionary decrees to the contrary  138  It was this determined resistance to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and the dechristianisation campaigns that played a major role in the re emergence of the Catholic Church as a prominent social institution  In fact  Olwen Hufton notes about the Counter Revolutionary women   for it is her commitment to her religion which determines in the post Thermidorean period the re emergence of the Catholic Church    139  Although they struggled  these women were eventually vindicated in their bid to reestablish the Church and thereby also to reestablish traditional family life and social stability  140  This was seen in the Concordat of 1801  which formally reinstated the Catholic Church in France  141  This act came after years of failed attempts at dechristianisation or state controlled religion  which were thwarted in part due to the resistance of devout counter revolutionary women  After the upheaval of the revolutionary period  the reestablishment of the Church was seen by many people as a welcome return to normalcy  Legacy Main article  Historiography of the French Revolution The French Revolution has received enormous amounts of historical attention  both from the general public and from scholars and academics  The views of historians  in particular  have been characterized as falling along ideological lines  with disagreement over the significance and the major developments of the Revolution  142 Alexis de Tocqueville argued that the Revolution was a manifestation of a more prosperous middle class becoming conscious of its social importance  143  Other thinkers  like the conservative Edmund Burke  maintained that the Revolution was the product of a few conspiratorial individuals who brainwashed the masses into subverting the old order a claim rooted in the belief that the revolutionaries had no legitimate complaints  144  Other historians  influenced by Marxist thinking  have emphasized the importance of the peasants and the urban workers in presenting the Revolution as a gigantic class struggle  145  In general  scholarship on the French Revolution initially studied the political ideas and developments of the era  but it has gradually shifted towards social history that analyzes the impact of the Revolution on individual lives  146  Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history  and the end of the early modern period  which started around 1500  is traditionally attributed to the onset of the French Revolution in 1789  147  The Revolution is  in fact  often seen as marking the  dawn of the modern era   148  Within France itself  the Revolution permanently crippled the power of the aristocracy and drained the wealth of the Church  although the two institutions survived despite the damage they sustained  After the collapse of the First Empire in 1815  the French public lost the rights and privileges earned since the Revolution  but they remembered the participatory politics that characterized the period  with one historian commenting   Thousands of men and even many women gained firsthand experience in the political arena  they talked  read  and listened in new ways  they voted  they joined new organizations  and they marched for their political goals  Revolution became a tradition  and republicanism an enduring option   149  Some historians argue that the French people underwent a fundamental transformation in self identity  evidenced by the elimination of privileges and their replacement by rights as well as the growing decline in social deference that highlighted the principle of equality throughout the Revolution  150  The Revolution represented the most significant and dramatic challenge to political absolutism up to that point in history and  despite its failures  spread democratic ideals throughout Europe and ultimately the world  151  It had a profound impact on the Russian Revolution and its ideas inspired Mao Zedong in his efforts at constructing a communist state in China  152  See also Biens nationaux Dual revolution History of democracy La R volution fran aise  film  List of people granted honorary French citizenship during
