been a successful launchpad for getting United Kingdom talent into the larger American comics market  and has also been the source of a number of film licences  Unlike earlier weekly titles  2000 AD was based on a 6 page strip format  This gave the writers greater opportunity to develop character and meant that the artists had greater scope in designing the layout  A long running joke is that the editor of 2000 AD is Tharg the Mighty  a green extraterrestrial from Betelgeuse who terms his readers  Earthlets   Tharg uses other unique alien expressions and even appears in his own comic strips  Readers sometimes play along with this  for example  in prog 200 a pair of readers wrote to Tharg claiming that they preferred to be called  Terrans   the resulting controversy ended in Tharg s accepting a challenge for a duel at a galactic location  Another running joke is Tharg s supposed use of robots to draw and write the strips   some of which bear a marked resemblance to actual writers and artists  A fictional reason for Tharg to use mechanical assistance was given when the robots  went on strike   reflecting real life industrial action that occasionally halted IPC s comics production during the 1970s and 1980s   Tharg wrote and drew a whole issue himself  but when he ran it through the quality control  Thrill meter   the device melted down on extreme overload  The offending issue had to be taken away  by blindfolded security guards  to a lead lined vault where there was no danger of anyone seeing it accidentally   edit  History  edit  The 1970s  edit  Pre publication 2000 AD logo  In December 1975  Kelvin Gosnell  a sub editor at IPC Magazines  read an article in the London Evening Standard about a wave of forthcoming science fiction films  and suggested that the company might get on the bandwagon by launching a science fiction comic  IPC asked Pat Mills  a freelance writer and editor who had created Battle Picture Weekly and Action  to develop it  Mills brought fellow freelancer John Wagner on board as script adviser and the pair began to develop characters  The then futuristic name 2000 AD was chosen as no one involved expected the comic to last that long  Mills  experiences with Battle and Action in particular had taught him that readers responded to his anti authoritarian attitudes  Wagner  who had written a Dirty Harry inspired tough cop called One Eyed Jack for Valiant  saw that readers also responded to authority figures  and developed a character that took the concept to its logical extreme  imagining an ultra violent lawman patrolling a future New York with the power to arrest  sentence  and if required execute criminals on the spot  Meanwhile  Mills had developed a horror strip  inspired by the novels of Dennis Wheatley  about a hanging judge  called Judge Dread  after the reggae and ska artist of the same name   The idea was abandoned as unsuitable for the new comic  but the name  with a little modification  was adopted by Wagner for his ultimate lawman  The task of visualising the newly named Judge Dredd was given to Carlos Ezquerra  a Spanish artist who had worked for Mills before on Battle on a strip called Major Eazy  Wagner gave Ezquerra an advertisement for the film Death Race 2000  showing the character Frankenstein clad in black leather  as a suggestion for what the character should look like  Ezquerra elaborated on this greatly  adding body armour  zips and chains  which Wagner originally thought over the top  Wagner s initial script was rewritten by Mills and drawn up by Ezquerra  but when the art came back a rethink was necessary  The hardware and cityscapes Ezquerra had drawn were far more futuristic than the near future setting originally intended  and Mills decided to run with it and set the strip further into the future  By this stage  however  Wagner had quit  IPC owned the rights to Dan Dare  and Mills decided to revive the character to add immediate public recognition for the title  Paul DeSavery  who owned Dare s film rights  offered to buy the new comic and give Mills and Wagner more creative control and a greater financial stake  The deal fell through  however  and Wagner walked  Mills was reluctant to lose Judge Dredd and farmed the strip out to a variety of freelance writers  hoping to develop it further  Their scripts were given to a variety of artists as Mills tried to find a strip which would make a good introduction to the character  all of which meant that Dredd would not be ready for the first issue  The story chosen was one written by Peter Harris  extensively rewritten by Mills and including an idea suggested by Kelvin Gosnell  and drawn by newcomer Mike McMahon  The strip debuted in prog 2  but Ezquerra  angry that another artist had drawn the first published strip  quit and returned to work for Battle   edit  The opening line up Mills had created Harlem Heroes  about the future sport of aeroball  a futuristic  violent version of basketball with jet packs  Similar future sport series had been a fixture of Action  Wanting to give the new comic a distinctive look  Mills wanted to use European artists  but the work turned in on Harlem Heroes by Trigo was disappointing  Veteran British artists Ron Turner and Barrie Mitchell were tried out  but a newcomer called Dave Gibbons won the editor over with his dynamic  American influenced drawings and got the job  Mills wrote the first five episodes before handing the strip to Roy of the Rovers writer Tom Tully  Dan Dare was extensively revamped to make it more futuristic  In the new stories he had been put into suspended animation and revived several centuries in the future  Several artists were tried out before Mills settled on Italian artist Massimo Belardinelli  whose imaginative  hallucinatory work was fantastic at visualising aliens  although perhaps less satisfying on the hero himself  The scripts were endlessly rewritten in an attempt to make the series work  but few Dan Dare fans remember this version of the character fondly  Belardinelli and Gibbons later switched strips  with Gibbons drawing Dare and Belardinelli drawing the Harlem Heroes sequel Inferno  When Gibbons took over Dare in Prog 28 the strip was refashioned as a  Star Trek  style space opera  The other opening strips were M A C H  1  a super powered secret agent inspired by The Six Million Dollar Man  Invasion   about a  Volgan   thinly disguised Soviet in fact originally billed as Soviet  but changed before printing to a  neutral  antagonist  invasion of the United Kingdom opposed by tough London lorry driver turned guerrilla fighter Bill Savage  and Flesh  a particularly violent strip about time travelling cowboys farming dinosaurs for their meat  Once the comic had been made ready to launch  Mills quit as editor and handed the reins to Kelvin Gosnell  whose idea it was in the first place  Gosnell appeared as the fall guy in the Tharg photostrips that were a feature of the comic in its early years   edit  The early years Wagner swallowed his pride and returned to write Judge Dredd  starting in prog 9  His  Robot Wars  storyline was drawn by a rotating team of artists  including McMahon  Ezquerra  Turner and Ian Gibson  and marked the point where Dredd became the most popular character in the comic  a position he has rarely relinquished  Dredd s city  which now covered most of the east coast of North America  became known as Mega City One  Dredd had also been unmasked in issue 8 in a story drawn by Massimo Belardinelli  but the face drawn was not anywhere near that which had been hoped citation needed   The decision was made to make out that Dredd s face had been scarred and the panel had a  censored  banner slapped on it  After this Dredd s face was never attempted to be shown again  A new story format was introduced in prog 25   Tharg s Future Shocks  one off twist in the tail stories devised by writer Steve Moore  2000 AD still uses this format as filler and to try out new talent  One early Future Shock was drawn by 2000 AD s then art assistant Kevin O Neill  Wagner introduced a new character  Robo Hunter  in 1978  The hero  Sam Slade  was a private detective type character specialising in robot related cases  Jos  Ferrer was the original artist  but the editorial team were not happy with his work and quickly replaced him with Ian Gibson  who redrew parts of Ferrer s episodes before taking over himself  Gibson s imaginative  cartoony art helped drive the series  style from hard boiled detective to surreal comedy  As the series continued Sam was joined by an idiot kit built robot assistant  Hoagy  and even  after a crack down on smoking in IPC comics  a Cuban robot cigar  Stogie  designed to help him cut down on nicotine  The hero started out based on Humphrey Bogart  but after a few years he looked more like Ted Danson citation needed   Other ongoing strips included The Visible Man  detailing the misfortunes of Frank Hart  a man whose skin had been made transparent due to exposure to nuclear waste  and Shako   which followed the same formula as Hook Jaw from Action but with less success  the story of a polar bear pursued by the Army because it had swallowed a secret capsule  M A C H  1 was killed off in 1978 but a spin off  M A C H  Zero  continued into the 1980s  Flesh had a sequel in 1978  set on the prehistoric oceans  and Bill Savage appeared again in a prequel  Disaster 1990  in which a nuclear explosion at the north pole had melted the polar ice cap and flooded Britain  In 1978 2000 AD launched the annual 48 page Summer Special  including a full length M A C H  Zero story drawn by O Neill  The yearly hardcover annual had started in 1977 and would continue till 1991  Pat Mills took over writing Dredd for a six month  epic  called  The Cursed Earth   inspired by Roger Zelazny s Damnation Alley  which took the future lawman out of the city on a humanitarian trek across the radioactive wasteland between the Mega Cities  McMahon drew the bulk of the stories  with occasional episodes drawn by Brian Bolland  The story saw Dredd moved to the colour centre pages for the first time while Dan Dare was given the front page  IPC had launched a second science fiction comic  Starlord  which was cancelled after only 22 issues and merged into 2000 AD  Two Starlord strips strengthened 2000 AD s line up  Strontium Dog  a mutant bounty hunter created by Wagner and Ezquerra  and Ro Busters  a robot disaster squad created by Mills  Ro Busters gave O Neill the chance to spread his artistic wings and led to the popular spin off ABC Warriors  Dan Dare was suspended while  The Cursed Earth  was finished in time for the merger  Wagner returned to Dredd following the merger to write  The Day the Law Died   another six month epic in which Mega City One was taken over by the insane Chief Judge Cal  based on the Roman emperor Caligula  Another cancelled title  Tornado  was merged with 2000 AD a few months later  contributing three stories to 2000AD   Blackhawk  an historical adventure series about a Nubian slave in the Roman empire which took a science fictional turn in 2000AD with him becoming a gladiator in an alien world  The Mind of Wolfie Smith  a coming of age psychic story of a runaway teenager  and Captain Klep  a single page superhero parody  2000 AD featured an adaptation of Harry Harrison s novel The Stainless Steel Rat  written by Gosnell and drawn by Ezquerra  Adaptations of two of Harrison s sequels  The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World and The Stainless Steel Rat for President  would follow later  The appearance of the main character  galactic thief  Slippery  Jim DiGriz  was based on James Coburn  evidently a favourite of Ezquerra s  Coburn was also the inspiration for Major Eazy  which Ezquerra drew in Battle  as well as Judge Koburn  a Dredd universe reworking of the Major Eazy character  who first appeared in 2003  Gerry Finley Day contributed The V C s  a future war story inspired by the Vietnam War  drawn by McMahon  Cam Kennedy  Garry Leach and John Richardson  An important feature of the early years of 2000 AD was the opportunities it gave to young British comic artists   by the time the title celebrated its 100th issue Brian Bolland  Dave Gibbons  Ian Gibson  Mike McMahon and Kevin O Neil were all established as regulars   edit  The 1980s In 1980 Judge Dredd gained a new enemy  Writer John Wagner realised that Dredd s habit of shooting just about everybody he came up against meant that it was difficult to create a recurring villain  The solution was Judge Death  an undead judge from another dimension where  since all crime was committed by the living  life itself was outlawed  The law had been thoroughly enforced on his own world  and now he had come to Mega City One to continue his work  Judge Death first appeared in an atmospheric three parter drawn by Brian Bolland which also introduced Judge Anderson of Psi Division  a squad of judges with psychic powers  Dredd soon began another epic journey in  The Judge Child   A dying Psi Division Judge had predicted disaster for Mega City One unless it was ruled by a boy with a birthmark shaped like an eagle  so Dredd set off into the Cursed Earth  to Texas City  and into deep space in search of the boy  Owen Krysler  and his kidnappers  the Angel Gang  The Angels were some of the most memorable villains Wagner had yet devised  but suffered the same mortality problem that had plagued the strip so far  All of them were killed during the course of the story  but one  the Mean Machine  was later resurrected by a convenient bit of magic   The Judge Child  was drawn by Bolland  Ron Smith and Mike McMahon in rotation  and the later episodes marked the beginning of Wagner s long running writing partnership with Alan Grant  The pair would go on to write Strontium Dog  Robo Hunter and many other stories for 2000 AD  as well as for Roy of the Rovers  Battle and the relaunched Eagle in the United Kingdom  and a number of comics in America  Prog  issue  178 was something of a relaunch for 2000 AD  All current stories  with the exception of Judge Dredd  were wound up  and a new set of stories was launched simultaneously  consisting of Mean Arena  set around a violent high tech street football game  Meltdown Man  whose hero was transported to a genetically engineered far future by a nuclear explosion  Strontium Dog  featuring a mutant bounty hunter character inherited from the short lived Starlord title  and Dash Decent  a thinly disguised spoof of Flash Gordon  Pat Mills introduced Comic Rock  which was meant to be a format for short stories inspired by popular music  The first story  inspired by The Jam s Going Underground  was drawn by Kevin O Neill and featured an insane underground travel network on a planet called  Termight   in which a freedom fighter called Nemesis battles the despotic Torquemada  chief of the Tube Police  All that was seen of Nemesis was the outside of his vehicle  the Blitzspear  The story was a reaction to an earlier tube chase sequence Mills and O Neill had done in Ro Busters  which management objected to  The only other Comic Rock story was a follow up called  Killer Watt   in which Nemesis and Torquemada fought on a teleport system  This led to a series  Nemesis the Warlock  in which it was revealed that Termight was Earth in the far future  Torquemada was a despotic demagogue leading a campaign of genocide against all aliens  and Nemesis was the leader of the alien resistance  Mills and O Neill were on a roll and produced a stream of bizarre and imaginative ideas  but ultimately O Neill was unable to continue the level of work he was putting into it on 2000 AD pay  He left to work for DC Comics in America  and was replaced on Nemesis by Bryan Talbot  2000 AD would occasionally take a gamble on non science fiction material  For example Fiends of the Eastern Front was a World War II vampire story by Gerry Finley Day and Carlos Ezquerra which was probably originally intended for Battle  Its hero was a German soldier who discovered that some of his Romanian allies were vampires  Later in the war  when Romania changed sides  he was the only one who knew their secret  A readers  poll revealed that future war was a popular topic  so Gerry Finley Day was asked to come up with a new war story  He  editor Steve MacManus and artists Dave Gibbons devised Rogue Trooper  a  Genetic Infantryman  engineered to be immune to chemical warfare hunting down the traitor general who had betrayed his regiment  who debuted in 1981  He was supported by bio chips of the personalities of three dead comrades  which  slotted into his equipment  could talk to him  Gibbons left the strip early on and was replaced by Colin Wilson  Brett Ewins  and most notably Cam Kennedy  Rogue Trooper replaced Meltdown Man  which had recently ended its run  Another new strip in 1981  inspired by the brief CB radio craze  was Ace Trucking Co   a comedy about pointy headed alien space trucker Ace Garp and his crew by Wagner  Grant and Belardinelli  Wagner and Grant also had big plans for Judge Dredd  Mega City One had grown too large and unwieldy  and they planned to cut it down to size   Block Mania   in which wars broke out between rival city blocks  turned out to be a plot orchestrated by the Russian city East Meg One  and led directly to  The Apocalypse War   another six month epic and a hard hitting satire on the concept of Mutually assured destruction  East Meg One  protected by a warp shield  softened up Mega City One with nuclear warheads before invading  Dredd spearheaded the resistance  leading a small team to East Meg territory  hijacking their nuclear bunkers and blowing East Meg One off the face of the earth   The Apocalypse War  was drawn in its entirety by Carlos Ezquerra  making a return to the character he created  A new writer  Alan Moore  had started contributing Future Shocks in 1980  He wrote more than fifty one off strips over the next three years  while also contributing to various Marvel UK titles and the independent magazine Warrior  In 1982 he got his first series  Skizz  a less sentimental take on the same basic plot used in E T  the Extra Terrestrial  set in Birmingham and influenced by Alan Bleasdale s Boys from the Blackstuff  Moore wrote Skizz without having seen E T  The series was drawn by Jim Baikie  Moore wrote another series  D R  and Quinch  spun off from a one off Time Twister  Drawn by Alan Davis  the strip featured a pair of alien juvenile delinquents with a penchant for mindless thermonuclear destruction  He went on to create The Ballad of Halo Jones with artist Ian Gibson  the first strip in 2000 AD to be based on a female protagonist  Halo was an everywoman in the far future  born into mass unemployment on a floating housing estate  who escaped the earth and got involved in a terrible galactic war  Three books were published  and more were planned  but Moore s demands for creator s rights and his increasing commitments to American publishers meant they never materialised  A new character  Sl ine  debuted in 1983  but had been in development since 1981  Created by Pat Mills and his then wife Angela Kincaid  Sl ine was a barbarian fantasy strip based on Celtic mythology  Kincaid was a children s book illustrator who had never worked in comics before  and her opening episode was drawn and redrawn several times before the editors were satisfied  Other stories were written for artists Massimo Belardinelli and Mike McMahon  but these could not see print until Kincaid s episode was ready  In 1985  after appearing as a supporting character in Judge Dredd  Judge Anderson finally got her own series  written by Wagner and Grant and initially drawn by Brett Ewins  New artist Glenn Fabry debuted on Sl ine  but due to his notorious slowness was rotated with David Pugh  In the Judge Dredd story  Letter from a Democrat   Wagner and Grant introduced a pro democracy movement in Mega City One  which is after all a police state  This would provide plotlines for years to come  In 1986 the comic reached its 500th issue  A new Sl ine story  Sl ine the King  began  entirely drawn by Fabry  Peter Milligan  a writer who had been contributing Future Shocks  began two series  the bleak future war story Bad Company   based partly upon John Wagner s Darkie s Mob strip in Battle  and a strange  psychedelic series called The Dead  In 1986  2000AD was selling a very healthy 150 000 copies a week   this was at the launch of their 500th issue   citation needed  In 1987 IPC s comics division was hived off and sold to publishing magnate Robert Maxwell as Fleetway  2000 AD was revamped  with a larger page size and full process colour on the covers and centre pages  Kevin O Neill returned for a short Nemesis series called  Torquemada the God   Not long after came the debut of Zenith  2000 AD s first superhero strip  by new writer Grant Morrison and artist Steve Yeowell  The title character was a shallow pop singer with superhuman powers  caught up in the intrigues of a 1960s generation of superhumans and the machinations of some Lovecraftian elder gods  Wagner and Grant began a new Dredd Epic   Oz   featuring Chopper  a popular supporting character  Chopper was a skysurfer who had been imprisoned for competing in an illegal surfing competition a few years previously  A legal  Supersurf  race was being held in Oz  the future Australia  and Chopper escaped to compete  Dredd also went to Oz  partly to deal with Chopper  but mostly to investigate the Judda  a clone army created by Mega City One s former chief genetic engineer  The Judda were defeated  and Chopper narrowly lost the race to Jug McKenzie  Dredd was waiting at the finish line  but McKenzie distracted him and allowed Chopper to escape into the outback  This ending was apparently the cause of some dispute between Wagner and Grant  and was a contributing factor  it was The Last American  a mini series for Epic Comics which would mark the end  in ending their regular writing partnership  Wagner kept Dredd  while Grant continued Strontium Dog and Judge Anderson  However the pair would still come together for occasional collaborations  The  Oz  storyline had some lasting implications  Kraken  a Judda cloned from the same genetic material as Dredd  was captured by Justice Department  who had plans for him  Chopper also spun off into his own series  written by Wagner and drawn by Colin MacNeil  The ABC Warriors finally got their own series again in 1987 as a spin off from Nemesis  This was written  as ever  by Pat Mills  and drawn by two artists in rotation  newcomer Simon Bisley and science fiction artist S M S   In 1988 Grant and artist Simon Harrison began a new Strontium Dog story   The Final Solution   It took nearly two years to complete  and ended with the death of Johnny Alpha  who sacrificed his life to save mutants from extermination  Original artist Carlos Ezquerra did not agree with the decision to kill the character off  and refused to draw it  The number of colour pages was increased  allowing for one complete strip per issue to be painted  Initially the colour pages were reserved for Judge Dredd  but were later given over to a new Sl ine story   The Horned God   fully painted by Simon Bisley  The series was collected as a series of three graphic novels  then as a single volume  and has remained in print ever since  In 1989 the colour pages were increased again  allowing for three colour stories and two black and white in every issue  One of the colour series was Rogue Trooper  the War Machine  written by Dave Gibbons and painted by Will Simpson  The original Rogue Trooper series had run out of steam after the Traitor General had been dealt with  so Gibbons revamped the concept  creating a different genetic infantryman  Friday  in a different war  One of the black and white stories   The Dead Man   was a low key beginning for a major event  In the Cursed Earth  villagers come across a man  burnt from head to toe  with no memory of who he is or what happened to him  As he tries to piece his memories back together  he is being hunted by the evil beings who left him in that state  A creepy  atmospheric horror western  it was drawn by John Ridgway and written by  Keef Ripley   a pseudonym for John Wagner  By the end of the series the Dead Man had discovered his identity  He was Judge Dredd   edit  The 1990s As  The Dead Man  ended  a new Judge Dredd story   Tale of the Dead Man   explained how Dredd had ended up in that position  Dredd was getting older and the democratic movement was causing him to doubt his role  so Justice Department had groomed Kraken  the former Judda cloned from his bloodline  to replace him  Kraken was now ready for his final assessment  and Dredd himself was chosen to assess him  Although Kraken performed faultlessly  Dredd thought he perceived a hint of his former allegiance to the Judda in him  and failed him  He then resigned as a judge and took the  Long Walk  into the Cursed Earth  There he met the Sisters of Death  and only barely survived the encounter  This could mean only one thing  Judge Death was back  This set up the latest six month epic   Necropolis   After Dredd had left  Justice Department had put Kraken through one final test  and given him Dredd s badge  But the Sisters of Death  spirit beings from Judge Death s dimension  were able to use Kraken s inner conflict to take control of him and use him to bring Judge Death and the other Dark Judges back from the limbo dimension Dredd had exiled them to  The Sisters possessed all the city s judges and began to enforce Death s twisted law  Out in the Cursed Earth  Dredd had recovered his memory and returned to defeat the Dark Judges  He then tried to lance the democratic boil by holding a referendum on whether the Judges should continue to govern the city  The judges won  by a small margin on a desultory turnout  and Dredd was satisfied  2000 AD gained an influx of talent from other comics  Garth Ennis and John Smith had come to prominence writing for Crisis  a 2000 AD spin off for older readers  while artists Jamie Hewlett and Philip Bond were the stars of Deadline  an independent comics and popular culture magazine founded by Steve Dillon and Brett Ewins  Smith created Indigo Prime  a multi dimensional organisation that polices reality  whose most memorable story was  Killing Time   a time travel story featuring Jack the Ripper  Garth Ennis and Philip Bond contributed Time Flies  a time travel comedy  and Hewlett was paired with writer Peter Milligan for the surreal Hewligan s Haircut  Writer John Tomlinson and artist Simon Jacob created Armoured Gideon  an action comedy series about a giant killer robot charged with keeping demons from invading earth  The Judge Dredd Megazine  a monthly title set in the world of Dredd  was launched in October 1990  With John Wagner focusing his attentions there  Garth Ennis became the regular writer of Dredd in the weekly  American writer Michael Fleisher  who had written The Spectre and Jonah Hex in the 1970s  was recruited to write the continuing adventures of the new Rogue Trooper  along with several other strips  none of which went down very well  Another new writer who failed to set 2000 AD on fire was Mark Millar  whose revival of Robo Hunter was particularly unpopular  Millar has since gone on to become a successful writer of American superhero comics such as The Authority and The Ultimates  2000 AD went all colour about this time  prog 723  dated 23 March 1991   in response to a short lived new colour weekly  Toxic   launched by Pat Mills and many of the core 2000 AD team of creators  Toxic  only lasted 31 issues but many of the creators who had worked on the comic eventually found their way to work for 2000 AD  Button Man  a contemporary thriller by John Wagner and Arthur Ranson  was originally intended for Toxic  but ended up in 2000 AD and the film rights have been optioned  A new ABC Warriors series  written by Mills and Tony Skinner and painted by Kev Walker  began in 1991  in which Deadlock took over the warriors with his  Khaos  philosophy  The series is beautifully painted and often very funny  but some readers disliked the new direction and the regular humiliation of Hammerstein  citation needed  Robert Maxwell died in late 1991  and Fleetway was merged with London Editions  a Danish owned company which owned rights to Disney characters  to become Fleetway Editions  In 1992  2000 AD and the Judge Dredd Megazine ran their first crossover story   Judgement Day   in which zombies overran Mega City One  Written by Garth Ennis and drawn by Carlos Ezquerra  Peter Doherty  Dean Ormston and Chris Halls  the story teamed Judge Dredd with Johnny Alpha through the medium of time travel  John Smith and artist Paul Marshall created Firekind  a slow paced story about dragons and alien societies  which was accidentally published with its episodes in the wrong order  The Strontium Dog world was eventually spun out to encompass a wider field  gaining the name Strontium Dogs   characters such as female vampire Durham Red  the albino Feral Jackson  and former Johnny Alpha sidekick The Gronk   the latter  normally a timid creature with weak  heartses   became a gung ho action character upon learning of Alpha s death  However  in the 12 parter The Darkest Star  it transpires that the one to actually kill him was the Gronk himself  changed into a form designed by a cadre of Lyran necromancers to bring him endless agony  Alpha asked his friend to end his torment  The  Summer Offensive  was an eight week experiment in 1993  when the comic was handed over to writers Grant Morrison  Mark Millar and John Smith  to a mixed reception  Morrison wrote a Dredd story   Inferno   and a drug influenced comedy adventure  Really  amp  Truly  Smith contributed Slaughterbowl  in which convicted criminals on dinosaurs are pitted against each other in a deadly sport  with the survivor being granted his freedom  Millar wrote Maniac 5  an action packed series about a remote controlled war robot  By far the most controversial story of this run  though  was Big Dave  a satire of British tabloid attitudes starring  Manchester s hardest man   In Big Dave s world  the German national football team really are Nazis  single mothers really do get a fortune in state handouts  Diana  Princess of Wales and Sarah  Duchess of York are portrayed as gold digging tarts making fools of the Royal family  and Saddam Hussein  who rides an ostrich  is in league with aliens who want to turn earthlings into  poofs   Written by Morrison and Millar and drawn by Steve Parkhouse  Big Dave divided readers like nothing else the comic had ever published  citation needed  A second crossover between 2000 AD and the Megazine   Wilderlands   began in 1994  Written by Wagner and drawn by Ezquerra  Mick Austin and Trevor Hairsine  it followed on from  Mechanismo   a series of stories in the Megazine in which Justice Department  opposed by Dredd  tried to introduce robot judges  With Wagner writing  Judge Dredd was again the flagship strip  A long running storyline   The Pit   was an ensemble based police procedural which had Dredd take a desk job as chief of a particularly crime ridden sector of the city  But 2000 AD s quality had dropped throughout the early 1990s  with a corresponding drop in readership  The long awaited Judge Dredd movie was released in 1995  but was poorly received and failed to provide any boost to circulation  citation needed  Former Megazine editor David Bishop became editor of the weekly in late 1995 but sales continued to decline  Unsuccessful series were dropped  and a number of new series were tried out  some more successful than others  Writer Dan Abnett introduced Sinister Dexter in 1996  a strip about two hitmen influenced by the film Pulp Fiction  which became a regular feature  In 1997  writer Robbie Morrison and artist Simon Fraser  who had worked with Bishop on the Megazine  created Nikolai Dante  a swashbuckling series set in future Russia starring a thief and ladies  man who discovers he s the illegitimate scion of an aristocratic dynasty  There were also gimmicks  like the  sex issue   sold in a clear plastic wrapper  The Spacegirls  a series attempting to cash in on the popularity of the Spice Girls  B L A I R  1  a parody of Tony Blair based on M A C H  1  and an adaptation of the Danny Boyle film A Life Less Ordinary  A new Dredd epic   Doomsday   appeared in 1999 and again ran in both 2000 AD and the Megazine  Wagner had been laying the foundations for this story for several years  introducing the main villain  semi robotic gang lord Nero Narcos  and supporting characters like Judge Edgar of the Public Surveillance Unit  and Galen DeMarco  a former judge who had quit after falling in love with Dredd and become a private eye  1999 also saw the return of another character  Nemesis the Warlock  After a break of ten years  writer Pat Mills decided to bring the story to an end with  The Final Conflict   The series was drawn by Henry Flint in a style that recalled Kevin O Neill s early work on the series  as well as Simon Bisley s ABC Warriors work  The decade ended with a special 100 page issue called  Prog 2000   Behind a cover by Brian Bolland  Nemesis wrapped up for good in a final episode drawn by Kevin O Neill  War broke out in Nikolai Dante  and writer Gordon Rennie and artist Mark Harrison introduced future war story Glimmer Rats  Another old favourite  Strontium Dog  was revived by Wagner and Ezquerra  telling new stories of Johnny Alpha set before his death  with the conceit that previous stories had been  folklore  and the new stories were  what really happened   allowing Wagner to revise continuity  The story was in fact an adaptation of a treatment Wagner had written for a TV pilot that was never made  citation needed   edit  The 2000s In the year of its title and beyond  2000 AD bounced back under the ownership of Rebellion  with editors Andy Diggle  Alan Barnes and Matt Smith at the helm  Rebellion continues to develop stories  and computer games  based on classic characters such as Rogue Trooper and Judge Dredd  and has also introduced a roster of new series including Shakara  The Red Seas and Caballistics  Inc   It has also published a tie in to the film Shaun of the Dead in a story written by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright  The comic continues to uncover new British talents  including Boo Cook  Dom Reardon and Al Ewing  It has also benefited from an improved dollar pound exchange rate that has meant the comic can now afford to re employ some of the talent thought lost to America  Recently when   a number of shorter self contained stories  partly created by the new wave of talent  have run including London Falling  Go Machine  Stone Island and Malone  Other developments include a revamping of the Judge Dredd Megazine which has included a section acting as a showcase for British small press comics  Starting in 1500 prog was a Judge Dredd story  The Connection   a  prelude  to a 23 part Judge Dredd epic  Origins  which filled in a lot of the details about Dredd s past  In prog 1526  1  dated 28 February 2007  2000 AD celebrated their 30th anniversary  2  The issue saw the start of two new storylines  Nikolai Dante  by Robbie Morrison and Simon Fraser  and Savage  by Pat Mills and Charlie Adlard   along with a one off episode of Flesh  by Pat Mills and Ramon Sola   The run up to this saw the first arcs of new series Stickleback and Kingdom  2000 AD was also made available online through Clickwheel  3  another Rebellion owned firm  In December 2007 they started making the latest issue available to download as a PDF 4  and then in early 2008 they announced they had added an archive of the 2007 issues to the service  5  They launched the Clickwheel Comics Reader in July 2008 that would allow the digital versions of the comics to be downloaded and read on the iPhone and iPod Touch  6   edit  List of stories A complete index of stories published in 2000 AD from 1977 to January 2012 is here   pdf file    7   edit  Continuity Main article  2000 AD crossovers Although there is no overall shared universe containing all 2000 AD stories  some stories spin off or crossover into other stories  Most notable are the many stories that occur in the Judge Dredd Universe and the early stories of Pat Mills  which are frequently interlinked and also link into the Dredd Universe   edit  Related publications The current sister publication to 2000 AD is the monthly Judge Dredd Megazine  which originally focused exclusively on expanding the world of Judge Dredd  but in recent years has expanded its focus to include other stories set in other universes as well  The bimonthly 2000 AD Extreme Edition presented reprints of classic and hard to find 2000AD stories  but poor sales led to its cancellation in mid 2008  Since the cancellation  a smaller reprint supplement has been packaged with the Judge Dredd Megazine instead  Starlord was a weekly title  originally intended to be monthly  launched in 1978 following much the same format as 2000 AD and included Strontium Dog and Ro Busters which introduced characters that would later reappear in ABC Warriors  The two titles were merged later the same year and published as 2000AD and Starlord  A third Starlord series  TimeQuake  also had a 4 week run in 2000AD over a year later  Tornado was a weekly title launched in 1979  There was less emphasis on Science Fiction series  It was merged with 2000 AD after 22 issues  transferring the strips Blackhawk  The Mind of Wolfie Smith and Captain Klep  For a while the publication was 2000AD and Tornado  Dice Man was an early attempt at creating a role playing comic featuring regular 2000 AD characters such as Rogue Trooper and Slaine  as well as original characters  like Diceman  The magazine was not a success and only lasted five issues  Crisis  1988 1991  was a sister publication that did not follow the format of 2000 AD  but did share many editorial staff and creative teams  Early issues featured two SF themed stories aimed at a slightly older age group than 2000 AD and soon became a magnet for British creators who wanted to create comics for the adult market  The 2000AD series Finn  begun the year after Crisis was cancelled  continues the adventures of the character from Third World War  though now with more of a fantasy emphasis  Revolver  1990 1991  joined Crisis though it only lasted for seven issues  Dan Dare was in the original lineup  and this transferred to Crisis when Revolver finished  Toxic  was a short lived rival publication  established by 2000 AD talent  that was published during 1991  A Best of 2000 AD title was published in the mid 1980s which featured reprint material from early issues of 2000 AD  In the early 1990s  The Complete Judge Dredd began publication in a similar format  Both titles were relaunched as Classic 2000AD and Classic Judge Dredd in the mid 1990s but were cancelled soon after  A yearly hardcover annual was published from 1977 to 1990  though the cover dates on the annuals were always the following year   From 1991 this was replaced by a softcover 2000AD Yearbook  the last of these was published in 1994  There were also annuals yearbooks dedicated to 2000AD characters such as Dan Dare  1978 1979  cover dated 1979 1980   Judge Dredd  1980 1994  and Rogue Trooper  1990   An annual 2000AD Sci Fi Special was published during the summer months between 1977 and 1996  plus the 2000AD Winter Special  1988 1995 and 2005   Judge Dredd Mega Special  1988 1996  and Rogue Trooper Action Special  1996    1996 s Judge Dredd Action Special was a tie in to the defunct Judge Dredd  Lawman of the Future rather than 2000AD proper   In April 1992  a 2000AD Action Special featured six strips reviving classic British comics characters such as the Steel Claw  Of these only Kelly s Eye also appeared in 2000AD proper  in 1993  though Tim Kelly had already appeared in a 1991 Universal Soldier serial   This was published in the incorrect belief that Fleetway s deal with IPC in 1987 had included the rights to these characters  In the mid 1990s a series of 2000AD Poster Progs were published  each featuring a new strip  There were five Judge Dredd poster magazines  plus one each for four other 2000AD series  Nemesis the Warlock  Strontium Dogs  Sl ine  and Rogue Trooper  A series of American comic format reprints started in 1983 by Eagle Comics with the first issue of an ongoing monthly Judge Dredd title  Eagle Comics also reprinted other 2000 AD material in other titles  The license to reprint 2000 AD material in the US was later taken over by Quality Comics  These reprints ended in the early 1990s   edit  Video game adaptations In 1987  Martech released well received games based on Nemesis the Warlock and Sl ine for the Amstrad CPC  Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum platforms  8 Krisalis Software released an adaptation of Rogue Trooper for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1991  and the merchandising that accompanied the 1995 Judge Dredd film included tie in games for the IBM PC  MS DOS   Game Boy  Game Gear  PlayStation  Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System  A Judge Dredd Pinball game was released for the PC  DOS  in 1998  With the purchase of 2000 AD by Rebellion Developments  a computer game company  several more 2000 AD linked games have been released or are under development  Judge Dredd  Dredd Vs  Death was released in 2003 and Rogue Trooper followed in 2006 for the Xbox  PlayStation 2 and PC  9  An updated version for the Wii has also been announced   edit  Famous creators Well known creators who have worked for 2000 AD include  Nick Abadzis Dan Abnett Massimo

independent fanzines  Between 1994 96   Fear The Badge  was an erstwhile but overly ambitious attempt at a 2000AD fanzine based around the Judge Dredd  Strontium Dog and Robo hunter universes  With original artwork  stories and articles  the fanzine would act as a showcase for talent wanting to break into comics  Its editor creator  Paul Dick  partially disabled himself  wanted to donate some of the zine s profits to a different disability charity each month  However  the fanzine s genesis was plagued by bad luck  not least of all Dick s health worsening  Despite the good intentions and hardwork of its creator  as well as the keen interest and support from both amateur and professional 2000AD contributors   the fanzine s full potential sadly never was realised  Only a dummy run of 50 copies of issue 1 were ever produced  In 1998 W R  Logan  frustrated at the lack of activity from the comic s publishers both in promoting the title and also in making best use of new talents  decided to create an independent title using 2000 AD copyrighted characters and situations  This was titled Class of  79  named after the year of Dredd s graduation from the Academy of Law   2079  The first couple of issues contained work from now professional comics creators Rufus Dayglo  Boo Cook  Henry Flint and PJ Holden and won the best Self Published Independent Comic Award at the 1999 National Comics Awards  In 2001  Andrew J  Lewis created Zarjaz comic  with strips featuring characters from a variety of 2000 AD stories  There were also interviews with Alan Grant  Frazer Irving and Alan Moore  as well as an extensive article on breaking into comics as a writer  Another long running fanzine  dedicated to the world of Johnny Alpha  is Dogbreath  originally run by the pseudonymous Dr Bob it is now being produced by FutureQuake Publishing  In 2003  Arthur Wyatt created FutureQuake  a fanzine devoted to the Future Shocks format  Although Class of  79 now appears to be on hiatus  all three of the other titles are in continuous publication  Zarjaz having started up again with a new issue 1  In addition  a number of small press comics have emerged from the 2000 AD fanbase  including Solar Wind  Omnivistascope and The End Is Nigh   edit  See also List of 2000 AD stories List of minor 2000 AD stories Action British comics British Invasion  which saw a number of 2000 AD artists and
