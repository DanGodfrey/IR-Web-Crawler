concepts MTV s super pre history began in 1977  when Warner Cable  a division of Warner Communications   and an ancestor of Warner Amex Satellite Entertainment  WASEC  launched the first two way interactive cable TV system  QUBE  in Columbus  Ohio  The QUBE system offered many specialized channels  One of these specialized channels was Sight On Sound  a music channel that featured concert footage and music oriented television programs  with the interactive QUBE service  viewers could vote for their favorite songs and artists  The original programming format of MTV was created by media executive Robert W  Pittman  who later became president and chief executive officer  CEO  of MTV Networks  3  Pittman had test driven the music format by producing and hosting a 15 minute show  Album Tracks  on WNBC in the late 1970s  Pittman s boss  WASEC Executive Vice President John Lack  had shepherded PopClips  a TV series created by former Monkee turned solo artist Michael Nesmith  whose attention had turned to the music video format by the late 1970s  4  The inspiration for PopClips came from a similar program on New Zealand s TVNZ network  Radio with Pictures  which premiered in 1976  The concept itself had been in the works since 1966  when major record companies began supplying the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation with promotional music clips to play on the air at no charge   Few artists made the long trip to New Zealand to appear live   Additionally  in the book The Mason Williams FCC Rapport  author Mason Williams states that he pitched an idea to CBS for a television program that featured  video radio   where disc jockeys would play avant garde art pieces set to music on the air  CBS cancelled the idea  but Williams premiered his own musical composition   Classical Gas   on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour  where he was head writer  The book in which this claim is made was first published in 1971  ten years before MTV first came on the air  The Beatles had utilized music videos since the mid 1960s and their debut movie  A Hard Day s Night  from 1964 is often claimed to be the true inspiration for the network  citation needed   edit  Music Television debuts The first images shown on MTV were a montage of the Apollo 11 moon landing Further information  First music videos aired on MTV On August 1  1981  at 12 01 a m   MTV launched with the words  Ladies and gentlemen  rock and roll   spoken by John Lack  and played over footage of the first Space Shuttle launch countdown of Columbia  which took place earlier that year  and of the launch of Apollo 11  Those words were immediately followed by the original MTV theme song  a crunching classical tune composed by Jonathan Elias and John Petersen  playing over photos of the Apollo 11 moon landing  with the flag featuring MTV s logo changing various colors  textures  and designs  MTV producers Alan Goodman and Fred Seibert used this public domain footage as a conceit  associating MTV with the most famous moment in world television history  5  Seibert said they had originally planned to use Neil Armstrong s  One small step  quote  but lawyers said Armstrong owns his name and likeness  and Armstrong had refused  so the quote was replaced with a beeping sound  6  At the moment of its launch  only a few thousand people on a single cable system in northern New Jersey could see it  Kenneth M  Miller is credited as being the first Technical Director to officially launch MTV from its New York based Network Operations facility  7  The first music video shown on MTV was The Buggles   Video Killed the Radio Star   The second video shown was Pat Benatar s  You Better Run   Sporadically  the screen would go black when an employee at MTV inserted a tape into a VCR  8  Video of the launch of MTV was uploaded onto YouTube in 2009  with the original commercials  and the  black screens  between videos  The  MTV lettering  differed on its first day  and included record label information like year and label name  The first 24 hours of programming was uploaded to YouTube in July 2010 ahead of the network s 30th anniversary  9  10   Carouselambra  by Led Zeppelin was played as the closing credits rolled when MTV was first broadcast  As programming chief  Robert W  Pittman recruited and managed a team for the launch that included Tom Freston  who succeeded Pittman as CEO of MTV networks   Fred Seibert  John Sykes  Carolyn Baker  original head of talent and acquisition   11  Marshall Cohen  original head of research   12  Gail Sparrow  of talent and acquisition   Sue Steinberg  executive producer   13  Julian Goldberg  Studio producers MTV News Writers Liz Nealon  Brian Diamond and Robin Zorn  Steve Casey  creator of the name MTV and its first program director   14  Marcy Brahman  Ronald E   Buzz  Brindle  and Robert Morton  14  MTV s effect was immediate in areas where the new music video channel could be picked up  Within a matter of just a couple of months  record shops in areas where MTV was available found themselves selling music that the local radio stations were not playing  such as Men at Work  Bow Wow Wow  and Human League  15   edit  Following concepts HBO also had a 30 minute program of music videos  called Video Jukebox  that first aired around the time of MTV s launch and would last until late 1986  Also around this time  HBO would occasionally play one or a few music videos between movies  citation needed  SuperStation WTBS launched Night Tracks on June 3  1983  with up to 14 hours of music video airplay each late night weekend by 1985  Its most noticeable difference was that black artists received airplay that MTV initially ignored  The program ran until the end of May 1992  A few markets also launched music only channels  most notably Las Vegas  KVMY Channel 21  which debuted in the summer of 1984 as KRLR TV Vusic 21  The first video played on that channel was Video Killed the Radio Star  following in the footsteps of MTV  citation needed  Shortly after TBS began Night Tracks  NBC launched its music video program called Friday Night Videos which was considered network television s answer to MTV  Later renamed simply Friday Night  the program ran from 1983 to sometime in the late 80s  ABC s contribution to the music video program genre in 1984  ABC Rocks  was far less successful  lasting only a year  16  TBS founder Ted Turner started the Cable Music Channel in 1984  designed to play a broader mix of music videos than MTV s rock format allowed  But after one month as a money losing venture  Turner sold it to MTV  who redeveloped the channel into VH1  17   edit  Music videos on MTV The original purpose of MTV was to be  Music Television   playing music videos 24 hours a day  7 days a week  guided by on air personalities known as VJs  or video jockeys  The original taglines of the channel were  You ll never look at music the same way again   and  On cable  In stereo   Although the original MTV channel no longer plays music videos 24 7  several spinoff channels do so  including MTV Hits and MTV Jams  In addition  videos can be played on demand at their website  Internationally  the station continues to support a broad selection of music including 4 channels in the UK that broadcast 23 hours of music video per day   edit  Original VJs and format Further information  List of MTV VJs MTV s early format was modeled after AOR  album oriented rock  radio  It would become a full top 40 station in 1984  Fresh faced young men and women were hired to host the network s programming and to introduce videos that were being played  The term VJ  video jockey  was coined  a play on the initialism DJ  disc jockey   Many VJs eventually became celebrities in their own right  The original five MTV VJs in 1981 were Nina Blackwood  Mark Goodman  Alan Hunter  J J  Jackson and Martha Quinn  18  The early music videos that made up the bulk of MTV s programming in the 1980s were promotional videos  called  promos  in the U K   that record companies had commissioned for international use or concert clips from whatever sources could be found  A large number of rock bands and performers of the 1980s were made popular by MTV  Such acts ranged from new wave to hard rock or heavy metal bands 19  such as Adam Ant  Eurythmics  20 Culture Club  21 Motley Crue  Split Enz  Prince  Ultravox  Duran Duran  22 Van Halen  23 Bon Jovi  RATT  24 Def Leppard  25 The Police  and The Cars  The network also rotated the videos of  Weird Al  Yankovic  who made a career out of parodying other artists  videos  26  MTV also played some classic rock acts from the 1980s and earlier decades  including David Bowie  Dire Straits  whose 1985 song and video  Money for Nothing  both referenced MTV and also included the slogan  I want my MTV  in its lyrics   Journey  Rush  John Mellencamp  Billy Joel  Genesis  Billy Squier  Robert Palmer  Rolling Stones  Rod Stewart  The Who and ZZ Top  newly solo acts such as Robert Plant  Phil Collins  Paul McCartney  David Lee Roth  and Pete Townshend  supergroup acts such as Asia  Power Station  The Firm  and Traveling Wilburys as well as forgotten acts such as Michael Stanley Band  Shoes  Blotto and Taxxi  The hard rock band Kiss publicly appeared without their trademark makeup for the first time on MTV in 1983  Also during the early days of the channel  the VJs would let other stars take over the channel within an hour as  Guest VJs  from musicians  Adam Ant  Billy Idol  Phil Collins  Simon LeBon and Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran  Tina Turner  to comedians  Eddie Murphy  Martin Short  Dan Aykroyd  Steven Wright  as they pick their favorite videos   edit  Breaking the  color barrier  Michael Jackson  whose discography included several important music videos such as Beat It  Billie Jean  and Thriller  During MTV s first few years on the air  very few black artists were included in rotation on the channel  Those who were in MTV s rotation included Eddy Grant  Tina Turner  Donna Summer  Musical Youth  Herbie Hancock  Grace Jones  and Prince  The very first non white act played on MTV in the US was UK band The Specials  which featured an integrated line up of white and black musicians and vocalists  The Specials  video  Rat Race  was played as the 58th video on the station s first day of broadcasting  27  MTV rejected other black artists  videos  such as Rick James   Super Freak   because they didn t fit the channel s carefully selected AOR format at the time  The exclusion enraged James  he publicly advocated the addition of more black artists  videos on the channel  Rock legend David Bowie also questioned MTV s lack of black artists during an on air interview with VJ Mark Goodman in 1983  28  MTV s original head of talent and acquisition  Carolyn B  Baker  who was black  had questioned why the definition of music had to be so narrow  as had a few others outside the network  Before 1983  Michael Jackson also struggled to receive airtime on MTV  29  To resolve the struggle and finally  break the color barrier   the president of CBS Records at the time  Walter Yetnikoff  denounced MTV in a strong  profane statement  threatening to take away MTV s ability to play any of the record label s music videos  29  30  However  Les Garland  then acquisitions head  said he decided to air Jackson s  Billie Jean  video without pressure from CBS  28  This was contradicted by CBS head of Business Affairs David Benjamin in Vanity Fair  6  In any case  MTV began showing the  Billie Jean  video in regular rotation in 1983  forming a lengthy partnership with Jackson and helping other black music artists  31  According to The Austin Chronicle  Jackson s video for the song  Billie Jean  was  the video that broke the color barrier  even though the channel itself was responsible for erecting that barrier in the first place   32  After airing Jackson s music videos  Jackson became even more popular  This move helped other black artists such as Prince  Whitney Houston  and Jackson s younger sister  Janet Jackson break into heavy rotation on the channel  Jonathan Cohen of Billboard magazine commented Janet Jackson s  accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV  and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader  beat driven musical mix   33  About the same time Michael Jackson was noted for making inroads   this also paved the way for rap hip hop music videos which was an evolving music genre  A majority of the rap artists e g  Run DMC  The Fat Boys  Whodini  L L  Cool J which had their music videos played on MTV were from the East Coast   edit  Other early criticism As early as 1983  because of MTV s visibility as a promotional tool for the recording industry  the channel was accused of devaluing the importance of music  replacing quality with a purely visual aesthetic and shunning equally popular but less image centric or single based acts  That year  Rolling Stone s Steven Levy wrote   MTV s greatest achievement has been to coax rock  amp  roll into the video arena where you can t distinguish between entertainment and the sales pitch   34  One musician that also criticized MTV for these reasons was Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys  the band released a song in 1985 titled  MTV  Get Off The Air   Various groups and individuals since then have criticized MTV for similar reasons  insisting that the channel has a responsibility as  Music Television  to play more music videos and uphold better critical standards for the music videos that they choose to feature in rotation   edit  Music video series Further information  List of programs broadcast by MTV MTV introduced 120 Minutes in 1986  a show that would feature low rotation  alternative rock and other  underground  videos for the next 14 years on MTV and three additional years on sister channel MTV2  The program then became known as Subterranean on MTV2  Then on July 31  2011  120 Minutes was resurrected with Matt Pinfield taking over hosting duties once again and airing monthly on MTV2  Another after hours show was added in 1987  Headbangers Ball  This popular show featured heavy metal music and news  Before its abrupt cancellation in 1995  it featured several hosts  notably Riki Rachtman and Adam Curry  Headbangers Ball remains an iconic identifier of heavy metal music  A weekly block of music videos with the name Headbangers Ball has aired since 2003 on sister channel MTV2  In 1988  MTV debuted Yo  MTV Raps  a hip hop rap formatted program  The program continued until August 1995  It was renamed to simply Yo  and played for one hour from 1995 until 1999  The concept was reintroduced as Direct Effect in 2000  which became Sucker Free in 2006 and was cancelled in 2008  after briefly celebrating the 20th anniversary of Yo  MTV Raps throughout the months of April and May 2008  Despite its cancellation on MTV  a weekly countdown of hip hop videos known as Sucker Free still airs on MTV2  By the beginning of the 1990s  the channel debuted Dial MTV  a daily top ten music video countdown show for which viewers could call the toll free telephone number 1 800 DIAL MTV to request a music video  Although Dial MTV was short lived  the phone number remained in use for video requests until 2006   edit  Live concerts Throughout its history  MTV has covered global benefit concert series live  For most of July 13  1985  MTV showed the Live Aid concerts  held in London and Philadelphia and organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia  While the ABC network showed only selected highlights during primetime  MTV broadcast 16 hours of coverage  35  In 1989  MTV began to premiere music based specials such as MTV Unplugged  an acoustic performance show  which has featured dozens of acts as its guests and has remained active in numerous iterations on various platforms for over 20 years  Along with VH1  MTV broadcast the Live 8 concerts  a series of concerts set in the G8 states and South Africa  on July 2  2005  36  Live 8 preceded the 31st G8 summit and 20th anniversary of Live Aid  MTV drew heavy criticism for its coverage of Live 8  The network cut to commercials  VJ commentary  or other performances during performances  Complaints surfaced on the Internet over MTV interrupting the reunion of Pink Floyd  37  In response  MTV president Van Toeffler stated that he wanted to broadcast highlights from every venue of Live 8 on MTV and VH1 and clarified that network hosts talked over performances only in transition to commercials  informative segments  or other musical performances  38  Toeffler acknowledged that  MTV should not have placed such a high priority on showing so many acts  at the expense of airing complete sets by key artists   37  He also blamed the Pink Floyd interruption on a mandatory cable affiliate break  38  MTV averaged 1 4 million viewers for its original July 2 broadcast of Live 8  37  Consequently  MTV and VH1 aired five hours of uninterrupted Live 8 coverage on July 9  with each channel airing different blocks of artists  39   edit  Rise of the directors By the early 1990s  MTV was playing a combination of pop friendly hard rock acts  chart topping metal and hard rock acts such as Metallica  Nirvana and Guns N  Roses  pop singers such as Michael Jackson  Madonna  2 Unlimited and New Kids on the Block  and R amp B quartets such as New Edition  Bell Biv Devoe  Tony Toni Tone  and Boyz II Men  while introducing hit rappers Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer  MTV progressively increased its airing of hip hop acts  such as LL Cool J  Naughty By Nature  Onyx and Sir Mix A Lot  and by 1993  the channel added West Coast rappers previously associated with gangsta rap  with a less pop friendly sound  such as Tupac Shakur  Ice Cube  Warren G  Dr  Dre and Snoop Dogg  To accompany the new sounds  a new form of music videos came about  more creative  funny  artistic  experimental  and technically accomplished than those in the 1980s  citation needed  Several noted film directors got their start creating music videos  After pressure from the MVPA  Music Video Producers Association   later changed to Music Video Production Association  MTV began listing the names of the videos  directors at the bottom of the credits by December 1992  As a result  MTV s viewers became familiar with the names of Spike Jonze  Michel Gondry  David Fincher  Samuel Bayer  Matt Mahurin  Mark Romanek  Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris  Anton Corbijn  Mark Pellington  Tarsem  Hype Williams  Jake Scott  Jonathan Glazer  Marcus Nispel  F  Gary Gray  Jim Yukich  Russell Mulcahy  Steve Barron and Marty Callner  among others  As the PBS series Frontline explored  MTV was a driving force that catapulted music videos to a mainstream audience  turning music videos into an art form as well as a marketing machine that became beneficial to artists  Danny Goldberg  chairman and CEO of Artemis Records  said the following about the art of music videos   I know when I worked with Nirvana  Kurt Cobain cared as much about the videos as he did about the records  He wrote the scripts for them  he was in the editing room  and they were part of his art  And I think they stand up as part of his art  and I think that s true of the great artists today  Not every artist is a great artist and not every video is a good video  but in general having it available as a tool  to me  adds to the business  And I wish there had been music videos in the heyday of the Beatles  and the Rolling Stones  I think they would ve added to their creative contribution  not subtracted from it   40  The Beatles did produce music videos specifically for television broadcast once their massive popularity made it less practical for them to appear in person   edit  Alternative is mainstream Nirvana led a sweeping transition into the rise of alternative rock music on MTV in 1991 with their popular video for  Smells Like Teen Spirit   By late 1991 going into 1992  MTV began frequently airing videos from their heavily promoted  Buzz Bin   such as Nirvana  Pearl Jam  Alice in Chains  Soundgarden  Nine Inch Nails  Tori Amos  PM Dawn  Arrested Development  Bj rk  and Gin Blossoms  MTV increased rotation of its weekly alternative music program 120 Minutes and added the daily Alternative Nation to play videos of these and other underground music acts  Subsequently  grunge and alternative rock had a rise in mainstream tastes  while 1980s style hair bands and traditional rockers were phased out  with some exceptions such as Aerosmith and Tom Petty  Older acts such as R E M  and U2 remained relevant by making their music more experimental or unexpected  In 1993  more hit alternative rock acts were on heavy rotation  such as Stone Temple Pilots  Soul Asylum  Rage Against the Machine  Tool  Beck  Therapy   Radiohead  and The Smashing Pumpkins  Other hit acts such as Weezer  Collective Soul  Blind Melon  The Cranberries  Bush  and Silverchair would follow in the next couple of years  Alternative bands that appeared on Beavis and Butthead also rose to fame  most notably White Zombie  By the next few years  1994 through 1997  MTV began promoting new power pop acts  most successfully Green Day and The Offspring  and ska rock acts such as No Doubt  The Mighty Mighty Bosstones  and Sublime  Pop singers were added to the rotation with success as long as they were considered  alternative   such as Alanis Morissette  Jewel  Fiona Apple  and Sarah McLachlan   edit  Electronica and pop By 1997  MTV focused heavily on introducing electronica acts into the mainstream  adding them to its musical rotation  Some of the more popular musicians of this group were The Prodigy  The Chemical Brothers  Moby  Aphex Twin  Daft Punk  The Crystal Method  and Fatboy Slim  Some other established musicians proceeded to experiment with electronica and be played on MTV  most notably Madonna  U2  David Bowie  Radiohead and Smashing Pumpkins  That year MTV also attempted to introduce neo swing bands  but they did not meet with much success  However  in late 1997  MTV began shifting more progressively towards pop music  inspired by the success of the Spice Girls and the rise of boy bands in Europe  Between 1998 and 1999  MTV s musical content consisted heavily of videos of boy bands such as Backstreet Boys and  N Sync as well as teen pop  princesses  such as Britney Spears  Christina Aguilera  Mandy Moore  and Jessica Simpson  Airplay of rock  electronica  and alternative acts was reduced  Hip hop music continued in heavy rotation  through the likes of Puff Daddy  Master P  DMX  Busta Rhymes  Jay Z  Missy Elliott  Eminem  Ja Rule and their associates  R amp B was also heavily represented with acts such as Destiny s Child and Brandy   edit  Total Request Live MTV Studios in Times Square Main article  Total Request Live Also by 1997  MTV was criticized heavily for not playing as many music videos as it had in the past  In response  MTV created four shows that centered around music videos  MTV Live  Total Request  Say What   and 12 Angry Viewers  Also at this time  MTV introduced its new studios in Times Square  A year later  in 1998  MTV merged Total Request and MTV Live into a live daily top ten countdown show  Total Request Live  which would become known as TRL and secure its place as the channel s unofficial flagship program  The original host of TRL  Carson Daly  brought popularity to the show  TRL spent its first year developing a cult type following  and every weekday  hundreds of fans would stand in Times Square outside the TRL studios  In the fall of 1999  a live studio audience was added to the show  By spring 2000  the countdown reached its peak  becoming a recognizable icon of popular culture in its first two years of existence  The program enjoyed success playing the top ten pop  rock  R amp B  and hip hop music videos  Korn s  Got the Life  is considered to be the first  retired  video from TRL  41  42  During the September 11 attacks  on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon  MTV suspended all of its programming along with its sister cable channel VH1  and it began simulcasting the CBS News coverage from its sister network until about 11 00 p m  that night  The channels then played a looped set of music videos without commercial interruption until an MTV News special edition of TRL aired on September 14  2001  In 2002  Carson Daly left MTV and TRL to pursue a late night talk show on NBC  after his departure  the relevance and impact of Total Request Live slowly diminished  TRL ultimately remained a part of MTV s regular program schedule for ten years  The series came to an end with a special finale episode  Total Finale Live  which aired November 16  2008  and featured many special guests from the history of the show and playing its last music video      Baby One More Time  by Britney Spears  43   edit  Return of the Rock Beginning in late 1997  MTV progressively reduced its airing of rock music videos  leading to the slogan among skeptics   Rock is dead   44  The fact that at the time rock music fans were less materialistic and bought less music based on television suggestion were cited as reasons that MTV abandoned its once staple music  MTV instead devoted its musical airtime mostly to pop and hip hop R amp B music  All rock centric shows were eliminated and the rock related categories of the Video Music Awards were pared down to one  From this time until 2004  MTV made some periodic efforts to reintroduce pop rock music videos to the channel  By 1998 through 1999  the punk rock band Blink 182 received regular airtime on MTV due in large part to their  All the Small Things  video that made fun of the boy bands that MTV was airing at the time  Meanwhile  some rock bands that were not receiving MTV support  such as Korn and Creed  continued to sell albums  Then  upon the release of Korn s rock rap hybrid album Follow the Leader  MTV began playing Korn s videos  Got the Life  and  Freak on a Leash   which became popular  A band sponsored by Korn  Limp Bizkit  received airtime for its cover of George Michael s  Faith   which became a hit  Subsequently  MTV began airing more rap rock hybrid acts  such as Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock  Some rock acts with more comical videos  such as Rob Zombie  Red Hot Chili Peppers  and Foo Fighters  also received airtime  In the fall of 1999  MTV announced a special Return of the Rock weekend  45  in which new rock acts received airtime  after which a compilation album was released  System of a Down  Staind  Godsmack  Green Day  Incubus  Papa Roach  P O D   Sevendust  Powerman 5000  Slipknot  Kittie  and Static X were among the featured bands  These bands received some airtime on MTV and more so on MTV2  though both channels gave emphasis to the rock rap acts  By 2000  Sum 41  Linkin Park  Jimmy Eat World  Mudvayne  Cold  At the Drive In  Alien Ant Farm  and other acts were added to the musical rotation  MTV also launched digital cable channel MTVX to play rock music videos exclusively  an experiment that lasted until 2002  46  A daily music video program on MTV that carried the name Return of the Rock ran through early 2001  replaced by a successor  All Things Rock  from 2002 until 2004   edit  Milestones and specials Around 1999 through 2001  as MTV aired fewer music videos throughout the day  it regularly aired compilation specials from its then 20 year history to look back on its roots  An all encompassing special  MTV Uncensored  premiered in 1999 and was later released as a book  47  48  MTV celebrated its 20th anniversary on August 1  2001  beginning with a 12 hour retrospective called MTV20  Buggles to Bizkit  which featured over 100 classic videos played chronologically  hosted by various VJs in reproductions of MTV s old studios  The day of programming culminated in a 3 hour celebratory live event called MTV20  Live and Almost Legal  which was hosted by Carson Daly and featured numerous guests from MTV s history  including the original VJs from 1981  Various other related MTV20 specials aired in the months surrounding the event  Janet Jackson became the inaugural honoree of the  mtvICON  award   an annual recognition of artists who have made significant contributions to music  music video and pop culture while tremendously impacting the MTV generation   49  Subsequent recipients included Aerosmith  Metallica  and The Cure  Five years later  on August 1  2006  MTV celebrated its 25th anniversary  On their website  MTV com  visitors could watch the very first hour of MTV  including airing the original promos and commercials from Mountain Dew  Atari  Chewels gum  and Jovan  Videos were also shown from The Buggles  Pat Benatar  Rod Stewart  and others  The introduction of the first five VJs was also shown  Additionally  MTV com put together a  yearbook  consisting of the greatest videos of each year from 1981 to 2006  MTV itself only mentioned the anniversary once on TRL   edit  Fewer music videos Despite targeted efforts to play certain types of music videos in limited rotation  MTV greatly reduced its overall rotation of music videos throughout the early mid 2000s  While music videos were featured on MTV up to eight hours per day in 2000  2008 saw an average of just three hours of music videos per day on MTV  The rise of the Internet as a convenient outlet for the promotion and viewing of music videos signaled this reduction  50  As the decade progressed  MTV continued to play some music videos instead of relegating them exclusively to its sister channels  but around this time  the channel began to air music videos only in the early morning hours or in a condensed form on Total Request Live  As a result of these programming changes  Justin Timberlake challenged MTV to  play more damn videos   while giving an acceptance speech at the 2007 Video Music Awards  51  Despite the challenge from Timberlake  MTV continued to decrease its total rotation time for music videos in 2007  and the channel eliminated its long running special tags for music videos such as  Buzzworthy   for under represented artists    Breakthrough   for visually stunning videos   and  Spankin  New   for brand new videos   Additionally  the historic Kabel typeface  which MTV displayed at the beginning and end of all music videos since 1981  was phased out in favor of larger text and less information about the video s record label and director  The classic font can still be seen in  prechyroned  versions of old videos on sister network VH1 Classic  which had their title information recorded onto the same tape as the video itself  For most of 2008  MTV s main source of music video programming was still Total Request Live  airing four times per week  featuring short

on June 15  2009  The host of the program  Alexa Chung  has been described as a  younger  more Web 2 0  version of Jimmy Fallon  55  Although it is filmed in the same Times Square studio where TRL used to be located  the network stated that  the only thing the two shows have in common is the studio location   56 It s On was cancelled in December of the same year  which again eliminated the only live in studio programming from MTV s schedule  just one year after TRL was also cancelled  Shortly after music and pop culture icon Michael Jackson died on June 25  2009  MTV briefly returned to its original music video format to celebrate his work  57  The channel aired many hours of Jackson s music videos  accompanied by live news specials featuring reactions from MTV personalities and other celebrities  The temporary shift in MTV s programming culminated the following week with the channel s live coverage of Jackson s memorial service  58  MTV again resurrected the long running series MTV Unplugged in 2009 with performances from acts such as Adele  Katy Perry  and Paramore  59  However  unlike past Unplugged specials  these new recordings usually only air in their entirety on MTV s website  MTV com  Nevertheless  short clips of the specials are shown on MTV during the AMTV block of music videos in the early morning hours  In May 2010  MTV launched 10 on Top  a weekly program that counts down the top 10 most trending and talked about topics of the week  MTV s web site describes the program as   a half hour countdown of the top 10 most texted and talked about young celebs

and events   The show went on hiatus in mid June 2011  According to host Lenay Dunn s Twitter feed  the show will return August 20  2011 with new shows  In September 2010  MTV tried its hand again at a live half hour program called The Seven  The Seven counted down the top seven things you should know about  having aired weekdays at 5 p m  with a weekend wrap up at 10 a m  The show was slightly retooled as it dropped host Julia Alexander and kept host Kevin Manno  The Saturday show was eliminated as well  Like its predecessor   The Seven  saw its cancellation on June 13  2011  Manno  per The Seven s Twitter feed  said he is still with MTV  Manno s only MTV assignment post Seven was conducting an interview with a band which only aired on MTV com  Today  Manno is no longer employed with MTV

Wayne and the show debuted both on MTV and MTV2  Although MTV was in their 30th year of broadcasting in 2011  the network apparently ignored this milestone in favor of its current programming schedule  They ve outsourced all of their 30th Anniversary Celebrations to its sister networks MTV2 and VH1 Classic  Nathaniel Brown  senior vice president of communications for MTV  confirmed that there were no plans for an on air MTV celebration like what they did 10 years ago when MTV celebrated its 20th Anniversary  Brown explained   MTV as a brand doesn t age with our viewers  We are really focused on our current viewers  and our feeling was that our anniversary wasn t something that would be meaningful to them  many of whom weren t even alive in 1981   60  In October 2011  Beavis and Butt Head returned to MTV with new episodes  61  Throughout 2011 and still to today  MTV has an unofficial show called MTV First  The MTV News produced piece typically airs every few weeks on any given weekday and typically starts at 7 56PM ET on air to start the interview with the featured artist or actor premiering a video or movie trailer  After 8PM  MTV starts its next scheduled program  while the interview and fan chat continues on MTV com only  MTV has made no official statement about MTV First  nor does First have a dedicated Show page online  but where once TRL  Chung and Seven facilitated such segments  it is clear MTV uses First as its new approach to bait viewers to its web site to finish the show after starting it on TV  In April 2012  MTV will rediscover its musical past when it launches a new music video hip hop based show 62  hosted by a presented Charlamagne  MTV Hip Hop POV airs every Wednesday from April 4  2012  In Summer 2012  MTV will launch a music discovery web site called Artists MTV  MTV says   While technology has made it way easier for artists to produce and distribute their own music on their own terms  it hasn t made it any simpler to find a way to cut through all the Internet noise and speak directly to all of their potential fans  The summer launch of Artists MTV is an attempt to help music junkies and musicians close the gap by providing a one stop place where fans can listen to and buy music and purchase concert tickets and merchandise    edit  Censorship Main article  Censorship on MTV MTV has edited a number of music videos to remove references to drugs  63 sex  violence  weapons  racism  homophobia  or advertising  64  Many music videos aired on the channel were censored  moved to late night rotation  or banned entirely from the channel  In the 1980s  parent media watchdog groups such as the Parents Music Resource Center criticized MTV over certain music videos that were claimed to have explicit imagery of satanism  MTV has developed a strict policy on refusal to air videos that may depict devil worship or anti religious themes  65  This policy led MTV to ban music videos such as  Jesus Christ Pose  by Soundgarden in 1991 66  and  Megalomaniac  by Incubus in 2004  67   edit  Other programs on MTV As MTV expanded  music videos were no longer the centerpiece of its programming  Conventional TV shows came to replace

as a  brand   with a unified vocabulary  voice  and visual identity  Senior management  including John Lack  Bob Pittman  and Fred Seibert  all started their careers in radio  which had developed station brands as a critical audience development tool for decades  and Seibert led the teams that became directly responsible for the brand s creation  MTV s logo  the large block letter  M  with graffiti style letters  TV  superimposed and the words  Music Television  underneath  quickly became ubiquitous and instantly recognizable in popular culture  The last three decades have brought some change and evolution to MTV s iconic image and branding   edit  Original logos and IDs An early MTV station ID by Henry Selick The MTV logo was designed in 1981 by Manhattan Design  a collective formed by Frank Olinsky  88  Pat Gorman  and Patty Rogoff  under the guidance of MTV s original creative director  Fred Seibert  The  M  was sketched by Rogoff  with the  TV  spray painted by Olinksky  89  Throughout MTV s early days  the channel s main logo was a large yellow  M  with red letters  TV   but unlike most networks  logos  the MTV logo constantly morphed and adapted with different colors  patterns  and images filling in the large block letter  The very first moments of MTV featured an adaptation of the first landing on the moon  directly from NASA still images  a concept of Seibert s  executed by Buzz Potamkin and Perpetual Motion Pictures   90  After the  moon landing   as well as the top of every hour until at least the mid 1980s  which ran  more than 15 000  times each year  according to Seibert   90  featured a rapidly changing station ID logo that changed its appearance several times per second  The only constant aspects of MTV s logo at the time were its general shape and proportions  everything else was dynamic  91  The channel s most popular image and branding campaign   I want my MTV    was launched in 1982  The media strategy and creative executions were developed by George Lois  based on a cereal commercial from the 1950s   I want my Maypo   that George created  92  Over the years the campaign featured known artists and celebrities including Pete Townshend  Pat Benatar  Adam Ant  David Bowie  The Police  Kiss  Culture Club  Billy Idol  Hall  amp  Oates  Cyndi Lauper  Madonna  Lionel Richie  Ric Ocasek  John Mellencamp  Peter Wolf  Joe Elliot  Stevie Nicks  Rick Springfield and Mick Jagger interacting with the MTV logo on air  encouraging viewers to call their cable or satellite providers and request that MTV be added to

edit  1990s and 2000s updates MTV s original 1981 and revised 2009 logos both feature dynamic patterns and images Once MTV s original morphing logo had run its course  the channel began to use a solid color white logo that was otherwise the same as the original  During the late 1990s and early 2000s  MTV updated its on air appearance at the beginning of every year and again each summer  creating a consistent brand across all of its music related shows  This style of channel wide branding came to an end as MTV drastically reduced its number of music related shows in the early to mid 2000s  At this time  MTV introduced a static  single color digital on screen graphic during all of its other programming   edit  2010 rebranding Since the premiere of the short lived FNMTV in 2008  MTV has used a revised  chopped version of its traditional logo during most of its on air programming  The revised logo is largely the same as MTV s original logo  but it excludes the  Music Television  caption  the bottom section of the  M  block letter  and the trailing letter  V  that branched off to the side of the original logo  93  However  much like the ever changing patterns that filled MTV s original 1981 logo  the new 2010 logo is designed to be filled in with an unlimited variety of pictures and images  This new logo formally became MTV s official brand mark on February 8  2010  when it debuted on MTV s website  94  The channel s long running official tagline  Music Television  was officially dropped at this time  93  It is used worldwide  except for several countries  as of July 1  2011  It was first adopted for MTV Films with the 2010 release Jackass 3D  MTV s rebranding was overseen by Popkern  95   edit  Moral influence and controversies MTV s near ubiquitous presence in popular culture for 30 years has led the channel to be in the center of the ongoing debate over the cultural and moral influence of music and television on young people and society  The channel has thus found itself a target of criticism by various groups about programming choices  social issues  political correctness  sensitivity  censorship  and a perceived negative moral influence on young people  96  In 2005  the Parents Television Council released a study titled MTV Smut Peddlers  which sought to expose what PTC believed was excessive sexual  profane  and violent content on the channel  based on MTV s Spring Break programming from 2004  97  Jeanette Kedas  an MTV network executive  called the PTC report  unfair and inaccurate  and  underestimating young people s intellect and level of sophistication   while L  Brent Bozell III  then president of the PTC  stated that  the incessant sleaze on MTV presents the most compelling case yet for consumer cable choice   referring to the practice of cable and satellite companies to allow consumers to pay for channels   la carte  98  The Christian right organization American Family Association has also criticized MTV from perceptions of negative moral influence  99  even going as far as to describe MTV as promoting a  pro sex  anti family  pro choice  drug culture   100  In April 2008  PTC released The Rap on Rap  a study covering

its success  MTV was invited back to produce another Super Bowl halftime show  which would spark a moral influence debate and lead to sweeping changes in Super Bowl halftime shows  MTV s own programming  and even music played on the radio  When CBS aired Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004  its sister network was again chosen to produce the halftime show  with performances by such artists as Nelly  Diddy  Janet Jackson  and Justin Timberlake  The show became controversial after Timberlake tore off part of Jackson s outfit while performing his hit song  Rock Your Body  with her  revealing her right breast  All involved parties apologized for the incident  and Timberlake referred to the incident as a  wardrobe malfunction   104  Michael Powell  then chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  ordered an investigation of the show the day after its broadcast  104  In the weeks following the controversial halftime show  MTV censored much of its programming  Several music videos  including  This Love  by Maroon 5 and  I Miss You  by Blink 182  were edited for sexual content  67  In September 2004  the FCC ruled that the halftime show was indecent and fined CBS  550 000  105

performed at Super Bowl XLV in 2011   edit  Jersey Shore controversy Main article  Controversies of Jersey Shore MTV received a significant amount of criticism from Italian American organizations for the show Jersey Shore  which premiered in December 2009  108  The controversy was due in large part to the manner in which MTV marketed the show  as it liberally used the word Guido to describe the cast members  The word Guido is generally regarded as an ethnic slur when referring to Italians and Italian Americans  One promotion stated that the show was to follow   eight of the hottest  tannest  craziest Guidos   109  while yet another advertisement stated    the show  exposes one of the tri state area s most misunderstood species    the GUIDO  Yes  they really do exist  Our Guidos and

disgraceful attack on Italian Americans     112  UNICO National President Andre DiMino said in a statement  MTV has festooned the  bordello like  house set with Italian flags and red  white and green maps of New Jersey while every other cutaway shot is of Italian signs and symbols  They are blatantly as well as subliminally bashing Italian Americans with every technique possible     113  Around this time  other Italian organizations joined the fight  including the NIAF  114  the Order Sons of Italy in America and the internet watch dog  115  116  MTV responded to the controversy by issuing a press release which stated in part   the Italian American cast takes pride in their ethnicity  We understand that this show is not intended for every audience and depicts just one aspect of youth culture   108  Since the calls for the show s removal  several sponsors have requested that their ads not be aired during the show  These sponsors include Dell  Domino s and American Family Insurance

the 2004 U S  Presidential election  airing programs focused on the issues and opinions of young people  including a program where viewers could ask questions of Senator John Kerry  123  MTV worked with P  Diddy s  Vote or Die  campaign  designed to encourage young people to vote  124  Additionally  MTV aired a documentary covering a trip by the musical group Sum 41 to the Democratic Republic of Congo  documenting the conflict there  The group ended up being caught in the midst of an attack outside of the hotel and were subsequently flown out of the country  125  The channel also began showing presidential campaign commercials for the first time during the 2008 US presidential election  126  This has led to criticism from the right  with Jonah Goldberg opining that  MTV serves as the Democrats  main youth outreach program   127   edit  Fight For Your Rights In the 1990s and early 2000s  MTV promoted annual campaigns known as Fight For Your Rights  with the slogan  Speak Out Stand Up Against Violence   to bring forth awareness on America s crime  drugs and violence issues  On April 6  2001  MTV voluntarily ceased regular programming for 24 hours as part of the year s hate crimes awareness campaign  On that night  MTV aired a made for TV movie Anatomy of a Hate Crime  based on a true story of the 1998 murder of 21 year old Matthew Shepard  a gay college student  After the film and a discussion  MTV went dark and showed names of hate crime victims   edit  think MTV MTV s most recent activism campaign is think MTV  which discusses current political issues such as same sex marriage  U S  elections  and war in other countries  The slogan of the program is  Reflect  Decide  Do   As part of think MTV  the channel also airs a series of pro conservation ads called Break The Addiction  as a way of encouraging their viewers to find ways to use less fossil fuels and energy  think MTV addresses twelve major issue areas  discrimination  environment  politics  health  amp  self  crime  amp  violence  poverty  amp  disease  human rights  war  amp  peace  relationships  amp  sex  faith  substance abuse  and education  Young people are encouraged to choose the issues that resonate most and take action to make a positive change  The motto is   Your cause  Your effect   think MTV is also integrated in MTV s current programming   edit  Beyond MTV Since its launch in 1981  the brand  MTV  has expanded to include many additional properties beyond the original MTV channel  including a variety of sister channels in the U S   dozens of affiliated channels around the world  and an Internet presence through MTV com and related websites   edit  Sister channels in the U S  Further information  MTV Networks MTV operates a group of channels under the name MTV Networks  a division of its corporate parent  Viacom  In 1985  MTV saw the introduction of its first true sister channel  VH1  which was originally an acronym for  Video Hits One  and was designed to play adult contemporary music videos  Today  VH1 is aimed at celebrity and popular culture programming  Another sister channel  CMT  targets the country music and southern culture market  The advent of satellite television and digital cable brought MTV greater channel diversity  including its current sister channels MTV2 and MTV Tr3s  now Tr3s   which initially played music videos exclusively but now focus on other programming  Music videos still occupy most of the schedule on two additional channels  MTV Hits and MTV Jams  MTV also broadcasts mtvU  a college oriented channel on campus at various universities  Recently  MTV began broadcasting with Chirs Wowkanyn MTV HD   a 1080i high definition simulcast of MTV  However only the network s original series after 2010  with some pre 2010 content  are aired in high definition  while music videos  despite being filmed for high definition presentation  are still presented in 4 3 standard definition  forcing them into a windowboxing type of presentation  DirecTV  Dish Network  Comcast  Time Warner Cable  U verse   amp  Verizon FiOS carry the HD channel  MTV Networks also operates Palladia  a high definition channel that features original HD programming and HD versions of programs from MTV  VH1  and CMT  The station was launched in January 2006 as MHD  Music  High Definition   The channel was officially rebranded as Palladia on September 1  2008 to coincide with the shift to more exclusive HD programming  128  In 2005 and 2006  MTV launched a series of channels for Asian Americans  The first channel was MTV Desi  launched in July 2005  dedicated toward South Asian Americans  Next was MTV Chi  in December 2005  which catered to Chinese Americans  The third was MTV K  launched in June 2006 and targeted toward Korean Americans  Each of these channels featured music videos and shows from MTV s international affiliates as well as original U S  programming  promos  and packaging  All three of these channels ceased broadcasting on April 30  2007   edit  The Internet MTV com in 2008 In the late 1980s  before the World Wide Web  in the days of the Gopher protocol  MTV VJ Adam Curry began experimenting on the Internet  He registered the then unclaimed domain name  MTV com  in 1993 with the idea of being MTV s unofficial new voice on the Internet  Although this move was sanctioned by his supervisors at MTV Networks at the time  when Curry left to start his own web portal design and hosting company  MTV subsequently sued him for the domain name  which led to an out of court settlement  129  The service hosted at the domain name was originally branded  MTV Online  during MTV s first few years of control over it in the mid 1990s  It served as a counterpart to the America Online portal for MTV content  which existed at AOL keyword MTV until approximately the end of the 1990s  After this time  the website became known as simply  MTV com  and served as the Internet home base for all MTV and MTV News content  MTV com experimented with entirely video based layouts between 2005 and 2007  The experiment began in April 2005 as MTV Overdrive  a streaming video service that supplemented the regular MTV com website  130  Shortly after the 2006 Video Music Awards  which were streamed on MTV com and heavily utilized the MTV Overdrive features  MTV introduced a massive change for MTV com  transforming the entire site into a Flash video based entity  131  Much of users  feedback about the Flash based site was negative  demonstrating a dissatisfaction with videos that played automatically  commercials that could not be skipped or stopped  and the slower speed of the entire website  The experiment ended in February 2006 as MTV com reverted to a traditional HTML based website design with embedded video clips  in the style of YouTube and other popular video based websites  132  Today  MTV com is still the official website of MTV  and it expands on the channel s broadcasts by bringing additional content to its viewers  The site s notable features include an online version of MTV News  podcasts  and a video streaming service supported by commercials  There are also movie features  profiles and interviews with recording artists and from MTV s television programs  The channel responded to the rise of the Internet as the new central place to watch music videos in October 2008 by launching MTV Music  a website that features thousands of music videos from MTV and VH1 s video libraries  dating back to the earliest videos from 1981  A newly created division of the company  MTV New Media  announced in 2008 that it would produce its own original web series  in an attempt to create a bridge between old and new media  133  The programming is available to viewers via personal computers  cell phones  iPods  and other digital devices  134   edit  MTV around the world Further information  List of MTV channels MTV Networks has also launched numerous native language regional
