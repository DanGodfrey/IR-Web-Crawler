Minnesota See also  List of lakes in Minnesota and List of Minnesota rivers Tilted beds of the Middle Precambrian Thompson Formation in Jay Cooke State Park 10  Minnesota contains some of the oldest rocks found on earth  gneisses some 3 6 billion years old  or 80  as old as the planet  11  10  About 2 7 billion years ago  basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the primordial ocean  the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota  10  12  The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota  Following a period of volcanism 1 1 billion years ago  Minnesota s geological activity has been more subdued  with no volcanism or mountain formation  but with repeated incursions of the sea  which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock  10  In more recent times  massive ice sheets at least one kilometer thick ravaged the landscape of the state and sculpted its current terrain  10  The Wisconsin glaciation left 12 000 years ago  10  These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast  an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock  This area is known as the Driftless Zone for its absence of glacial drift  13  Much of the remainder of the state outside of the northeast has 50 feet  15 m  or more of glacial till left behind as the last glaciers retreated  Gigantic Lake Agassiz formed in the northwest 13 000 years ago  Its bed created the fertile Red River valley  and its outflow  glacial River Warren  carved the valley of the Minnesota River  10  Minnesota is geologically quiet today  it experiences earthquakes infrequently  and most of them are minor  14  Palisade Head on Lake Superior formed from a Precambrian rhyolitic lava flow  10  The state s high point is Eagle Mountain at 2 301 feet  701 m   which is only 13 miles  21 km  away from the low of 602 feet  183 m  at the shore of Lake Superior

Fort Snelling  by the St  Croix River near Hastings  by the Chippewa River at Wabasha  and by many smaller streams  The Red River  in the bed of glacial Lake Agassiz  drains the northwest part of the state northward toward Canada s Hudson Bay  Approximately 10 6 million acres  42 900 km   of wetlands are contained within Minnesota s borders  the most of any state except Alaska  18   edit  Flora

western parts of the state  the Eastern Broadleaf Forest  Big Woods  in the southeast  extending in a narrowing strip to the northwestern part of the state  where it transitions into Tallgrass Aspen Parkland  and the northern Laurentian Mixed Forest  a transitional forest between the northern boreal forest and broadleaf forests to the south  19  These northern forests are a vast wilderness of pine and spruce trees mixed with patchy stands of birch and poplar  Much of Minnesota s northern forest underwent logging at some time  leaving only a few patches of old growth forest today in areas such as in the Chippewa National Forest and the Superior National Forest where the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness has some 400 000 acres  161 874 ha  of unlogged land  20  Although logging continues  regrowth keeps about one third of the state forested  21  Nearly all of Minnesota s prairies and oak savannas have been destroyed or fragmented because of farming  grazing  logging  and suburban development  22  While loss of habitat has affected native animals such as the pine marten  elk  woodland caribou  and bison  23  others like whitetail deer and bobcat thrive  The state has the nation s largest population of timber wolves outside Alaska  24  and supports healthy populations of black bear and moose  Located on the Mississippi Flyway  Minnesota hosts migratory waterfowl

article  History of Minnesota Map of Minnesota Territory 1849 1858 Before European settlement  Minnesota was populated by the Anishinaabe  the Dakota  and other Native Americans  The first Europeans were French fur traders that arrived in the 17th century  Late that century  Ojibwe Indians migrated westward to Minnesota  causing tensions with the Sioux  31  Explorers such as Daniel Greysolon  Sieur du Lhut  Father Louis Hennepin  Jonathan Carver  Henry Schoolcraft  and Joseph Nicollet  among others  mapped out the state  The portion of the state east of the Mississippi River became a part of the United States at the end of the American Revolutionary War  when the Second Treaty of Paris was signed  Land west of the Mississippi River was acquired with the Louisiana Purchase  although a portion of the Red River Valley was disputed until the Treaty of 1818  32  In 1805  Zebulon Pike bargained with Native Americans to acquire land at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers  The construction of Fort Snelling followed between 1819 and 1825  33  Its soldiers built a grist mill and a sawmill at Saint Anthony Falls  the first of the water powered industries around which the city of Minneapolis later grew  Meanwhile  squatters  government officials  and tourists had settled near the fort  In 1839  the Army forced them to move downriver  and they settled in the area that became St  Paul  34 Minnesota Territory was formed on March 3  1849  Thousands of people had come to build farms and cut timber  and Minnesota became the 32nd U S  state on May 11  1858  Settlers escaping the Dakota War of 1862 Treaties between European settlers and the Dakota and Ojibwe gradually forced the natives off their lands and on to smaller reservations  As conditions deteriorated for the Dakota  tensions rose  leading to the Dakota War of 1862  35  The result of the six week war was the execution of 38 Dakota   the largest mass execution in United States history   and the exile of most of the rest of the Dakota to the Crow Creek Reservation in Nebraska  32  As many as 800 white settlers died during the war  36  Logging and farming were mainstays of Minnesota s early economy  The sawmills at Saint Anthony Falls  and logging centers like Marine on St  Croix  Stillwater  and Winona  processed high volumes of lumber  These cities were situated on rivers that were ideal for transportation  32  Later  Saint Anthony Falls was tapped to provide power for flour mills  Innovations by Minneapolis millers led to the production of Minnesota  patent  flour  which commanded almost double the price of  bakers  or  clear  flour  which it replaced  37  By 1900  Minnesota mills  led by Pillsbury  Northwestern and the Washburn Crosby Company  a forerunner of General Mills   were grinding 14 1  of the nation s grain  38  Phelps Mill in Otter Tail County The state s iron mining industry was established with the discovery of iron in the Vermilion Range and the Mesabi Range in the 1880s  and in the Cuyuna Range in the early 20th century  The ore was shipped by rail to Duluth and Two Harbors  then loaded onto ships and transported eastward over the Great Lakes  32  Industrial development and the rise of manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century  Nevertheless  farming remained prevalent  Minnesota s economy was hard hit by the Great Depression  resulting in lower prices for farmers  layoffs among iron miners  and labor unrest  Compounding the adversity  western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935  New Deal programs provided some economic turnaround  The Civilian Conservation Corps and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations  and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self government  This provided natives a greater voice within the state  and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and native languages were no longer suppressed  33  After World War II  industrial development quickened  New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle  machine milking at dairy farms  and raising chickens in large buildings  Planting became more specialized with hybridization of corn and wheat  and the use of farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm  University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution  33 Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation  Increased mobility  in turn  enabled more specialized jobs  33  Minnesota became a center of technology after World War II  Engineering Research Associates was formed in 1946 to develop computers for the United States Navy  It later merged with Remington Rand  and then became Sperry Rand  William Norris left Sperry in 1957 to form Control Data Corporation  CDC   39 Cray Research was formed when Seymour Cray left CDC to form his own company  Medical device maker Medtronic
