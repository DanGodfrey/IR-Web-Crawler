created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko  The character soon appeared in The Amazing Spider Man  11 and  12  and again in  31   32  and  33   edit  Fictional character biography Born in Schenectady  New York  Otto Octavius had a turbulent upbringing  His father  Torbert  a factory worker  was abusive and violent towards both Otto and his mother Mary  leading Otto to be shy and reclusive in school  Young Otto s shyness and good work in school got him labeled as a  teacher s pet  and targeted as a subject for bullying  Torbert Octavius did not appreciate having a bullied son  and roared at Otto to use violence in dealing with the bullies  Mary Octavius would defend her son from Torbert s tirades  saying Otto was a gifted thinker who would use his brain to solve problems  not his fists  Due to his mother s insistence and her disgust towards men who worked in manual labor  Otto was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education  regularly scoring top marks  Otto s devotion to study paid off with him being awarded a university scholarship  During Otto s freshman year of college  his father s death due to an industrial accident pushed Otto towards the study of  and obsession with  physical science  After graduating from college  Otto Octavius found work in an engineering firm  Otto became a brilliant and respected nuclear physicist  atomic research consultant  inventor  and lecturer  He designed a set of highly advanced mechanical arms controlled via a brain computer interface to assist him with his research into atomic physics  The tentacle arms were resistant to radiation and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement  attached to a harness that fit around his body  Though his relationship with co workers was typically hostile  a fellow researcher named Mary Alice Anders befriended him when Otto impressed her with a demonstration of his harness  and the two began a courtship  In due time  Otto proposed marriage to Mary Alice  However  Otto s mother did not approve  believing that no woman was good enough for her son  To please her  he ended his engagement  Later  when he discovered that his mother had begun dating a librarian  he rebuked her  causing her to have a fatal heart attack in the heat of their argument  With the death of his mother and Mary Alice Anders out of his life  Octavius  disposition towards nearly everyone became mean spirited  and he had become more distracted from paying attention to detail and safety precautions in his work   edit  Criminal

became fused to Octavius  body  It was later revealed that the radiation  or possibly his own latent mutation  had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone  The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body  although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from a great distance  The accident also seemingly damaged his brain  although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was in fact his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs 3    and the scientist turned to a life of crime  first taking the hospital hostage although Spider Man defeats him  volume  amp  issue needed  Though Doctor Octopus himself is portly  in poor physical shape  and is near sighted  with his harness attached he is physically more than a match for Spider Man  in his first appearance he beat Spider Man so badly throwing him outside the hospital  that the wall crawler considered giving up his heroic career  until he was inspired to continue by the Human Torch  4  Over the years Dr  Octopus has become one of the most identifiable members of Spider Man s rogues gallery  Doctor Octopus formed the original Sinister Six to fight Spider Man after taking Betty Brant and May Parker hostage  In the battle he first detached his tentacles to attack Spider Man from behind  then dropped him into a giant fishbowl and battled him wearing scuba equipment  hoping to drown Spider Man  but Spider Man used his webbing to tangle his tentacles  With the rest of the Sinister Six he was jailed  5  He has led subsequent Sinister Six groups  and usually takes offense when someone else leads the team  Disguised as the Master Planner  he organized a theft of atomic equipment  leading a gang which used high tech equipment  After he stole a formula that Spider Man needed to cure his Aunt May  Spider Man tracked the gang to their base  In a fight with Spider Man a support beam was destroyed and the ceiling collapsed  causing a leak to spring up  though Spider Man escaped using his strength  6  It is later revealed he used a scuba tank to escape  Doctor Octopus later attempts to steal the Defense Department s Nullifier device  and sets a trap for Spider Man  7  He became May Parker s tenant  8  then got close enough to use the Nullifier on Spider Man  although he had hoped that it would merely nullify Spider Man s web shooters  the radiation in Spider Man s blood resulted in the Nullifier s interaction with Spider Man s unique biology rendering him amnesiac  9  Doctor Octopus subsequently tricking Spider Man into helping him before Spider Man s own better nature resulted in him turning against his  partner  despite his memory loss long enough for John Jameson to use the Nullifier to shut down his tentacles  10  Doctor Octopus later exhibited the ability to activate his mechanical arms remotely  and used them to free himself from prison  11  His resulting battle with Spider Man resulted in the death of Captain George Stacy  12  Doctor Octopus later waged a gang war with Hammerhead  13  He attempted to wed May Parker in order to acquire an island with an atomic plant which she had recently unknowingly inherited  14  Doc Ock escaped death when the island was destroyed  and began a life as a homeless person  15  He next battled the  ghost  of Hammerhead  and was able to return him to human form and defeat him after a temporary alliance with Spider Man  16  Doctor Octopus later attempted to hijack an atomic submarine  17  He also attempted to poison New York City with printers  ink  and battled the Punisher and Spider Man  18  He next battled the Owl and his gang  19  He successfully deactivated a nuclear reactor in a laboratory before meltdown  20  He later displayed symptoms which Mister Fantastic diagnosed as multiple personality disorder  21  Doctor Octopus was taken to the Beyonder s Battleworld  where he fought a horde of heroes and plotted against Doctor Doom for leadership of the group of villains  He was able to defeat the X Men until Magneto came to the mutants  aid  22   edit  Arachnophobia His crowning achievement of evil was the near fatal beating of Spider Man s then partner  the Black Cat  which led to Spider Man beating Doc Ock to within an inch of his life  The trauma of the beating he received from Spider Man left Octavius afraid of Spider Man and spiders in general for years  and he needed to be treated for his acute arachnophobia  23  Spider Man was forced to let his nemesis beat him in combat so as to allow Octavius to break free of his fears and recruit him to save New York City from an exploding nuclear reactor  Octavius had been planning to detonate the reactor to kill Spider Man indirectly  but after his out of control arms beat Spider Man seemingly senseless  Spider Man convinced him to shut down the reactor to ensure that there were witnesses to his  great triumph   Octavius decided to let Spider Man live on the grounds that he would now have to cope with the same humiliation he had endured  24   edit  Death and resurrection During the Clone Saga  Doctor Octopus saved Spider Man from certain death from a poison injected by the Vulture  although this was only because he desired to be the one to kill Spider Man  25  During the healing process he discovered the identity of Spider Man and then allowed himself to be taken in by police  expecting to be saved by his accomplice lover Stunner  However  Stunner was knocked out and Doc Ock was murdered by the insane Peter Parker clone named Kaine  26  Octavius  student Carolyn Trainer took over as  Doctor Octopus  until the original was resurrected by a branch of the mystical ninja cult known as the Hand  27  Upon his resurrection  it was revealed that he had no knowledge of Spider Man s identity  The reason was that the memories he gained came from a computer chip provided by Carolyn Trainer  that recent memory had not been recorded at the time of his death  28   edit  Subsequent schemes In later years  Octavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed  Spider Woman   and was involved in a plot involving using prosthetic limbs as mind control devices  to create an army of minions  He has also had to deal with another usurper  in the form of an arrogant young businessman and con artist named Carlyle  who pretended to employ Octavius at his company  29  This proved to be a ruse  and Carlyle subdued Octopus and stole his technology  using it to create his own version of Octavius  harness  30  During a prolonged battle with Octavius and Spider Man  Carlyle was defeated when Doc Ock ripped open his suit  allowing Spider Man to fill Carlyle s suit with webbing  although Doc Ock informed his enemy that he only did this to hurt Carlyle rather than to help Spider Man  31  Then  Dr  Octopus took the ambassador of the newly formed Free Palestinian State hostage  demanding that in exchange for the ambassador s freedom  Spider Man would meet him in Times Square and unmask himself in front of the world  When Spider Man went to Times Square  he pulled off his mask to reveal another mask  angering Octavius enough to distract him from the release of the ambassador by agents of the Israeli Secret Service  32  Dr  Octopus was taken to Ryker s Island and was drugged and brainwashed to take down the Green Goblin  He interrupted a battle between Spider Man and the Green Goblin on the Brooklyn Bridge  and the two villains were struck by lightning and fell into the river below  Octopus was dragged out days later with no memories of the event  33   edit  Civil War Octavius unsuccessfully tries to form and lead another version of the

impostor   He is again defeated by Spider Man  who confronts Dr  Octopus unmasked  after two of Peter s students distract Octavius  volume  amp  issue needed  He is then sent to Baron Zemo s

After Chameleon steals the baby from Spider Man  Doctor Octopus talks with the Chameleon saying that the baby is the first of a new species  Because the serums inside Norman Osborn and Lily Hollister co mingled when they reproduced  the baby is beyond Octopus  procurement  He refers to it as  Sui Generis  and plans on using the new species  DNA to repair his body  When Spider Man caught Chameleon  he mentioned that the baby is still alive and that the Lizard stole it from him before it can be handed over to Doctor Octopus  39  Doctor Octopus was looking for the Lizard when Spider Man arrived  Spider Man told Doctor Octopus that they will get the baby back from the Lizard and then fight over who will get it  Spider Man even mentioned to Doctor Octopus that the Lizard is now in a different appearance  When Doctor Octopus attacks Spider Man  the Lizard attacks Spider Man  Spider Man threatens to attack the Lizard with the Lizard serum if he doesn t give him the baby  Lizard agrees and reveals that he got a blood sample from the baby and found out that Norman Osborn is not the father  The Lizard then gives the baby to Spider Man saying that if Osborn is not the father  then the baby is of no use to him  Doctor Octopus then attacks the Lizard while Spider Man escapes with the baby  40  Spider Man and the Avengers later fight Doctor Octopus and his macro octobot army  During that time  he had assembled another version of the Sinister Six consisting of Chameleon  who was posing as Steve Rogers   Electro  Mysterio  Rhino  and Sandman in a plot to slip the macro octobot army into

the occurrences with a remote Octobot and uses the machine to assist the astronauts on board as part of his heretofore unknown plans  42  It was revealed that both Otto and Tony Stark had a working relationship years ago before they became superhumans  Otto would lecture  bellitle  and even boasted about how much smarter he claimed to be compared to Stark  While Stark would return the favor by insulting him with joke and cruelity  like telling Octavius how he s not as smart as he thinks  Attempting to find a cure for his condition  Doctor Octopus attempts to capture Tony Stark to force him to find a treatment for his injuries  threatening to detonate a nuclear bomb if Stark doesn t help him  However  when Stark suggested contacting others such as Doctor Strange or Mister Fantastic for help  Doctor Octopus rejected the offer proclaiming that he had mainly made the offer to force Stark into a position where he would fail programming the bomb to go off in six minutes  to prove how much  smarter  he was then him  43  The Sinister Six and the Avengers Academy fought each other when the Sinister Six were trying to steal something from a lab in Paris  Although it seemed like they were trying to steal something the lab in Paris  they were actually trying to steal something in Hank Pym s lab  They tricked Jocasta  one of the teachers at the academy  into opening a portal into the lab and stole the object that Doc Ock said could have ruined his future plans  Otto s actions caused to not only leave some of the Avengers Academy members to be hospitalized  but their defeat by the Sinister Six also hurt their reputation  44  Spider Man and the Future Foundation stumble onto a plot by Doctor Octopus and the Sinister Six to cause trouble on a Caribbean Island with a plot that involves masquerading as zombie pirates  45  It was revealed that the zombie pirates were animatrons constructed by Mysterio  as were the rest of the Sinister Six aside from Mysterio and Chameleon  The real Doctor Octopus  Sandman  Electro and Rhino had taken advantage and gotten into the Baxter Building whilst it was completely empty  and Doctor Octopus is looking for something  46  Doctor

the Octobots were disabled  Doctor Octopus orders the Octobots to finish their mission and then destroy the space station  Spider Man  Human Torch  and John Jameson later discover that some of the space station s crew members have come under control of the Octobots  making them obey Doctor Octopus  commands  48  Doctor Octopus discovers that Spider Man is on the Apogee 1 Space Station  Doctor Octopus then appears on the space station s screen stating that Spider Man has meddled in his plans for the last time and pushes a button that starts to move the Apogee 1 Space Station closer to Earth

the man who  gave you the greatest gift of all   a future   51   edit  Powers and abilities Octavius is a genius in the field of atomic physics  and he holds a Ph  D  in nuclear science  A brilliant engineer and inventor  he is also a superb strategist and a charismatic leader  His genius in radiation is so exceptional that he was once called upon by Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four to offer his expertise when the Invisible Woman suffered from complications during her second pregnancy as a result of the cosmic radiation that had given the team their powers  21  Due to exposure to atomic radiation  Doctor Octopus has the mental ability to control his four  electrically powered  telescoping  prehensile  titanium steel  artificial  tentacle arms  even when they are not connected to him  he can also control them over vast distances   that are attached to a stainless steel harness encompassing his lower torso  Each of these four arms are capable of lifting several tons  provided that at least one arm is used to support his body  The reaction time and agility of his mechanical appendages is enhanced far beyond the range attainable for normal human musculature  The arms allow Octavius to move rapidly over any terrain and to scale vertical surfaces and ceilings  He has developed his concentration and control to the point that he can engage a single opponent  like Spider Man  or multiple opponents with the arms while performing a completely separate  more delicate task  such as stirring coffee or constructing a machine  Due to his weight and age  his opponents are often lured into a false sense of security  only to find he is a formidable combatant  as he has managed to force to fight on the defensive  opponents as dangerous as Spider man  Daredevil  and Captain America  52  Doctor Octopus has also employed an armored body suit enabling him to breathe underwater and designed to withstand extreme water pressure  volume  amp  issue needed  Doctor Octopus has begun wearing a full body armor suit due to a crippling illness caused by the amount of punishment he has sustained over the years   made even worse by the fact that his ability to take damage is still at a human norm  even if he can deliver a superhuman level of punishment  To compensate  he has covered his entire body with his new suit  his normal arms are bound to his chest  and four additional tentacles have been added to his harness  He also has telepathic control over an army of  Octobots   small  octopus like drones  35   edit  Harnesses Dr  Octopus has possessed a total of three different harnesses during his career  the original titanium harness  a more powerful adamantium harness  and the current harness  with tentacles bearing an octopus like motif  The original and adamantium harnesses were both destroyed in the Lethal Foes of Spider Man miniseries  His current harness is made of a titanium steel niobium alloy mixture that is dense but light weight in composition  While wearing the harness  the arms are powerful enough to allow him to walk up sheer concrete walls and move about quickly  They are also used to grab items  both small and large  and as literal weapons in terms of being swung at objects and people like clubs  The pincers at the end of each tentacle can also be used to cut and tear into the flesh of his enemies  His sheer power using these appendages was great enough to beat Daredevil  a seasoned combatant with superhuman senses  almost to death  53  The adamantium harness was powerful enough to both restrain and pummel the Hulk into submission during a series written by Erik Larsen  The adamantium in his tentacles made besting Iron Man in combat possible  tearing the hero s armor apart with a defeat so harsh that Tony Stark began to doubt his abilities almost enough to resort back to alcoholism  54  The harness is also capable of holding a small jetpack allowing him to fly to places faster and able to evade Spider Man more easily  Doctor Octopus is even capable of whirling his tentacles around to deflect small projectiles like bullets  Eventually  Dr  Octopus  harness was surgically removed  but he was still able to control it mentally  even at a distance  This power was initially explained as having been caused by the initial accident  Octopus and his arms were fused together mentally  as well as physically  In fact  when the original harness was destroyed it caused Octavius excruciating pain  He was seen sweating profusely and screaming  Later stories suggest that Octavius possessed minor telepathic powers that gave him a direct mental link with his harness  These telepathic powers were also hinted at to have caused a brain aneurysm in his father when they first developed during puberty   edit

hands of an older version of the Sinister Six  While he originally appeared to merely be world weary  relying on his  four sons   his tentacles  to keep him alive  he revealed via monologue that he had in fact been dead for months  and had left the tentacles a program that would force them into action to find Spider Man  Furthermore  the tentacles were used to play the tape on which his monologue is recorded  and take him to the graveyard where his loved ones lay  The hope is to use Spider Man to reignite the age of the super powered beings  as both Doctor Octopus and Spider Man were born from nuclear accidents   edit  Ultimate Doctor Octopus Doctor Octopus as seen in the pages of Ultimate Spider Man  18  April 2002   Art by Mark Bagley  In Ultimate Spider Man  Doctor Octopus is

series  Doctor Octopus made several appearances in the 1990s Spider Man TV series  voiced by Efrem Zimbalist  Jr  in a thick Germanic accent  In his first episode  Doctor Octopus Armed and Dangerous   Otto Octavius was Peter Parker s science teacher at Science Camp when Peter was 10 years old  This relationship of former mentor and pupil made Dr  Octopus fond of Peter even after his descent into villainy  Years later  he began experiments in order to generate Nuclear Fusion inside a battery and was offered a position by the Hardy Foundation controlled by the mother of Felicia Hardy  After his budget was cut  he was forced to move to an old house where he continued his experiments on fusion using four metal tentacles  When the experiment exploded  Octavius  tentacles were permanently fused to his skeleton becoming Doctor Octopus  Of Spider Man s main rogue s gallery  Doctor Octopus was a character that appeared quite frequently in the series  Aside from his vendettas against the Hardy Foundation  Octavius was also a member in both incarnations of the Kingpin s Insidious Six  as the leader of the group in the field  He later teamed up with the Kingpin to once again battle the Hardy family  On a solo venture  he created a sentient smaller robotic version of his tentacles called an Octobot  With it he battled Spider Man  and after an injury caused the web slinger to have temporary amnesia  he convinced Spider Man they were partners in criminal endeavors  In the three part  Secret Wars  saga  Doctor Octopus was among of the villains the Beyonder chose to represent evil in the Secret Wars saga  They conquer some of the planet  He originally colonized Octavia before it was taken over by Doctor Doom who renamed it New Latveria  This causes Doctor Octopus to collaborate with Red Skull and Alistair Smythe to reclaim Octavia after crushing the rebels  He and the other villains were later sent back to Earth by Doctor Doom  In the two part  Spider Wars  saga  a Spider Man of an alternate dimension had defeated Doctor Octopus and took possession of his trademark tentacles  Doctor Octopus makes a cameo in the first episode of Spider Man Unlimited  Doctor Octopus as he appears in The Spectacular Spider Man  Doctor Octopus appears in The Spectacular Spider Man  voiced by Peter MacNicol  as a major antagonist  Dr  Octavius is a research scientist working under Norman Osborn at OsCorp  He is very timid and willing to apologize for every little thing  a direct contrast to his boss  Norman  He is one of OsCorp s most intelligent scientists and the creator of a four armed harness that makes him able to do dangerous experiments  playing a part in the creation of Sandman and Rhino  earning him the nickname  Doctor Octopus   which he considers demeaning  Eventually  as the result of a devastating nuclear fusion accident at Oscorp orchestrated by the Green Goblin  Octavius  harness becomes fused to his spinal cord  When found by Osborn and Spider Man  the already paranoid doctor becomes deranged and megalomaniacal  blaming the two for his accident  He attacks both parties  and takes  Doctor Octopus  as his new name  With his arms permanently fused  he then seeks to destroy all of those who have wronged him  but Spider Man eventually defeated the menace at a Coney Island carnival  In the following days  Doc Ock sent letters to Electro  who was going through therapy at Ravencroft  He convinced Electro to break him and the other members of the Sinister Six  Vulture  Sandman  Rhino  and Shocker  out of Ryker s Island to fight Spider Man  Doc Ock showed an interest in Spider Man s symbiote costume during the final battle at Central Park  Spider Man s symbiote costume started to take control of Spider Man and if it weren t for the intervention of Captain George Stacy  Doctor Octopus wouldn t have survived the battle  At the beginning of the second season  he is moved to Ravencroft where he is being treated by Dr  Kafka along with Electro and Cletus Kasady  and is apparently cured  He was offered a chance in the new Sinister Six  but Electro mentioned he isn t worth saving anymore  since he s no longer interested in villainy  At the

 Film Main article  Spider Man 2 Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus in Spider Man 2  2004   Spider Man battles Doctor Octopus atop a subway train Director of the Spider Man films  Sam Raimi  has stated that Ock was intended to appear in the first film  teaming up with Green Goblin  but wasn t included because Raimi thought it  wouldn t do the movie justice to have a third origin in there   62  For Spider Man 2  2004   Doctor Octopus is portrayed by Alfred Molina as the main antagonist  The movie version is portrayed as a sympathetic character  and he is married to a woman named Rosalie  He first meets Peter when Curt Connors recommends visiting him  Otto tells Peter he is experimenting with a substance called tritium that he will use as a fusion based energy source  He later begins his experiment with a handful of fellow scientists and reporters looking on  as well as Peter and Octavius  sponsor  Harry Osborn  Octavius attaches his A I  tentacles to his waist and back  using them to contain the fusion beams  Unfortunately  the experiment goes out of control  The resulting magnetic field indirectly kills Rosalie and destroys the inhibitor chip that Otto had used to prevent the advanced AI of the arms from adversely influencing his own mind  It also fused the arms to his spine  At the hospital Otto s arms  now with a life of their own  kill the doctors while Otto is out cold  The tentacles convince Otto that in order to get funding for a new fusion reactor  he must begin a life of crime  becoming Doctor Octopus  Ock robs the first national bank of Manhattan  but is interrupted by Spider Man  After a skirmish with the somewhat debilitated Spider Man  Ock abandons the bank heist and abducts Aunt May for use as a hostage  Spider Man wins the day  but Ock avoids capture  Octavius spends the money that he stole to get equipment for the more advanced version of his experiment  Octavius travels to the home of Harry Osborn  who tells him that he will provide him with tritium once he brings Spider Man to him  The next day  while Peter is having coffee with Mary Jane  Doc Ock crashes in and kidnaps Mary Jane  Peter follows Doc Ock to a tower on the west side  Their battle starts on the tower s top  but fall off onto the roof of a passing subway train  After battling for several minutes  it becomes clear that the two are too evenly matched for further fighting to have much purpose  Ock sets the train s throttle to maximum and then destroys the control panel  threatening to send the train hurtling off the end of an elevated track into the dockyards and sea  Ock easily captures the now exhausted Spider Man after he saves the speeding train  Giving Spider Man s unconscious body to Harry  he takes the tritium and heads back towards the warehouse  Spider Man arrives in the nick of time  combating Octavius once again  and almost gets close to killing Spidey when he accidentally stabs some electric cables attached to the machine  Peter then reveals himself to Octavius  who has returned to his senses through a combination of factors  being pummelled into submission by Spider Man  being given a lecture on morality by an unmasked Peter Parker  and simply by observing the danger inherent in the imploding reactor  With the machine once again out of control  and Otto decides to sacrifice himself to save the city  He destroys the reactor s support beams  and it sinks into the bottom of the river  taking Octavius with it  Archive footage of Molina as Dr  Octopus appears in the opening scene of Spider Man 3  and an old newspaper

In the PC Mac version of the Spider Man 2 game  the prologue cutscene takes most of the cutscene from the main console version where Dr  Octavius  machine goes haywire and Spider Man swings in to stop it  Taking from that  Doc Ock is responsible for nearly all of the game s events  It is possible that he was responsible for having several crooks cause a major riot at the New York Maximum Security Prison and free the supervillain known as the Rhino  which was successful  though the Rhino failed to kill Spider Man when he escaped  After the Rhino was defeated when he accidentally blew up a gas station and was sent several blocks away from the explosion  knocked unconscious  we see Ock s arms spiriting Rhino away  In the next level  Doc Ock pulls a heist on the bank  like he did in the movie and the main console version  and after Spider Man defeats several of Ock s crooks and saves several security guards and civilians  he confronts Ock in the bank s basement  There  Ock is stealing much gold and money in a vault and after Spider Man solves a puzzle that opens the large triple door that is separating them  they battle  Ock escapes  and Spider Man is forced to let him go to save his Aunt May from three crooks who have decided to kidnap her and place her in their van  Later  after Spider Man defeats the supervillain Puma at a construction site  Puma reveals to Spider Man he was merely a distraction for Spider Man while Ock kidnapped his girlfriend  Mary Jane Watson  which Ock did  Later  Ock was responsible for the hold up at OsCorp with his thugs  the Rhino  and the eight bombs Ock planted in the building  Spider Man took care of all those  but Ock counted on Mysterio to distract the vigilante with an illusion of New York literally torn up out of the ground  Mysterio failed  and Spider Man lived  Later  Spider Man fought through several of Ock s cronies at the subway station  and confronted him on top of a moving train where Ock constantly threw things at Spider Man and dismantled the carts of the train  That is until it crashed  and both superhumans survived  Spider Man tracked Doc Ock down in his compound  fighting through more thugs  destroying gun turrets Ock placed around and inside the compound  until Spider Man finally found Mary Jane and Ock activated his machine  There  Ock confronted Spider Man on a platform on top of a machine  throwing explosive barrels at Spider Man  and the vigilante defeated him by shooting at four generators that caused explosions that temporarily stunned Ock and let Spider Man pummel him several times  Once Spider Man finally defeats Ock  he realizes the error of his ways like he did in the movie  and sacrifices himself by pulling his machine down into the river as Spider Man saves Mary Jane  Doctor Octopus is a playable character and a boss in the Spider Man  Friend or Foe video game voiced by Joe Alaskey  He alongside Green Goblin  Sandman  and Venom are shown in the opening cutscene fighting Spider Man and New Goblin until they are attacked by P H A N T O M s and the villains end up abducted  Spider Man encounters him in a secret lab within a Japanese industrial factory building another solar generator apparently to power the P H A N T O M s  Spider Man defeats Doctor Octopus and frees him from the Control Amulet  After being freed  Doctor Octopus joins Spider Man on his quest because like the vast amount of other villains in the game he is after revenge for being put under mind control  After agreeing to aid Spider Man  he says  If I didn t know any better  I d swear I ve been punched   to which Spider Man  who had punched him various times during their battle  answers  Huh  Weird   A female  Marvel 2099 version of Doctor Octopus appears as a boss in the video game Spider Man  Shattered Dimensions  63  voiced by Tara Strong  Her real name is Dr  Serena Patel and she is the head scientist of Alchemax s Shadow Division which is dedicated to the creation of dangerous super weapons and twisted experiments  Fearing that Spider Man s war on Alchemax would lead to her  Patel creates a battle suit and models it after her idol Dr  Otto Octavius along with six high tech mechanical arms  and gives herself the title of 2099 s Dr  Octopus  Believing that Octavius killed the Heroic Age Spider Man  she uses her knowledge of history to defeat the 2099 Spider Man including creating Hobgoblin 2099 and manipulating Scorpion 2099  When she finds a fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos  she goes mad with power and builds a Condensed Matter Reactor powered by the fragment to wreak havoc and take over the world  When Spider Man 2099 finds Doctor Octopus  he is attacked by her and escapes upon setting off the self destruct sequence  Spider Man 2099 escapes

still uses his tentacles as tools for his research  When he and Walker Sloane  the company  founder   attempt to use Anti Venom to kill Spider Man  the intervention of a future Spider Man results in Octavius  Sloan and Anti Venom being merged and trapped between the two times after they are all accidentally thrown into the time portal at the same time  When they return to the real world as the monstrous Atrocity  resembling a bloated Anti Venom with Doctor Octopus s tentacles   the two Spider Men are able to determine that separating Atrocity by returning it to the portal is the key to stopping the time storms that now threaten to destroy reality  They are also able to use Atrocity to defeat the Alchemax CEO  a future version of Peter Parker  by having Spider Man tear off Atrocity s tentacles and toss them through the portal into the future  the Anti Venom elements of the tentacles weakening CEO Peter enough for the future Spider Man to injure him   edit  Miscellaneous Doctor
