series Fraggle Rock ran from January 10  1983 to March 30  1987 on CBC Television in Canada  ITV in the UK  Channel 7 in Australia  HBO in the United States and TV1 in New Zealand  2  It was one of the first shows to be co produced by HIT Entertainment since its foundation in 1989 when it was called Henson International Television  the international arm of Jim Henson Productions and Deluxe Digital Studios  It was a co production between British regional ITV franchise holder Television South  TVS   the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  United States pay television service Home Box Office and Henson Associates  later Jim Henson Productions   the show was filmed on a Toronto sound stage   later at Elstree Studios  London   The avant garde poet bpNichol worked as one of the show s writers  In the early days of development  the script called Fraggles  Woozles  pending the devising of a more suitable name   edit  International co productions The producers made the series with the intention of it airing in various forms internationally  That concept grew out of Duncan Kenworthy s experience adapting Sesame Street to the requirements of foreign markets  4  The human  wraparound  segments were produced separately in several countries  with the intention that the child viewer would always be able to relate to the world of the program  The series has appeared now in over ten countries and languages  Head producer was Wesley James Tomlinson  The main version that was filmed in Canada features an inventor named Doc  played by Gerard Parkes  and his dog Sprocket  This wraparound was also used in the USA  Australia  New Zealand  the Netherlands  Ireland  Scandinavia  Spain and Eastern European shows  Dutch  Scandinavian  Spanish and Eastern European shows were dubbed in their respective languages  The British inserts was filmed at the TVS Television Theatre in Gillingham  Kent  since closed  and presents Fraggle Rock as a rocky sea island with a lighthouse  It used as an actual shown location St  Anthony s Lighthouse located near Falmouth in Cornwall  The lighthouse keeper is The Captain  played by Fulton Mackay   a retired sailor who lives with his faithful dog Sprocket  In the third season the role was filled by John Gordon Sinclair as P K   the captain s nephew  and in the fourth Simon O Brien as B J   the captain s son   84 of these British wraparounds are now missing believed wiped  Only 12 are known to remain  In the German version  the action takes place beneath the workshop of the inventor Doc  played by Hans Helmut Dickow   In France  the wraparound segments take place in a bakery with its version of Doc  played by Michel Robin  and a French alter ego for Sprocket called Croquette  Doc inherited the home from his eccentric Uncle Georges  who was a noted inventor   Thus  when the frame story required the use of a mechanical device  Doc would merely find yet another of Uncle George s machines  Plotlines also frequently involved the elegant but unseen Madame Pontaven  who Doc repeatedly attempted to impress and invite to dinner with no success   Nickelodeon repeated it in the UK from 1993  as did Boomerang and Cartoonito in 2007  The episodes shown were the US versions  As of 2010 update Fraggle Rock showed in the US on The Hub  UK on POP  and Tiny Pop  in Australia on Boomerang and in Canada on Teletoon

Boober  Wembley and Mokey  Fraggles are humanoid creatures  about 18 inches tall  4  with fur in a wide variety of colors and a tail like a lion s  with a tuft of fur on the end  They live in a network of caves called Fraggle Rock  populated by a variety of creatures  and seeming to connect to at least two different worlds in separate dimensions of time and space  Fraggles spend much of their carefree lives in play  exploring their worlds  and generally enjoying themselves  However  at the same time they maintain a complex culture and society  with each individual having rights and responsibilities  They have basic skill with tools and with crude machinery  and the concept of war is known to them  although wars between Fraggles are very rare   Fraggles live on a diet of vegetables  especially radishes  If individuals touch their heads together before falling asleep they can  share dreams   Five Fraggles are at the center of the series  Gobo  Mokey  Wembley  Boober and Red  They form a tight knit group of friends  and each has a distinct personality  Gobo Fraggle  performed by Jerry Nelson    The  leader  of the five main Fraggles  He is unusually level headed and practical for a Fraggle  prefers to control most situations  2  He plays a guitar  made from a gourd  and often goes on trips to explore the lesser known tunnels of Fraggle Rock  apparently more out of a sense of obligation to his Uncle Traveling Matt than from personal inclination  An unfailing pragmatist  he resists the influence of his friends  Gobo has an orange complexion and purple hair  and wears a yellow sweater with a brown vest  in early episodes he used to wear a dark magenta jacket  Mokey Fraggle  performed by Kathryn Mullen    Mokey represents a highly spiritual and artistic  hippie type and usually remains quiet and contemplative  though even she can get annoyed from time to time  6  Mokey often enjoys painting and reciting poetry  although  according to the episode  Mokey s Funeral   her friends  Gobo  Boober  Wembley  and Red  do not enjoy listening to her poems  especially the unusually long ones about death and friendships  She functions as the optimist of the group  trying to see the best in everyone and everything  and comforting her friends when no such  bright side  can be found  According to episode 15  Mokey can make friends quite easily because of her optimistic personality  Though spiritual and serene  Mokey has the dangerous job of procuring radishes from the Gorgs  garden  Mokey has mauve skin and light blue green hair  She wears a greyish brown robe like sweater and later an actual turtleneck sweater underneath the robe like sweater starting in  The Great Radish Caper   She also wears the pop top from a soda can as a necklace pendant  Mokey Fraggle s puppet regularly switches back and forth between live hands and rod hands  depending on the requirements of the scene  During those times  Mokey s right hand is usually performed by Trish Leeper  Also  she is the only Fraggle character to have moveable eyelids which open wide when scared  excited  or surprised  Mokey thinks more about the heart and is the oldest of the Fraggle group  serving as a den mother  Red Fraggle  performed by Karen Prell    In direct contrast to her best friend Mokey  Red has an exuberant and athletic nature  she is one of the best swimmers among the Fraggles  6  Red has a yellowish orange hue  red hair  and wears a red sweater  Mo Rocca described her on VH1 s I Love the 80s  Strikes Back as the  Buck the establishment Fraggle   comparable citation needed  to Peppermint Patty of the Peanuts Gang   She is also highly cynical of her friends  plans and ideas and often teases Gobo about his Uncle Traveling Matt  occasionally yawning while he reads the postcards   Red  like Gobo  wants to be in control  and there is often friction between them over who should be the one in charge  During the course of the show  Red and Mokey become roommates  Wembley Fraggle  performed by Steve Whitmire    Gobo s roommate and best friend  appears nervous and pathologically indecisive  mostly because he doesn t want to hurt anyone s feelings  saying  yes  to someone means saying  no  to someone else   6  In fact   to wemble  is a Fraggle verb meaning  to be indecisive  citation needed   though the episode  The Secret of Convincing John  points out that to not be able to choose  one must first understand ALL the possibilities  suggesting an  up  side to the condition   Starting with the episode  The Thirty Minute Work Week  and in later episodes  Wembley works with the fire department as their siren  Wembley looks greenish yellow  with yellow hair  He wears a white shirt with palm trees on it  which he refers to as his  banana shirt   As quite a talented percussionist  he often plays bongo drums  Boober Fraggle  performed by Dave Goelz    His cardinal traits include depression and worry  and he most enjoys washing socks even though Fraggles do not seem to use footwear most of the time  possibly he collects them   Boober almost always expresses a negative attitude  and displays hypochondriac tendencies  he is apparently allergic to dogs  and he expresses deeply ingrained superstition  6  Boober is Fraggle Rock s most talented cook and does everyone s laundry  and has a penchant for singing the blues  Boober is greenish blue with reddish orange hair  and always wears a red hat and brown scarf  He is the only primary Fraggle whose eyes remain invisible  and he prefers to live on his own  although he is close friends with both Red and Wembley  and he often subtly hits on Mokey  He has so much knowledge that he is actually a capable medic to the other fraggles  as evidenced in the later seasons  Uncle Traveling Matt  performed by Dave Goelz    Gobo s famous explorer uncle  spends most of the series in  Outer Space   his perspective of the human world  and sends postcards back to his nephew describing his adventures there  He interacts with and often ends up interfering with the daily lives of humans  known to Fraggles as the  Silly Creatures   He sometimes refers to himself as  Matthew   he identifies the room filled with entrances to  Outer Space  as the  T  Matthew Fraggle Room   His name puns on  traveling matte   Ancient Fraggles   A tribe of Fraggles that were seen in  Mokey  Then and Now   Back then  Fraggles had leaders and didn t have hairs on the heads yet  Mokey  Wembley  and Booker ended up somewhere back in time where the Ancient Fraggles mistook Mokey as the legendary Blundig  who Mokey was dressed as when she  Wembley  and Boober were rehersing a play about Blundig   Fishface Fraggle  performed by Jerry Nelson    The autocratic ruler of the Ancient Fraggles  Bigmouth Fraggle  performed by Bob Stutt    An Ancient Fraggle that speaks a lot  Bonehead Fraggle  performed by Cheryl Wagner    An Ancient Fraggle with a bone through her nose  She tends to repeat every phrase Fishface Fraggle says  Noodlenose Fraggle  performed by Tim Gosley    An Ancient Fraggle that is amused a lot and often ends up in the Ancient Fraggles  prison since being amused back then was a bad thing  Cantus the Minstrel  performed by Jim Henson    Cantus and the Minstrels continually travel to different parts of the cave  and stop several times at Fraggle Rock  They encourage the Fraggles to find their own songs  which culminate in  Our melody come and sing it with me It s a song where you know you ll belong     Cause you know we belong to the song   Brio the Minstrel  performed by Terry Angus    A Fraggle who is one of the Minstrels following Cantus  Brio is a bespectacled Fraggle who plays the cymbals  According to puppeteer Terry Angus  Brio is also the only female minstrel  conceived by Jocelyn Stevenson to balance the gender ratio  She first appeared in the Fraggle Rock episode  The Minstrels   Cave Fraggles   Deep in the caves of Fraggle Rock lives another group of Fraggles that are known to other Fraggles as Cave Fraggles  as shown in the episode  Fraggle Wars    Enemy Fraggles live in a place they call Fraggle Cave  The Enemy Fraggles are dull and seem to be a lot like Boober  in that they share his pessimistic attitude and dislike of most forms of fun  The Cave s Oldest Fraggle  performed by Tim Gosley    The elder of the Cave Fraggles  She urges her group of Cave Fraggles on to combat against the opposition as seen in  Fraggle Wars   Ultimately  humor prevails  and both Cave s Oldest and World s Oldest can only express disdain for modern youth  Beige Fraggle  performed by Richard Hunt    One of the Cave Fraggles from the second season Fraggle Rock episode  Fraggle Wars   He is in charge of guarding Mokey when she is captured and kept prisoner in a cage  Beige tries very hard to be a tough  efficient Security Fraggle  but secretly begins to feel sorry for Mokey  When war threatens to break out between the Cave Fraggles and the Rock Fraggles  Beige finds the courage to help Mokey and  with Red s help  stop the battle before it starts  Like Red  however  his name is the same as his color  except his is the same color as his skin  and Red s is the same as her hair  While Mokey was being kept in the cage  she and Beige discussed the differences between their two cultures  Beige demonstrates the Cave Fraggles  unique sense of humor with the song  Ho Ho Ho  What a Funny World It Is    One joke they find particularly amusing goes   I met a man who had a son  he also had a daughter too   Chuchu Fraggle   Appeared in  Playing Till It Hurts  and has extremely large  yellow teeth  which are knocked out in the course of the episode  He played first base on Rumpel Fraggle s rock hockey team and

Fraggle Rock Volunteer Fire Department as seen in the Fraggle Rock episode  The Thirty Minute Work Week   Convincing John  performed by Jim Henson    An evangelist like Fraggle  uses his fast talking musical numbers to convince Fraggles to do anything  from getting Red to wear a blindfold to getting all Fraggles to stop eating Doozer constructions  and  subsequently  to start eating them again    He could convince a Gorg that he s a Doozer   Convincing John lives some distance away from the rest of the Fraggle warren  it is suggested that this status is something akin to exile  or quarantine  given Convincing John s propensity to convince people to do things at random  He does  however  have a trio of backing singers dancers who are almost his acolytes  though when not performing  they are aware of his true nature and are less than impressed  In  The Secret Society of the Poobahs   Convincing John was the Vanguard of the Poobahs  Eminent and Venerable Council of Sages   The council comprises the first three Fraggles to show up for a hearing  It is composed of the dopey Lambo  performed by Richard Hunt   Hambo  performed by Steve Whitmire  and an unnamed sleeping female Fraggle

bath and empties the Fraggle s pond  sing and repeatedly bang on the pipes in the wall until the pond fills with water again  Archbanger Fraggle  performed by Jerry Nelson    The head of the Pipebangers  who have the job of refilling the Fraggle Pond with water when it runs low  He does this by leading the Pipebangers in a ritual that involves striking the pipes in Fraggle Rock with sticks  The noisy pipes lead Doc to believe that there is a problem with his boiler  which he consequently empties  The Fraggles  however  believe the appearance of water to be magically related to the Pipebangers  actions  In his only appearance in  Let the Water Run   the Archbanger Fraggle is shocked when the water doesn t flow out of the pipes  despite repeated banging  He is unaware that Doc is fixing his boiler at the time  When Red brings back an umbrella from Doc s Workshop  the Archbanger insists on using it to bang on the pipes  claiming   I know a sacred banging stick when I see one   Doc turns his boiler on at the very moment that the Archbanger begins to strike the pipes with the umbrella  and the Fraggles  faith in the pipe banging ritual is restored  He also appeared in the animated version of Fraggle Rock  in the episode  Mokey s Flood of Wizard   For the 100th pipe banging  the Archbanger wants a special ceremony  and is persuaded to allow Mokey to recite a poem

ceremonial events and emergency meetings  He first appears in the episode  The Finger of Light   The World s Oldest Fraggle is obviously greatly respected by the Fraggles  but he s not their leader

assistant to the World s Oldest Fraggle  His role is to correct The World s Oldest Fraggle  and then get hit in the nose with his cane after he exclaims   I know that    edit  Doozers Within Fraggle Rock lives a second species of small humanoid creatures  the pudgy  green  ant like Doozers  Standing only 6 inches  150 mm  tall  knee high to a Fraggle   Doozers in a sense represent anti Fraggles  their lives are dedicated to work and industry  Doozers spend much of their time busily constructing all manner of scaffolding throughout Fraggle Rock using miniature construction equipment and wearing hard hats and work boots  No one but the Doozers themselves seem to understand the actual purpose of their intricate and beautiful constructions  Often they accompany their building with marching songs and various Doozer chants  To ensure that they always have a steady stream of work to do  Doozers build their constructions out of an edible candy like substance  manufactured from radishes  which is greatly enjoyed by Fraggles  They actually want the Fraggles to eat their constructions because  architecture s supposed to be enjoyed  and also so they can go on to build again  This is essentially the only interaction between Doozers and Fraggles  Doozers spend most of their time building  and Fraggles spend much of their time eating Doozer buildings  They thus form an odd sort of symbiosis  In one episode  the flavor of the Doozer sticks is augmented by adding other flavors  such as tomato and mustard  This symbiosis becomes integral to the episode  The Preachification of Convincing John  where Mokey calls upon the Fraggles to stop eating the Doozers  constructions because they spend so much time making them  Fraggle Rock quickly fills with constructions and the Doozers have no space left in which to build  After running out of space  the Doozers finally decide to move on to a new area because the Fraggles won t eat their constructions  and there is even a tragic scene with a mother explaining to her daughter that Doozers must build or they will die  and so they must find a new place to live where they can build and hopefully find Fraggles who will eat their constructions  Overhearing this  Mokey realizes that she has inadvertently disrupted a vital symbiotic relationship through ignorant good intentions  As a result  Mokey frantically rescinds her prohibition and encourages the Fraggles to gorge on the structures   just in time to persuade the Doozers to stay  At one point a series of Fraggle Rock books appeared  one entitled  The Legend of the Doozer Who Didn t   This book details the story of a Doozer who went against Doozer tradition when he stopped working and going to school  According to this book  a Doozer who doesn t  do  becomes a Fraggle   though  All Work And All Play   a second season episode of the show  unmasks this as merely a story that Doozer parents tell their children to teach them the value of hard work  no Doozer seriously believes it  The series had several episodes that featured a young female Doozer named Cotterpin as a main character  Angle Doozer   Architect Doozer  performed by Jerry Nelson    The

the other Doozers  and states she would rather be a Fraggle  Cotterpin enjoys drawing  and actually was able to become Architect s apprentice  Though seen as a Baby Doozer in  The Great Radish Famine   she was introduced in  All Work and All Play  when she rejected the pressure placed on her to take the helmet  and ran away to become a Fraggle  Cotterpin met and befriended Red Fraggle at this time  though Cotterpin finally realized that she couldn t become a Fraggle since she can t do what Red Fraggle could do  However  Architect Doozer understood her plight  as he himself was once in her shoes  and allowed her to  take the drawing board  rather than the helmet  She still maintains a friendship with Red  Wembley  and Boober  Crosscut Doozer  performed by Kathryn Mullen    Crosscut is a Doozer welder and a member of Flange s work team  Crusty Doozer  performed by Steve Whitmire    Originally one of the Doozers left behind in the Cavern of Lost Dreams  the original Doozer Cave  alongside

husband and wife of the family call themselves the King  portrayed by Gord Robertson and voiced by Jerry Nelson  and Queen  portrayed by Trish Leeper and voiced by Myra Fried in 1983  Cheryl Wagner in 1984 1987  of the Universe  with their son Junior  portrayed by Rob Mills in Season 1 4  Frank Meschkuleit in Season 5  and voiced by Richard Hunt   as its Prince and their heir  but to all appearances working as simple farmers with a hut and garden patch  The second episode of the first season reveals that the Gorgs have never actually met anyone besides themselves in years   I ve never met a real subject before     suggesting that King and Queen of the Universe are self bestowed titles  The Gorgs regard Fraggles as pests  which steal radishes from their garden  In one episode it is revealed that the Gorgs use radishes to make  anti vanishing cream  that prevents them from becoming invisible  So the three main races of the Fraggle Rock universe   Fraggles  Doozers and Gorgs   are all dependent on the radishes for different reasons  While the King and Queen consider the Fraggles disgusting vermin  Junior enjoys chasing  catching and keeping them like a boy would lizards and bugs  Junior has no friends  and perhaps pursues the Fraggles just so he has someone to talk to  The Gorgs were developed by art director Douglas Cook in the Isle of Wight  Other creatures live in the Gorgs  world  In one episode  a frog like con man named Wander McMooch temporarily tricks the Gorgs out of their  castle  hut so he can raze the forest to build a village  This implies that enough other people  and indeed  other Gorgs  live in that world  at least enough to fill a village  This conflict is resolved when the con man finds out there are hundreds of thousands of Fraggles living around the Gorgs  castle  He seems to consider Fraggles pests  like rodents  and gives back the castle  Significantly  this implies that Fraggles live scattered all over the Gorgs  world  that they are generally considered to be pests by everyone  not just Ma and Pa Gorg   and that it is rare to find such a large collection of Fraggles  In one of the final episodes  all leaves suddenly drop from  The Nirvana Tree  in the Gorg s Garden  which is the traditional sign that the reigning King must surrender his throne to the crowned prince  But after eating the last Nirvana leaf  Junior shrinks to fraggle size  sees the realm from their point of view  including a consultation with the Trash Heap   and upon regaining his Gorg stature  invites his Fraggle friends to his coronation  at which time he immediately abolishes the Gorg s monarchy  introducing a Fraggle like society where all creatures are socially equal   edit  Marjory the Trash Heap Marjory  The Trash Heap The Trash Heap  a wise being  referred to as an  oracle    serves as the garbage dump of the Gorgs  2  She and her heckling heralds live near the Gorg s garden  and she gives the Fraggles guidance and advice  which the Fraggles regard with reverence  although they do not worship her  She also appears to have some magical abilities  specifically telepathy and the ability to teleport items or Fraggles   although she does not often use them  Sometimes she knits to pass the time  She has an uncle named Maximillian  whom she refers to as  Uncle Max   Jerry Nelson voiced Marjory the Trash Heap   edit  Philo and Gunge The heralds of the Trash Heap  they often introduce her as the  all knowing  all seeing Trash Heap   They supply humor  bad jokes  and puns  Although Gunge portrays himself as the brains of the pair  neither ever really prove a great help  They watch over the Trash Heap  if they were to leave for a long time  she would begin to die out  When she finishes speaking  they announce   The Trash Heap has spoken  Nyeah   Philo and Gunge had two episodes of the series devoted to them   Home Is Where the Trash Is  and  Gunge the Great  amp  Glorious   Philo was played by Dave Goelz and Gunge was played by Richard Hunt   edit  The Silly Creatures of Outer Space Gobo s uncle Matt  known as Traveling Matt  has gone to explore the human world  Fraggles call it Outer Space   and he regularly sends postcards back to Gobo  The name  Traveling Matt  puns on the film special effects device known as a traveling matte  Matt calls the humans he meets the  Silly Creatures   Yet despite his contempt  the interactions related in his postcards often show his own ignorance  For example  he once sees two teenage girls chewing bubble gum  when they blow bubbles  he believes that the  food  has made their tongues inflate and explode  The North American version shows the connection between Fraggle Rock and Outer Space as a small hole in the wall of the workshop of an eccentric inventor and former barber  Doc   portrayed by Gerard Parkes   Gobo must go out into Doc s workshop to retrieve the postcards from the wastebasket where Doc throws them  Doc remains unaware of the Fraggles  existence  but his dog Sprocket  performed by Steve Whitmire while the right hand and wagging tail were done by Karen Prell  has seen them and tries in vain to prove their existence to his master  The last episode reveals Doc s true name  Jerome Crystal  spelling of the surname verified according to the official Encyclopedia Fragglia  an internal document compiled by Karen Prell and other staffers   7  In the second to last episode  he finally learns that the Fraggles exist and befriends them  Matt also returns home to Fraggle Rock  Doc has a friend named Ned Shimmelfinney who lives next door to him  At first  Sprocket hates Shimmelfinney  who owns a cat named Fluffanella  voiced by Karen Prell   Sprocket makes a face and choking gestures every time Shimmelfinney s name is mentioned  He stops doing this after Doc and Shimmelfinney have a fight in  The Great Radish Famine   In the last episode  Ned Shimmelfinney moves to the desert for his health causing Doc and Sprocket to go with him  Doc also helps out Ms  Betty Ardath  who moves into his neighborhood in episode 44  She runs a bed and breakfast called  The Captain s Inn   Sprocket has a crush on her pet Airedale Terrier named Marigold just as Doc has a crush on Betty   edit  Other characters and creatures Aretha  voiced by Sharon Lee Williams    A cave creature that accompanies Gobo when he sings  Only Way Home  in the episode  Sir
