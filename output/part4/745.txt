history of Bank of America dates back to 1904  when Amadeo Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco in an effort to cater to immigrants denied service by other banks  16  Giannini was raised by the Fava Stanghellini family  as his father was shot while trying to collect on a  10 00 debt  citation needed  When the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck  Giannini was able to scavenge all deposits out of the bank building and away from the fires  Because San Francisco s banks were in smoldering ruins and unable to open their vaults  Giannini was able to use the rescued funds to commence lending within a few days of the disaster  From a makeshift desk consisting of a few planks over two barrels  he lent money to anyone who was willing to rebuild  Later in life  he took great pride in the fact that all of these loans were repaid  In 1922  Giannini established Bank of America and Italy in Italy by buying Banca dell Italia Meridionale  the latter established in 1918  17  On March 7  1927  Giannini consolidated his Bank of Italy  101 branches  with the newly formed Liberty Bank of America  175 branches   The result was the Bank of Italy National Trust  amp  Savings Association with capital of  30 Billion  and resources of  115 Billion  In 1928  A  P  Giannini merged with Bank of America  Los Angeles and consolidated it with his other bank holdings to create what would become the largest banking institution in the country  He renamed the Bank of Italy on November 3  1930  calling it Bank of America  The resulting company was headed by Giannini with Orra E  Monnette serving as co Chair   edit  Growth in California Giannini sought to build a national bank  expanding into most of the western states as well as into the insurance industry  under the aegis of his holding company  Transamerica Corporation  In 1953  regulators succeeded in forcing the separation of Transamerica Corporation and Bank of America under the Clayton Antitrust Act  18  The passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 prohibited banks from owning non banking subsidiaries such as insurance companies  Bank of America and Transamerica were separated  with the latter company continuing in the insurance business  However  federal banking regulators prohibited Bank of America s interstate banking activity  and Bank of America s domestic banks outside California were forced into a separate company that eventually became First Interstate Bancorp  later acquired by Wells Fargo and Company in 1996  It was not until the 1980s with a change in federal banking legislation and regulation that Bank of America was again able to expand its domestic consumer banking activity outside California  New technologies also allowed credit cards to be linked directly to individual bank accounts  In 1958  the bank introduced the BankAmericard  which changed its name to Visa in 1975  19  A consortium of other California banks introduced Master Charge  now MasterCard  to compete with BankAmericard   edit  Expansion outside California Following the passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956  BankAmerica Corporation was established for the purpose of owning and operation of Bank of America and its subsidiaries  BankAmerica expanded outside California in 1983 with its acquisition of Seafirst Corporation of Seattle  Washington  as well as its wholly owned banking subsidiary  Seattle First National Bank  Seafirst was at risk of seizure by the federal government after becoming insolvent due to a series of bad loans to the oil industry  BankAmerica continued to operate its new subsidiary as Seafirst rather than Bank of America until the 1998 merger with NationsBank  BankAmerica experienced huge losses in 1986 and 1987 by the placement of a series of bad loans in the Third World  particularly in Latin America  The company fired its CEO  Sam Armacost  Though Armacost blamed the problems on his predecessor  A W   Tom  Clausen  Clausen was appointed to replace Armacost  The losses resulted in a huge decline of BankAmerica stock  making it vulnerable to a hostile takeover  First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles  which had originated from banks once owned by BankAmerica   launched such a bid in the fall of 1986  although BankAmerica rebuffed it  mostly by selling operations  It sold its FinanceAmerica subsidiary to Chrysler and the brokerage firm Charles Schwab and Co  back to Mr  Schwab  It also sold Bank of America and Italy to Deutsche Bank  By the time of the 1987 stock market crash  BankAmerica s share price had fallen to  8  but by 1992 it had rebounded mightily to become one of the biggest gainers of that half decade  The Bank of America Tower in New York City  BankAmerica s next big acquisition came in 1992  The company acquired its California rival  Security Pacific Corporation and its subsidiary Security Pacific National Bank in California and other banks in Arizona  Idaho  Oregon  and Washington  which Security Pacific had acquired in a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s   This was  at the time  the largest bank acquisition in history  Federal regulators  however  forced the sale of roughly half of Security Pacific s Washington subsidiary  the former Rainier Bank  as the combination of Seafirst and Security Pacific Washington would have given BankAmerica too large a share of the market in that state  The Washington branches were divided and sold off to West One Bancorp  now U S  Bancorp  and KeyBank  20  Later that year  BankAmerica expanded into Nevada by acquiring Valley Bank of Nevada  In 1994  BankAmerica acquired the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co  of Chicago  which had become federally owned as part of the same oil industry debacle emanating from Oklahoma City s Penn Square Bank  that had brought down numerous financial institutions including Seafirst  At the time  no bank possessed the resources to bail out Continental  so the federal government operated the bank for nearly a decade  Illinois at that time regulated branch banking extremely heavily  so Bank of America Illinois was a single unit bank until the 21st century  BankAmerica moved its national lending department to Chicago in an effort to establish a financial beachhead in the region  These mergers helped BankAmerica Corporation to once again become the largest U S  bank holding company in terms of deposits  but the company fell to second place in 1997 behind fast growing NationsBank Corporation  and to third in 1998 behind North Carolina s First Union Corp  On the capital markets side  the acquisition of Continental Illinois helped BankAmerica to build a leveraged finance origination and distribution business  Continental Illinois had extensive leveraged lending relationships  which allowed the firm s existing broker dealer  BancAmerica Securities  originally named BA Securities   to become a full service franchise  21  22  In addition  in 1997  BankAmerica acquired Robertson Stephens  a San Francisco based investment bank specializing in high technology for  540 million  Robertson Stephens was integrated into BancAmerica Securities and the combined subsidiary was renamed BancAmerica Robertson Stephens  23   edit  Merger of NationsBank and BankAmerica Logo of the former Bank of America  ca 1980 In 1997  BankAmerica lent D  E  Shaw  amp  Co   a large hedge fund   1 4 billion in order to run various businesses for the bank  However  D E  Shaw suffered significant loss after the 1998 Russia bond default  BankAmerica was acquired by NationsBank of Charlotte in October 1998 in what was the largest bank acquisition in history at that time  While NationsBank was the nominal survivor  the merged bank took the name Bank of America Corporation  with Bank of America NT amp SA changing its name to Bank of America  N A  as the remaining legal bank entity  The combined bank still operates under Federal Charter 13044  which was granted to Giannini s Bank of Italy on March 1  1927  However  SEC filings before 1998 are listed under NationsBank  not BankAmerica  Bank of America possessed combined assets of  570 billion  as well as 4 800 branches in 22 states  Despite the mammoth size of the two companies  federal regulators insisted only upon the divestiture of 13 branches in New Mexico  in towns that would be left with only a single bank following the combination  Branch divestitures are only required if the combined company will have a larger than 25  FDIC deposit market share in a particular state or 10  deposit market share overall   In addition  the combined broker dealer  created from the integration of BancAmerica Robertson Stephens and NationsBanc Montgomery Securities  was renamed Banc of America Securities in 1998  24   edit  History since 2001 Typical Bank of America local office in Los Angeles In 2001  Bank of America CEO and chairman Hugh McColl stepped down and named Ken Lewis as his successor  In 2004  Bank of America announced it would purchase Boston based bank FleetBoston Financial for  47 billion in cash and stock  25  By merging with Bank of America  all of its banks and branches were given the Bank of America logo  At the time of merger  FleetBoston was the seventh largest bank in United States with  197 billion in assets  over 20 million customers and revenue of  12 billion  25  Hundreds of FleetBoston workers lost their jobs or were demoted  according to the Boston Globe  On June 30  2005  Bank of America announced it would purchase credit card giant MBNA for  35 billion in cash and stock  The Federal Reserve Board gave final approval to the merger on December 15  2005  and the merger closed on January 1  2006  The acquisition of MBNA provided Bank of America a leading domestic and foreign credit card issuer   The combined Bank of America Card Services organization  including the former MBNA  had more than 40 million U S  accounts and nearly  140 billion in outstanding balances  Under Bank of America the operation was renamed FIA Card Services  Footprint of Bank of America locations In May 2006  Bank of America and Banco Ita   Investimentos Ita  S A   entered into an acquisition agreement through which Ita  agreed to acquire BankBoston s operations in Brazil and was granted an exclusive right to purchase Bank of America s operations in Chile and Uruguay  A deal was signed in August 2006 under which Ita  agreed to purchase Bank of America s operations in Chile and Uruguay  Prior to the transaction  BankBoston s Brazilian operations included asset management  private banking  a credit card portfolio  and small  middle market  and large corporate segments  It had 66 branches and 203 000 clients in Brazil  BankBoston in Chile had 44 branches and 58 000 clients and in Uruguay it had 15 branches  In addition  there was a credit card company  OCA  in Uruguay  which had 23 branches  BankBoston N A  in Uruguay  together with OCA  jointly served 372 000 clients  While the BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction  as part of the sale agreement  they cannot be used by Bank of America in Brazil  Chile or Uruguay following the transactions  Hence  the BankBoston name has disappeared from Brazil  Chile and Uruguay  The Ita  stock received by Bank of America in the transactions has allowed Bank of America s stake in Ita  to reach 11 51   Banco de Boston de Brazil had been founded in 1947  On November 20  2006  Bank of America announced the purchase of The United States Trust Company for  3 3 billion  from the Charles Schwab Corporation  US Trust had about  100 billion of assets under management and over 150 years of experience  The deal closed July 1  2007  26  On September 14  2007  Bank of America won approval from the Federal Reserve to acquire LaSalle Bank Corporation from Netherlands s ABN AMRO for  21 billion  With this purchase  Bank of America possessed 1 7 trillion in assets  A Dutch court blocked the sale until it was later approved in July  The acquisition was completed on October 1  2007  Many of LaSalle s branches and offices had already taken over smaller regional banks within the previous decade  such as Lansing and Detroit based Michigan National Bank  The deal increased Bank of America s presence in Illinois  Michigan  and Indiana by 411 branches  17 000 commercial bank clients  1 4 million retail customers  and 1 500 ATMs  Bank of America became the largest bank in the Chicago market with 197 offices and 14  of the deposit share  surpassing JPMorgan Chase  LaSalle Bank and LaSalle Bank Midwest branches adopted the Bank of America name on May 5  2008  27  Ken Lewis resigned as of December 31  2009  in part due to controversy and legal investigations concerning the purchase of Merrill Lynch  and Brian Moynihan became President and CEO effective January 1  2010  After Moynihan assumed control  credit card charge offs and delinquencies declined in January  Bank of America also repaid the  45 billion it had received from the Troubled Assets Relief Program  28  29   edit  Acquisition of Countrywide Financial On August 23  2007  the company announced a  2 billion repurchase agreement for Countrywide Financial  This purchase of preferred stock was arranged to provide a return on investment of 7 25  per annum and provided the option to purchase common stock at a price of  18 per share  30  On January 11  2008  Bank of America announced they would buy Countrywide Financial for  4 1 billion  31  In March 2008  it was reported that the FBI was investigating Countrywide for possible fraud relating to home loans and mortgages  32  This news did not hinder the acquisition  which was completed in July 2008  33  giving the bank a substantial market share of the mortgage business  and access to Countrywide s resources for servicing mortgages  34  The acquisition was seen as preventing a potential bankruptcy for Countrywide  Countrywide  however  denied that it was close to bankruptcy  Countrywide provided mortgage servicing for nine million mortgages valued at  1 4 trillion as of December 31  2007  35  This purchase made Bank of America Corporation the leading mortgage originator and servicer in the U S   controlling 20 25  of the home loan market  36  The deal was structured to merge Countrywide with the Red Oak Merger Corporation  which Bank of America created as an independent subsidiary  It has been suggested that the deal was structured this way to prevent a potential bankruptcy stemming from large losses in Countrywide hurting the parent organization by keeping Countrywide bankruptcy remote  37  Countrywide Financial has changed its name to Bank of America Home Loans  In December 2011  The Justice Department announced a  335 million settlement with Bank of America over discriminatory lending practice at Countrywide Financial  Attorney General Eric Holder said a federal probe found discrimination against qualified African American and Latino borrowers from 2004 to 2008  He said that minority borrowers who qualified for prime loans were steered into higher interest rate subprime loans  38   edit  Acquisition of Merrill Lynch On September 14  2008  Bank of America announced its intentions to purchase Merrill Lynch  amp  Co   Inc  in an all stock deal worth approximately  50 billion  Merrill Lynch was at the time within days of collapse  and the acquisition effectively saved Merrill from bankruptcy  39  Around the same time Bank of America was reportedly also in talks to purchase Lehman Brothers  however a lack of government guarantees caused the bank to abandon talks with Lehman  40  Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy the same day Bank of America announced its plans to acquire Merrill Lynch  41  This acquisition made Bank of America the largest financial services company in the world  42 Temasek Holdings  the largest shareholder of Merrill Lynch  amp  Co   Inc   briefly became one of the largest shareholders of Bank of America  43  with a 3  stake  However  taking a loss Reuters estimated at  3 billion  the Singapore sovereign wealth fund sold its whole stake in Bank of America in the first quarter of 2009  44  Shareholders of both companies approved the acquisition on December 5  2008  and the deal closed January 1  2009  45  Bank of America had planned to retain various members of the then Merrill Lynch s CEO  John Thain s management team after the merger  46  However  after Thain was removed from his position  most of his allies left  The departure of Nelson Chai  who had been named Asia Pacific president  left just one of Thain s hires in place  Tom Montag  head of sales and trading  47  The Bank  in its January 16  2009 earnings release  revealed massive losses at Merrill Lynch in the fourth quarter  which necessitated an infusion of money that had previously been negotiated 48  with the government as part of the government persuaded deal for the Bank to acquire Merrill  Merrill recorded an operating loss of  21 5 billion in the quarter  mainly in its sales and trading operations  led by Tom Montag  The Bank also disclosed it tried to abandon the deal in December after the extent of Merrill s trading losses surfaced  but was compelled to complete the merger by the U S  government  The Bank s stock price sank to  7 18  its lowest level in 17 years  after announcing earnings and the Merrill mishap  The market capitalization of Bank of America  including Merrill Lynch  was then  45 billion  less than the  50 billion it offered for Merrill just four months earlier  and down  108 billion from the merger announcement  Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis testified before Congress 11  that he had some misgivings about the acquisition of Merrill Lynch  and that federal officials pressured him to proceed with the deal or face losing his job and endangering the bank s relationship with federal regulators  49  Lewis  statement is backed up by internal emails subpoenaed by Republican lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee  50  In one of the emails  Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker threatened that if the acquisition did not go through  and later Bank of America were forced to request federal assistance  the management of Bank of America would be  gone   Other emails  read by Congressman Dennis Kucinich during the course of Lewis  testimony  state that Mr  Lewis had foreseen the outrage from his shareholders that the purchase of Merrill would cause  and asked government regulators to issue a letter stating that the government had ordered him to complete the deal to acquire Merrill  Lewis  for his part  states he didn t recall requesting such a letter  The acquisition made Bank of America the number one underwriter of global high yield debt  the third largest underwriter of global equity and the ninth largest adviser on global mergers and acquisitions  51  As the credit crisis eased  losses at Merrill Lynch subsided  and the subsidiary generated 3 7 billion of Bank of America s 4 2 billion in profit by the end of quarter one in 2009  and over 25  in quarter 3 2009  52  53   edit  Bonus settlement On August 3  2009  Bank of America agreed to pay a  33 million fine  without admission or denial of charges  to the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  over the non disclosure of an agreement to pay up to  5 8 billion of bonuses at Merrill  The bank approved the bonuses before the merger but did not disclose them to its shareholders when the shareholders were considering approving the Merrill acquisition  in December 2008  The issue was originally investigated by New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo  who commented after the suit and announced settlement that  the timing of the bonuses  as well as the disclosures relating to them  constituted a  surprising fit of corporate irresponsibility   and  our investigation of these and other matters pursuant to New York s Martin Act will continue   Congressman Kucinich commented at the same time that  This may not be the last fine that Bank of America pays for how it handled its merger of Merrill Lynch   54  A federal judge  Jed Rakoff  in an unusual action  refused to approve the settlement on August 5  55  A first hearing before the judge on August 10 was at times heated  and he was  sharply critic al   of the bonuses  David Rosenfeld represented the SEC  and Lewis J  Liman  son of Arthur L  Liman  represented the bank  The actual amount of bonuses paid was  3 6 billion  of which  850 million was  guaranteed  and the rest was shared amongst 39 000 workers who received average payments of  91 000  696 people received more than  1 million in bonuses  at least one person received a more than  33 million bonus  56  On September 14  the judge rejected the settlement and told the parties to prepare for trial to begin no later than February 1  2010  The judge focused much of his criticism on the fact that the fine in the case would be paid by the bank s shareholders  who were the ones that were supposed to have been injured by the lack of disclosure  He wrote   It is quite something else for the very management that is accused of having lied to its shareholders to determine how much of those victims  money should be used to make the case against the management go away        The proposed settlement   the judge continued   suggests a rather cynical relationship between the parties  the S E C  gets to claim that it is exposing wrongdoing on the part of the Bank of America in a high profile merger  the bank s management gets to claim that they have been coerced into an onerous settlement by overzealous regulators  And all this is done at the expense  not only of the shareholders  but also of the truth   57  While ultimately deferring to the SEC  in February  2010  Judge Rakoff approved a revised settlement with a  150 million fine  reluctantly   calling the accord  half baked justice at best  and  inadequate and misguided   Addressing one of the concerns he raised in September  the fine will be  distributed only to Bank of America shareholders harmed by the non disclosures  or  legacy shareholders   an improvement on the prior  33 million while still  paltry   according to the judge  Case  SEC v  Bank of America Corp   09 cv 06829  United States District Court for the Southern District of New York  58  Investigations also were held on this issue in the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform  57  under chairman Edolphus Towns  D NY  59  and in its investigative Domestic Policy Subcommittee under Kucinich  60   edit  Municipal bonds fraud In 2010  the bank was accused by the U S  government of defrauding schools  hospitals  and dozens of state and local government organizations via misconduct and illegal activities involving the investment of proceeds from municipal bond sales  As a result  the bank agreed to pay  137 7 million  including  25 million to the Internal Revenue service and  4 5 million to state attorney general  to the affected organizations to settle the allegations  61  Former bank official Douglas Campbell pleaded guilty to antitrust  conspiracy and wire fraud charges  As of January 2011  other bankers and brokers are under indictment or investigation  62   edit  Downsizing  2011 to 2014  During 2011  Bank of America began conducting personnel reductions of an estimated 36 000 people  contributing to intended savings of  5 billion per year by 2014  63  In December 2011  Forbes ranked Bank of America s financial health 91st out of the nations largest 100 banks and thrift institutions  64    edit  Federal TARP Bank of America received  20 billion in the federal bailout from the U S  government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program  TARP  on January 16  2009  along with a guarantee of  118 billion in potential losses at the company  65  This was in addition to the  25 billion given to them in the Fall of 2008 through TARP  The additional payment was part of a deal with the U S  government to preserve Bank of America s merger with the troubled investment firm Merrill Lynch  66  Since then  members of the U S  Congress have expressed considerable concern about how this money has been spent  especially since some of the recipients have been accused of misusing the bailout money  67  Then CEO Ken Lewis was quoted as claiming  We are still lending  and we are lending far more because of the TARP program   Members of the U S  House of Representatives  however  were skeptical and quoted many anecdotes about loan applicants  particularly small business owners  being denied loans and credit card holders facing stiffer terms on the debt in their card accounts  According to a March 15  2009  article in The New York Times  Bank of America received an additional  5 2 billion in government bailout money  channeled through American International Group  68  As a result of its federal bailout and management problems  The Wall Street Journal reported that the Bank of America was operating under a secret  memorandum of understanding   MOU  from the U S  government that requires it to  overhaul its board and address perceived problems with risk and liquidity management   With the federal action  the institution has taken several steps  including arranging for six of its directors to resign and forming a Regulatory Impact Office  Bank of America faces several deadlines in July and August and if not met  could face harsher penalties by federal regulators  Bank of America did not respond to The Wall Street Journal story  69  On December 2  2009  Bank of America announced it would repay the entire  45 billion it received in TARP and exit the program  using  26 2 billion of excess liquidity along with  18 6 billion to be gained in  common equivalent securities   Tier 1 capital   The bank announced it had completed the repayment on December 9  Bank of America s Ken Lewis said during the announcement   We appreciate the critical role that the U S  government played last fall in helping to stabilize financial markets  and we are pleased to be able to fully repay the investment  with interest    As America s largest bank  we have a responsibility to make good on the taxpayers  investment  and our record shows that we have been able to fulfill that commitment while continuing to lend   70  71   edit  Lawsuits Bank of America was sued for  10 billion by American International Group Inc  in August 2011  Another lawsuit filed September
