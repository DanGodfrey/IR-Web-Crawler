States Congress shall have the power  To coin Money   16  Laws implementing this power are currently codified in Section 5112 of Title 31 of the United States Code  Section 5112 prescribes the forms in which the United States dollars shall be issued  17  Those coins are both designated in Section 5112 as  legal tender  in payment of debts  17  The Sacagawea dollar is one example of the copper alloy dollar  The pure silver dollar is known as the American Silver Eagle  Section 5112 also provides for the minting and issuance of other coins  which have values ranging from one cent to fifty dollars  17  These other coins are more fully described in Coins of the United States dollar  The Constitution provides that  a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time   18  That provision of the Constitution is made specific by Section 331 of Title 31 of the United States Code  19  The sums of money reported in the  Statements  are currently being expressed in U S  dollars  for example  see the 2009 Financial Report of the United States Government   20  The U S  dollar may therefore be described as the unit of account of the United States  The word  dollar  is one of the words in the first paragraph of Section 9 of Article 1 of the U S  Constitution  In that context   dollars  is a reference to the Spanish milled dollar  a coin that had a monetary value of 8 Spanish units of currency  or reales  In 1792 the U S  Congress adopted legislation titled An act establishing a mint  and regulating the Coins of the United States  Section 9 of that act authorized the production of various coins  including  DOLLARS OR UNITS each to be of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current  and to contain three hundred and seventy one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure  or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver   Section 20 of the act provided   That the money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars  or units    and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation   In other words  this act designated the United States dollar as the unit of currency of the United States  The U S  dollar bill uses the decimal system  consisting of 100 equal cents  symbol     It is also officially divided into 1 000 mills or ten dimes  while ten dollars is equal to an eagle  However  only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar   dime  is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10   while  eagle  and  mill  are largely unknown to the general public  though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies  and gasoline prices are usually in the form of  X XX9 per gallon  e g    3 599  sometimes written as  3 599 10  When currently issued in circulating form  denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U S  coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes  with the exception of gold  silver and platinum coins valued up to  100 as legal tender  but worth far more as bullion   Both one dollar coins and notes are produced today  although the note form is significantly more common  In the past   paper money  was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar  fractional currency  and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of  20  known as the  double eagle   discontinued in the 1930s   The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars  and subsequently was used in naming gold coins  Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination  known as  fractional currency   was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as  shinplasters   In 1854  James Guthrie  then Secretary of the Treasury  proposed creating  100   50 and  25 gold coins  which were referred to as a  Union    Half Union   and  Quarter Union   21  thus implying a denomination of 1 Union    100  Series of 1917  1 United States bill Today  USD notes are made from cotton fiber paper  unlike most common paper  which is made of wood fiber  U S  coins are produced by the United States Mint  U S  dollar banknotes are printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and  since 1914  have been issued by the Federal Reserve  The  large sized notes  issued before 1928 measured 7 42 inches  188 mm  by 3 125 inches  79 4 mm   small sized notes  introduced that year  measure 6 14 inches  156 mm  by 2 61 inches  66 mm  by 0 0043 inches  0 11 mm   When the current  smaller sized U S  currency was introduced it was referred to as Philippine sized currency because the Philippines had previously adopted the same size for its legal currency   edit  Etymology Further information  Dollar In the 16th century  Count Hieronymus Schlick of Bohemia began minting coins known as Joachimstalers  from German thal  or nowadays usually Tal   valley   cognate with  dale  in English   named for Joachimstal  the valley where the silver was mined  St  Joachim s Valley  now J chymov  then part of the Holy Roman Empire  now part of the Czech Republic   22  Joachimstaler was later shortened to the German Taler  a word that eventually found its way into Danish and Swedish as daler  Dutch as daalder  Ethiopian as      talari   Hungarian as tall r  Italian as tallero  and English as dollar  22  Alternatively  thaler is said to come from the German coin Guldengroschen   great guilder   being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder   minted from the silver from Joachimsthal   edit  Nicknames This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  The colloquialism  buck   much like the British word  quid  for the pound sterling  is often used to refer to dollars of various nations  including the U S  dollar  This term  dating to the 18th century  may have originated with the colonial fur trade  23   Greenback  is another nickname originally applied specifically to the 19th century Demand Note dollars created by Abraham Lincoln to finance the costs of the Civil War for the North  24  The original note was printed in black and green on the back side  It is still used to refer to the U S  dollar  but not to the dollars of other countries   Other well known names of the dollar as a whole in denominations include  greenmail    green  and  dead presidents   the last because late presidents are pictured on some of the bills    Grand   sometimes shortened to simply  G   is a common term for the amount of  1 000  The suffix  K  or  k   from  kilo    is also commonly used to denote this amount  such as   10k  to mean  10 000   In colloquial English  when someone refers to a  large  or  stack   it is usually a reference to an amount that is a multiple of  1 000  such as  fifty large  meaning  50 000   Banknotes  nicknames are the same as their values  such as  five    twenty  etc   The  100 bill is nicknamed  Benjamin    Benji  or  Franklin   after Benjamin Franklin  who is pictured on the note    C note   C being the Roman numeral for 100    Century note  or  bill   e g   two bills  being  200   The  20 bill has been referred to as  double sawbuck    dub  or  Jackson   after Andrew Jackson   the  10 bill as  sawbuck    ten spot  or  Hamilton   after Alexander Hamilton   the  5 bill as  fin    fiver  or  five spot   The  2 bill is sometimes called  deuce    Tom    Jefferson  or  T J    after Thomas Jefferson   and the  1 bill  single  or  buck   The dollar has also been referred to as a  bone  and  bones  in plural  e g   twenty bones  is equal to  20  or a  bean   The newer designs are sometimes referred to as  Bigface

Puerto Ricans  both living in Puerto Rico and in the United States  may refer to the dollar as  peso   In some places in Mexico  prices in U S  dollars are referred to as  en americano    in American    with the word  peso  used in Mexico primarily to refer to the Mexican peso  Cubans call the U S  dollar  fula   Loosely translated from Cuban jargon  it means bad or not good  American money was not bad to have or use by Cubans in the island  but its possession was penalized before the mid 1990s  hence the nickname  Cuban Americans colloquially may call them  pesos    edit  Dollar sign Main article  Dollar sign Silver real of 1768 The symbol    usually written before the numerical amount  is used for the U S  dollar  as well as for many other currencies   The sign was the result of a late 18th century evolution of the scribal abbreviation  ps  for the peso  The p and the s eventually came to be written over each other giving rise to    25  26  27  28  Another popular explanation is that it comes from the Pillars of Hercules on the Spanish Coat of arms on the Spanish dollars that were minted in the New World mints in Mexico City  Potos   Bolivia  and in Lima  Peru  These Pillars of Hercules on the silver Spanish dollar coins take the form of two vertical bars      and a swinging cloth band in the shape of an  S   Yet another fictional explanation suggests that the dollar sign was formed from the capital letters U and S written or printed one on top of the other  This theory  popularized by novelist Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged  29  does not consider the fact that the symbol was already in use before the formation of the United States  30   edit  History The neutrality of this section is disputed  Please see the discussion on the talk page  Please do not remove

McKinley  Reverse of  500 Bill The first dollar coins issued by the United States Mint  founded 1792  were similar in size and composition to the Spanish dollar  The Spanish  U S  silver dollars  and Mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the United States  and the Spanish dollar and Mexican peso remained legal tender until 1857  The coinage of various English colonies also circulated  The lion dollar was popular in the Dutch New Netherland Colony  New York   but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the English colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century  Examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable  thus they were sometimes referred to as  dog dollars   31  The U S  dollar was created by the Constitution and defined by the Coinage Act of 1792  It specified a  dollar  to be based in the Mexican peso at 1 dollar per peso and between 371 and 416 grains  27 0 g  of silver  depending on purity  and an  eagle  to be between 247 and 270 grains  17 g  of gold  again depending on purity   The choice of the value 371 grains arose from Alexander Hamilton s decision to base the new American unit on the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars  and later Mexican peso   Hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of Spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371 grains  A new Spanish dollar was usually about 377 grains in weight  and so the new U S  dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the Spanish dollar  The Coinage Act of 1792 set the value of an eagle at 10 dollars  and the dollar at 1 10 eagle  It called for 90  silver alloy coins in denominations of 1  1 2  1 4  1 10  and 1 20 dollars  it called for 90  gold alloy coins in denominations of 1  1 2  1 4  and 1 10 eagles  The value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods  This allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time  except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nation s economy  The early currency of the USA did not exhibit faces of presidents  as is the custom now  In fact  George Washington was against having his face on the currency  a practice he compared to the policies of European monarchs  citation needed  The currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century  before that  heads  side of coinage used profile faces and striding  seated  and standing figures from Greek and Roman mythology and composite native Americans  The last coins to be converted to profiles of historic Americans were the dime  1946  and the Dollar  1971   For articles on the currencies of the colonies and states  see

dollar was defined as 371 25 grains  24 056 g  of silver  Many historians who   erroneously assume gold was standardized at a fixed rate in parity with silver  however  there is no evidence of Congress making this law  This has to do with Alexander Hamilton s suggestion to Congress of a fixed 15 1 ratio of silver to gold  respectively  The gold coins that were minted however  were not given any denomination whatsoever and traded for a market value relative to the Congressional standard of the silver dollar  1834 saw a shift in the gold standard to 23 2 grains  1 50 g   followed by a slight adjustment to 23 22 grains  1 505 g  in 1837  16 1 ratio   citation needed  In 1862  paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals  due to the Civil War  Silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated  This disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the War of 1812  The use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the Articles of Confederation from 1777 to 1788  With no solid backing and being easily counterfeited  the continentals quickly lost their value  giving rise to the phrase  not worth a continental   This was a primary reason for the  No state shall    make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts  clause in article 1  section 10 of the United States Constitution  The Gold Standard Act of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as 23 22 grains  1 505 g  of gold  equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at  20 67  Silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964  when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters  and the half dollar was reduced to 40  silver  Silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970  Gold coins were confiscated by Executive Order 6102 issued in 1933 by Franklin Roosevelt  The gold standard was changed to 13 71 grains  0 888 g   equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at  35  This standard persisted until 1968  Between 1968 and 1975  a variety of pegs to gold were put in place  The price was at  42 22

Technically  all these coins are still legal tender at face value  though some are far more valuable today for their numismatic value  and for gold and silver coins  their precious metal value  From 1965 to 1970 the Kennedy half dollar was the only circulating coin with any silver content though the Mint still makes what it calls Silver Proof sets for collectors  In addition  an experimental  4 00  Stella  coin was also minted  but never placed into circulation and is properly considered to be a pattern rather than an actual coin denomination  The  50 coin mentioned was only produced in 1915 for the Panama Pacific International Exposition  1915  celebrating the opening of the Panama Canal  Only 1 128 were made  645 of which were octagonal  this remains the only U S  coin that was not round as well as the largest and heaviest U S  coin ever  From 1934 to present the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny  nickel  dime  quarter  half dollar and dollar  The nickel is the only coin still in use today that is essentially unchanged  except in its design  from its original version  Every year since 1866  the nickel has been 75  copper and 25

Dollar  it contained 416 grains of  standard silver   89 25  silver and 10 75  copper   as specified by Section 13  33  of the Coinage Act of 1792  It was designated by Section 9 of that Act as having  the value of a Spanish milled dollar   Dollar coins have not been very popular in the United States  34 Silver dollars were minted intermittently from 1794 through 1935  a copper nickel dollar of the same large size  featuring President Dwight D  Eisenhower  was minted from 1971 through 1978  Gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century  The Susan B  Anthony dollar coin was introduced in 1979  these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters  due to their nearly equal size  their milled edge  and their similar color  Minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980  collectors  pieces were struck in 1981   but  as with all past U S  coins  they remain legal tender  As the number of Anthony dollars held by the Federal Reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted  additional Anthony dollars were struck in 1999  In 2000  a new  1 coin  featuring Sacagawea   the Sacagawea dollar  was introduced  which corrected some of the mistakes of the Anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color  without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the Anthony dollar  However  this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still existing  1 bill and is rarely used in daily transactions  The failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support  35  In February 2007  the U S  Mint  under the Presidential  1 Coin Act of 2005  36  introduced a new  1 U S  Presidential dollar coin  Based on the success of the  50 State Quarters  series  the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations  starting with George Washington  on the obverse side  The reverse side features the Statue of Liberty  To allow for larger  more detailed portraits  the traditional inscriptions of  E Pluribus Unum    In God We Trust   the year of minting or issuance  and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face  This feature  similar to the edge inscriptions seen on the British  1 coin  is not usually associated with U S  coin designs  The inscription  Liberty  has been eliminated  with the Statue of Liberty serving as a sufficient replacement  In addition  due to the nature of U S  coins  this will be the first time there will be circulating U S  coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse  heads  side  Lincoln penny  Jefferson nickel  Franklin D  Roosevelt dime  Washington quarter and Kennedy half dollar dollar   Another unusual fact about the new  1 coin is Grover Cleveland will have two coins with his portrait issued due to the fact he was the only U S  President to be elected to two non consecutive terms  37  Early releases of the Washington coin included error coins shipped primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks  Highly sought after by collectors  and trading for as much as  850 each within a week of discovery  the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions  E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P   The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia  although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units  Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to  heads   some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying  upside down lettering error  coins  38  Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years  whereas coins are more permanent  The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes which have been withdrawn from circulation bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones  As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes  they commonly accept only  1 bills  though a few will give change in dollar coins   edit  Mint marks Most U S  coins bear a mint mark as part of the design  usually found on the front of the coin near the date although in the past it was more commonly found on the reverse  The Philadelphia Mint issues coins bearing a letter P  or no mark at all   while the Denver Mint uses a letter D  The San Francisco Mint uses an S  though no coins have been released from that mint for general circulation since 1980  It does  however  continue to strike proof coins for collectors  The West Point Mint uses a W  though this is rarely seen as the West Point mint generally only makes high denomination coins  with face values over  1 00  which are not meant for everyday use  A CC mark  for the Carson City Mint  was used from 1870 to 1893  but the mint at that location was only a temporary establishment  The New Orleans Mint used a mint mark O  It operated from 1838 until Louisiana seceded from the Union in 1861  and again from 1879 to 1909  The letter D was also used for coinage of the Dahlonega Mint from 1837 to 1861  and C was used for the Charlotte Mint during the same timespan  The latter two mints struck gold coins only   edit  Banknotes Main article  Federal Reserve Note The U S  Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power to  borrow money on the credit of the United States   39  Congress has exercised that power by authorizing Federal Reserve Banks to issue Federal Reserve Notes  Those notes are  obligations of the United States  and  shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States  in the city of Washington  District of Columbia  or at any Federal Reserve bank   40  Federal Reserve Notes are designated by law as  legal tender  for the payment of debts  41  Congress has also authorized the issuance of more than 10 other types of banknotes  including the United States Note 42  and the Federal Reserve Bank Note  The Federal Reserve Note is the only type that remains in circulation since the 1970s  Currently printed denominations are  1   2   5   10   20   50  and  100  Notes above the  100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969  These notes were used primarily in inter bank transactions or by organized crime  it was the latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue

 Means of issue Currently  the US government maintains over 800 billion US dollars in cash money  primarily Federal Reserve Notes  in circulation  44  45  The amount of cash in circulation is increased  or decreased  by the actions of the Federal Reserve System  Eight times a year  the 12 person Federal Open Market Committee meet to determine US monetary policy  46  Every business day  the Federal Reserve System engages in Open market operations to carry out that monetary policy  47  If the Federal Reserve desires to increase the money supply  it will buy securities  such as US Treasury Bonds  anonymously citation needed  from banks in exchange for dollars  Conversely  it will sell securities to the banks in exchange for dollars  to take dollars out of circulation  48  When the Federal Reserve makes a purchase  it credits the seller s reserve account  with the Federal Reserve   This money is not transferred from any existing funds it is at this point that the Federal Reserve has created new high powered money  Commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the Federal Reserve  To fulfill those requests  the Federal Reserve places an order for printed money from the US Treasury Department  49  The Treasury Department in turn sends these requests to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing  to print new dollar bills  and the Bureau of the Mint  to stamp the coins   Usually  the short term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short term interest rate target  In other instances  monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold  For example  in the case of the USA the Federal Reserve targets the federal funds rate  the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight  The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include   i  Discount window lending  as lender of last resort    ii  Fractional deposit lending  changes in the reserve requirement    iii  Moral suasion  cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes    iv   Open mouth operations   talking monetary

Article 1 of the U S  Constitution provides that the U S  Congress shall have the power to  coin money  and to  regulate the value  of domestic and foreign coins  Congress exercised those powers when it enacted the Coinage Act of 1792  That Act provided for the minting of the first U S  dollar and it declared that the U S  dollar shall have  the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current   50  The table to the right shows the equivalent amount of goods that  in a particular year  could be purchased with  1  The table shows that from 1774 through 2009 the U S  dollar has lost about 96 4  of its buying power  51  The decline in the value of the U S  dollar corresponds to price inflation  which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time  52  A consumer price index  CPI  is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services purchased by households  The United States Consumer Price Index  published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services in the United States  53  It reflects inflation as experienced by consumers in their day to day living expenses  54  A graph showing the U S  CPI relative to 1982 1984 and the annual year over year change in CPI is shown at right  The value of the U S  dollar declined significantly during wartime  especially during the American Civil War  World War I  and World War II  55  The Federal Reserve  which was established in 1913  was designed to furnish an  elastic  currency subject to  substantial changes of quantity over short periods   which differed significantly from previous forms of high powered money such as gold  national bank notes  and silver coins  56  Over the very long run  the prior gold standard kept prices stable for instance  the price level and the value of the U S  dollar in 1914 was not very different from the price level in the 1880s  The Federal Reserve initially succeeded in maintaining the value of the U S  dollar and price stability  reversing the inflation caused by the First World War and stabilizing the value of the dollar during the 1920s  before presiding over a 30  deflation in U S  prices in the 1930s  57  Under the Bretton Woods system established after World War II  the value of the U S  dollar was fixed to  35 per ounce  and the value of the U S  dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold  Rising government spending in the 1960s  however  led to doubts about the ability of the United States to maintain this convertibility  gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold  and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline  Facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the United States would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold  gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by President Nixon  resulting in the  Nixon shock   58  The value of the U S  dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold  and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the value of the U S  currency  The Federal Reserve  however  continued to increase the money supply  resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the U S  dollar in the 1970s  This was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked  the Phillips curve   and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign  58  Between 1965 and 1981  the U S  dollar lost two thirds of its value  51  In 1979  President Carter appointed Paul Volcker Chairman of the Federal Reserve  The Federal Reserve tightened the money supply and inflation was substantially lower in the 1980s  and hence the value of the U S  dollar stabilized  58  Over the thirty year period from 1981 to 2009  the U S  dollar lost over half its value  51  This is because the Federal Reserve has targeted not zero inflation  but a low  stable rate of inflation between 1987 and 1997  the rate of inflation was approximately 3 5   and between 1997 and 2007 it was approximately 2   The so called  Great Moderation  of economic conditions since the 1970s is credited to monetary policy targeting price stability  58  There is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation  which would mean a constant value for the U S  dollar over time  or low  stable inflation  which would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time  as is the case now   Although some economists are in favor of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the U S  dollar  57  others contend that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control interest rates and stimulate the economy when needed  59   edit  Exchange rates  edit  Historical exchange rates Currency units per U S  dollar  averaged over the year  60      value at start of year  1864 1970  1980  1985  1990
