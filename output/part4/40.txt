 1  2  3  4  Created by American writer Jerry Siegel and Canadian born American artist Joe Shuster in 1932 while both were living in Cleveland  Ohio  and sold to Detective Comics  Inc   later DC Comics  in 1938  the character first appeared in Action Comics  1  June 1938  and subsequently appeared in various radio serials  television programs  films  newspaper strips  and video games  With the success of his adventures  Superman helped to create the superhero genre and establish its primacy within the American comic book  1  The character s appearance is distinctive and iconic  a blue  red and yellow costume  complete with cape  with a stylized  S  shield on his chest  5  6  7  This shield is now typically used across media to symbolize the character  8  The original story of Superman relates that he was born Kal El on the planet Krypton  before being rocketed to Earth as an infant by his scientist father Jor El  moments before Krypton s destruction  Discovered and adopted by a Kansas farmer and his wife  the child is raised as Clark Kent and imbued with a strong moral compass  Very early he started to display superhuman abilities  which upon reaching maturity he resolved to use for the benefit of humanity  Superman has fascinated scholars  with cultural theorists  commentators  and critics alike exploring the character s impact and role in the United States and the rest of the world  Umberto Eco discussed the mythic qualities of the character in the early 1960s  and Larry Niven has pondered the implications of a sexual relationship the character might enjoy with Lois Lane  9  The character s ownership has often been the subject of dispute  with Siegel and Shuster twice suing for the return of legal ownership  Superman placed first on IGN s Top 100

Man  in the fanzine Science Fiction  No 3  June 1933   Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster had initially created a bald telepathic villain bent on dominating the world  in the short story  The Reign of the Super Man  in Science Fiction  3  a fanzine Siegel published in 1933  11  Siegel re envisioned the character later that year as a hero bearing no resemblance to his villainous namesake  visually modeling Superman on Douglas Fairbanks and his bespectacled alter ego  Clark Kent  on Harold Lloyd  12  13  Comic strips such as Li l Abner and Dick Tracy influenced its original artwork  Siegel and Shuster then began a six year quest to find a publisher  Titling it The Superman  Siegel and Shuster offered it to Consolidated Book Publishing  who had published a 48 page black and white comic book entitled Detective Dan  Secret Operative No  48  Although the duo received an encouraging letter  Consolidated never again published comic books  Shuster took this to heart and burned all pages of the story  the cover surviving only because Siegel rescued it from the fire  Siegel and Shuster each compared this character to Slam Bradley  an adventurer the pair had created for Detective Comics No 1  March 1937   14  Siegel contacted other artists to collaborate on the strip  according to Gerard Jones feeling that  Superman was going nowhere with Joe   15 Tony Strobl  Mel Graff and Russell Keaton were all contacted as potential collaborators by Siegel  15  Artwork produced by Keaton based on Siegel s treatment shows the concept evolving  Superman is now sent back in time as a baby by the last man on Earth  where he is found and raised by Sam and Molly Kent  16  However Keaton did not pursue the collaboration  and soon Siegel and Shuster were back working together on the character  15  The pair re envisioned the character  who became more of a hero in the mythic tradition  inspired by such characters as Samson and Hercules  17  who would right the wrongs of Siegel and Shuster s times  fighting for social justice and against tyranny  It was at this stage the costume was introduced  Siegel later recalling that they created a  kind of costume and let s give him a big S on his chest  and a cape  make him as colorful as we can and as distinctive as we can   5  The design was based in part on the costumes worn by characters in outer space settings published in pulp magazines  as well as comic strips such as Flash Gordon  18  and also partly suggested by the traditional circus strong man outfit  which comprised a pair of shorts worn over a contrasting bodysuit  5  19  However  the cape has been noted as being markedly different from the Victorian tradition  Gary Engle described it as without  precedent in popular culture  in Superman at Fifty  The Persistence of a Legend  20  The circus performer s shorts over tights outfit was soon established as the basis for many future superhero outfits  This third version of the character was given extraordinary abilities  although this time of a physical nature as opposed to the mental abilities of the villainous Superman  5  The locale and the hero s civilian names were inspired by the movies  Shuster said in 1983   Jerry created all the names  We were great movie fans  and were inspired a lot by the actors and actresses we saw  As for Clark Kent  he combined the names of Clark Gable and Kent Taylor  And Metropolis  the city in which Superman operated  came from the Fritz Lang movie  Metropolis  1927   which we both loved   21  Although they were by now selling material to comic book publishers  notably Malcolm Wheeler Nicholson s National Allied Publishing  the pair decided to feature this character in a comic strip format  rather than in the longer comic book story format that was establishing itself at this time  They offered it to both Max Gaines  who passed  and to United Feature Syndicate  who expressed interest initially but finally rejected the strip in a letter dated February 18  1937  However  in what historian Les Daniels describes as  an incredibly convoluted turn of events   Max Gaines ended up positioning the strip as the lead feature in Wheeler Nicholson s new publication  Action Comics  Vin Sullivan  editor of the new book  wrote to the pair requesting that the comic strips be refashioned to suit the comic book format  requesting  eight panels a page   However Siegel and Shuster ignored this  utilizing their own experience and ideas to create page layouts  with Siegel also identifying the image used for the cover of Action Comics No 1  June 1938   Superman s first appearance  22  In February 2010  an original Action Comics  1 was sold at auction for  1 000 000  23  Siegel may have been inspired to create the Superman character due to the death of his father  Mitchell Siegel was an immigrant who owned a clothing store on Cleveland s near east side  He died during a robbery attempt in 1932  a year before Superman was created  Although Siegel never mentioned the death of his father in interviews  both Gerard Jones and Brad Meltzer believe it must have affected him   It had to have an effect   says Jones   There s a connection there  the loss of a dad as a source for Superman   Meltzer states   Your father dies in a robbery  and you invent a bulletproof man who becomes the world s greatest hero  I m sorry  but there s a story there

on April 18  1938  cover dated to June 1938   25  In 1939  a self titled series was launched  The first issue mainly reprinted adventures published in Action Comics  but despite this the book achieved greater sales  26  The year 1939 also saw the publication of New York World s Fair Comics  which by summer of 1942 became World s Finest Comics  With issue No 7 of All Star Comics  Superman made the first of a number of infrequent appearances  on this occasion appearing in cameo to establish his honorary membership in the Justice Society of America  27  Initially Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster provided the story and art for all the strips published  However  Shuster s eyesight began to deteriorate  and the increasing appearances of the character meant an increase in the workload  This led Shuster to establish a studio to assist in the production of the art  26  although he insisted on drawing the face of every Superman the studio produced  Outside the studio  Jack Burnley began supplying covers and stories in 1940  28  and in 1941 artist Fred Ray began contributing a stream of Superman covers  some of which  such as that of Superman No 14  February 1942   became iconic and much reproduced  Wayne Boring  initially employed in Shuster s studio  began working for DC in his own right in 1942 providing pages for both Superman and Action Comics  29 Al Plastino was hired initially to copy Wayne Boring but was eventually allowed to create his own style and became one of the most prolific Superman artists during the Gold and Silver Ages of comics  30  The scripting duties also became shared  In late 1939 a new editorial team assumed control of the character s adventures  Whitney Ellsworth  Mort Weisinger and Jack Schiff were brought in following Vin Sullivan s departure  This new editorial team brought in Edmond Hamilton  Manly Wade Wellman  and Alfred Bester  established writers of science fiction  31  By 1943  Jerry Siegel was drafted into the army in a special celebration  and as a result his contributions diminished  Don Cameron and Alvin Schwartz joined the writing team  Schwartz teaming up with Wayne Boring to work on the Superman comic strip  which had been launched by Siegel and Shuster in 1939  29  In 1945  Superboy made his debut in More Fun Comics  101  The character moved to Adventure Comics in 1946  and his own title  Superboy  was launched in 1949  The 1950s saw the launching of Superman s Pal Jimmy Olsen  1954  and Superman s Girlfriend Lois Lane  1958   By 1974 these titles had merged into Superman Family  although the series was canceled in 1982  DC Comics Presents was a series published from 1978 to 1986 featuring team ups between Superman and a wide variety of other characters of the DC Universe  In 1986  a decision was taken to restructure the universe the Superman character inhabited with other DC characters in the mini series Crisis on Infinite Earths  resulting in the publication of  Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow   a two part story written by Alan Moore  with art by Curt Swan  George P rez and Kurt Schaffenberger  32  The story was published in Superman No 423 and Action Comics No 583 and presented what Les Daniels notes as  the sense of loss the fans might have experienced if this had really been the last Superman tale   33  Superman s origin is revamped in The Man of Steel No 1  July 1986   written and drawn by John Byrne  Superman was relaunched by writer  amp  artist John Byrne  initially in the limited series The Man of Steel  1986   The year 1986 also saw the cancellation of World s Finest Comics  and the Superman title renamed The Adventures of Superman  A second volume of Superman was launched in 1987  running until cancellation in 2006  After this cancellation  The Adventures of Superman reverted to the Superman title  Superman  The Man of Steel was launched in 1991  running until 2003  while the quarterly book Superman  The Man of Tomorrow ran from 1995 to 1999  In 2003 Superman Batman was launched as well as the Superman  Birthright limited series  with All Star Superman launched in 2005 and Superman Confidential in 2006  this title was canceled in 2008   He also appeared in the TV animated series based comic book tie ins Superman Adventures  1996 2002   Justice League Adventures  Justice League Unlimited  canceled in 2008  and The Legion of Super Heroes In The 31st Century  canceled in 2008   Current ongoing publications that feature Superman on a regular basis are Superman  Action Comics  Superman Batman and Justice League of America  The character often appears as a guest star in other series and is usually a pivotal figure in DC crossover events  Influences An influence on early Superman stories is the context of the Great Depression  The left leaning perspective of creators Shuster and Siegel is reflected in early storylines  Superman took on the role of social activist  fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run down tenements  34  This is seen by comics scholar Roger Sabin as a reflection of  the liberal idealism of Franklin Roosevelt s New Deal   with Shuster and Siegel initially portraying Superman as champion to a variety of social causes  35  In later Superman radio programs the character continued to take on such issues  tackling a version of the KKK in a 1946 broadcast  36  37  Siegel and Shuster s status as children of Jewish immigrants is also thought to have influenced their work  Timothy Aaron Pevey has argued that they crafted  an immigrant figure whose desire was to fit into American culture as an American   something which Pevey feels taps into an important aspect of American identity  38  Siegel himself noted that the mythic heroes in the traditions of many cultures bore an influence on the character  including Hercules and Samson  5 Scott Bukatman sees the character to be  a worthy successor to Lindberg      and  also     like Babe Ruth   and is also representative of the United States dedication to  progress and the  new   through his  invulnerable body     on which history cannot be inscribed   39  Further  given that Siegel and Shuster were noted fans of pulp science fiction  11  it has been suggested that another influence may have been Hugo Danner  Danner was the main character of the 1930 novel Gladiator by Philip Wylie  and is possessed of the same powers of the early Superman  40  Comics creator and historian Jim Steranko has cited the pulp hero Doc Savage as another likely source of inspiration  noting similarities between Shuster s initial art and contemporary advertisements for Doc Savage   Initially  Superman was a variation of pulp heavyweight Doc Savage   41  Steranko argued that the pulps played a major part in shaping the initial concept   Siegel s Superman concept embodied and amalgamated three separate and distinct themes  the visitor from another planet  the superhuman being and the dual identity  He composed the Superman charisma by exploiting all three elements  and all three contributed equally to the eventual success of the strip  His inspiration  of course  came from the science fiction pulps   41  identifying another pulp likely to have influenced the pair as being  John W  Campbell s Aarn Munro stories about a descendant of earthmen raised on the planet Jupiter who  because of the planet s dense gravity  is a mental and physical superman on Earth   41  Because Siegel and Shuster were both Jewish  some religious commentators and pop culture scholars such as Rabbi Simcha Weinstein and British novelist Howard Jacobson suggest that Superman s creation was partly influenced by Moses  42  43  and other Jewish elements  Superman s Kryptonian name   Kal El   resembles the Hebrew words        which can be taken to mean  voice of God   44  45  The suffix  el   meaning   of  God  46  is also found in the name of angels  e g  Gabriel  Ariel   who are flying humanoid agents of good with superhuman powers  Jewish legends of the Golem have been cited as worthy of comparison  47  a Golem being a mythical being created to protect and serve the persecuted Jews of 16th century Prague and later revived in popular culture in reference to their suffering at the hands of the Nazis in Europe during the 1930s and 1940s  Superman is often seen as being an analogy for Jesus  being a savior of humanity  35  43  47  48  Furthermore  the surname Kent  in early 20th century real life  was a common Americanization of  Cohen   and Clark Kent s wimpy  bumbling persona strongly resembled the classic Yiddish schlemiel  Whilst the term Superman was initially coined by Friedrich Nietzsche  it is unclear how influential Nietzsche and his ideals were to Siegel and Shuster  43  Les Daniels has speculated that  Siegel picked up the term from other science fiction writers who had casually employed it   further noting that  his concept is remembered by hundreds of millions who may barely know who Nietzsche is   5  Others argue that Siegel and Shuster  could not have been unaware of an idea that would dominate Hitler s National Socialism  The concept was certainly well discussed   49  Yet Jacobson and others point out that in many ways Superman and the  bermensch are polar opposites  42  Nietzsche envisioned the  bermensch as a man who had transcended the limitations of society  religion  and conventional morality while still being fundamentally human  Superman  although an alien gifted with incredible powers  chooses to honor human moral codes and social mores  Nietzsche envisioned the perfect man as being beyond moral codes  Siegel and Shuster envisioned the perfect man as holding himself to a higher standard of adherence to them  50  Siegel and Shuster have themselves discussed a number of influences that impacted upon the character  Both were avid readers  and their mutual love of science fiction helped to drive their friendship  Siegel cited John Carter stories as an influence   Carter was able to leap great distances because the planet Mars was smaller that the planet Earth  and he had great strength  I visualized the planet Krypton as a huge planet  much larger than Earth   21  The pair were also avid collectors of comic strips in their youth  cutting them from the newspaper  with Winsor McKay s Little Nemo firing their imagination with its sense of fantasy  51  Shuster has remarked on the artists which played an important part in the development of his own style  whilst also noting a larger influence   Alex Raymond and Burne Hogarth were my idols   also Milt Caniff  Hal Foster  and Roy Crane  But the movies were the greatest influence on our imagination  especially the films of Douglas Fairbanks Senior   52  Fairbanks  role as Robin Hood was certainly an inspiration  as Shuster admitted to basing Superman s stance upon scenes from the movie  53  The movies also influenced the storytelling and page layouts  54  whilst the city of Metropolis was named in honor of the Fritz Lang motion picture of the same title  21  Copyright issues This section is outdated  Please update this section to reflect recent events or newly available information  Please see the talk page for more information   June 2011  As part of the deal which saw Superman published in Action Comics  Siegel and Shuster sold the rights to the company in return for  130 and a contract to supply the publisher with material  55  56 The Saturday Evening Post reported in 1940 that the pair was each being paid  75 000 a year  a fraction of National Comics Publications  millions in Superman profits  57  Siegel and Shuster renegotiated their deal  but bad blood lingered and in 1947 Siegel and Shuster sued for their 1938 contract to be made void and the re establishment of their ownership of the intellectual property rights to Superman  The pair also sued National in the same year over the rights to Superboy  which they claimed was a separate creation that National had published without authorization  National immediately fired them and took their byline off the stories  prompting a legal battle that ended in 1948  when a New York court ruled that the 1938 contract should be upheld  However  a ruling from Justice J  Addison Young awarded them the rights to Superboy  A month after the Superboy judgment the two sides agreed on a settlement  National paid Siegel and Shuster  94 000 for the rights to Superboy  The pair also acknowledged in writing the company s ownership of Superman  attesting that they held rights for  all other forms of reproduction and presentation  whether now in existence or that may hereafter be created   58  but DC refused to re hire them  59  Jerry Siegel  with wife Joanne and daughter Laura in 1976  Joanne and Laura Siegel filed a termination notice on Jerry Siegel s share of the copyright of Superman in 1999  In 1973 Siegel and Shuster again launched a suit claiming ownership of Superman  this time basing the claim on the Copyright Act of 1909 which saw copyright granted for 28 years but allowed for a renewal of an extra 28 years  Their argument was that they had granted DC the copyright for only 28 years  The pair again lost this battle  both in a district court ruling of October 18  1973 and an appeal court ruling of December 5  1974  60  61  In 1975 after news reports of their pauper like existences  Warner Communications gave Siegel and Shuster lifetime pensions of  20 000 per year and health care benefits  Jay Emmett  then executive vice president of Warner Bros   was quoted in the New York Times as stating   There is no legal obligation  but I sure feel there is a moral obligation on our part   57  Heidi MacDonald  writing for Publishers Weekly  noted that in addition to this pension  Warner agreed that Siegel and Shuster would henceforth be credited as creators of Superman on all comics  TV shows and films   56  The year after this settlement  1976  the copyright term was extended again  this time for another 19 years for a total of 75 years  However  this time a clause was inserted into the extension to allow authors to reclaim their work  reflecting the arguments Siegel and Shuster had made in 1973  The new act took effect in 1978 and allowed a reclamation window in a period based on the previous copyright term of 56 years  This meant the copyright on Superman could be reclaimed between 1994 to 1999  based on the initial publication date of 1938  Jerry Siegel having died in January 1996  his wife and daughter filed a copyright termination notice in 1999  Although Joe Shuster died in July 1992  no termination was filed at this time by his estate  62  In 1998  the copyright was extended again with the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act  This time the copyright term was extended to 95 years with a further window for reclamation introduced  In January 2004 Mark Peary  nephew and legal heir to Joe Shuster s estate  filed notice of his intent to reclaim Shuster s half of the copyright  the termination effective in 2013  62  The status of Siegel s share of the copyright is now the subject of a legal battle  Warner Bros  and the Siegels entered into discussions on how to resolve the issues raised by the termination notice  but these discussions were set aside by the Siegels and in October 2004 they filed suit alleging copyright infringement on the part of Warner Bros  Warner Bros  counter sued  alleging that the termination notice contains defects  among other arguments  63  64  On March 26  2008  Judge Larson of the United States District Court for the Central District of California ruled that Siegel s estate was entitled to claim a share in the United States copyright  The ruling does not affect the International rights  which Time Warner holds on the character through DC  Issues regarding the amount of monies owed Siegel s estate and whether the claim the estate has extends to derivative works such as movie versions will be settled at trial  although any compensation would be owed only from works published since 1999  Time Warner offered no statement on the ruling but do have the right to challenge it  65  66  The case was scheduled to be heard in a California federal court in May  2008  67  A similar termination of copyright notice filed in 2002 by Siegel s wife and daughter concerning the Superboy character was ruled on in their favor on March 23  2006  68  However  on July 27  2007  the same court issued a ruling 69  reversing the March 23  2006 ruling  This ruling is currently subject to a legal challenge from Time Warner  with the case as yet update  unresolved  65  A July 9  2009  verdict on the case denied a claim by Siegel s family that it was owed licensing fees  U S  District Court judge Stephen G  Larson said Warner Bros  and DC Comics have fulfilled their obligations to the Siegels under a profit sharing agreement for the 2006 movie Superman Returns and the CW series Smallville  However  the court also ruled that if Warner Bros  does not start a new Superman film by 2011  the family will have the right to sue to recover damages  70  Character biography Main article  History of Superman See also  Superman  Earth Two  Superman  given the serial nature of comic publishing and the length of the character s existence  has evolved as a character as his adventures have increased  71  The details of Superman s origin  relationships and abilities changed significantly during the course of the character s publication  from what is considered the Golden Age of Comic Books through the Modern Age  The powers and villains were developed through the 1940s  with Superman developing the ability to fly  and costumed villains introduced from 1941  72  The character was shown as learning of the existence of Krypton in 1949  The concept itself had originally been established to the reader in 1939 in the Superman comic strip  73  The 1960s saw the introduction of a second Superman  DC had established a multiverse within the fictional universe its characters shared  This allowed characters published in the 1940s to exist alongside updated counterparts published in the 1960s  This was explained to the reader through the notion that the two groups of characters inhabited parallel Earths  The second Superman was introduced to explain to the reader Superman s membership in both the 1940s superhero team the Justice Society of America and the 1960s superhero team the Justice League of America  74  Superman dies in Lois Lane s arms  Superman No  75  vol  2  January 1993   Art by Dan Jurgens and Brett Breeding  The 1980s saw radical revisions of the character  DC decided to remove the multiverse in a bid to simplify its comics line  This led to the rewriting of the back story of the characters DC published  Superman included  John Byrne rewrote Superman  removing many established conventions and characters from continuity  including Superboy and Supergirl  Byrne also re established Superman s adoptive parents  The Kents  as characters  75  In the previous continuity  the characters had been written as having died early in Superman s life  about the time of Clark Kent s graduation from high school   In 1993 Superman was killed by the villain Doomsday  76  although the character was soon resurrected  77  Superman also marries Lois Lane in 1996  His origin is again revisited in 2004  78  In 2006 Superman is stripped of his powers  79  although these are restored within a fictional year  80  After a confrontation with Brainiac that results in his father s death  Superman discovers the lost city of Kandor  which contains 10 000 Kryptonians  Their stay on Earth causes trouble  and the Kryptonians create their own planet  New Krypton  Eventually  New Krypton wages war against Earth  The two sides sustain major casualties and most of the Kryptonians are killed  Superman then starts a journey to reconnect with his adopted home world  Personality In the original Siegel and Shuster stories  Superman s personality is rough and aggressive  The character was seen stepping in to attack and terrorize wife beaters  profiteers  a lynch mob and gangsters  with rather rough edges and a looser moral code than audiences may be used to today  34  Later writers have softened the character and instilled a sense of idealism and moral code of conduct  Although not as cold blooded as the early Batman  the Superman featured in the comics of the 1930s is unconcerned about the harm his strength may cause  tossing villainous characters in such a manner that fatalities would presumably occur  although these were seldom shown explicitly on the page  This came to an end late in 1940 when new editor Whitney Ellsworth instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow  banning Superman from ever killing  73  This change would even be reflected in the stories themselves  in which it would occasionally be pointed out in the narrative or dialogue that Superman had vowed never to take human life and that if he ever did so  he would hang up his cape and retire  Today  Superman is commonly seen as a brave and kind hearted hero with a strong sense of justice  morality and righteousness  He adheres to a strict moral code often attributed to the Midwestern values with which he was raised  His commitment to operating within the law has been an example to many other heroes but has stirred resentment among others  who refer to him as the  big blue boy scout   Superman can be rather rigid in this trait  causing tensions in the superhero community  notably with Wonder Woman  one of his closest friends  after she killed Maxwell Lord  81  and Booster Gold  who after an initial icy relationship with the Man of Steel  grew to respect him  82  Having lost his home world of Krypton  Superman is very protective of Earth  and especially of Clark Kent s family and friends  This same loss  combined with the pressure of using his powers responsibly  has caused Superman to feel lonely on Earth  despite his many friends  his wife and his parents  Previous encounters with people he thought to be fellow Kryptonians  Power Girl 83   who is  in fact from the Krypton of the Earth Two universe  and Mon El  84  have led to disappointment  The arrival of Supergirl  who has been confirmed to be not only from Krypton but also his cousin  has relieved this loneliness somewhat  85  In Superman Batman No 3  December 2003   Batman observes   It is a remarkable dichotomy  In many ways  Clark is the most human of us all  Then    he shoots fire from the skies  and it is difficult not to think of him as a god  And how fortunate we all are that it does not occur to him   86  Later  as Infinite Crisis began  Batman admonished him for identifying with humanity too much and failing to provide the strong leadership that superhumans need  87  Superman has sometimes portrayed as a vegetarian  while at other times  an omnivore  indeed  it is often unclear as to whether he even needs to eat  although in some works  such as Superman  Peace on Earth  it is clearly stated he does not need to eat  and thus he only eats for pleasure and will never know hunger  In Superman  Birthright  Superman is portrayed as a strict vegetarian  However  in Straczynski s  Superman  Grounded  he ordered a  philly cheese steak  sandwich  88  In the 1966 Broadway play It s a Bird   It s a Plane   It s Superman  Superman  portrayed by Bob Holiday  sings   Gosh I m hungry  I d sure like a T bone steak   89  Other versions Main article  Alternative versions of Superman Both the multiverse established by the publishers in the 1960s and the Elseworlds line of comics established in 1989 have allowed writers to introduce variations on Superman  These have included differences in the nationality  race and morality of the character  Alongside such reimaginings  a number of characters have assumed the title of Superman  especially in the wake of  The Death of Superman  storyline  wherein four newly introduced characters are seen to claim the mantle  90  In addition to these  the Bizarro character created in 1958 is a weird  imperfect duplicate of Superman  91  Other members of Superman s family of characters have borne the Super  prefix  including Supergirl  Superdog and Superwoman  Outside comics published by DC  the notoriety of the Superman or   bermensch  archetype makes the character a popular figure to be represented through an analogue in entirely unrelated continuities  For example  Roy Thomas based rival publisher Marvel Comics  Hyperion character on Superman  92  93  94  95  Powers and abilities Main article  Powers and abilities of Superman As an influential archetype of the superhero genre  Superman possesses extraordinary powers  with the character traditionally described as  faster than a speeding bullet  more powerful than a locomotive  and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound   a phrase coined by Jay Morton and first used in the Superman radio serials and Max Fleischer animated shorts of the 1940s 96  as well as the TV series of the 1950s  For most of his existence  Superman s famous arsenal of powers has included flight  super strength  invulnerability to non magical attacks  super speed  vision powers  including x ray  heat emitting  telescopic  infra red  and microscopic vision   super hearing  and super breath  which enables him to blow out air at freezing temperatures  as well as exert the propulsive force of high speed winds  97  As originally conceived and presented in his early stories  Superman s powers were relatively limited  consisting of superhuman strength that allowed him to lift a car over his head  run at amazing speeds and leap one eighth of a mile  as well as an incredibly dense body structure that could be pierced by nothing less than an exploding artillery shell  97  Siegel and Shuster compared his strength and leaping abilities to an ant and a grasshopper  98  When making the cartoons  the Fleischer Brothers found it difficult to keep animating him leaping and requested to DC to change his ability to flying  this was an especially convenient concept for short films  which would have otherwise had to waste precious running time moving earthbound Clark Kent from place to place  99  Writers gradually increased his powers to larger extents during the Silver Age  in which Superman could fly to other worlds and galaxies and even across universes with relative ease  97  He would often fly across the solar system to stop meteors from hitting the Earth  or sometimes just to clear his head  Writers found it increasingly difficult to write Superman stories in which the character was believably challenged  100  so DC made a series of attempts to rein the character in  The most significant attempt  John Byrne s 1986 rewrite  established several hard limits on his abilities  he barely survives a nuclear blast  and his space flights are limited by how long he can hold his breath  101  Superman s power levels have again increased since then  with Superman currently possessing enough strength to hurl mountains  withstand nuclear blasts with ease  fly into the sun unharmed  and survive in the vacuum of outer space without oxygen  The source of Superman s powers has changed subtly over the course of his history  It was originally stated that Superman s abilities derived from his Kryptonian heritage  which made him eons more evolved than humans  73  This was soon amended  with the source for the powers now based upon the establishment of Krypton s gravity as having been stronger than that of the Earth  This situation mirrors that of Edgar Rice Burroughs  John Carter  As Superman s powers increased  the implication that all Kryptonians had possessed the same abilities became problematic for writers  making it doubtful that a race of such beings could have been wiped out by something as trifling as an exploding planet  In part to counter this  the Superman writers established that Kryptonians  whose native star Rao had been red  possessed superpowers only under the light of a yellow sun  102  Superman is most vulnerable to green Kryptonite  mineral debris from Krypton transformed into radioactive material by the forces that destroyed the planet  Exposure to green Kryptonite radiation nullifies Superman s powers and immobilizes him with pain and nausea  prolonged exposure will eventually kill him  The only substance on Earth that can protect him from Kryptonite is lead  which blocks the radiation  Lead is also the only known substance that Superman cannot see through with his x ray vision  Kryptonite was first introduced to the public in 1943 as a plot device to allow the radio serial voice actor  Bud Collyer  to take some time off  71  Although green Kryptonite is the most commonly seen form  writers have introduced other forms over the years  such as red  gold  blue  white  and black  each with its own effect  103  Supporting cast See also  Superman character and cast and List of Superman supporting characters Clark Kent  Superman s secret identity  was based partly on Harold Lloyd and named after Clark Gable and Kent Taylor  12  13  Creators have discussed the idea of whether Superman pretends to be Clark Kent or vice versa  and at differing times in the publication either approach has been adopted  104  105  Although typically a newspaper reporter  during the 1970s the character left the Daily Planet for a time to work for television  105  whilst the 1980s revamp by John Byrne saw the character become somewhat more aggressive  101  This aggressiveness has since faded with subsequent creators restoring the mild mannerisms traditional to the character  Superman s large cast of supporting characters includes Lois Lane  perhaps the character most commonly associated with Superman  being portrayed at different times as his colleague  competitor  love interest and or wife  Other main supporting characters include Daily Planet coworkers such as photographer Jimmy Olsen and editor Perry White  Clark Kent s adoptive parents Jonathan and Martha Kent  childhood sweetheart Lana Lang and best friend Pete Ross  and former college love interest Lori Lemaris  a mermaid   Stories making reference to the possibility of Superman siring children have been featured both in and out of mainstream continuity  Incarnations of Supergirl  Krypto the Superdog  and Superboy have also been major characters in the mythos  as well as the Justice League of America  of which Superman is usually a member   A feature shared by several supporting characters is alliterative names  especially with the initials  LL   including Lex Luthor  Lois Lane  Linda Lee  Lana Lang  Lori Lemaris and Lucy Lane  106  alliteration being common in early comics  Team ups with fellow comics icon Batman are common  inspiring many stories over the years  When paired  they are often referred to as the  World s Finest  in a nod to the name of the comic book series that features many team up stories  In 2003  DC began to publish a new series featuring the two characters titled Superman Batman  Enemies Main article  List of Superman enemies Superman also has a rogues gallery of enemies  including his most well known nemesis  Lex Luthor  who has been envisioned over the years in various forms as both a rogue scientific genius with a personal vendetta against Superman  or a powerful but corrupt CEO of a conglomerate called LexCorp who thinks Superman is somehow hindering human progress by his heroic efforts  107  In the 2000s  he even becomes president of the United States  108  and has been depicted occasionally as a former childhood friend of Clark Kent  The alien android  in most incarnations  known as Brainiac is considered by Richard George to be the second most effective enemy of Superman  109  The enemy that accomplished the most  by actually killing Superman  is the raging monster Doomsday  Darkseid  one of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe  is also a formidable nemesis in most post Crisis comics  Other important enemies who have featured in various incarnations of the character  from comic books to film and television include the fifth dimensional imp Mister Mxyzptlk  the reverse Superman known as Bizarro and the Kryptonian criminal General Zod  among many others  Cultural impact Superman has come to be seen as both an American cultural icon 110  111  and the first comic book superhero  His adventures and popularity have established the character as an inspiring force within the public eye  with the character serving as inspiration for musicians  comedians and writers alike  Kryptonite  Brainiac and Bizarro have become synonymous in popular vernacular with Achilles  heel  extreme intelligence 112  and reversed logic 113  respectively  Similarly  the phrase  I m not Superman  or alternatively  you re not Superman  is an idiom used to suggest a lack of omnipotence  114  115  116  Inspiring a market The character s initial success led to similar characters being created  117  118  Batman was the first to follow  Bob Kane commenting to Vin Sullivan that given the  kind of money  Siegel and Shuster were earning with their superhero  you ll have one on Monday   119  Victor Fox  an accountant for DC  also noticed the revenue such comics generated and commissioned Will Eisner to create a deliberately similar character to Superman  Wonder Man was published in May 1939  and although DC successfully sued  claiming plagiarism  120  Fox had decided to cease publishing the character  Fox later had more success with the Blue Beetle  Fawcett Comics  Captain Marvel  launched in 1940  was Superman s main rival for popularity throughout the 1940s and was again the subject of a lawsuit  which Fawcett eventually settled in 1953  a settlement which involved the cessation of the publication of the character s adventures  121  Superhero comics are now established as the dominant genre in American comic book publishing  122  with many thousands of characters in the tradition having been created in the years since Superman s creation  123  Merchandising Superman became popular very quickly  with an additional title  Superman Quarterly  rapidly added  In 1940 the character was represented in the annual Macy s parade for the first time  124  In fact Superman had become popular to the extent that in 1942  with sales of the character s three titles standing at a combined total of over 1 5 million  Time was reporting that  the Navy Department  had  ruled that Superman comic books should be included among essential supplies destined for the Marine garrison at Midway Islands   125  The character was soon licensed by companies keen to cash in on this success through merchandising  The earliest paraphernalia appeared in 1939  a button proclaiming membership in the Supermen of America club  By 1940 the amount of merchandise available increased dramatically  with jigsaw puzzles  paper dolls  bubble gum and trading cards available  as well as wooden or metal figures  The popularity of such merchandise increased when Superman was licensed to appear in other media  and Les Daniels has written that this represents  the start of the process that media moguls of later decades would describe as  synergy    126  By the release of Superman Returns  Warner Bros  had arranged a cross promotion with Burger King  127  and licensed many other products for sale  Superman s appeal to licensees rests upon the character s continuing popularity  cross market appeal and the status of the  S  shield  the stylized magenta and gold  S  emblem Superman wears on his chest  as a fashion symbol  128  129  The  S  shield by itself is often used in media to symbolize the Superman character  It has been incorporated into the opening and or closing credits of several films and TV series  In other media Main article  Superman in other media Superman as he was depicted in Fleischer Studios s Superman theatrical cartoons  1941 1943  The character of Superman has appeared in various media aside from comic books  This is in some part seen to be owing to the character s cited standing as an American cultural icon  130  with the concept s continued popularity also being taken into consideration  131  but is also seen in part as due to good marketing initially  126  The character has been developed as a vehicle for serials on radio  television and film  as well as feature length motion pictures  and video games have also been developed featuring the character on multiple occasions  The first adaptation of Superman was as a daily newspaper comic strip  which was launched on January 16  1939  The strip ran until May 1966 and significantly  Siegel and Shuster used the first strips to establish Superman s background  adding details such as the planet Krypton and Superman s father  Jor El  concepts not yet established in the comic books  73  Following on from the success of this was the first radio series  The Adventures of Superman  which premiered on February 12  1940  and featured the voice of Bud Collyer as Superman  The series ran until March 1951  Collyer was also cast as the voice of Superman in a series of Superman animated cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios for theatrical release  Seventeen shorts were produced between 1941 and 1943  By 1948 Superman was back in the movie theatres  this time in a filmed serial  Superman  with Kirk Alyn becoming the first actor to portray Superman on screen  A second serial  Atom Man vs  Superman  followed in 1950  132  In 1951 a television series was commissioned  Adventures of Superman starring George Reeves  with the 25th and 26th episodes of the series being adapted from the theatrical release of the movie Superman and the Mole Men  The series ran for 104 episodes  from 1952 1958  The next adaptation of Superman occurred in 1966  when Superman was adapted for the stage in the Broadway musical It s a Bird   It s a Plane   It s Superman  Despite good reviews  the play closed after only 129 performances  133  The original cast album recording was released and continues to be available  134  However  in 1975 the play was remade for television  Superman was again animated  this time for television  in the series The New Adventures of Superman  Sixty eight shorts were made and broadcast between 1966 and 1969  Bud Collyer again provided the voice for Superman  Then  from 1973 until 1984  ABC broadcast the Super Friends series  this time animated by Hanna Barbera  135  Superman returned to movie theaters in 1978 with director Richard Donner s Superman starring Christopher Reeve  The film spawned three sequels  Superman II  1980   Superman III  1983  and Superman IV  The Quest for Peace  1987   136  In 1988 Superman returned to television in the Ruby Spears animated series Superman  137  and also in Superboy  a live action series that ran from 1988 until 1992  138  In 1993 Lois  amp  Clark  The New Adventures of Superman premiered on television starring Dean Cain as Superman and Teri Hatcher as Lois Lane  the series ran until 1997  Superman  The Animated Series was produced by Warner Bros  and ran from 1996 until 2000 on The WB Television Network  139  The early 21st century brought an increased presence of Superman in live action media  In 2001  the Smallville television series was launched  focusing on the adventures of Clark Kent as a teenager before he dons the mantle of Superman  Tom Welling stars as Clark  The series ended after ten seasons in May 2011  In 2006  Bryan Singer directed Superman Returns starring Brandon Routh as Superman  The film was presented as a loose sequel to the first two Christopher Reeve films  In 2007  Welling was in consideration for the role of Superman in the planned film Justice League  Mortal  to be directed by George Miller  140  The film was to feature Superman  Batman  Wonder Woman and other prominent members of DC Comics  Justice League of America  Though never officially announced  D J  Cotrona was cast in the part of Superman  but the film was canceled before production began  140  In 2010  the story of Superman s creation and his relationship with Jerry Siegel was dealt with in David Bar Katz s play The History of Invulnerability  which premiered at the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park  141  142  A new feature film  Man of Steel  will appear in theaters in December 2012  143  The film  directed by Zack Snyder with Henry Cavill in the starring role  will reboot the Warner Bros  film franchise in a fashion similar to the 2005 film Batman Begins  143  Cavill had auditioned and was considered for the lead role in Superman Returns before the part was offered to Routh  Musical references  parodies  and homages See also  Superman in popular music Superman has also featured as an inspiration for musicians  with songs by numerous artists from several generations celebrating the character  Donovan s Billboard Hot 100 topping single  Sunshine Superman  utilized the character in both the title and the lyric  declaring  Superman and Green Lantern ain t got nothing on me   144  Folk singer songwriter Jim Croce sung about the character in a list of warnings in the chorus of his song  You Don t Mess Around with Jim   introducing the phrase  you don t tug on Superman s cape  into popular lexicon  145  Other tracks to reference the character include Genesis   Land of Confusion   146  the video to which featured a Spitting Image puppet of Ronald Reagan dressed as Superman  147    Wish I Could Fly Like  Superman  by The Kinks on their 1979 album Low Budget and  Superman  by The Clique  a track later covered by R E M  on its 1986 album Lifes Rich Pageant  This cover is referenced by Grant Morrison in Animal Man  in which Superman meets the character  and the track comes on Animal Man s walkman immediately after  148 Crash Test Dummies   Superman s Song   from the 1991 album The Ghosts That Haunt Me explores the isolation and commitment inherent in Superman s life  149 Five for Fighting released  Superman  It s Not Easy   in 2000  which is from Superman s point of view  although Superman is never mentioned by name  150  Parodies of Superman did not take long to appear  with Mighty Mouse introduced in  The Mouse of Tomorrow  animated short in 1942  151  While the character swiftly took on a life of its own  moving beyond parody  other animated characters soon took their turn to parody the character  In 1943 Bugs Bunny was featured in a short  Super Rabbit  which sees the character gaining powers through eating fortified carrots  This short ends with Bugs stepping into a phone booth to change into a real  Superman  and emerging as a U S  Marine  In 1956 Daffy Duck assumes the mantle of  Cluck Trent  in the short  Stupor Duck   a role later reprised in various issues of the Looney Tunes comic book  152  In the United Kingdom Monty Python created the character Bicycle Repairman  who fixes bicycles on a world full of Supermen  for a sketch in series of their BBC show  153  Also on the BBC was the sit com  My Hero   which presented Thermoman as a slightly dense Superman pastiche  attempting to save the world and pursue romantic aspirations  154  In the United States  Saturday Night Live has often parodied the figure  with Margot Kidder reprising her role as Lois Lane in a 1979 episode  Jerry Seinfeld  a noted Superman fan  filled his series Seinfeld with references to the character and in 1997 asked for Superman to co star with him in a commercial for American Express  The commercial aired during the 1998 NFL Playoffs and Super Bowl  Superman animated in the style of artist Curt Swan  again at the request of Seinfeld  155  Superman has also been used as reference point for writers  with Steven T  Seagle s graphic novel Superman  It s a Bird exploring Seagle s feelings on his own mortality as he struggles to develop a story for a Superman tale  156 Brad Fraser used the character as a reference point for his play Poor Super Man  with The Independent noting the central character  a gay man who has lost many friends to AIDS as someone who  identifies all the more keenly with Superman s alien amid deceptive lookalikes status   157  Thom Zahler s romantic comedy Love and Capes is a parody of the entire genre  with the love story between a Superman analog   Please  I m iconic    and his non super fianc e as the primary focus  Superman is also mentioned in several films  including in Joel Schumacher s Batman  amp  Robin  in which Batman states   That s why Superman works alone     in reference to the many troubles caused by his partner Robin  and also in Sam Raimi s Spider Man  in which Aunt May gives her nephew Peter Parker a word of advice not to strain himself too much  as  You re not Superman  you know   among many others  Literary analysis Superman has been interpreted and discussed in many forms in the years since his debut  The character s status as the first costumed superhero has allowed him to be used in many studies discussing the genre  Umberto Eco noting that  he can be seen as the representative of all his similars   158  Writing in Time Magazine in 1971  Gerald Clarke stated   Superman s enormous popularity might be looked upon as signalling the beginning of the end for the Horatio Alger myth of the self made man   Clarke viewed the comics characters as having to continuously update in order to maintain relevance  and thus representing the mood of the nation  He regarded Superman s character in the early seventies as a comment on the modern world  which he saw as a place in which  only the man with superpowers can survive and prosper   159  Andrew Arnold  writing in the early 21st century  has noted Superman s partial role in exploring assimilation  the character s alien status allowing the reader to explore attempts to fit in on a somewhat superficial level  160  Clark Kent  argued by Jules Feiffer to be the most innovative feature of Superman A C  Grayling  writing in The Spectator  traces Superman s stances through the decades  from his 1930s campaign against crime being relevant to a nation under the influence of Al Capone  through the 1940s and World War II  a period in which Superman helped sell war bonds  161  and into the 1950s  where Superman explored the new technological threats  Grayling notes the period after the Cold War as being one where  matters become merely personal  the task of pitting his brawn against the brains of Lex Luthor and Brainiac appeared to be independent of bigger questions   and discusses events post 9 11  stating that as a nation  caught between the terrifying George W  Bush and the terrorist Osama bin Laden  America is in earnest need of a Saviour for everything from the minor inconveniences to the major horrors of world catastrophe  And here he is  the down home clean cut boy in the blue tights and red cape   162  Scott Bukatman has discussed Superman  and the superhero in general  noting the ways in which they humanize large urban areas through their use of the space  especially in Superman s ability to soar over the large skyscrapers of Metropolis  He writes that the character  represented  in 1938  a kind of Corbusierian ideal  Superman has X ray vision  walls become permeable  transparent  Through his benign  controlled authority  Superman renders the city open  modernist and democratic  he furthers a sense that Le Corbusier described in 1925  namely  that  Everything is known to us    39  Jules Feiffer has argued that Superman s real innovation lay in the creation of the Clark Kent persona  noting that what  made Superman extraordinary was his point of origin  Clark Kent   Feiffer develops the theme to establish Superman s popularity in simple wish fulfillment  163  a point Siegel and Shuster themselves supported  Siegel commenting that  If you re interested in what made Superman what it is  here s one of the keys to what made it universally acceptable  Joe and I had certain inhibitions    which led to wish fulfillment which we expressed through our interest in science fiction and our comic strip  That s where the dual identity concept came from  and Shuster supporting that as being  why so many people could relate to it   164  Ian Gordon suggests that the many incarnations of Superman across media use nostalgia to link the character to an ideology of the American Way  He defines this ideology as a means of associating individualism  consumerism  and democracy and as something that took shape around WWII and underpinned the war effort  Superman he notes was very much part of that effort  165  Superman s immigrant status is a key aspect of his appeal  166  167  168  Aldo Regalado saw the character as pushing the boundaries of acceptance in America  The extraterrestrial origin was seen by Regalado as challenging the notion that Anglo Saxon ancestry was the source of all might  169  Gary Engle saw the  myth of Superman  asserting  with total confidence and a childlike innocence the value of the immigrant in American culture   He argues that Superman allowed the superhero genre to take over from the Western as the expression of immigrant sensibilities  Through the use of a dual identity  Superman allowed immigrants to identify with both their cultures  Clark Kent represents the assimilated individual  allowing Superman to express the immigrants cultural heritage for the greater good  167  Timothy Aaron Pevey has argued other aspects of the story reinforce the acceptance of the American dream  He notes that  the only thing capable of harming Superman is Kryptonite  a piece of his old home world   38  David Jenemann has offered a contrasting view  He argues that Superman s early stories portray a threat   the possibility that the exile would overwhelm the country   170  David Rooney  a theater critic for the New York Times  in his evaluation of the play  Year Zero  considers Superman to be the  quintessential immigrant story    b orn on an alien planet  he grows stronger on Earth but maintains a secret identity tied to a homeland that continues to exert a powerful hold on him even as his every contact with those origins does him harm   171  Even an episode of 9 11 showed school children bullying dark skinned classmates one of whom was reading Superman  Told that Superman was American  the boy reminded them that Superman is an alien  and furthermore that Wonder Woman is a foreigner  Critical reception and popularity The character Superman and his various comic series have received various awards over the years  Empire magazine named him the greatest comic book character of all time  172  The Reign of the Supermen is one of many storylines or works to have received a Comics Buyer s Guide Fan Award  winning the Favorite Comic Book Story category in 1993  173  Superman came at number 2 in VH1 s Top Pop Culture Icons 2004  174  Also in 2004  British cinemagoers voted Superman as the greatest superhero of all time  175  Works featuring the character have also garnered six Eisner Awards 176  177  and three Harvey Awards  178  either for the works themselves or the creators of the works  The Superman films have received a number of nominations and awards  with Christopher Reeve winning a BAFTA for his performance in Superman  The Smallville television series has garnered Emmys for crew members and various other awards  179  180  181  Superman as a character is still seen as being as relevant now as he has been in the seventy years of his existence  182  Video games Main article  List of Superman video games While Superman is largely considered to be the archetypal superhero  and the flagship character of DC Comics  he has enjoyed virtually no success in video games  Ever since 1978  when the first game was released on the Atari 2600  numerous developers have tried at making a Superman game that was generally well received  although none have succeeded  One of the most notorious examples is the 1999 game for the Nintendo 64  simply titled  Superman   although often erroneously called  Superman 64  due to the tradition of N64 games putting the number  64  at the end of several titles   which is largely considered to be one of the worst games of all time  See also Comics
