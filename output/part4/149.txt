Roman Emperor and king of Bohemia from the House of Luxembourg  6  The three Partitions of Luxembourg have greatly reduced Luxembourg s territory  The recorded history of Luxembourg begins with the acquisition of Lucilinburhuc  7   today Luxembourg Castle  situated on the Bock rock by Siegfried  Count of Ardennes in 963 through an exchange act with the abbey of St Maximin in Trier  8  Around this fort  a town gradually developed  which became the centre of a small state of great strategic value  In the 14th and early 15th centuries three members of the House of Luxembourg reigned as Holy Roman Emperors  In 1437  the House of Luxembourg suffered a succession crisis  precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne  which led to the territory being sold by Duchess Elisabeth to Philip the Good of Burgundy  9  In the following centuries  Luxembourg s fortress was steadily enlarged and strengthened by its successive occupants  the Bourbons  Habsburgs  Hohenzollerns  and the French  among others  After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815  Luxembourg was disputed between Prussia and the Netherlands  The Congress of Vienna formed Luxembourg as a Grand Duchy in personal union with the Netherlands  Luxembourg also became a member of the German Confederation  with a Confederate fortress manned by Prussian troops  10  The Belgian Revolution of 1830 1839 reduced Luxembourg s territory by more than half  as the predominantly francophone western part of the country was transferred to Belgium  Luxembourg s independence was reaffirmed by the 1839 First Treaty of London  In the same year  Luxembourg joined the Zollverein  11  Luxembourg s independence and neutrality were again affirmed by the 1867 Second Treaty of London  after the Luxembourg Crisis nearly led to war between Prussia and France  12  After the latter conflict  the Confederate fortress was dismantled  13  The King of the Netherlands remained Head of State as Grand Duke of Luxembourg  maintaining personal union between the two countries until 1890  At the death of William III  the Dutch throne passed to his daughter Wilhelmina  while Luxembourg  at that time restricted to male heirs by the Nassau Family Pact  passed to Adolph of Nassau Weilburg  14  During World War I Luxembourg was invaded and occupied by Germany  but was allowed to maintain its independence and political mechanisms  During World War II  Luxembourg was unable to maintain its policy of neutrality when in 1940 Nazi Germany invaded and occupied the country  due to its strategic location on the invasion route into France  In contrast to the First World War experience  Luxembourg was treated as a Germanic territory and informally annexed to an adjacent province of the Third Reich in 1940  A government in exile based in London fought alongside the Allies  sending a small group of volunteers who participated in the Normandy invasion  Luxembourg was liberated in September 1944  It became a founding member of the United Nations in 1946  and of NATO in 1949  In 1957  Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Economic Community  later the European Union   and  in 1999  it joined the euro currency era  In 2005  a referendum on the EU treaty establishing a constitution for Europe was held in Luxembourg  15   edit  Politics Main article  Politics of Luxembourg Districts of
