gov Virginia  i v r d  nj     officially the Commonwealth of Virginia  is a U S  state on the Atlantic Coast of the Southern United States  Virginia is nicknamed the  Old Dominion  and sometimes the  Mother of Presidents  after the eight U S  presidents born there  The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay  which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna  The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond  Virginia Beach is the most populous city and Fairfax County the most populous political subdivision  The Commonwealth s population is over eight million  2  The area s history begins with several indigenous groups  including the Powhatan  In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent New World English colony  Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony s early politics and plantation economy  Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution and joined the Confederacy in the American Civil War  during which Richmond was made the Confederate capital and Virginia s northwestern counties separated to form the state of West Virginia  Although the Commonwealth was under conservative single party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction  both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia  6  The Virginia General Assembly is the oldest legislature in the Western Hemisphere  The state government has been repeatedly ranked most effective by the Pew Center on the States  7  It is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally  manages local roads  and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms  Virginia s economy has many sectors  agriculture in the Shenandoah Valley  federal agencies in Northern Virginia  including the headquarters of the Department of Defense and CIA  and military facilities in Hampton Roads  the site of the region s main seaport  Virginia s public schools and many colleges and universities have contributed to growing media and technology sectors  As a result  computer chips have become the state s leading export  8  Contents 1 Geography 1 1 Geology and terrain 1 2 Climate 1 3 Flora and fauna 2 History 2 1 Colony 2 2 Statehood 2 3 Civil War and aftermath 2 4 Contemporary era 3 Cities and towns 4

miles  110 784 7 km2   including 3 180 13 square miles  8 236 5 km2  of water  making it the 35th largest state by area  9  Virginia is bordered by Maryland and Washington  D C  to the north and east  by the Atlantic Ocean to the east  by North Carolina and Tennessee to the south  by Kentucky to the west  and by West Virginia to the north and west  Virginia s boundary with Maryland and Washington  D C  extends to the low water mark of the south shore of the Potomac River  10  The southern border is defined as the 36  30  parallel north  though surveyor error led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes  11   edit  Geology and terrain Virginia is divided into five geographic regions  The Chesapeake Bay separates the contiguous portion of the Commonwealth from the two county peninsula of Virginia s Eastern Shore  The bay was formed following a meteoroid impact crater during the Eocene  12  Many of Virginia s rivers flow into the Chesapeake Bay  including the Potomac  Rappahannock  York  and James  which create three peninsulas in the bay  13  14  Geographically and geologically  Virginia is divided into five regions from east to west  Tidewater  Piedmont  Blue Ridge Mountains  Ridge and Valley  and Cumberland Plateau  15  The Tidewater is a coastal plain between the Atlantic coast and the fall line  It includes the Eastern Shore and major estuaries of Chesapeake Bay  The Piedmont is a series of sedimentary and igneous rock based foothills east of the mountains which were formed in the Mesozoic  16  The region  known for its heavy clay soil  includes the Southwest Mountains  17  The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the chain of Appalachian Mountains with the highest points in the state  the tallest being Mount Rogers at 5 729 feet  1 746 m   18  The Ridge and Valley region is west of the mountains  and includes the Great Appalachian Valley  The region is carbonate rock based  and includes Massanutten Mountain  19  The Cumberland Plateau and the Cumberland Mountains are in the south west corner of Virginia  below the Allegheny Plateau  In this region rivers flow northwest  with a dendritic drainage system  into the Ohio River basin  20  Deciduous and evergreen trees give the Blue Ridge Mountains their distinct color 21  The state s carbonate rock is filled with more than 4 000 caves  ten of which are open for tourism  22  The Virginia seismic zone has not had a history of regular activity  Earthquakes are rarely above 4 5 on the Richter magnitude scale because Virginia is located away from the edges of the North American Plate  The largest earthquake  at an estimated 5 9 magnitude  was in 1897 near Blacksburg  23  A 5 8 magnitude earthquake struck central Virginia on August 23  2011  near Mineral  The earthquake was reportedly felt as far away as Toronto  Canada  24 Coal mining takes place in the three mountainous regions at 40 distinct coal beds near Mesozoic basins  25  Other resources such as slate  kyanite  sand  and gravel are mined  with an annual value of nearly  2 billion as of 2006 update   26   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Virginia Virginia state wide averages Climate chart  explanation

Precipitation totals in mm The climate of Virginia becomes increasingly warmer and more humid farther south and east  27  Seasonal extremes vary from average lows of 26  F   3  C  in January to average highs of 86  F  30  C  in July  The Atlantic ocean has a strong effect on eastern and southeastern coastal areas of the state  Influenced by the Gulf Stream  coastal weather is subject to hurricanes  most pronouncedly near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay  28  Virginia has an annual average of 35 45 days of thunderstorm activity  particularly in the western part of the state  29  and an average annual precipitation of 42 7 inches  108 cm   28  Cold air masses arriving over the mountains in winter can lead to significant snowfalls  such as the Blizzard of 1996 and winter storms of 2009 2010  The interaction of these elements with the state s topography creates distinct microclimates in the Shenandoah Valley  the mountainous southwest  and the coastal plains  30  Virginia averages seven tornadoes annually  most F2 or lower on the Fujita scale  31  In recent years  the expansion of the southern suburbs of Washington  D C  into Northern Virginia has introduced an urban heat island primarily caused by increased absorption of solar radiation in more densely populated areas  32  In the American Lung Association s 2011 report  11 counties received failing grades for air quality  with Fairfax County having the worst in the state  due to automobile pollution  33  34  Haze in the mountains is caused in part by coal power plants  35   edit  Flora and fauna Forests cover 65  of the state  primarily with deciduous  broad leaf trees  36  Lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance  with hickory and oak in the Blue Ridge  27  However since the early 1990s  Gypsy moth infestations have eroded the dominance of oak forests  37  In the lowland tidewater yellow pines tend to dominate  with bald cypress wetland forests in the Great Dismal and Nottoway swamps  Other common trees and plants include chestnut  maple  tulip poplar  mountain laurel  milkweed  daisies  and many species of ferns  The largest areas of wilderness are along the Atlantic coast and in the western mountains  where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in North America are found  27  38  The Atlantic coast regions are host to flora commonly associated with the South Atlantic pine forests and lower Southeast Coastal Plain maritime flora  the latter found primarily in southeastern Virginia  White tailed deer  also known as Virginia deer  graze at Tanner Ridge in Shenandoah National Park Mammals include White tailed deer  black bear  beaver  bobcat  coyote  raccoon  skunk  groundhog  Virginia Opossum  gray fox  red fox  and eastern cottontail rabbit  39  Birds include cardinals  barred owls  Carolina chickadees  Red tailed Hawks  Ospreys  Brown Pelicans  Quail  Sea gulls  Bald Eagles  and Wild Turkeys  The Peregrine Falcon was reintroduced into Shenandoah National Park in the mid 1990s  40  Walleye  brook trout  Roanoke bass  and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish  41  Running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by a plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders  27  The Chesapeake Bay is host to many species  including blue crabs  clams  oysters  and rockfish  also known as striped bass   42  Virginia has 30 National Park Service units  such as Great Falls Park and the Appalachian Trail  and one national park  the Shenandoah National Park  43  Shenandoah was established in 1935 and encompasses the scenic Skyline Drive  Almost 40  of the park s area  79 579 acres 322 km2  has been designated as wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System  44  Additionally  there are 34 Virginia state parks and 17 state forests  run by the Department of Conservation and Recreation and the Department of Forestry  36  45  The Chesapeake Bay  while not a national park  is protected by both state and federal legislation  and the jointly run Chesapeake Bay Program which conducts restoration on the bay and its watershed  The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge extends into North Carolina  46  The Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge marks the beginning of the Outer Banks which also extends into North Carolina   edit  History Main article  History of Virginia The story of Pocahontas  an ancestress of many of the First Families of Virginia  was romanticized by later artists  Jamestown 2007 marked Virginia s quadricentennial year  celebrating 400 years since the establishment of the Jamestown Colony  The celebrations highlighted contributions from Native Americans  Europeans  and Africans  each of which had a significant part in shaping Virginia s history  47  48  Warfare  including among these groups  has also had an important role  Virginia was a focal point in conflicts from the French and Indian War  the American Revolution and the Civil War  to the Cold War and the War on Terrorism  49  Stories about historic figures  such as those surrounding Pocahontas and John Smith  George Washington s childhood  or the plantation elite in the slave society of the antebellum period  have also created potent myths of state history  and have served as rationales for Virginia s ideology  50   edit  Colony Main article  Colony of Virginia The first people are estimated to have arrived in Virginia over 12 000 years ago  51  By 5 000 years ago more permanent settlements emerged  and farming began by 900 AD  By 1500  the Algonquian peoples had founded towns such as Werowocomoco in the Tidewater region  which they referred to as Tsenacommacah  The other major language groups in the area were the Siouan to the west  and the Iroquoians  who included the Nottoway and Meherrin  to the north and south  After 1570  the Algonquians consolidated under Chief Powhatan in response to threats from these other groups on their trade network  52  Powhatan controlled more than 30 smaller tribes and over 150 settlements  who shared a common Virginia Algonquian language  In 1607  the native Tidewater population was between 13 000 to 14 000  53  Several European expeditions  including a group of Spanish Jesuits  explored the Chesapeake Bay during the 16th century  In 1583  Queen Elizabeth I of England granted Walter Raleigh a charter to plant a colony north of Spanish Florida  54  In 1584  Raleigh sent an expedition to the Atlantic coast of North America  55  The name  Virginia  may have been suggested then by Raleigh or Elizabeth  perhaps noting her status as the  Virgin Queen   and may also be related to a native phrase   Wingandacoa   or name   Wingina   56  Initially the name applied to the entire coastal region from South Carolina to Maine  plus the island of Bermuda  57  The London Company was incorporated as a joint stock company by the proprietary Charter of 1606  which granted land rights to this area  The Company financed the first permanent English settlement in the  New World   Jamestown  Named for King James I  it was founded in May 1607 by Christopher Newport  58  In 1619  colonists took greater control with an elected legislature called the House of Burgesses  With the bankruptcy of the London Company in 1624  the settlement was taken into royal authority as a British crown colony  59  Williamsburg was the capital from 1699 to 1780  Life in the colony was perilous  and many died during the  starving time  in 1609 and the Anglo Powhatan Wars  including the Indian massacre of 1622  which fostered the colonists  negative view of all tribes  60  61  By 1624  only 3 400 of the 6 000 early settlers had survived  62  However  European demand for tobacco fueled the arrival of more settlers and servants  63  The headright system tried to solve the labor shortage by providing colonists with land for each indentured servant they transported to Virginia  64  African workers were first imported in 1619  and their slavery was codified after a 1654 lawsuit over the servant John Casor  65  Tensions and the geographic differences between the working and ruling classes led to Bacon s Rebellion in 1676  by which time current and former indentured servants made up as much as 80  of the population  66  Rebels  largely from the colony s frontier  were also opposed to the conciliatory policy towards native tribes  Colonists appropriated tribal land by force and treaty  including the Treaty of 1677  which made the signatory tribes tributary states  Williamsburg became the colonial capital in 1699  following the founding of The College of William  amp  Mary in 1693  67  In 1747  a group of Virginian speculators formed the Ohio Company  with the backing of the British crown  to start English settlement and trade in the Ohio Country west of the Appalachian Mountains  68 France  which claimed this area as part of their colony of New France  viewed this as a threat  and the ensuing French and Indian War became part of the Seven Years  War  1756 1763   A militia from several British colonies  called the Virginia Regiment  was led by then Lieutenant colonel George Washington  69   edit  Statehood 1851 painting of Patrick Henry s speech before the House of Burgesses on the Virginia Resolves against the Stamp Act of 1765 The British Parliament s efforts to levy new taxes following the French and Indian War were deeply unpopular in the colonies  In the House of Burgesses  opposition to taxation without representation was led by Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee  among others  70  Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773  and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year  71  After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774  Virginia s revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions  On May 15  1776  the Convention declared Virginia s independence from the British Empire and adopted George Mason s Virginia Declaration of Rights  which was then included in a new constitution  72  Another Virginian  Thomas Jefferson  drew upon Mason s work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence  73  When the American Revolutionary War began  George Washington was selected to head the colonial army  During the war  the capital was moved to Richmond at the urging of Governor Thomas Jefferson  who feared that Williamsburg s location would make it vulnerable to British attack  74  In 1781  the combined action of Continental and French land and naval forces trapped the British army on the Virginia Peninsula  where troops under George Washington and Comte de Rochambeau defeated British General Cornwallis in the Siege of Yorktown  His surrender on October 19  1781  led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies  75  Virginians were instrumental in writing the United States Constitution  James Madison drafted the Virginia Plan in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in 1789  73 Virginia ratified the Constitution on June 25  1788  The three fifths compromise ensured that Virginia  with its large number of slaves  initially had the largest bloc in the House of Representatives  Together with the Virginia dynasty of presidents  this gave the Commonwealth national importance  In 1790  both Virginia and Maryland ceded territory to form the new District of Columbia  though the Virginian area was retroceded in 1846  76  Virginia is sometimes called  Mother of States  because of its role in being carved into states like Kentucky  which became the 15th state in 1792  and for the numbers of American pioneers born in Virginia  77   edit  Civil War and aftermath Main article  Virginia in the American Civil War Richmond  the capital of the Confederate States of America  was burned prior to its capture by the Union  In addition to agriculture  slave labor was increasingly used in mining  shipbuilding and other industries  78 Nat Turner s slave rebellion in 1831 and John Brown s Raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 showed deep social discontent about slavery and its role in the plantation economy  By 1860  almost half a million people  roughly 31  of the total population of Virginia  were enslaved  79  This division contributed to the start of the American Civil War  Virginia voted to secede from the United States on April 17  1861  after the Battle of Fort Sumter and Abraham Lincoln s call for volunteers  On April 24  Virginia joined the Confederate States of America  which chose Richmond as its capital  77  After the 1863 Wheeling Convention  48 counties in the northwest separated to form a new state of West Virginia  which chose to remain loyal to the Union  Virginian general Robert E  Lee took command of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1862  and led invasions into Union territory  ultimately becoming commander of all Confederate forces  During the war  more battles were fought in Virginia than anywhere else  including Bull Run  the Seven Days Battles  Chancellorsville  and the concluding Battle of Appomattox Court House  80  After the capture of Richmond in 1865  the capital was briefly moved to Danville  81  Virginia was formally restored to the United States in 1870  due to the work of the Committee of Nine  82  The Third Battle of Petersburg  April 1865 During the post war Reconstruction era  Virginia adopted a constitution which provided for free public schools  and guaranteed political  civil  and voting rights  83  The populist Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883  84  It passed segregationist Jim Crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia to include a poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites until federal legislation was passed in the 1960s  85  Though their schools were segregated and underfunded  as were services  due to a lack of political representation  African Americans were able to create their own communities  86   edit  Contemporary era The Virginia Civil Rights Memorial was erected in 2008 to commemorate the protests which led to school desegregation  Protests started by Barbara Rose Johns in 1951 in Farmville against segregated schools led to the lawsuit Davis v  County School Board of Prince Edward County  This case  filed by Richmond natives Spottswood Robinson and Oliver Hill  was decided in 1954 with Brown v  Board of Education  which rejected the segregationist doctrine of  separate but equal   But  in 1958  under the policy of  massive resistance  led by the influential segregationist Senator Harry F  Byrd and his Byrd Organization  the Commonwealth prohibited desegregated local schools from receiving state funding  87  The Civil Rights Movement gained many participants in the 1960s  It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965  In 1964 the United States Supreme Court ordered Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools  88  In 1967  the Court also struck down the state s ban on interracial marriage  From 1969 to 1971  state legislators under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution  after goals such as the repeal of Jim Crow laws had been achieved  In 1989  Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected as governor in the United States  89  New economic forces also changed the Commonwealth  In 1926  Dr  W A R  Goodwin  rector of Williamsburg s Bruton Parish Church  began restoration of colonial era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of John D  Rockefeller  Jr   their work led to the development of Colonial Williamsburg  the state s most popular tourism site  90 World War II and the Cold War led to the expansion of national defense government programs housed in offices in Northern Virginia near Washington  D C   and correlative population growth  91  Among the federal developments was the Pentagon  built during World War II as the headquarters for the Department of Defense  It was one of the targets of the September 11 attacks  189 people died at the site when a jet passenger plane crashed into the building  92   edit  Cities and towns Main article  Political subdivisions of Virginia The population of the Hampton Roads area is over 1 6 million  Virginia is divided into 95 counties and 39 independent cities  which both operate the same way since independent cities are considered to be county equivalent  93  This method of treating cities and counties equally is unique to Virginia  with only three other independent cities in the United States outside Virginia  94  Virginia limits the authority of cities and counties to countermand laws expressly allowed by the Virginia General Assembly under what is known as Dillon s Rule  95  In addition to independent cities  there are also incorporated towns which operate under their own governments  but are part of a county  Finally there are hundreds of unincorporated communities within the counties  Virginia does not have any further political subdivisions  such as villages or townships  Virginia has 11 Metropolitan Statistical Areas  Northern Virginia  Hampton Roads  and Richmond Petersburg are the three most populous  Richmond is the capital of Virginia  and its metropolitan area has a population of over 1 2 million  96  As of 2010 update   Virginia Beach is the most populous city in the Commonwealth  with Norfolk and Chesapeake second and third  respectively  97  Norfolk forms the urban core of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area  which has a population over 1 6 million people and is the site of the world s largest naval base  Naval Station Norfolk  96  98 Suffolk  which includes a portion of the Great Dismal Swamp  is the largest city by area at 429 1 square miles  1 111 km2   99  Fairfax County is the most populous locality in Virginia  with over one million residents  although that does not include its county seat Fairfax  which is one of the independent cities  100  Fairfax County has a major urban business and shopping center in Tysons Corner  Virginia s largest office market  101  Neighboring Loudoun County  with the county seat at Leesburg  is both the fastest growing county in Virginia and has the highest median household income   114 204  in the country as of 2010 update   102 Arlington County  the smallest self governing county in the United States by land area  is an urban community organized as a county  103  The Roanoke area  with an

096 604 on July 1  2011  a 1 19  increase since the 2010 United States Census  2  which showed Virginia had a population of 8 001 024  105  This includes an increase from net migration of 314 832 people into the Commonwealth since the 2000 census  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 159 627 people  and migration within the country produced a net increase of 155 205 people  106  The center of population is located in Goochland County outside of Richmond  107  English was passed as the Commonwealth s official language by statutes in 1981 and again in 1996  though the status is not mandated by the Constitution of Virginia  108  English is the only language spoken by 6 245 517  86 7   Virginians  though it is spoken  very well  by an additional 570 638  7

others of British and Irish heritage have since immigrated  111  Those who self identify as having  American  ancestry are predominantly of English descent  but have ancestry that has been in North America for so long that they choose to identify simply as American  112  113  Of the English immigrants to Virginia in the 1600s  75  came as indentured servants  114  The western mountains have many settlements that were founded by Scots Irish immigrants before the American Revolution  115  116  There are also sizable numbers of people of German descent in the northwestern mountains and Shenandoah Valley  117  Most African American Virginians have been descendants of enslaved Africans who worked on tobacco  cotton  and hemp plantations  These men  women and children were brought from west central Africa  primarily from Angola and the Bight of Biafra  The Igbo ethnic group of what is now southern Nigeria were the single largest African group among slaves in Virginia  118  119  Though the black population was reduced by the Great Migration  since 1965 there has been a reverse migration of blacks returning south  120  More recent immigration in the late 20th century and early 21st century has fueled new communities of Hispanics  particularly Central Americans  and Asians  As of 2010 update   7 9  of Virginians are Hispanic  5 5  are Asian  and 0 9  are American Indian
