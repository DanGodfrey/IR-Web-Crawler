1 ISBN 0 7851 1828 4 The Fantastic Four is a fictional superhero team appearing in comic books published by Marvel Comics  The group debuted in The Fantastic Four  1  cover dated Nov  1961   which helped to usher in a new level of realism in the medium  The Fantastic Four was the first superhero team created by writer editor Stan Lee and artist and co plotter Jack Kirby  who developed a collaborative approach to creating comics with this title that they would use from then on  As the first superhero team title produced by Marvel Comics  it formed a cornerstone of the company s 1960s rise from a small division of a publishing company to a pop culture conglomerate  The title would go on to showcase the talents of comics creators such as Roy Thomas  John Byrne  Steve Englehart  Walt Simonson  John Buscema  George P rez and Tom DeFalco  and is one of several Marvel titles originating in the Silver Age of Comic Books that is still in publication today  The four individuals traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four  who gained superpowers after exposure to cosmic rays during a scientific mission to outer space  are  Mister Fantastic  Reed Richards   a scientific genius and the leader of the group  who can stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes  the Invisible Woman  Susan  Sue  Storm   who eventually married Reed  who can render herself invisible and later project powerful force fields  the Human Torch  Johnny Storm   Sue s younger brother  who can generate flames  surround himself with them and fly  and the monstrous Thing  Ben Grimm   their grumpy but benevolent friend  a former college football star and Reed s college roommate as well as a good pilot  who possesses superhuman strength and endurance due to the nature of his stone like flesh  Ever since the original 1961 introduction  the Fantastic Four have been portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional  yet loving  family  Breaking convention with other comic book archetypes of the time  they would squabble and hold grudges both deep and petty  and eschewed anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status  The team is also well known for its recurring encounters with characters such as the villainous monarch Doctor Doom  the planet devouring Galactus  the sea dwelling prince Namor  the spacefaring Silver Surfer  and the shape changing alien Skrulls  The Fantastic Four have been adapted into other media  including four animated television series  an aborted 1990s low budget film  and the studio motion pictures Fantastic Four  2005  and Fantastic Four  Rise of the Silver Surfer  2007   Contents 1 Publication history 1 1 Origins 1 2 1961 1970s 1 3 1980s and early 1990s 1 4 2000s 1 5 2010s 2 Spinoffs 2 1 The Human Torch solo 2 2 The Thing solo 3 Characters 4

history  edit  Origins Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961  longtime magazine and comic book publisher Martin Goodman was playing golf with either Jack Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of rival company DC Comics  then known as National Periodical Publications  and that the top executive bragged about DC s success with the new superhero team the Justice League of America  note 1  While film producer and comics historian Michael Uslan has debunked the particulars of that story  note 2  Goodman  a publishing trend follower  aware of the JLA s strong sales  did direct his comics editor  Stan Lee  to create a comic book series about a team of superheroes  According to Lee  writing in 1974   Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most  It was a book called The  sic  Justice League of America and it was composed of a team of superheroes       If the Justice League is selling   spoke he   why don t we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes    1  16 Lee  who had served as editor in chief and art director of Marvel Comics and its predecessor companies  Timely Comics and Atlas Comics  for two decades  found that the medium had become creatively restrictive  Determined  to carve a real career for myself in the nowhere world of comic books  note 3  Lee concluded that   For just this once  I would do the type of story I myself would enjoy reading     And the characters would be the kind of characters I could personally relate to  they d be flesh and blood  they d have their faults and foibles  they d be fallible and feisty  and   most important of all   inside their colorful  costumed booties they d still have feet of clay   1  17 Lee said he created a synopsis for the first Fantastic Four story that he gave to penciller Jack Kirby  who then drew the entire story  Kirby turned in his penciled art pages to Lee  who added dialogue and captions  This approach to creating comics  which became known as the  Marvel Method   worked so well for Lee and Kirby that they used it from then on  the Marvel Method became standard for the company within a year  2  87 Kirby recalled events somewhat differently  Challenged with Lee s version of events in a 1990 interview  Kirby responded   I would say that s an outright lie   3  39 although the interviewer  Gary Groth notes that this statement needs to be viewed with caution  note 4  Kirby claims he came up with the idea for the Fantastic Four in Marvel s offices  and that Lee had merely added the dialogue after the story had been pencilled  3  38 Kirby has also sought to establish  more credibly and on numerous occasions  that the visual elements of the strip were his conceptions  He regularly pointed to a team he had created for rival publisher DC Comics in the 1950s  Challengers of the Unknown    I f you notice the uniforms  they re the same    I always give them a skintight uniform with a belt    the Challengers and the FF have a minimum of decoration  And of course  the Thing s skin is a kind of decoration  breaking up the monotony of the blue uniform   4  4 The characters wear no uniforms in the first two issues  Given the conflicting statements  outside commentators have found it hard to identify with precise detail who created the Fantastic Four  Although Stan Lee s typed synopsis for the Fantastic Four exists  Earl Wells  writing in The Comics Journal  points out that its existence doesn t assert its place in the creation    W e have no way of knowing of whether Lee wrote the synopsis after a discussion with Kirby in which Kirby supplied most of the ideas   5  78 Comics historian R C  Harvey believes that the Fantastic Four was a furtherance of the work Kirby had been doing previously  and so  more likely Kirby s creations than Lee s   6  69 But Harvey notes that the Marvel Method of collaboration allowed each man to claim credit  6  68 and that Lee s dialogue added to the direction the team took  6  69 Wells argues that it was Lee s contributions which set the framework within which Kirby worked  and this made Lee  more responsible   5  85 Comics historian Mark Evanier  a studio assistant to Jack Kirby in the 1970s  says that the considered opinion of Lee and Kirby s contemporaries was  that Fantastic Four was created by Stan and Jack  No further division of credit seemed appropriate   7  122  edit  1961 1970s The release of The Fantastic Four  1  Nov  1961  was an unexpected success  Lee had felt ready to leave the comics field at the time  but the positive response to Fantastic Four persuaded him to stay on  8  The title began to receive fan mail  and Lee started printing the letters in a letter column with Issue  3  Also with the third issue  Lee created the hyperbolic slogan  The Greatest Comic Magazine in the World    With the following issue  the slogan was changed to  The World s Greatest Comic Magazine    and became a fixture on the issue covers into the 1990s  2  87 and on numerous covers in the 2000s  Fantastic Four  48  Sept  1966   The Watcher warns  in part one of the landmark  Galactus Trilogy   Cover art by Kirby and Joe Sinnott  Issue  4  May 1962  reintroduced Namor the Sub Mariner  an aquatic antihero who was a star character of Marvel s earliest iteration  Timely Comics  during the late 1930s and 1940s period that historians and fans call the Golden Age of Comics  Issue  5  July 1962  introduced the team s most frequent nemesis  Doctor Doom  These earliest issues were published bimonthly  With issue  16  July 1963   the cover title dropped its The and became simply Fantastic Four  While the early stories were complete narratives  the frequent appearances of these two antagonists  Doom and Namor  in subsequent issues indicated the creation of a long narrative by Lee and Kirby that extended over months  Ultimately  according to comics historian Les Daniels   only narratives that ran to several issues would be able to contain their increasingly complex ideas   2  88 During its creators  lengthy run  the series produced many acclaimed storylines and characters that have become central to Marvel  including the hidden race of alien human genetic experiments  the Inhumans  9  the Black Panther  10  an African king who would be mainstream comics  first black superhero  the rival alien races the Kree and the shapeshifting Skrulls  Him  who would become Adam Warlock  the Negative Zone  and unstable molecules  The story frequently cited as Lee and Kirby s finest achievement 11  12  is the three part  Galactus Trilogy  that began in Fantastic Four  48  March 1966   chronicling the arrival of Galactus  a cosmic giant who wanted to devour the planet  and his herald  the Silver Surfer  13  Daniels noted that   t he mystical and metaphysical elements that took over the saga were perfectly suited to the tastes of young readers in the 1960s   and Lee soon discovered that the story was a favorite on college campuses  2  128 Kirby left Marvel in mid 1970  having drawn the first 102 issues plus an unfinished issue later completed and published as Fantastic Four  The Lost Adventure  April 2008   Fantastic Four continued with Lee  Roy Thomas  Gerry Conway and Marv Wolfman as its consecutive regular writers  working with artists such as John Romita  Sr   John Buscema  Rich Buckler and George P rez  with longtime inker Joe Sinnott adding some visual continuity  Jim Steranko also contributed several covers during this time   edit  1980s and early 1990s John Byrne joined the title with issue  209  Aug  1979   doing pencil breakdowns for Sinnott to finish  Byrne then wrote two tales as well   220 221  July Aug  1980  before writer Doug Moench and penciller Bill Sienkiewicz took over for 10 issues  With issue  232  July 1981   the aptly titled  Back to the Basics   Byrne began his run as writer  penciller and inker  that last under the pseudonym Bjorn Heyn for this issue only  14  Byrne revitalized the slumping title with his run  15  265 Originally  Byrne was slated to write with Sienkiewicz providing the art  Sienkiewicz left to do Moon Knight  and Byrne ended up as writer  artist  and inker  Various editors were assigned to the comic  eventually Bob Budiansky became the regular editor  Byrne told Jim Shooter that he could not work with Budiansky  although they ultimately continued to work together  In 2006  Byrne said  that s my paranoia  I look back and I think that was Shooter trying to force me off the book   Byrne eventually vague  left in the middle of a story arc  explaining he could not recapture the fun he had previously had on the series  16  One of Byrne s changes was making the Invisible Girl into the Invisible Woman  assertive and confident  During this period  fans came to recognize that she was quite powerful  whereas previously  she had been primarily seen as a superpowered mother and wife in the tradition of television moms like those played by Donna Reed and Florence Henderson  17  Byrne also staked new directions in the characters  personal lives  having the married Sue Storm and Reed Richards suffer a miscarriage  and the Thing quitting the Fantastic Four  with She Hulk being recruited as his long term replacement  John Byrne gets  Back to the Basics  in  232  July 1981   his debut as writer artist  Cover art by Byrne and inker Terry Austin  Byrne was followed by a quick succession of writers  Roger Stern  Tom DeFalco  and Roy Thomas  Steve Englehart took over as writer for issues 304 332  except  320   The title had been struggling  so Englehart decided to make radical changes  He felt the title had become stale with the normal makeup of Reed  Sue  Ben  and Johnny  so in issue  308 Reed and Sue retired and were replaced with the Thing s new girlfriend  Sharon Ventura  and Johnny Storm s former love  Crystal  The changes increased readership through issue  321  At this point  Marvel made decisions about another Englehart comic  West Coast Avengers  that he disagreed with  and in protest he changed his byline to S F X  Englehart  S F X  is the abbreviation for Simple Sound Effects   In issue  326  Englehart was told to bring Reed and Sue back and undo the other changes he had made  This caused Englehart to take his name entirely off the book  He used the pseudonym John Harkness  which he had created years before for work he didn t want to be associated with  According to Englehart  the run from  326 through his last issue   332  was  one of the most painful stretches of  his  career   18  Writer artist Walt Simonson took over as writer with  334  December 1989   and three issues later began pencilling and inking as well  With brief inking exceptions  two fill in issues  and a three issue stint drawn by Arthur Adams  Simonson remained in all three positions through  354  July 1991   Simonson  who had been writing the team comic The Avengers  had gotten approval for Reed and Sue to join that team after Engelhart had written them out of Fantastic Four  Yet by The Avengers  300  where they were scheduled to join the team  Simonson was told the characters were returning to Fantastic Four  This led to Simonson quitting The Avengers after that issue  Shortly afterward  he was offered the job of writing Fantastic Four  Having already prepared a number of stories involving the Avengers with Reed and Sue in the lineup  he then rewrote these for Fantastic Four  Simonson later recalled that working on Fantastic Four allowed him the latitude to use original Avengers members Thor and Iron Man  which he had been precluded from using in The Avengers  19  After another fill in  the regular team of writer and Marvel editor in chief Tom DeFalco  penciller Paul Ryan and inker Dan Bulanadi took over  with Ryan self inking beginning with  360  Jan  1992   That team  with the very occasional different inker  continued for years through  414  July 1996   DeFalco nullified the Storm Masters marriage by retconning that the alien Skrull Empire had kidnapped the real Masters and replaced her with a spy named Lyja  Once discovered  Lyja  who herself had fallen for Storm  helped the Fantastic Four rescue Masters  Ventura departed after being further mutated by Doctor Doom  Ryan s lengthy run is behind only those of Jack Kirby and John Byrne in number of issues drawn  citation needed  Although some fans were not pleased with DeFalco s run on Fantastic Four  calling him  The Great Satan   the title s sales increased over the period  20  Other key developments included Franklin Richards being sent into the future and returning as a teenager  the return of Reed s time traveling father  Nathaniel  who is revealed to be the father of time travelling villain Kang  and Reed s apparent death at the hands of a seemingly mortally wounded Doctor Doom  It would be two years before DeFalco resurrected the two characters  revealing that their  deaths  were orchestrated by the supervillain Hyperstorm  The ongoing series was canceled with issue  416  Sept  1996  and relaunched with vol  2   1  Nov  1996  as part of the multi series  Heroes Reborn  crossover story arc  The year long volume retold the team s first adventures in a more contemporary style  and set in a parallel universe  Following the end of that experiment  Fantastic Four was relaunched with vol  3

bickering  the Fantastic Four consistently prove themselves to be  a cohesive and formidable team in times of crisis   15  204 205 While there have been a number of lineup changes to the group  the

Torch character published by Marvel s predecessor Timely Comics in the 1940s  an android that could ignite itself  Lee said that when he conceptualized the character   I thought it was a shame that we didn t have The Human Torch anymore  and this was a good chance to bring him back   2  85 Unlike the teen sidekicks that preceded him  the Human Torch in the early stories was  a typical adolescent   brash  rebellious  and affectionately obnoxious   15  204 Johnny Storm was killed in the 2011 storyline  Three   28  The Thing  Ben Grimm   Reed Richards  college roommate and best friend  has been

uncle figure  a long term friend of the family with a gruff Brooklyn manner  short temper  and caustic sense of humor   15  204 In the original synopsis Lee gave to Kirby  The Thing was intended as  the heavy   but over the years  the character has become  the most lovable group member  honest  direct and free of pretension   2  86 The Fantastic Four has had several different headquarters  most notably the Baxter Building  located at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue citation needed  in New York City  The Baxter Building was replaced by Four Freedoms Plaza at the same location after the Baxter

Cultural impact The Fantastic Four s characterization was initially different from all other superheroes at the time  One major difference is that they do not conceal their identities  leading the public to be both suspicious and in awe of them  Also  they frequently argued and disagreed with each other  hindering their work as a team  15  Described as  heroes with hangups  by Stan Lee  38  the Thing has a temper  and the Human Torch resents being a child among adults  Mr  Fantastic blames himself for the Thing s transformation  Social scientist Bradford W  Wright describes the team as a  volatile mix of human emotions and personalities   In spite of their disagreements  they ultimately function well as a team  39  The first issue of The Fantastic Four proved a success  igniting a new direction for superhero comics and soon influencing many other superhero comics  40  Readers grew fond of Ben s grumpiness  Johnny s tendency to annoy others  and Reed and Sue s spats  Stan Lee was surprised at the reaction to the first issue  leading him to stay in the comics field despite previous plans to leave  Comics historian Stephen Krensky said that  Lee s natural dialogue and flawed characters appealed to 1960s kids looking to  get real    8  As of 2005  150 million comics featuring the Fantastic Four have been sold  38  A Fantastic Four film was released in 2005  and a sequel in

further Power Records albums  In 1979  the Thing was featured as half of the Saturday morning cartoon Fred and Barney Meet the Thing  The character of the Thing was given a radical make over for the series  The title character for this program was Benji Grimm  a teenage boy who possessed a pair of magic rings which could transform him into the Thing  The other members of the Fantastic Four do not

America This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  The Fantastic Four has been published in translation around the world  beginning in the late 1960s in Mexico  Los Cuatro Fant sticos  published by La Prensa until the mid 1970s  then by Macc Division until 1980  and finally by Novedades Editores during the early 1980s  and French speaking Canada  Les Fantastic Four  from 1969 1986  after which the title was merged with the Spider Man title for 3 more years   Mexican translators were not consistent in their translations of the characters  code names  The Thing was called Coloso  Colossus  in the first series  La Mole in the second and the third  which was the name used for The Hulk in the first series   The other three main characters had more stable translated names  Mister Fant stico  sometimes translated as Se or Fant stico   La Chica  or La Mujer  Invisible  and La Antorcha Humana  Dr  Doom was Doctor Destino and She Hulk was La Mujer Hulk in her run in the Fantastic Four  In the movie  and in current appearances in Mexico  Mister Fantastic is referred to as  El Hombre El stico   Elastic Man   Canada rarely translated character names from their English version  although sometimes switching back and forth between English and French names in the same issue  The Thing   La Chose  Mister Fantastic   Monsieur Fantastic  Invisible Girl   Fille  or Femme  Invisible  Human Torch   Torche Humaine   The names of Dr  Doom and She Hulk were not translated into French for the Canadian reprints   edit  United Kingdom British publication of the series began in the black and white anthology title Mystic in the 1960s  In 1972  the Fantastic Four s adventures were publsihed starting with issue 1 of the US comic in Mighty World of Marvel alongside Spider Man and Hulk reprints when Marvel Comics began its imprint Marvel UK  In 1976 the feature was moved to Marvel UK s The Titans to revive flagging sales  starting with issue  27  But after just a few months the feature was removed from The Titans  replaced by The Avengers  to form part of the line up of the new Captain Britain Weekly for its first issue in October 1976  After the demise of Captain Britain Weekly the FF went with Captain Britain into the merged Super Spiderman and Captain Britain Weekly in July 1977  A few months after the merger a new title The Complete Fantastic Four was launched in September 1977 starting with the story from the US Fantastic Four 133  45  Unusually The Complete Fantastic Four reprinted an entire issue of the US publication at a time when stories were always broken up intio several instalments  As a back up strip it started serializing the FF s adventures from US Fantastic Four 1  but this was replaced by The Invaders towards the end of the run  In 1978 that series merged into Mighty World Of Marvel returning the FF to their original home alongside Hulk  Their last adventure in that title was issue 329  when they were moved out so that the comic could be relaunched as Marvel Comic in early 1979  Their adventures briefly moved back into Spiderman Comic before stopping shortly after John Byrne took over pencilling chores on the strip  In March 1980 Marvel UK launched the Fantastic Four Pocketbook reprinting Lee and Kirby stories  After cancellation of the Pocketbook in July 1982 the classic Fantastic Four strips continued in a short lived weekly title that began in October 1982  During 1985 the Fantastic Four  along with other Marvel titles such as New Mutants  Avengers and X men  were included in the Secret Wars II reprint title  This mostly focused on issues which crossed over into the Secret Wars II maxi series  From 2005  around the release of the Fantastic Four film  the super team appeared in Fantastic Four Adventures  published by Panini Comics  The title ended in March 2012   edit  France This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Publication history in France started with the reprinting of the first 10 pages of Fantastic Four  50 in 1967 in an anthology title called  Les Chefs d Oeuvres de la Bande Dessin e   Comic Book Masterpieces   In 1974  the first 4 issues of the title were published  one page at a time  in the daily newspaper  France Soir   But primarily  rights to the Fantastic Four in France were held by a company called Editions Lug  which began publishing Fantastic Four first in an 1969 anthology title called Fantask  along with Spider Man and Silver Surfer  then in another anthology called  Marvel   The censors objected to the content of the book  and citing  nightmarish visions  and  terrifying science fiction  as the reasons  forced their cancellations after respectively 7 and 13 issues  Although other anthologies featuring Marvel strips continued  notably  Strange   featuring X Men  Iron Man  amp  Silver Surfer   the Fantastic Four remained unpublished in France until 1973  Editions Lug created a format aimed more for adults  an 80 page series called Les Fantastiques debuted where the old series left off  with the stories that introduced the Inhumans and Galactus  That series lasted over 15 years  coming out 4 times a year  In the mid 1970s  a title called Spidey was released by Editions Lug  Primarily featuring reprints from the juvenile  Spider Super Stories   it also featured a similarly themed FF series produced in France  These original stories had art that closely resembled the work of Jack Kirby or John Buscema  but the storylines themselves included watered down super villains  the FF on vacation  and even Santa Claus  This series was replaced by 1960s era X Men reprints when Marvel demanded the same royalties for Editions Lug s original stories that they did for the US reprints  Eventually  a regular monthly series began publication in France  and the Fantastic Four took over the headlining position in the pocket format anthology  Nova   sharing the title with Spider Woman  Peter Parker  She Hulk  and Silver Surfer and lasted until Marvel began publishing its own titles under the newly formed  Marvel France  line in the late 1990s  Fantastic Four shared space in the Silver Surfer s own book until the Heroes Reborn storyline created their own title  supported by Captain America   Fantastic Four  then appeared in the anthology  Marvel Legends  and currently appears in  Marvel Icons   sharing that title with The Avengers  Two different French companies held rights to Marvel Comics at the same time in the late 1970s and early 1980s  Lug  which eventually changed its name to Semic  published Fantastic Four  Spider Man  X Men  Daredevil  and Iron Man  and most related series  while Aredit held the rights to Avengers  Hulk  Thor  Captain America  Sub Mariner and many of the 1970s era modern series like Ghost Rider  Man Thing  Power Man  and the first She Hulk series  Often  crossovers would force one company to publish another s title  i e  the Marvel Two In One and Fantastic Four annuals that crossed over into the Invaders story would have to be published by the  other  company  and in fact that particular cross over was published twice  once by each company  This resulted in different translations of the characters names   Susan Storm Richards was called Jane in her own title by Editions Lug  presumably because the name  Sue  is a form of the verb  to sweat  in French   and Reed was called Red  a combination of letters easier to pronounce than the double E sound  When Aredit published a Fantastic Four appearance they kept the traditional US names  Generally speaking  their names in France were  Monsieur Fantastic  although Mister was often used as well   L Invisible  La Chose  and La Torche   Rarely was  Humaine  used in the French editions   Dr  Doom was called Docteur Fatalis  and She Hulk was called Miss Hulk   edit  Germany This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability   Die Fantastischen Vier  First appeared in Hit Comics  a weekly title that rotated the main feature with other Marvel titles  Williams Comics eventually obtained the rights to Marvel s line and began publishing  for the first time in color  in

300 pages each  They also published a paperback series in a similar format to the Marvel Graphic Novels  Marvel Deutschland currently publishes  Die Fantastischen Vier   The German names of the characters are Das Ding  The Thing   Die Fackel or Die menschliche Fackel  The Human Torch   Die Unsichtbare  The Unseen One   and Mr  Fantastisch  Mr  Fantastic   Silver Surfer and She Hulk retained

in their own title  shared first with Captain Marvel  then rotating with other back up features  by Corno  then Star Comics in the 1990s  and are currently published by Marvel Italia  Character s

Human Torch solo series from Strange Tales   edit  See also Maximum Fantastic Four  edit  Notes   That DC all star superhero team had debuted in The Brave and the Bold  28  cover dated Feb  1960  before going on to its own hit title  issue  1 cover dated Nov  1960     Uslan  in a letter published in Alter Ego  43  December 2004   pp  43 44  writes   Irwin Donenfeld said he never played golf with Goodman  so the story is untrue  I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC s 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as Sol Harrison and  production chief  Jack Adler were schmoozing with some of us    who worked for DC during our college summers      T he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News  not DC Comics  though DC owned Independent News       As the distributor of DC Comics  this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman      Of course  Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces      Sol worked closely with Independent News  top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse s mouth     Lee  Stan  September 1974   Origins of Marvel Comics  Simon and Schuster Fireside Books  ISBN 978 0671218638    My wife  Joan was commenting about the fact that after 20 years of producing comics I was still writing television material  advertising copy and newspaper features in my spare time  She wondered why I didn t put as much effort and creativity into the comics as I seemed to be putting into my other freelance endeavors      H er little dissertation made me suddenly realize that it was time to start concentrating on what I was doing   to carve a real career for myself in the nowhere world of comic books      Groth explains in his 2002 introduction to the interview that Kirby s state of mind needs to be taken into consideration when evaluating certain statements within the interview  Kirby was involved in an acrimonious dispute with Marvel Comics regarding the return of his artwork  and his relationship with Lee had deteriorated  in part due to this dispute but also due to Lee s public statements through the years  which Kirby saw as diminishing his role  Groth states   Lee s contribution is a matter for endless speculation  but most observers and historians consider Kirby s claims here to be excessive    edit  References   a b Lee  Stan  September 1974   Origins of Marvel Comics  Simon and Schuster
