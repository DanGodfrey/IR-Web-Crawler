Babylonian and Hittite art  The earliest evidence for fist fighting with any kind of gloves can be found on Minoan Crete  c  1500 900 BC   and on Sardinia  if we consider the boxing statues of Prama mountains  c  2000 1000 BC   2   edit  Modern boxing  edit  Broughton s rules  1743  A straight right demonstrated in Edmund Price s The Science of Self Defense  A Treatise on Sparring and Wrestling  1867 Records of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Western Roman Empire when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned  However  there are detailed records of various fist fighting sports that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries  There was also a sport in ancient Rus called Fistfight  As the wearing of swords became less common  there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists  The sport would later resurface in England during the early 16th century in the form of bare knuckle boxing sometimes referred to as prizefighting  The first documented account of a bare knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the London Protestant Mercury  and the first English bare knuckle champion was James Figg in 1719  3  This is also the time when the word  boxing  first came to be used  It should be noted  that this earliest form of modern boxing was very different  Contests in Mr  Figg s time  in addition to fistfighting  also contained fencing and cudgeling  On 6 January 1681  the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when Christopher Monck  2nd Duke of Albemarle  and later Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica  engineered a bout between his butler and his butcher with the latter winning the prize  Early fighting had written rules  There were no weight divisions or round limits  and no referee  In general  it was extremely chaotic  The first boxing rules  called the Broughton s rules  were introduced by champion Jack Broughton in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred  4  Under these rules  if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds  the fight was over  Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited  Broughton also invented and encouraged the use of  mufflers   a form of padded gloves  which were used in training and exhibitions  The first paper on boxing was published in the late 18th century by successful Birmingham boxer  William Futrell  who remained undefeated until his one hour and seventeen minute fight at Smitham Bottom  Croydon  on July 9  1788 against a much younger  Gentleman  John Jackson which was attended by the Prince of Wales  Tom Cribb vs Tom Molineaux in a re match for the heavyweight championship of England  1811 These rules did allow the fighters an advantage not enjoyed by today s boxers  They permitted the fighter to drop to one knee to begin a 30 second count at any time  Thus a fighter realizing he was in trouble had an opportunity to recover  However  this was considered  unmanly  5  and was frequently disallowed by additional rules negotiated by the Seconds of the Boxers  6  Intentionally going down in modern boxing will cause the recovering fighter to lose points in the scoring system  Furthermore  as the contestants did not have heavy leather gloves and wristwraps to protect their hands  a certain amount of restraint was required when striking the head   edit  London Prize Ring rules  1838  Main article  London Prize Ring rules In 1838  the London Prize Ring rules were codified  Later revised in 1853  they stipulated the following  7  Fights occurred in a 24 feet  7 3 m  square ring surrounded by ropes  If a fighter was knocked down  he had to rise within 30 seconds under his own power to be allowed to continue  Biting  headbutting and hitting below the belt were declared fouls   edit  Marquess of Queensberry rules  1867  In 1867  the Marquess of Queensberry rules were drafted by John Chambers for amateur championships held at Lillie Bridge in London for Lightweights  Middleweights and Heavyweights  The rules were published under the patronage of the Marquess of Queensberry  whose name has always been associated with them  The June 1894 Leonard Cushing bout  Each of the six one minute rounds recorded by the Kinetograph was made available to exhibitors for  22 50  8  Customers who watched the final round saw Leonard score a knockdown  There were twelve rules in all  and they specified that fights should be  a fair stand up boxing match  in a 24 foot square or similar ring  Rounds were three minutes long with one minute rest intervals between rounds  Each fighter was given a ten second count if he was knocked down and wrestling was banned  The introduction of gloves of  fair size  also changed the nature of the bouts  An average pair of boxing gloves resembles a bloated pair of mittens and are laced up around the wrists  9  The gloves can be used to block an opponent s blows  As a result of their introduction  bouts became longer and more strategic with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping  bobbing  countering and angling  Because less defensive emphasis was placed on the use of the forearms and more on the gloves  the classical forearms outwards  torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to a more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face   edit  Prohibition Through the late nineteenth century  boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of dubious legitimacy  Outlawed in England and much of the United States  prizefights were often held at gambling venues and broken up by police  citation needed  Brawling and wrestling tactics continued  and riots at prizefights were common occurrences  Still  throughout this period  there arose some notable bare knuckle champions who developed fairly sophisticated fighting tactics  The English case of R v  Coney in 1882 found that a bare knuckle fight was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm  despite the consent of the participants  This marked the end of widespread public bare knuckle contests in England  The first world heavyweight champion under the Queensberry Rules was  Gentleman Jim  Corbett  who defeated John L  Sullivan in 1892 at the Pelican Athletic Club in New Orleans  10  Throughout the early twentieth century  boxers struggled to achieve legitimacy  aided by the influence of promoters like Tex Rickard and the popularity of great champions from John L  Sullivan to Jack Dempsey  Shortly after this era  boxing commissions and other sanctioning bodies were established to regulate the sport and establish universally recognized champions  Further information  Professional boxing  edit  Rules Main article  Marquess of Queensberry rules The Marquess of Queensberry rules have been the general rules governing modern boxing since their publication in 1867  A boxing match typically consists of a determined number of three minute rounds  a total of up to 12 rounds  formerly 15   A minute is typically spent between each round with the fighters in their assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff  The fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters  rule on their ability to fight safely  count knocked down fighters  and rule on fouls  Up to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers  based on punches that connect  defense  knockdowns  and other  more subjective  measures  Because of the open ended style of boxing judging  many fights have controversial results  in which one or both fighters believe they have been  robbed  or unfairly denied a victory  Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring  where his or her coach  as well as one or more  seconds  may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds  Each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signaled end of each round  A bout in which the predetermined number of rounds passes is decided by the judges  and is said to  go the distance   The fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner  With three judges  unanimous and split decisions are possible  as are draws  A boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knockout  such bouts are said to have ended  inside the distance   If a fighter is knocked down during the fight  determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent s punch and not a slip  as determined by the referee  the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to his or her feet and can continue  Should the referee count to ten  then the knocked down boxer is ruled  knocked out   whether unconscious or not  and the other boxer is ruled the winner by knockout  KO   A  technical knockout   TKO  is possible as well  and is ruled by the referee  fight doctor  or a fighter s corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight  based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves  Many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a  three knockdown rule   in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO  A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter s record  A  standing eight  count rule may also be in effect  This gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that he feels may be in danger  even if no knockdown has taken place  After counting the referee will observe the fighter  and decide if he is fit to continue  For scoring purposes  a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown  In general  boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt  holding  tripping  pushing  biting  or spitting  The boxer s shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to hit to the groin area with intent to cause pain or injury  Failure to abide by the former may result in a foul or wallet slap  They also are prohibited from kicking  head butting  or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist  including hitting with the elbow  shoulder or forearm  as well as with open gloves  the wrist  the inside  back or side of the hand   They are prohibited as well from hitting the back  back of the neck or head  called a  rabbit punch   or the kidneys  They are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching  holding an opponent while punching  or ducking below the belt of their opponent  dropping below the waist of your opponent  no matter the distance between   If a  clinch    a defensive move in which a boxer wraps his or her opponents arms and holds on to create a pause   is broken by the referee  each fighter must take a full step back before punching again  alternatively  the referee may direct the fighters to  punch out  of the clinch   When a boxer is knocked down  the other boxer must immediately cease fighting and move to the furthest neutral corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a knockout or called for the fight to continue  Violations of these rules may be ruled  fouls  by the referee  who may issue warnings  deduct points  or disqualify an offending boxer  causing an automatic loss  depending on the seriousness and intentionality of the foul  An intentional foul that causes injury that prevents a fight from continuing usually causes the boxer who committed it to be disqualified  A fighter who suffers an accidental low blow may be given up to five minutes to recover  after which they may be ruled knocked out if they are unable to continue  Accidental fouls that cause injury ending a bout may lead to a  no contest  result  or else cause the fight to go to a decision if enough rounds  typically four or more  or at least three in a four round fight  have passed  Unheard of these days  but common during the early 20th Century in North America  a  newspaper decision  NWS   might be made after a no decision bout had ended  A  no decision  bout occurred when  by law or by pre arrangement of the fighters  if both boxers were still standing at the fight s conclusion and there was no knockout  no official decision was rendered and neither boxer was declared the winner  But this did not prevent the pool of ringside newspaper reporters from declaring a consensus result among themselves and printing a newspaper decision in their publications  Officially  however  a  no decision  bout resulted in neither boxer winning or losing  Boxing historians sometimes use these unofficial newspaper decisions in compiling fight records for illustrative purposes only  Often  media outlets covering a match will personally score the match  and post their scores as an independent sentence in their report   edit  Professional vs  amateur boxing Throughout the 17th through 19th centuries  boxing bouts were motivated by money  as the fighters competed for prize money  promoters controlled the gate  and spectators bet on the result  The modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports  and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908  In their current form  Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds  scoring is computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed  regardless of impact  and fighters wear protective headgear  reducing the number of injuries  knockdowns  and knockouts  Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges  but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an Automated Boxing Scoring System  which introduces scoring objectivity  improves safety  and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators  Professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally  though amateur boxing is dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics  For most fighters  an amateur career  especially at the Olympics  serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career   edit  Amateur boxing Main article  Amateur boxing Headgear is mandatory in modern amateur boxing Amateur boxing may be found at the collegiate level  at the Olympic Games and Commonwealth Games  and in many other venues sanctioned by amateur boxing associations  Amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage  Bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games  and three rounds of three minutes in a national ABA  Amateur Boxing Association  bout  each with a one minute interval between rounds  Competitors wear protective headgear and gloves with a white strip across the knuckle  A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves  Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point  A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows  A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches   any boxer repeatedly landing low blows  below the belt  is disqualified  Referees also ensure that the boxers don t use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging  If this occurs  the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing  Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified  Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured  if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced  11  Amateur bouts which end this way may be noted as  RSC   referee stopped contest  with notations for an outclassed opponent  RSCO   outscored opponent  RSCOS   injury  RSCI  or head injury  RSCH    edit  Professional boxing Main article  Professional boxing Professional bouts are usually much longer than amateur bouts  typically ranging from ten to twelve rounds  though four round fights are common for less experienced fighters or club fighters  There are also some two  12  and three round professional bouts  13  especially in Australia  Through the early twentieth century  it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds  ending only when one fighter quit  benefiting high energy fighters like Jack Dempsey  Fifteen rounds remained the internationally recognized limit for championship fights for most of the twentieth century until the early 1980s  when the death of boxer Duk Koo Kim reduced the limit to twelve  Headgear is not permitted in professional bouts  and boxers are generally allowed to take much more punishment before a fight is halted  At any time  however  the referee may stop the contest if he believes that one participant cannot defend himself due to injury  In that case  the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win  A technical knockout would also be awarded if a fighter lands a punch that opens a cut on the opponent  and the opponent is later deemed not fit to continue by a doctor because of the cut  For this reason  fighters often employ cutmen  whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut  If a boxer simply quits fighting  or if his corner stops the fight  then the winning boxer is also awarded a technical knockout victory  In contrast with amateur boxing  professional male boxers have to be bare chested  14   edit  Boxing styles  edit  Definition of Style  Style  is often defined as the strategic approach a fighter takes during a bout  No two fighters  styles are alike  as it is determined by that individual s physical and mental attributes   edit  Boxer out fighter Heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali A classic  boxer  or stylist  also known as an  out fighter   seeks to maintain distance between himself and his opponent  fighting with faster  longer range punches  most notably the jab  and gradually wearing his opponent down  Due to this reliance on weaker punches  out fighters tend to win by point decisions rather than by knockout  though some out fighters have notable knockout records  They are often regarded as the best boxing strategists due to their ability to control the pace of the fight and lead their opponent  methodically wearing him down and exhibiting more skill and finesse than a brawler citation needed   Out fighters need reach  hand speed  reflexes  and footwork  Notable out fighters include Muhammad Ali  Salvador Sanchez  Gene Tunney  15 Ezzard Charles  16 Willie Pep  17 Meldrick Taylor  Ricardo Lopez  Larry Holmes  Roy Jones  Jr   Joe Calzaghe  and Sugar Ray Leonard  This style was also used by fictional boxer Apollo Creed   edit  Boxer puncher Sugar Ray Robinson prompted sportswriters to create  pound for pound  rankings A boxer puncher is a well rounded boxer who is able to fight at close range with a combination of technique and power  often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot  Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out fighter  although they are generally not as mobile as an out fighter citation needed    but instead of winning by decision  they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout  A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style  Notable boxer punchers include Nonito Donaire  Sam Langford  18 Henry Armstrong  19 Joe Louis  20 Sugar Ray Robinson  21 Tony Zale  Archie Moore  Carlos Monz n 22 Alexis Arg ello  Erik Morales  Lennox Lewis  Wladimir Klitschko  Oscar de la Hoya  Terry Norris  James Toney  Marco Antonio Barrera  Manny Pacquiao  Thomas Hearns  Miguel Cotto and Victor Ortiz   edit  Brawler slugger A brawler is a fighter who generally lacks finesse and footwork in the ring  but makes up for it through sheer punching power  Mainly Irish  Irish American  Mexican  and Mexican American boxers popularized this style  Many brawlers tend to lack mobility  preferring a less mobile  more stable platform and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet  They may also have a tendency to ignore combination punching in favour of continuous beat downs with one hand and by throwing slower  more powerful single punches  such as hooks and uppercuts   Their slowness and predictable punching pattern  single punches with obvious leads  often leaves them open to counter punches  so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment  A brawler s most important assets are power and chin  the ability to absorb punishment while remaining able to continue boxing   This is the image most people think about when they get into boxing for self defense in street fights  Because most street fights use fists rather than kicks  mostly happen in crowded places  you need distance to kick   boxing has become one of the top sports for  club  self defense  23  Examples of this style include John L  Sullivan  Max Baer  Ray Mancini  George Foreman  Sonny Liston  David Tua  Arturo Gatti   Irish  Micky Ward  Michael Katsidis  James Kirkland  and Ireland s John Duddy  This style of boxing was also used by fictional boxer Rocky Balboa   edit  Swarmers in fighter In fighters swarmers  sometimes called  pressure fighters   attempt to stay close to an opponent  throwing intense flurries and combinations of hooks and uppercuts  A successful in fighter often needs a good  chin  because swarming usually involves being hit with many jabs before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective  In fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward  However  several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in fighting as well as out fighting  The essence of a swarmer is non stop aggression  Many short in fighters utilize their stature to their advantage  employing a bob and weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches  Unlike blocking  causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance  permits forward movement past the opponent s extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter  A distinct advantage that in fighters have is when throwing uppercuts where they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch  Mike Tyson was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts  Julio C sar Ch vez was known for his hard  chin   punching power  body attack and the stalking of his opponents  Some in fighters  like Mike Tyson  have been known for being notoriously hard to hit  The key to a swarmer is aggression  endurance  chin  and bobbing and weaving  Notable in fighters include Mike Tyson  Harry Greb  24 Jack Dempsey  25 Rocky Marciano  26 Joe Frazier  Jake LaMotta  David Tua  Ricky Hatton and Julio C sar Ch vez   edit  Counter puncher Louis vs  Schmeling  1936 Counter punchers are slippery  defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent s mistakes in order to gain the advantage whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout  They use their well rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch  Thus  fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and never telegraphing a punch for the counter puncher to generate a good offense from  To be successful using this style they must have good reflexes  intelligence  punch accuracy  and good hand speed  Notable counter punchers include Jim Corbett  Jack Johnson  Laszlo Papp  Jerry Quarry  Chris Byrd  Bernard Hopkins  Vitali Klitschko  James Toney  Marvin Hagler  Evander Holyfield  Juan Manuel M rquez  Humberto Soto  Floyd Mayweather  Jr   Roger Mayweather  Pernell Whitaker  and Max Schmeling   edit  Combinations of styles All fighters have primary skills with which they feel most comfortable  but truly elite fighters are often able to incorporate auxiliary styles when presented with a particular challenge  For example  an out fighter will sometimes plant his feet and counter punch  or a slugger may have the stamina to pressure fight with his power punches   edit  Style matchups There is a generally accepted rule of thumb about the success each of these boxing styles has against the others  In general  an in fighter has an advantage over an out fighter  an out fighter has an advantage over a puncher  and a puncher has an advantage over an in fighter  these form a cycle with each style being stronger relative to one  and weaker relative to another  with none dominating  as in rock paper scissors  Naturally  many other factors  such as the skill level and training of the combatants  determine the outcome of a fight  but the widely held belief in this relationship among the styles is embodied in the clich  amongst boxing fans and writers that  styles make fights   Brawlers tend to overcome swarmers or in fighters because  in trying to get close to the slugger  the in fighter will invariably have to walk straight into the guns of the much harder hitting brawler  so  unless the former has a very good chin and the latter s stamina is poor  the brawler s superior power will carry the day  A famous example of this type of match up advantage would be George Foreman s knockout victory over Joe Frazier  Taylor vs Ch vez 1  an example of a style matchup Although in fighters struggle against heavy sluggers  they typically enjoy more success against out fighters or boxers  Out fighters prefer a slower fight  with some distance between themselves and the opponent  The in fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries  On the inside  the out fighter loses a lot of his combat effectiveness  because he cannot throw the hard punches  The in fighter is generally successful in this case  due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility  which makes him difficult to evade  For example  the swarming Joe Frazier  though easily dominated by the slugger George Foreman  was able to create many more problems for the boxer Muhammad Ali in their three fights  Joe Louis  after retirement  admitted that he hated being crowded  and that swarmers like untied undefeated champ Rocky Marciano would have caused him style problems even in his prime  The boxer or out fighter tends to be most successful against a brawler  whose slow speed  both hand and foot  and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out fighter  The out fighter s main concern is to stay alert  as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight  If the out fighter can avoid those power punches  he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs  tiring him out  If he is successful enough  he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds in an attempt to achieve a knockout  Most classic boxers  such as Muhammad Ali  enjoyed their best successes against sluggers  An example of a style matchup was the historical fight of Julio C sar Ch vez  a swarmer or in fighter  against Meldrick Taylor  the boxer or out fighter  see Chavez versus Taylor   The match was nicknamed  Thunder Meets Lightning  as an allusion to tremendous punching power of Ch vez and blinding speed of Taylor  Ch vez was the epitome of the  Mexican  style of boxing  He relentlessly stalked and closed in on the other fighter  ignoring whatever punishment he took for the chance to dish out his own at close range  particularly in the form of a crunching body attack that would either wear down his opponents until they collapsed in pain and exhaustion  or became too tired to defend as Ch vez shifted his attack to the head and went for a knockout  During the fight  Taylor s brilliant hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage  allowing him to begin building a large lead on points  but in the end  Chavez s punishment wore down Taylor and knocked him down with a tremendous right hand in the last round   edit  Equipment Since boxing involves forceful  repetitive punching  precautions must be taken to prevent damage to bones in the hand  Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without wrist wraps and boxing gloves  Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand  and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury  allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not utilize them  Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century  though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth century fighters  Prior to a bout  both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves to be used in the bout  with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage  The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches  so this too is usually stipulated before a bout  A mouth guard is important to protect the teeth and gums from injury  and to cushion the jaw  resulting in a decreased chance of knockout  Both fighters must wear soft soled shoes to reduce the damage from accidental  or intentional  stepping on feet  While older boxing boots more commonly resembled those of a professional wrestler  modern boxing shoes and boots tend to be quite similar to their amateur wrestling counterparts  Boxers practice their skills on two basic types of punching bags  A small  tear drop shaped  speed bag  is used to hone reflexes and repetitive punching skills  while a large cylindrical  heavy bag  filled with sand  a synthetic substitute  or water is used to practice power punching and body blows  In addition to these distinctive pieces of equipment  boxers also utilize sport nonspecific training equipment to build strength  speed  agility  and stamina  Common training equipment includes free weights  rowing machines  jump rope  and medicine balls   edit  Technique Main article  Boxing styles and technique It has been suggested that this article or section be merged with Boxing styles and technique   Discuss  Proposed since November 2011   edit  Stance The modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries  The modern stance has a more upright vertical armed guard  as opposed to the more horizontal  knuckles facing forward guard adopted by early 20th century hook users such as Jack Johnson  Upright stance Semi crouch Full crouch In a fully upright stance  the boxer stands with the legs shoulder width apart and the rear foot a half step in front of the lead man  Right handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist  for most penetration power   Both feet are parallel  and the right heel is off the ground  The lead  left  fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level  The rear  right  fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body  The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock outs and is often kept slightly offcenter  Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage  Some boxers fight from a crouch  leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together  The stance described is considered the  textbook  stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once its been mastered as a base  Case in point  many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork  while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents  Left handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance  which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs  hooks  or crosses from the opposite side  The southpaw stance  conversely  is vulnerable to a straight right hand  North American fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance  facing the opponent almost squarely  while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side  The positioning of the hands may also vary  as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face  risking exposure to body shots  Modern boxers can sometimes be seen tapping their cheeks or foreheads with their fists in order to remind themselves to keep their hands up  which becomes difficult during long bouts   Boxers are taught to push off with their feet in order to move effectively  Forward motion involves lifting the lead leg and pushing with the rear leg  Rearward motion involves lifting the rear leg and pushing with the lead leg  During lateral motion the leg in the direction of the movement moves first while the opposite leg provides the force needed to move the body   edit  Punches There are four basic punches in boxing  the jab  straight right left hand  hook and uppercut  If a boxer is right handed  orthodox   his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand  For a left handed boxer or southpaw  the hand positions are reversed  For clarity  the following discussion will assume a right handed boxer  Jab Cross   in counter punch with a looping hook Uppercut Short straight punch   in short range and close range Cross counter  counter punch  Half uppercut   a combination of a wide Uppercut straight punch Jab   A quick  straight punch thrown with the lead hand from the guard position  The jab is accompanied by a small  clockwise rotation of the torso and hips  while the fist rotates 90 degrees  becoming horizontal upon impact  As the punch reaches full extension  the lead shoulder can be brought up to guard the chin  The rear hand remains next to the face to guard the jaw  After making contact with the target  the lead hand is retracted quickly to resume a guard position in front of the face  The jab is recognised as the most important punch in a boxer s arsenal because it provides a fair amount of its own cover and it leaves the least amount of space for a counter punch from the opponent  It has the longest reach of any punch and does not require commitment or large weight transfers  Due to its relatively weak power  the jab is often used as a tool to gauge distances  probe an opponent s defenses  harass an opponent  and set up heavier  more powerful punches  A half step may be added  moving the entire body into the punch  for additional power  Some notable boxers who have been able to develop relative power in their jabs and use it to punish or  wear down  their opponents to some effect include Larry Holmes and Wladimir Klitschko  Ukrainian IBF  WBA  WBO and IBO heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko  Cross   A powerful  straight punch thrown with the rear hand  From the guard position  the rear hand is thrown from the chin  crossing the body and traveling towards the target in a straight line  The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching the outside of the chin  At the same time  the lead hand is retracted and tucked against the face to protect the inside of the chin  For additional power  the torso and hips are rotated counter clockwise as the cross is thrown  Weight is also transferred from the rear foot to the lead foot  resulting in the rear heel turning outwards as it acts as a fulcrum for the transfer of weight  Body rotation and the sudden weight transfer is what gives the cross its power  Like the jab  a half step forward may be added  After the cross is thrown  the hand is retracted quickly and the guard position resumed  It can be used to counter punch a jab  aiming for the opponent s head  or a counter to a cross aimed at the body  or to set up a hook  The cross can also follow a jab  creating the classic  one two  combination  The cross is also called a  straight  or  right   especially if it does not cross the opponent s outstretched jab  Hook   A semi circular punch thrown with the lead hand to the side of the opponent s head  From the guard position  the elbow is drawn back with a horizontal fist  knuckles pointing forward  and the elbow bent  The rear hand is tucked firmly against the jaw to protect the chin  The torso and hips are rotated clockwise  propelling the fist through a tight  clockwise arc across the front of the body and connecting with the target  At the same time  the lead foot pivots clockwise  turning the left heel outwards  Upon contact  the hook s circular path ends abruptly and the lead hand is pulled quickly back into the guard position  A hook may also target the lower body and this technique is sometimes called the  rip  to distinguish it from the conventional hook to the head  The hook may also be thrown with the rear hand  Notable left hookers include Joe Frazier and Mike Tyson  Uppercut   A vertical  rising punch thrown with the rear hand  From the guard position  the torso shifts slightly to the right  the rear hand drops below the level of the opponent s chest and the knees are bent slightly  From this position  the rear hand is thrust upwards in a rising arc towards the opponent s chin or torso  At the same time  the knees push upwards quickly and the torso and hips rotate anti clockwise and the rear heel turns outward  mimicking the body movement of the cross  The strategic utility of the uppercut depends on its ability to  lift  the opponent s body  setting it off balance for successive attacks  The right uppercut followed by a left hook is a deadly combination employing the uppercut to lift the opponent s chin into a vulnerable position  then the hook to knock the opponent out  These different punch types can be thrown in rapid succession to form combinations or  combos   The most common is the jab and cross combination  nicknamed the  one two combo   This is usually an effective combination  because the jab blocks the opponent s view of the cross  making it easier to land cleanly and forcefully  A large  swinging circular punch starting from a cocked back position with the arm at a longer extension than the hook and all of the fighter s weight behind it is sometimes referred to as a  roundhouse    haymaker   or sucker punch  Relying on body weight and centripetal force within a wide arc  the roundhouse can be a powerful blow  but it is often a wild and uncontrolled punch that leaves the fighter delivering it off balance and with an open guard  Wide  looping punches have the further disadvantage of taking more time to deliver  giving the opponent ample warning to react and counter  For this reason  the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch  and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation  Sometimes it has been used  because of its immense potential power  to finish off an already staggering opponent who seems unable or unlikely to take advantage of the poor position it leaves the puncher in  Another unconventional punch is the rarely used Bolo punch  in which the opponent swings an arm out several times in a wide arc  usually as a distraction  before delivering with either that or the other arm   edit  Defense There are several basic maneuvers a boxer can use in order to evade or block punches  depicted and discussed below  Slipping Bobbing Blocking  with the arms  Cover Up  with the gloves  Clinching Footwork Pulling away Slip   Slipping rotates the body slightly so that an incoming punch passes harmlessly next to the head  As the opponent s punch arrives  the boxer sharply rotates the hips and shoulders  This turns the chin sideways and allows the punch to  slip  past  Muhammad Ali was famous for extremely fast and close slips  as was an early Mike Tyson  Sway or fade   To anticipate a punch and move the upper body or head back so that it misses or has its force appreciably lessened  Also called  rolling with the punch  or   Riding The Punch   Duck or break   To drop down with the back straight so that a punch aimed at the head glances or misses entirely  Bob and weave   Bobbing moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch  As the opponent s punch arrives  the boxer bends the legs quickly and simultaneously shifts the body either slightly right or left  Once the punch has been evaded  the boxer  weaves  back to an upright position  emerging on either the outside or inside of the opponent s still extended arm  To move outside the opponent s extended arm is called  bobbing to the outside   To move inside the opponent s extended arm is called  bobbing to the inside   Joe Frazier  Jack Dempsey  Mike Tyson and Rocky Marciano were masters of bobbing and weaving  Parry block   Parrying or blocking uses the boxer s shoulder  hands or arms as defensive tools to protect against incoming attacks  A block generally receives a punch while a parry tends to deflect it  A  palm  or  cuff  is a block which intentionally takes the incoming punch on that portion of the defender s glove  The cover Up   Covering up is the last opportunity  other than rolling with a punch  to avoid an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body  Generally speaking  the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots  When protecting the body  the boxer rotates the hips and lets incoming punches  roll  off the guard  To protect the head  the boxer presses both fists against the front of the face with the forearms parallel and facing outwards  This type of guard is weak against attacks from below  The clinch   Clinching is a form of trapping or a rough form of grappling and occurs when the distance between both fighters has closed and straight punches cannot be employed  In this situation  the boxer attempts to hold or  tie up  the opponent s hands so he is unable to throw hooks or uppercuts  To perform a clinch  the boxer loops both hands around the outside of the opponent s shoulders  scooping back under the forearms to grasp the opponent s arms tightly against his own body  In this position  the opponent s arms are pinned and cannot be used to attack  Clinching is a temporary match state and is quickly dissipated by the referee  Clinching is technically against the rules  and in amateur fights points are deducted fairly quickly for it  It is unlikely  however  to see points deducted for a clinch in professional boxing   edit  Guards There are several defensive positions  guards or styles  used in boxing  Within each style  there is considerable variation among fighters  as some fighters may have their guard higher for more head protection while others have their guard lower to provide better protection against body punches  Many fighters vary their defensive style throughout a bout in order to adapt to the situation of the moment  choosing the position best suited to protect them  Boxers who use an upright stance protect their chin with the rear hand in either the low or mixed guard styles depicted below  Crouch fighters tend to use the  peek a boo  style  discussed below  Low guard Mix boo Peek a boo   Sometimes known as the  poo   the hands are placed next to each other in front of the face  fighters tend to vary the exact positioning  and elbows are brought in tight to the body  this position can be achieved by bringing the elbows as close together while not straining yourself to do so   This defensive style is what a boxer is taught to do when he begins to box  after he gains experience he can decide to change or vary the guard  This style is middle of the road style in terms of counterpunching and damage reduction  A boxer can counter punch from this stance  but it is difficult  However  there have been boxers who can do this very well  This defense covers up a fighter well  but there are holes  Hooks do damage by going around the hands and by hitting just behind the elbows  Winky Wright uses this style very well from a damage reduction stand point  Another famous example is Mike Tyson  who in his early career used the Peek a Boo with great success  Cross armed   The forearms are placed on top of each other horizontally in front of the face with the glove of one arm being on the top of the elbow of the other arm  This style is greatly varied when the back hand rises vertically  This style is the most effective for reducing head damage  The only head punch that a fighter is susceptible to is a jab to the top of the head  The body is open  but most fighters who use this style bend and lean to protect the body  but while upright and unaltered the body is there to be hit  This position is very difficult to counterpunch from  but virtually eliminates all head damage  Philly Shell  hitman or crab   The lead arm is placed across the torso usually somewhere in between the belly button and chest and the lead hand rests on the opposite side of the fighter s torso  The back hand is placed on the side of the face  The lead shoulder is brought in tight against the side of the face  This style is used by fighters who like to counterpunch  To execute this guard a fighter must be very athletic and experienced  This style is so effective for counterpunching because it allows fighters to slip punches by rotating and dipping their upper body and causing blows to glance off the fighter  After the punch glances off  the fighter s back hand is in perfect position to hit his out of positioned opponent  The shoulder lean is used in this stance  To execute the shoulder lean a fighter rotates and ducks when his opponent s punch is coming towards him and then rotates back towards his opponent while his opponent is bringing his hand back  The fighter will throw a punch with his back hand as he is rotating towards his undefended opponent  The weakness to this style is that when a fighter is stationary and not rotating he is open to be hit  so a fighter must be athletic and well conditioned to effectively execute this style  To beat this style fighters like to jab their opponent s shoulder causing the shoulder and arm to be in pain and to demobilize that arm  Boxers generally attempt to land high  fast combinations and then quickly shift position to avoid a possible response by their opponent  Strategically  the ring s centre is generally the desired position since a boxer is able to conserve movement by forcing the opponent to circle around them  When in the centre  the boxer is also less likely to be knocked backwards against the ropes surrounding the ring and cornered  Depending on the boxer s style  the centre is the desired location as cornering opponents is always a good strategy  Most fighters  though  will not move around the boxer in the center because doing so makes them vulnerable to shots thrown at good angles  Movement is the most important tool in the ring and allows the fighter to avoid punches that were not telegraphed  If a boxer is standing still  his opponent has a better chance of hitting him  A fighter anticipating a shot while stationary is less likely to be able to evade the shot than a fighter already in motion   edit  Less common strategies The  rope a dope  strategy   Used by Muhammad Ali in his 1974  the Rumble in the Jungle  bout against George Foreman  the rope a dope method involves lying back against the ropes  covering up defensively as much as possible and allowing the opponent to attempt numerous punches  The back leaning posture  which does not cause the defending boxer to become as unbalanced as they would during normal backward movement  also maximizes the distance of the defender s head from his opponent  increasing the probability that punches will miss their intended target  Weathering the blows that do land  the defender lures the opponent into expending energy whilst conserving his her own  If successful  the attacking opponent will eventually tire  creating defensive flaws which the boxer can exploit  In modern boxing  the rope a dope is generally discouraged since most opponents are not fooled by it and few boxers possess the physical toughness to withstand a prolonged  unanswered assault  Recently  however  eight division world champion Manny Pacquiao skillfully used the strategy to gauge the power of welterweight titlist Miguel Cotto in November 2009  Pacquiao followed up the rope a dope gambit with a withering knockdown  Bolo punch   Occasionally seen in Olympic boxing  the bolo is an arm punch which owes its power to the shortening of a circular arc rather than to transference of body weight  it tends to have more of an effect due to the surprise of the odd angle it lands at rather than the actual power of the punch  This is more of a gimmick than a technical maneuver  this punch is not taught  being on the same plane in boxing technicality as is the Ali shuffle  Nevertheless  a few professional boxers have used the bolo punch to great effect  including former welterweight champions Sugar Ray Leonard  and Kid Gavilan  Middleweight champion Ceferino Garcia is regarded as the inventor of the bolo punch  Bolo punch Overhand  overcut  Overhand right   The overhand right is a punch not found in every boxer s arsenal  Unlike the right cross  which has a trajectory parallel to the ground  the overhand right has a looping circular arc as it is thrown over the shoulder with the palm facing away from the boxer  It is especially popular with smaller stature boxers trying to reach taller opponents  Boxers who have used this punch consistently and effectively include former heavyweight champions Rocky Marciano and Tim Witherspoon  as well as MMA champions Chuck Liddell and Fedor Emelianenko  The overhand right has become a popular weapon in other tournaments that involve fist striking  Check hook   A check hook is employed to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in  There are two parts to the check hook  The first part consists of a regular hook  The second  trickier part involves the footwork  As the opponent lunges in  the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around  If executed correctly  the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador  This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute  Technically speaking it has been said that there is no such thing as a check hook and that it is simply a hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past  Others have argued that the check hook exists but is an illegal punch due to it being a pivot punch which is illegal in the sport  Floyd Mayweather  Jr  employed the use of a check hook against Ricky Hatton  which sent Hatton flying head first into the corner post and being knocked down  Hatton managed to get himself to his feet after the knockdown but was clearly dazed and it was only a matter of moments before Mayweather landed a flurry of punches which sent Hatton crashing to the canvas  giving Mayweather a TKO victory in the 10th round and handing Hatton his first ever defeat   edit  The corner Yusuf Ahmed boxer in corner of the ring  In boxing  each fighter is given a corner of the ring where he rests in between rounds and where his trainers stand  Typically  three men stand in the corner besides the boxer himself  these are the trainer  the assistant trainer and the cutman  The trainer and assistant typically give advice to the boxer on what he is doing wrong as well as encouraging him if he is losing  The cutman is a cutaneous doctor responsible for keeping the boxer s face and eyes free of cuts and blood  This is of particular importance because many fights are stopped because of cuts that threaten the boxer s eyes  In addition  the corner is responsible for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury  The corner will occasionally throw in a white towel to signify a boxer s surrender  the idiomatic phrase  to throw in the towel   meaning to give up  derives from this practice   27  This can be seen in the fight between Diego Corrales and Floyd Mayweather  In that fight  Corrales  corner surrendered despite Corrales  steadfast refusal   edit  Medical concerns See also  The distance  boxing  Distance change criticisms Knocking a person unconscious or even causing concussion may cause permanent brain damage  28  There is no clear division between the force required to knock a person out and the force likely to kill a person citation needed   Since 1980  more than 200 amateur boxers  professional boxers and Toughman fighters have died as the result of ring or training injuries  29  Thus clarification needed   in 1983  the Journal of the American Medical Association called for a ban on boxing  The editor  Dr  George Lundberg  called boxing an  obscenity  that  should not be sanctioned by any civilized society   30  Since then  the British  31  Canadian 32  and Australian 33  Medical Associations also have called for bans on boxing  Supporters of the ban state that boxing is the only sport where hurting the other athlete is the goal  Dr  Bill O Neill  boxing spokesman for the British Medical Association  has supported the BMA s proposed ban on boxing   It is the only sport where the intention is to inflict serious injury on your opponent  and we feel that we must have a total ban on boxing   34  In 2007  one study of amateur boxers showed that protective headgear did not prevent brain damage  35  and another found that amateur boxers faced a high risk of brain damage  36  In 1997  the American Association of Professional Ringside Physicians was established to create medical protocols through research and education to prevent injuries in boxing  37  38  Professional boxing is forbidden in Norway  Iceland  Cuba  Iran and North Korea  It was banned in Sweden until 2007 39  when the ban was lifted but strict restrictions  including four three minute rounds for fights  were imposed  citation needed  It was banned in Albania from 1965 till the fall of Communism in 1991  Now it is still legal   edit  Boxing Hall of Fame The sport of boxing has two internationally recognized boxing halls of fame  the International Boxing Hall of Fame  IBHOF  and the World Boxing Hall of Fame  WBHF   with the IBHOF being the more widely recognized boxing hall of fame  The WBHF was founded by Everett L  Sanders in 1980  Since its inception the WBHOF has never had a permanent location or museum  which has allowed the more recent IBHOF to garner more publicity and prestige  Among the notable names in the WBHF are Ricardo  Finito  Lopez  Gabriel  Flash  Elorde  Michael Carbajal  Khaosai Galaxy  Henry Armstrong  Jack Johnson  Roberto Dur n  George Foreman  Ceferino Garcia and Salvador Sanchez  Boxing s International Hall of Fame was inspired by a tribute an American town held for two local heroes in 1982  The town  Canastota  New York   which is about 15 miles  24 km  east of Syracuse  via the New York State Thruway   honored former world welterweight middleweight champion Carmen Basilio and his nephew  former world welterweight champion Billy Backus  The people of Canastota raised money for the tribute which inspired the idea of creating an official  annual hall of fame for notable boxers  The International Boxing Hall of Fame opened in Canastota in 1989  The first inductees in 1990 included Jack Johnson  Benny Leonard  Jack Dempsey  Henry Armstrong  Sugar Ray Robinson  Archie Moore  and Muhammad Ali  Other world class figures include Salvador Sanchez  Roberto  Manos de Piedra  Dur n  Ricardo Lopez  Gabriel  Flash  Elorde  Vicente Saldivar  Ismael Laguna  Eusebio Pedroza  Carlos Monz n  Azumah Nelson  Rocky Marciano  Pipino Cuevas and Ken Buchanan  The Hall of Fame s induction ceremony is held every June as part of a four day event  The fans who come to Canastota for the Induction Weekend are treated to a number of events  including scheduled autograph sessions  boxing exhibitions  a parade featuring past and present inductees  and the induction ceremony itself  edit  Governing and sanctioning bodies Governing Body Website British Boxing Board of Control  BBBofC  http   www bbbofc com  Nevada State
