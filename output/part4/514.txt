Jimmy Carter  around age 13  his dog  Bozo  in 1937  James Earl Carter  Jr   was born at the Wise Sanitarium 6  on October 1  1924  in the tiny southwest Georgia city of Plains  near Americus  The first president born in a hospital  7  he is the eldest of four children of James Earl Carter and Bessie Lillian Gordy  Carter s father was a prominent business owner in the community and his mother was a registered nurse  Carter is descended from immigrants from southern England  his paternal ancestor arrived in the American Colonies in 1635   8  and his family has lived in the state of Georgia for several generations  Carter has documented ancestors who fought in the American Revolution  and he is a member of the Sons of the American Revolution  9  Carter s great grandfather  Private L B  Walker Carter  1832 1874   served in the Confederate States Army  10  Carter was a gifted student from an early age who always had a fondness for reading  By the time he attended Plains High School  he was also a star in basketball  He was greatly influenced by one of his high school teachers  Julia Coleman  1889 1973   While he was in high school he was in the Future Farmers of America  which later changed its name to the National FFA Organization  serving as the Plains FFA Chapter Secretary  11  Carter had three younger siblings  sisters Gloria Carter Spann  1926 1990  and Ruth Carter Stapleton  1929 1983   and brother William Alton  Billy  Carter  1937 1988   During Carter s Presidency  Billy was often in the news  usually in an unflattering light  12  He married Rosalynn Smith in 1946  they have four children  He is a first cousin of politician Hugh Carter and a distant cousin of Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr  on his mother s side  and a cousin of June Carter Cash  13  Naval career After high school  Carter enrolled at Georgia Southwestern College  in Americus  Later  he applied to the United States Naval Academy and  after taking additional mathematics courses at Georgia Tech  he was admitted in 1943  Carter graduated 59th out of 820 midshipmen at the Naval Academy with a Bachelor of Science degree with an unspecified major  as was the custom at the academy at that time  14  Carter served on surface ships and on diesel electric submarines in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets  As a junior officer  he completed qualification for command of a diesel electric submarine  He applied for the US Navy s fledgling nuclear submarine program run by then Captain Hyman G  Rickover  Rickover s demands on his men and machines were legendary  and Carter later said that  next to his parents  Rickover had the greatest influence on him  Carter has said that he loved the Navy  and had planned to make it his career  His ultimate goal was to become Chief of Naval Operations  Carter felt the best route for promotion was with submarine duty since he felt that nuclear power would be increasingly used in submarines  Carter was based in Schenectady  New York  and working on developing training materials for the nuclear propulsion system for the prototype of a new submarine  15  On December 12  1952  an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at Atomic Energy of Canada s Chalk River Laboratories caused a partial meltdown  The resulting explosion caused millions of liters of radioactive water to flood the reactor building s basement  and the reactor s core was no longer usable  16  Carter was now ordered to Chalk River  joining other Canadian and American service personnel  He was the officer in charge of the U S  team assisting in the shutdown of the Chalk River Nuclear Reactor  17  Once they arrived  Carter s team used a model of the reactor to practice the steps necessary to disassemble the reactor and seal it off  During execution of the actual disassembly each team member  including Carter  donned protective gear  was lowered individually into the reactor  stayed for only a few seconds at a time to minimize exposure to radiation  and used hand tools to loosen bolts  remove nuts and take the other steps necessary to complete the disassembly process  During and after his presidency Carter indicated that his experience at Chalk River shaped his views on nuclear power and nuclear weapons  including his decision not to pursue completion of the neutron bomb  18  Upon the death of his father James Earl Carter  Sr   in July 1953  he was urgently needed to run the family business  Lieutenant Carter resigned his commission  and he was discharged from the Navy on October 9  1953  Farming and Personal Belief Though Carter s father  Earl  died a relatively wealthy man  between Earl s forgiveness of debts owed to him and the division of his wealth among his heirs  Jimmy Carter inherited comparatively little  For a year  due to a limited real estate market  the Carters lived in public housing  Carter is the only U S  president to have lived in housing subsidized for the poor   19  Knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects and raised on a farm  Carter took over the family peanut farm  Carter took to the county library to read up on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the businesses financials  19  Though they barely broke even the first year  Carter managed to expand in Plains  His farming business was successful  and during the 1970 gubernatorial campaign  he was considered a wealthy peanut farmer  20  From a young age  Carter showed a deep commitment to Christianity  serving as a Sunday School teacher throughout his life  Even as President  Carter prayed several times a day  and professed that Jesus Christ was the driving force in his life  Carter had been greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man  called   If you were arrested for being a Christian  would there be enough evidence to convict you   21  Early political career Georgia State Senate Jimmy Carter started his career by serving on various local boards  governing such entities as the schools  hospitals  and libraries  among others  In the 1960s  he served two terms in the Georgia Senate from the fourteenth district of Georgia  His 1961 election to the state Senate  which followed the end of Georgia s County Unit System  per the Supreme Court case of Gray v  Sanders   was chronicled in his book Turning Point  A Candidate  a State  and a Nation Come of Age  The election involved corruption led by Joe Hurst  the sheriff of Quitman County  system abuses included votes from deceased persons and tallies filled with people who supposedly voted in alphabetical order  It took a challenge of the fraudulent results for Carter to win the election  Carter was reelected in 1964  to serve a second two year term  For a time in State Senate he chaired its Education Committee  22  In 1966  Carter declined running for re election as a state senator to pursue a gubernatorial run  His first cousin  Hugh Carter  was elected as a Democrat and took over his seat in the Senate  Campaigns for Governor Main article  Georgia gubernatorial election  1966 In 1966  during the end of his career as a state senator  he flirted with the idea of running for the United States House of Representatives  His Republican opponent  Howard Callaway  dropped out and decided to run for Governor of Georgia  Carter did not want to see a Republican Governor of his state  and  in turn  dropped out of the race for Congress and joined the race to become Governor  Carter lost the Democratic primary  but drew enough votes as a third place candidate to force the favorite  liberal former governor Ellis Arnall  into a runoff election  setting off a chain of events which resulted in the nomination of segregationist Democrat Lester Maddox  Maddox would go on to be selected governor of Georgia by the Georgia General Assembly despite finishing a close second in a three way general election race between Maddox  Callaway  and Arnall  who ran as a Write in candidate  During the primary Carter ran as a moderate alternative to both liberal Arnall and conservative Maddox  22  Although he lost  his strong third place finish was viewed as a success for a little known state senator  22  Main article  Georgia gubernatorial election  1970 For the next four years  Carter returned to his agriculture business and carefully planned for his next campaign for Governor in 1970  making over 1 800 speeches throughout the state  During his 1970 campaign  he ran an uphill populist campaign in the Democratic primary against former Governor Carl Sanders  labeling his opponent  Cufflinks Carl   Carter was never a segregationist  and refused to join the segregationist White Citizens  Council  prompting a boycott of his peanut warehouse  His family was also one of only two that voted to admit blacks to the Plains Baptist Church  23   Carter himself was not a segregationist in 1970  But he did say things that the segregationists wanted to hear  He was opposed to busing  He was in favor of private schools  He said that he would invite segregationist governor George Wallace to come to Georgia to give a speech    according to historian E  Stanly Godbold  After his election  Carter would make a statement that would displease the segregationists   I say to you quite frankly  that the time for racial discrimination is over  No poor  rural  weak  or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity of an education  a job  or simple justice   Leroy Johnson  Georgia State Senator reflected   We were extremely pleased  Many of the white segregationists were displeased  And I m convinced that those people that supported him  would not have supported him if they had thought that he would have made that statement   24  Carter s campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent celebrating with black basketball players  25  26  Following his close victory over Sanders in the primary  he was elected Governor over Republican Hal Suit  Governor of Georgia Carter was sworn in as the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12  1971 and held this post for one term  until January 14  1975  Governors of Georgia were not allowed to succeed themselves at the time  His predecessor as Governor  Lester Maddox  became the Lieutenant Governor  Carter and Maddox found little common ground during their four years of service  often publicly feuding with each other  27  28  Civil rights politics Carter declared in his inaugural speech that the time of racial segregation was over  and that racial discrimination had no place in the future of the state  the first statewide office holder in the Deep South to say this in public  29  Afterwards  Carter appointed many African Americans to statewide boards and offices  He was often called one of the  New Southern Governors    much more moderate than their predecessors  and supportive of racial desegregation and expanding African Americans  rights  Abortion Although  personally opposed  to abortion  after the landmark US Supreme Court decision Roe v  Wade  410 US 113  1973  Carter supported legalized abortion  30  He did not support increased federal funding for abortion services as president and was criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union for not doing enough to find alternatives  31  State government reforms Carter improved government efficiency by merging about 300 state agencies into 30 agencies  One of his aides recalled that Governor Carter  was right there with us  working just as hard  digging just as deep into every little problem  It was his program and he worked on it as hard as anybody  and the final product was distinctly his   He also pushed reforms through the legislature  providing equal state aid to schools in the wealthy and poor areas of Georgia  set up community centers for mentally handicapped children  and increased educational programs for convicts  Carter took pride in a program he introduced for the appointment of judges and state government officials  Under this program  all such appointments were based on merit  rather than political influence  32  33  Vice Presidential aspirations in 1972 In 1972  as US Senator George McGovern of South Dakota was marching toward the Democratic nomination for President  Carter called a news conference in Atlanta to warn that McGovern was unelectable  Carter criticized McGovern as too liberal on both foreign and domestic policy  yet when McGovern s nomination became a foregone conclusion  Carter lobbied to become his vice presidential running mate  During the 1972 Democratic National Convention he endorsed the candidacy of Senator Henry M  Jackson of Washington  34  Carter received 30 votes at the Democratic National Convention in the chaotic ballot for Vice President  McGovern offered the second spot to Reubin Askew  from next door Florida and one of the  new southern governors   but he declined  Death penalty and crime After the US Supreme Court overturned Georgia s death penalty law in 1972  Carter quickly proposed state legislation to replace the death penalty with life in prison  an option that previously did not exist   35  When the Georgia legislature passed a new death penalty statute  Carter  despite voicing reservations about its constitutionality  36  signed new legislation on March 28  1973 37  to authorize the death penalty for murder  rape and other offenses  and to implement trial procedures that conformed to the newly announced constitutional requirements  In 1976  the Supreme Court upheld Georgia s new death penalty for murder  In the case of Coker v  Georgia  the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional as applied to rape  Many in America were outraged by William Calley s life sentence at Fort Benning for his role in the My Lai Massacre  Carter instituted  American Fighting Man s Day  and asked Georgians to drive for a week with their lights on in support of Calley  38  Indiana s governor asked all state flags to be flown at half staff for Calley  and Utah s and Mississippi s governors also disagreed with the verdict  38  Despite his earlier support  Carter soon became a death penalty opponent  and during Presidential campaigns  like previous nominee George McGovern and two successive nominees  Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis   this was noted  39  Currently  Carter is known for his outspoken opposition to the death penalty in all forms  in his Nobel Prize lecture  he urged  prohibition of the death penalty   40  United States Senate appointment Richard Russell  Jr   then President pro tempore of the United States Senate  died in office on January 21  1971  Carter  only nine days into his governorship  appointed state Democratic Party chair David H  Gambrell to fill an unexpired Russell term in the Senate on February 1  41  Gambrell was defeated in the next Democratic primary by the more conservative Sam Nunn  Other activities In 1973  while Governor of Georgia  Carter filed a report on his 1969 UFO sighting with the International UFO Bureau in Oklahoma City  42  43  44  In 2007  Carter stated that he did not remember why he filed the report and that he believes he probably only did it at the request of one of his children  He also stated he does not believe it was an alien spacecraft  but rather that it was likely some sort of military experiment being conducted from a nearby military base  45  Carter made an appearance as the first guest of the evening on an episode of the game show What s My Line in 1974  signing in as  X   lest his name give away his occupation  After his job was identified on question seven of ten by Gene Shalit  he talked about having brought movie production to the state of Georgia  citing Deliverance  and the then unreleased The Longest Yard  In 1974  Carter was chairman of the Democratic National Committee s congressional  as well as gubernatorial  campaigns  1976 presidential campaign Main article  United States presidential election  1976 The electoral map of the 1976 election When Carter entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries in 1976  he was considered to have little chance against nationally better known politicians  He had a name recognition of only two percent  When he told his family of his intention to run for President  his mother asked   President of what   The Watergate scandal was still fresh in the voters  minds  and so his position as an outsider  distant from Washington  D C   became an asset  The centerpiece of his campaign platform was government reorganization  Carter and President Gerald Ford debating at the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia  Carter became the front runner early on by winning the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary  He used a two prong strategy  In the South  which most had tacitly conceded to Alabama s George Wallace  Carter ran as a moderate favorite son  When Wallace proved to be a spent force  Carter swept the region  In the North  Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters and had little chance of winning a majority in most states  He won several Northern states by building the largest single bloc  Carter s strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there  He traveled over 50 000 miles  visited 37 states  and delivered over 200 speeches before any other candidates even announced that they were in the race  46  Initially dismissed as a regional candidate  Carter proved to be the only Democrat with a truly national strategy  and he eventually clinched the nomination  The national news media discovered and promoted Carter  as Lawrence Shoup noted in his 1980 book The Carter Presidency and Beyond  What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media  It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge  propelling him rocket like to the top of the opinion polls  This helped Carter win key primary election victories  enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President elect in the short space of 9 months  Carter was interviewed by Robert Scheer of Playboy for its November 1976 issue  which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election  It was here that in the course of a digression on his religion s view of pride  Carter admitted   I ve looked on a lot of women with lust  I ve committed adultery in my heart many times   47  He remains the only American president to be interviewed by this magazine  As late as January 26  1976  Carter was the first choice of only four percent of Democratic voters  according to a Gallup poll  Yet  by mid March 1976 Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination  he also led President Ford by a few percentage points   according to Shoup  He chose Senator Walter F  Mondale as his running mate  He attacked Washington in his speeches  and offered a religious salve for the nation s wounds  48  Carter began the race with a sizable lead over Ford  who was able to narrow the gap over the course of the campaign  but was unable to prevent Carter from narrowly defeating him on November 2  1976  Carter won the popular vote by 50 1 percent to 48 0 percent for Ford and received 297 electoral votes to Ford s 240  He became the first contender from the Deep South to be elected President since the 1848 election  Presidency Main article  Presidency of Jimmy Carter Jimmy Carter is sworn in as the 39th President of the United States by Chief Justice Warren Burger  January 20  1977  Carter was elected over Gerald Ford in 1976  His tenure was a time of continuing inflation and recession  as well as an energy crisis  On January 7  1980  Carter signed Law H R  5860 aka Public Law 96 185 known as The Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979 bailing out Chrysler Corporation and canceled military pay raises during a time of high inflation and government deficits  While attempting to calm various conflicts around the World  most visibly in the Middle East resulting in the signing of the Camp David Accords  giving back the Panama Canal and signing the SALT II nuclear arms reduction treaty with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev  the final year of his administration was marred by the Iran hostage crisis  which contributed to his losing his 1980 re election campaign to Ronald Reagan  U S  Energy Crisis On April 18  1977 Carter delivered a televised speech declaring that the U S  energy crisis during the 1970s was the moral equivalent of war  Carter encouraged energy conservation by all U S  citizens and installed solar water heating panels on the White House  49  50  and wore sweaters while turning down the heat within the White House  Carter meeting with the Shah of Iran  Mohammad Reza Pahlavi  in Tehran The Shah and Carter EPA Love Canal Superfund In 1978  Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of Love Canal in the city of Niagara Falls  New York  More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood  which was built on top of a toxic waste landfill  The Superfund law was created in response to the situation  Federal disaster money was appropriated to demolish the approximately 500 houses  the 99th Street School  and the 93rd Street School  which were built on top of the dump and to remediate the dump and construct a containment area  This was the first time that such a thing had been done  He then said that there were several more  Love Canals  across the country  and that discovering such dumpsites was  one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era   Deregulation American beer industry U S  President Jimmy Carter signs theAirline Deregulation Act  During 1979  Carter deregulated the American beer industry by opening access of the home brew market back up to the craft brewers  making it again legal to sell malt  hops  and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the effective 1920 beginning of Prohibition in the United States  51  U S  Airline Industry In 1977  President Jimmy Carter appointed Alfred E  Kahn  a professor of economics at Cornell University  to be chair of the CAB  A concerted push for the legislation had developed  drawing on leading economists  leading  think tanks  in Washington  a civil society coalition advocating the reform  patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck and rail reform efforts   the head of the regulatory agency  Senate leadership  the Carter administration  and even some in the airline industry  This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978  The Airline Deregulation Act  Pub L  95 504  is United States enacted federal legislation signed into law by President Carter on October 24  1978  The main purpose of the act was to remove government control over fares  routes and market entry  of new airlines  from commercial aviation  The Civil Aeronautics Board s powers of regulation were to be phased out  eventually allowing passengers to be exposed to market forces in the airline industry  The Act  however  did not remove or diminish the FAA s regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety  U S  Boycott of the Moscow Olympics One of Carter s most bitterly controversial decisions was his boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow in response to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  This marks the only time since the founding of the modern Olympics in 1896 that the United States has ever failed to participate in a Summer or Winter Olympics  The Soviet Union retaliated by boycotting the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and did not withdraw troops from Afghanistan until 1989  eight years after Carter left office   1980 presidential campaign Main article  United States presidential election  1980 The electoral map of the 1980 election Carter wrote that the most intense and mounting opposition to his policies came from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party  which he attributed to Ted Kennedy s ambition to replace him as president  52  Kennedy  originally on board with Carter s health plan  pulled his support from that legislation in the late stages  Carter states that this was in anticipation of Kennedy s own candidacy  and when neither won  the tactic effectively delayed comprehensive health coverage for decades  53  Carter s campaign for re election in 1980 was one of the most difficult  and least successful  in history  He faced strong challenges from the right  Ronald Reagan   the center  John B  Anderson   and the left  Ted Kennedy   He had to run against his own  stagflation  ridden economy  He alienated liberal college students  who were expected to be his base  by re instating registration for the draft  He was defeated by Ronald Reagan  Post Presidency Former President and First Lady Carter wave from their aircraft after the inauguration of Ronald Reagan on January 20  1981  In 1981  Carter returned to Georgia to his peanut farm  which he had placed into a blind trust during his presidency to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest  He found that the trustees had mismanaged the trust  leaving him over one million dollars in debt  In the years that followed  he has led an active life  establishing The Carter Center  building his presidential library  teaching at Emory University in Atlanta  Georgia  and writing numerous books  48  Legacy When he first left office  Carter s presidency was viewed by most as a failure  54  55  56  In historical rankings of US presidents  the Carter presidency has ranged from  19 to  34  Although Carter s presidency received mixed reviews from some historians  his all around peace keeping and humanitarian efforts since he left office have led him to be renowned as one of the most successful ex presidents in US history  57  58  Although Carter has also received mixed reviews in both television and film documentaries  such as the Man from Plains  2007   the 2009 documentary  Back Door Channels  The Price of Peace  credits Carter s efforts at Camp David  which brought peace between Israel and Egypt  with bringing the only meaningful peace to the Middle East  The film opened the 2009 Monte Carlo Television Festival in an invitation only royal screening 59  on June 7  2009 at the Grimaldi Forum in the presence of Albert II  Prince of Monaco  60  Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale are the longest living post presidential team in American history  On December 11  2006  they had been out of office for 25 years and 325 days  surpassing the former record established by President John Adams and Vice President Thomas Jefferson  who both died on July 4  1826  On Friday  September 7  2012  at 11 36 a m  EST  Carter will surpass Herbert Hoover as the President with the longest retirement from the office  Jimmy Carter is one of only four presidents  61  and the only one in modern history  who did not have an opportunity to nominate a judge to serve on the Supreme Court  The other three are William Henry Harrison  Zachary Taylor  and Andrew Johnson  Public image The Independent writes   Carter is widely considered a better man than he was a president   62  While he began his term with a 66  approval rating  63  this had dropped to 34  approval by the time he left office  with 55  disapproving  64  Much of this image in the public eye results from the Presidents proximate to him in history  65  In the wake of Nixon s Watergate Scandal  exit polls from the 1976 Presidential election suggested that many still held Gerald Ford s pardon of Nixon against him  66  and Carter by comparison seemed a sincere  honest  and well meaning Southerner  62  Despite being honest and truthful  Carter s administration suffered from his inexperience in politics  Carter paid too much attention to detail  He frequently backed down from confrontation and was always quick to retreat when under fire from political rivals  He frequently appeared to be indecisive and ineffective  and did not define his priorities clearly  He seemed to be distrustful and uninterested in working with other groups  or even with Congress when controlled by his own party  which he denounced for being controlled by special interest groups  65  Though he made efforts to address many of these issues in 1978  the approval he won from his reforms did not last long  When Carter ran for reelection  Ronald Reagan s nonchalant self confidence contrasted to Carter s serious and introspective temperament  Carter s personal attention to detail  his pessimistic attitude  his seeming indecisiveness and weakness with people was also accentuated by Reagan s charismic charm and easy delegation of tasks to subordinates  65  67  Ultimately  the combination of the economic problems  the Iran hostage crisis  and lack of Washington cooperation made it very easy for Reagan to portray Carter as a weak and ineffectual leader  which resulted in Carter to become the first elected president since 1932 to lose a reelection bid  and his presidency was largely considered to be a failure  Notwithstanding perceptions while Carter was in office  his reputation has much improved  Carter s presidential approval rating  which sat at 31  just prior to the 1980 election  was polled in early 2009 at 64   68  Carter s continued post Presidency activities have also been favorably received  Carter explains that a great deal of this change was owed to Reagan s successor  George H  W  Bush  who actively sought him out and was far more courteous and interested in his advice than Reagan had been  62  Carter Center Main article  Carter Center Jimmy Carter

advance human rights and alleviate unnecessary human suffering  The non profit  nongovernmental Center promotes democracy  mediates and prevents conflicts  and monitors the electoral process in support of free and fair elections  It also works to improve global health through the control and eradication of diseases such as Guinea worm disease  river blindness  malaria  trachoma  lymphatic filariasis  and schistosomiasis  It also works to diminish the stigma of mental illnesses and improve nutrition through increased crop production in Africa  A major accomplishment of The Carter Center has been the elimination of more than 99  of cases of Guinea worm disease  a debilitating parasite that has existed since ancient times  from an estimated 3 5 million cases in 1986 to 3 190 reported cases in 2009  69  The Carter Center has monitored 81 elections in 33 countries since 1989  70  It has worked to resolve conflicts in Haiti  Bosnia  Ethiopia  North Korea  Sudan and other countries  Carter and the Center actively support human rights defenders around the world and have intervened with heads of state on their behalf  Nobel Peace Prize In 2002  President Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work  to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts  to advance democracy and human rights  and to promote economic and social development  through The Carter Center  71  Three sitting presidents  Theodore Roosevelt  Woodrow Wilson and Barack Obama  have received the prize  Carter is unique in receiving the award for his actions after leaving the presidency  He is  along with Martin Luther King  Jr   one of only two native Georgians to receive the Nobel  Diplomacy Foreign trips of Jimmy Carter during his presidency North Korea In 1994  North Korea had expelled investigators from the International Atomic Energy Agency and was threatening to begin processing spent nuclear fuel  In response  then President Clinton pressured for US sanctions and ordered large amounts of troops and vehicles into the area to brace for war  Bill Clinton secretly recruited Carter to undertake a peace mission to North Korea  72  under the guise that it was a private mission of Carter s  Clinton saw Carter as a way to let North Korean President Kim Il sung back down without losing face  73  Carter negotiated an understanding with Kim Il sung  but went further and outlined a treaty  which he announced on CNN without the permission of the Clinton White House as a way to force the US into action  The Clinton Administration signed a later version of the Agreed Framework  under which North Korea agreed to freeze and ultimately dismantle its current nuclear program and comply with its nonproliferation obligations in exchange for oil deliveries  the construction of two light water reactors to replace its graphite reactors  and discussions for eventual diplomatic relations  The agreement was widely hailed at the time as a significant diplomatic achievement  74  In December 2002  the Agreed Framework collapsed as a result of a dispute between the George W  Bush Administration and the North Korean government of Kim Jong il  In 2001  Bush had taken a confrontational position toward North Korea and  in January 2002  named it as part of an  Axis of Evil   Meanwhile  North Korea began developing the capability to enrich uranium  Bush Administration opponents of the Agreed Framework believed that the North Korean government never intended to give up a nuclear weapons program  but supporters believed that the agreement could have been successful and was undermined  75  In August 2010  Carter traveled to North Korea in an attempt to secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes  Gomes  a U S  citizen  was sentenced to eight years of hard labor after being found guilty of illegally entering North Korea  Carter successfully secured the release  76  Middle East Carter and experts from The Carter Center assisted unofficial Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in designing a model agreement for peace  called the Geneva Accord  in 2002 2003  77  Carter has also in recent years become a frequent critic of Israel s policies in Lebanon  West Bank  and Gaza  78  79  In 2006  at the UK Hay Festival  Carter stated that Israel has at least 150 nuclear weapons  He expressed his support for Israel as a country  but criticized its domestic and foreign policy   One of the greatest human rights crimes on earth is the starvation and imprisonment of 1 6m Palestinians   said Carter  He mentioned statistics showing nutritional intake of some Palestinian children was below that of the children of Sub Saharan Africa and described the European position on Israel as  supine   80  In April 2008  the London based Arabic newspaper Al Hayat reported that Carter met with exiled Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal on his visit to Syria  The Carter Center initially did not confirm nor deny the story  The US State Department considers Hamas a terrorist organization  81  Within this Mid East trip  Carter also laid a wreath on the grave of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah on April 14  2008  82  Carter said on April 23 that neither Condoleezza Rice nor anyone else in the State Department had warned him against meeting with Hamas leaders during his trip  83  Carter spoke to Mashaal on several matters  including  formulas for prisoner exchange to obtain the release of Corporal Shalit   84  In May 2007  while arguing that the United States should directly talk to Iran  Carter again stated that Israel has 150 nuclear weapons in its arsenal  85  In December 2008  Carter visited Damascus again  where he met with Syrian President Bashar Assad  and the Hamas leadership  During his visit he gave an exclusive interview to Forward Magazine  the first ever interview for any American president  current or former  with a Syrian media outlet  86  87  Carter visited with three officials from Hamas who have been living at the International Red Cross office in Jerusalem since July 2010  Israel believes that these three Hamas legislators had a role in the 2006 kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit  and has a deportation order set for them  88  Africa Carter held summits in Egypt and Tunisia in 1995 1996 to address violence in the Great Lakes region of Africa  89  Carter played a key role in negotiation of the Nairobi Agreement in 1999 between Sudan and Uganda  90  On July 18  2007  Carter joined Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg  South Africa  to announce his participation in a new humanitarian organization called The Elders  In October 2007  Carter toured Darfur with several of The Elders  including Desmond Tutu  Sudanese security prevented him from visiting a Darfuri tribal leader  leading to a heated exchange  91  On June 18  2007  Carter  accompanied by his wife  arrived in Dublin  Ireland  for talks with President Mary McAleese and Bertie Ahern concerning human rights  On June 19  Carter attended and spoke at the annual Human Rights Forum at Croke Park  An agreement between Irish Aid and The Carter Center was also signed on this day  In November 2008  President Carter  former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan  and Graca Machel  wife of Nelson Mandela  were stopped from entering Zimbabwe  to inspect the human rights situation  by President Robert Mugabe s government  Americas Carter led a mission to Haiti in 1994 with Senator Sam Nunn and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell to avert a US led multinational invasion and restore to power Haiti s democratically elected president  Jean Bertrand Aristide  92  Carter visited Cuba in May 2002 and had full discussions with Fidel Castro and the Cuban government  He was allowed to address the Cuban public uncensored on national television and radio with a speech that he wrote and presented in Spanish  In the speech  he called on the US to end  an ineffective 43 year old economic embargo  and on Castro to hold free elections  improve human rights  and allow greater civil liberties  93  He met with political dissidents  visited the AIDS sanitarium  a medical school  a biotech facility  an agricultural production cooperative  and a school for disabled children  and threw a pitch for an all star baseball game in Havana  The visit made Carter the first President of the United States  in or out of office  to visit the island since the Cuban revolution of 1959  94  Carter observed the Venezuela recall elections on August 15  2004  European Union observers had declined to participate  saying too many restrictions were put on them by the Hugo Ch vez administration  95  A record number of voters turned out to defeat the recall attempt with a 59   no  vote  96  The Carter Center stated that the process  suffered from numerous irregularities   but said it did not observe or receive  evidence of fraud that would have changed the outcome of the vote   97  On the afternoon of August 16  2004  the day after the vote  Carter and Organization of American States  OAS  Secretary General C sar Gaviria gave a joint press conference in which they endorsed the preliminary results announced by the National Electoral Council  The monitors  findings  coincided with the partial returns announced today by the National Elections Council   said Carter  while Gaviria added that the OAS electoral observation mission s members had  found no element of fraud in the process   Directing his remarks at opposition figures who made claims of  widespread fraud  in the voting  Carter called on all Venezuelans to  accept the results and work together for the future   98  A Penn  Schoen  amp  Berland Associates  PSB  exit poll had predicted that Ch vez would lose by 20   when the election results showed him to have won by 20   Schoen commented   I think it was a massive fraud   99 US News and World Report offered an analysis of the polls  indicating  very good reason to believe that the  Penn  Schoen  amp  Berland  exit poll had the result right  and that Ch vez s election officials   and Carter and the American media   got it wrong   The exit poll and the government s programming of election machines became the basis of claims of election fraud  An Associated Press report states that Penn  Schoen  amp  Berland used volunteers from pro recall organization S mate for fieldwork  and its results contradicted five other opposition exit polls  100  Following Ecuador s severing of ties with Colombia in March 2008  Carter brokered a deal for agreement between the countries  respective presidents on the restoration of low level diplomatic relations announced June 8  2008  101  102  Vietnam On November 18  2009  Carter visited Vietnam to build houses for the poor  The one week program  known as Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project 2009  built 32 houses in Dong Xa village  in the northern province of Hai Duong  The project launch was scheduled for November 14  according to the news source which quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga  Administered by the non governmental and non profit Habitat for Humanity International  HFHI   the annual program of 2009 would build and repair 166 homes in Vietnam and some other Asian countries with the support of nearly 3 000 volunteers around the world  the organization said on its website  HFHI has worked in Vietnam since 2001 to provide low cost housing  water  and sanitation solutions for the poor  It has worked in provinces like Tien Giang and Dong Nai as well as Ho Chi Minh City  103  Criticism of US policy In 2001  Carter criticized President Bill Clinton s controversial pardon of Marc Rich  calling it  disgraceful  and suggesting that Rich s financial contributions to the Democratic Party were a factor in Clinton s action  104  Carter has also criticized the presidency of George W  Bush and the Iraq War  In a 2003 New York Times editorial  Carter warned against the consequences of a war in Iraq and urged restraint in use of military force  105  In March 2004  Carter condemned George W  Bush and Tony Blair for waging an unnecessary war  based upon lies and misinterpretations  to oust Saddam Hussein  In August 2006  Carter criticized Blair for being  subservient  to the Bush administration and accused Blair of giving unquestioning support to Bush s Iraq policies  106  In a May 2007 interview with the Arkansas Democrat Gazette  he said   I think as far as the adverse impact on the nation around the world  this administration has been the worst in history   when it comes to foreign affairs  107  108  Two days after the quote was published  Carter told NBC s Today that the  worst in history  comment was  careless or misinterpreted   and that he  wasn t comparing this administration with other administrations back through history  but just with President Nixon s   109  The day after the  worst in history  comment was published  White House spokesman Tony Fratto said that Carter had become  increasingly irrelevant with these kinds of comments   110  On May 19  2007  Mr  Blair made his final visit to Iraq before stepping down as British Prime Minister  and Carter criticized him afterward  Carter told the BBC that Blair was  apparently subservient  to Bush and criticized him for his  blind support  for the Iraq war  111  Carter described Blair s actions as  abominable  and stated that the British Prime Minister s  almost undeviating support for the ill advised policies of President Bush in Iraq have been a major tragedy for the world   Carter said he believes that had Blair distanced himself from the Bush administration during the run up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003  it might have made a crucial difference to American political and public opinion  and consequently the invasion might not have gone ahead  Carter states that  one of the defenses of the Bush administration     has been  okay  we must be more correct in our actions than the world thinks because Great Britain is backing us  So I think the combination of Bush and Blair giving their support to this tragedy in Iraq has strengthened the effort and has made the opposition less effective  and prolonged the war and increased the tragedy that has resulted   Carter expressed his hope that Blair s successor  Gordon Brown  would be  less enthusiastic  about Bush s Iraq policy  111  In June 2005  Carter urged the closing of the Guantanamo Bay Prison in Cuba  which has been a focal point for recent claims of prisoner abuse  112  In September 2006  Carter was interviewed on the BBC s current affairs program Newsnight  voicing his concern at the increasing influence of the Religious Right on US politics  113  Due to his status as former President  Carter was a superdelegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention  Carter announced his endorsement of Senator  now president  Barack Obama  Speaking to the English Monthly Forward magazine of Syria  Carter was asked to give one word that came to mind when mentioning President George W  Bush  His answer was  the end of a very disappointing administration  His reaction to mentioning Barack Obama was  honesty  intelligence  and politically adept  114  In September 2009  he put weight behind allegations by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez  pertaining to United States involvement in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d  tat attempt by a civilian military junta  saying that Washington knew about the coup and may have taken part  115  On June 16  2011  the 40th anniversary of Richard Nixon s official declaration of America s War on Drugs  he wrote an op ed in The New York Times urging the United States and the rest of the world to  Call Off the Global War on Drugs   116  explicitly endorsing the initiative released by the Global Commission on Drug Policy earlier that month and quoting a message he gave to Congress in 1977 saying that   p enalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself   Death penalty Carter continues to speak out against the death penalty in the US and abroad  Most recently  in his letter to the Governor of New Mexico  Bill Richardson  Carter urged him to sign a bill to eliminate the death penalty and institute life in prison without parole instead  New Mexico abolished the death penalty in 2009  Carter wrote  As you know  the United States is one of the few countries  along with nations such as Saudi Arabia  China  and Cuba  which still carry out the death penalty despite the ongoing tragedy of wrongful conviction and gross racial and class based disparities that make impossible the fair implementation of this ultimate punishment  117  Carter also called for commutations of death sentences for many death row inmates  including Brian K  Baldwin  executed in 1999 in Alabama   118 Kenneth Foster  sentence in Texas commuted in 2007  119  120  and Troy Anthony Davis  executed in Georgia in 2011   121  Torture In a 2008 interview with Amnesty International  Carter criticized the alleged use of torture at Guantanamo Bay  saying that it  contravenes the basic principles on which this nation was founded   122  He stated that the next President should publicly apologize upon his inauguration  and state that the United States will  never again torture prisoners   Author Further information  Jimmy Carter bibliography Carter at a book signing in Phoenix  Arizona Carter has been a prolific author in his post presidency  writing 21 of his 23 books  Among these is one he co wrote with his wife  Rosalynn  and a children s book illustrated by his daughter  Amy  They cover a variety of topics  including humanitarian work  aging  religion  human rights  and poetry  Palestine Peace Not Apartheid Main articles  Palestine Peace Not Apartheid and Commentary on Palestine Peace Not Apartheid See also  Israel and the apartheid analogy In a 2007 speech to Brandeis University  Carter stated   I have spent a great deal of my adult life trying to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors  based on justice and righteousness for the Palestinians  These are the underlying purposes of my new book   123  In his book Palestine Peace Not Apartheid  published in November 2006  Carter states  Israel s continued control and colonization of Palestinian land have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the Holy Land  124  He declares that Israel s current policies in the Palestinian territories constitute  a system of apartheid  with two peoples occupying the same land  but completely separated from each other  with Israelis totally dominant and suppressing violence by depriving Palestinians of their basic human rights   124  In an Op Ed titled  Speaking Frankly about Israel and Palestine   published in the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers  Carter states  The ultimate purpose of my book is to present facts about the Middle East that are largely unknown in America  to precipitate discussion and to help restart peace talks  now absent for six years  that can lead to permanent peace for Israel and its neighbors  Another hope is that Jews and other Americans who share this same goal might be motivated to express their views  even publicly  and perhaps in concert  I would be glad to help with that effort  125  While some   such as a former Special Rapporteur for both the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the International Law Commission  as well as a member of the Israeli Knesset   have praised Carter for speaking frankly about Palestinians in Israeli occupied lands  others   including the envoy to the Middle East under Clinton  as well as the first director of the Carter Center 126  127    have accused him of anti Israeli bias  Specifically  these critics have alleged significant factual errors  omissions and misstatements in the book  128  129  The 2007 documentary film  Man from Plains  follows President Carter during his tour for the controversial book and other humanitarian efforts  130  In December 2009  Carter apologized for any words or deeds that may have upset the Jewish community in an open letter meant to improve an often tense relationship  He said he was offering an Al Het  a prayer said on Yom Kippur  the Jewish Day of Atonement  131  Involvement with Bank of Credit and Commerce International After Carter left the presidency  his interest in the developing countries led him to having a close relationship with Agha Hasan Abedi  the founder of Bank of Credit and Commerce International  BCCI   Abedi was a Pakistani  whose bank had offices and business in a large number of developing countries  He was introduced to Carter in 1982 by Bert Lance  one of Carter s closest friends   Unknown to Carter  BCCI had secretly purchased an interest in 1978 in National Bank of Georgia  which had previously been run by Lance and had made loans to Carter s peanut business   Abedi made generous donations to the Carter Center and the Global 2000 Project  Abedi also traveled with Carter to at least seven countries in connection with Carter s charitable activities  The main purpose of Abedi s association with Carter was not charitable activities  but to enhance BCCI s influence  in order to open more offices and develop more business  In 1991  BCCI was seized by regulators  amid allegations of criminal activities  including illegally having control of several U S  banks  Just prior to the seizure  Carter began to disassociate himself from Abedi and the bank  132  Faith  family  and community Carter in Plains  2008 Carter and his wife  Rosalynn  are also well known for their work as volunteers with Habitat for Humanity  a Georgia based philanthropy that

the U S  Secret Service  133  In 2000  Carter severed ties with the Southern Baptist Convention  saying the group s doctrines did not align with his Christian beliefs  134  In April 2006  Carter  former President Bill Clinton and Mercer University President Bill Underwood initiated the New Baptist Covenant  The broadly inclusive movement seeks to unite Baptists of all races  cultures and convention affiliations  Eighteen Baptist leaders representing more than 20 million Baptists across North America backed the group as an alternative to the Southern Baptist Convention  The group held its first meeting in Atlanta  January 30 through February 1  2008  135  Carter s hobbies include painting  136 fly fishing  woodworking  cycling  tennis  and skiing  The Carters have three sons  one

Scott King and  most recently  at the funeral of his former political rival  but later his close  personal friend and diplomatic collaborator  Gerald Ford  Race in politics Carter ignited debate in September 2009 when he stated   I think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Barack Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man  that he is African American   144  145  Obama disagreed with Carter s assessment  On CNN Obama stated   Are there people out there who don t like me because of race  I m sure there are   that s not the overriding issue here   146  2012 Presidential race In the Republican party 2012 Presidential primary  Carter endorsed former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in mid September  not because he supports Romney  but

president s re election  148  Funeral and burial plans Carter intends to be buried in front of his home in Plains  Georgia  In contrast  most Presidents since Herbert Hoover have been buried at their
