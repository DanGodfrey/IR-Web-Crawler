launch  CNN was the first channel to provide 24 hour television news coverage  3  and the first all news television channel in the United States  4  While the news channel has numerous affiliates  CNN primarily broadcasts from its headquarters at the CNN Center in Atlanta  the Time Warner Center in New York City  and studios in Washington  D C   and Los Angeles  CNN is owned by parent company Time Warner  and the U S  news channel is a division of the Turner Broadcasting System  5  CNN is sometimes referred to as CNN U S  to distinguish the American channel from its international counterpart  CNN International  As of August 2010  CNN is available in over 100 million U S  households  6  Broadcast coverage extends to over 890 000 American hotel rooms  6  and the U S broadcast is also shown in Canada  Globally  CNN programming airs through CNN International  which can be seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories  7  Starting late 2010  the domestic version CNN U S   is available in high definition to viewers in Japan under the name CNN HD  Contents 1 History 1 1 Early history 1 2 Major events 1 2 1 Challenger disaster 1 2 2 Baby Jessica rescue 1 2 3 Gulf War 1 2 3 1

Worldwide 8 Controversy 9 See also 10 References 11 External links History Early history Main article  History of CNN  1980 2003  CNN s first broadcast with David Walker and Lois Hart on June 1  1980  The Cable News Network was launched at 5 00 p m  EST on Sunday June 1  1980  After an introduction by Ted Turner  the husband and wife team of David Walker and Lois Hart anchored the first newscast  8 Burt Reinhardt  the then executive vice president of CNN  hired most of CNN s first 200 employees  including the network s first news anchor  Bernard Shaw  9  Since its debut  CNN has expanded its reach to a number of cable and satellite television companies  several websites  and specialized closed circuit channels  such as CNN Airport Network   The company has 36 bureaus  10 domestic  26 international   more than 900 affiliated local stations  and several regional and foreign language networks around the world  The channel s success made a bona fide mogul of founder Ted Turner and set the stage for the Time Warner conglomerate s eventual acquisition of Turner Broadcasting  A companion channel  CNN2  was launched on January 1  1982 and featured a continuous 24 hour cycle of 30 minute news broadcasts  A year later  it changed its name to  CNN Headline News   and eventually it was simply called  Headline News    In 2005  Headline News would break from its original format with the addition of Headline Prime  a prime time programming block that features news commentary  and in 2008 the channel changed its name again  to  HLN    Major events Replica of the newsroom at CNN Center  Challenger disaster On January 28  1986  CNN carried the only live television coverage of the launch and subsequent explosion of Space Shuttle Challenger  which killed the seven crew members  Baby Jessica rescue On October 14  1987  an 18 month old toddler named Jessica McClure fell down a well in Midland  Texas  CNN was quickly on the spot  and the event helped make their name  The New York Times ran a retrospective article in 1995 on the impact of live video news   If a picture is worth a thousand words  then a moving picture is worth many times that  and a live moving picture makes an emotional connection that goes deeper than logic and lasts well beyond the actual event  This was before correspondents reported live from the enemy capital while American bombs were falling  Before Saddam Hussein held a surreal press conference with a few of the hundreds of Americans he was holding hostage  Before the nation watched  riveted but powerless  as Los Angeles was looted and burned  Before O  J  Simpson took a slow ride in a white Bronco  and before everyone close to his case had an agent and a book contract  This was uncharted territory just a short time ago   10  Gulf War The first Persian Gulf War in 1991 was a watershed event for CNN that catapulted the channel past the  big three  American networks for the first time in its history  largely due to an unprecedented  historical scoop  CNN was the only news outlet with the ability to communicate from inside Iraq during the initial hours of the Coalition bombing campaign  with live reports from the al Rashid Hotel in Baghdad by reporters Bernard Shaw  John Holliman  and Peter Arnett  Operation Desert Storm as captured live on a CNN night vision camera with reporters narrating  The moment when bombing began was announced on CNN by Bernard Shaw on January 16  1991 as follows  11    This is Bernie Shaw  Something is happening outside   Peter Arnett  join me here  Let s describe to our viewers what we re seeing   The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated   We re seeing bright flashes going off all over the sky    CNN s coverage of the initial hours of the Gulf War was carried by TV stations and networks around the world  resulting in CNN being watched by over a billion viewers worldwide    a feat that led to the subsequent creation of CNN International  The Gulf War experience brought CNN some much sought after legitimacy and made household names of previously obscure reporters  Many of these reporters now comprise CNN s  old guard   Bernard Shaw became CNN s chief anchor until his retirement in 2001  Others include then Pentagon correspondent Wolf Blitzer  now host of The Situation Room  and international correspondent Christiane Amanpour  Amanpour s presence in Iraq was caricatured by actress Nora Dunn as the ruthless reporter  Adriana Cruz  in the film Three Kings  1999   Time Warner later produced a television movie  Live from Baghdad  about the channel s coverage of the first Gulf War  which aired on HBO  CNN effect Coverage of the first Gulf War and other crises of the early 1990s  particularly the infamous Battle of Mogadishu  led officials at the Pentagon to coin the term  the CNN effect  to describe the perceived impact of real time  24 hour news coverage on the decision making processes of the American government  September 11 attacks CNN breaking the news about the September 11 attacks  CNN was the first channel to break the news of the September 11 attacks  12 Anchor Carol Lin was on the air to deliver the first public report of the event  She broke into a commercial at 8 49 a m  ET and said    This just in  You are looking at obviously a very disturbing live shot there  That is the World Trade Center  and we have unconfirmed reports this morning that a plane has crashed into one of the towers of the World Trade Center  CNN Center right now is just beginning to work on this story  obviously calling our sources and trying to figure out exactly what happened  but clearly something relatively devastating happening this morning there on the south end of the island of Manhattan  That is once again  a picture of one of the towers of the World Trade Center    Sean Murtagh  CNN vice president of finance and administration  was the first network employee on the air  He called into CNN Center from his office at CNN New York bureau and said that a commercial jet hit the Trade Center  13  Daryn Kagan and Leon Harris were live on the air just after 9 a m  ET as the second plane hit the World Trade Center and through an interview with CNN correspondent David Ensor  reported the news that U S  officials determined  that this is a terrorist act   14  Later  Aaron Brown anchored through the day and night as the attacks unfolded  Brown had just come to CNN from ABC to be the breaking news anchor  Paula Zahn assisted in the September 11  2001  coverage on her first day as a CNN reporter  a fact that she mentioned as a guest clue presenter on a 2005 episode of Jeopardy   CNN has made archival files of much of the day s broadcast available in five segments plus an overview  2008 U S  election The stage for the second 2008 CNN YouTube presidential debate  Leading up to the 2008 U S  presidential election  CNN devoted large amounts of coverage to politics  including hosting candidate debates during the Democratic and Republican primary seasons  On June 3 and June 5  CNN teamed up with Saint Anselm College to sponsor the New Hampshire Republican and Democratic Debates  15  Later in 2007  the channel hosted the first CNN YouTube presidential debates  a non traditional format where viewers were invited to pre submit questions over the internet via the YouTube video sharing service  16  In 2008  CNN partnered with The Los Angeles Times to host two primary debates leading up to its coverage of Super Tuesday  17  CNN s debate and election night coverage led to its highest ratings of the year  with January 2008 viewership averaging 1 1 million viewers  a 41  increase over the previous year  17  Programming Current shows Weekdays ET Program Host s  Location Description 4a 5a World Business Today Andrew

presentation In December 2008  CNN introduced its new graphics package  a comprehensive redesign replacing the existing style that had been used since 2004  22  The design replaced the scrolling ticker that had been in use since 2001  Also  since March 1  2009  the redundant CNN HD logo has been missing from the bottom left corner of the screen  CNN s new graphic design is similar to its sister channel  CNN International  The CNN logo itself has remained relatively unchanged since the channel s launch  except that it was originally displayed in yellow  On January 10  2011  CNN introduced its most recent graphics package  in conjunction with the network wide switch to a 16 9 letterbox format from 4 3  Both of CNN s standard definition and high definition feeds now carry the same 16 9 format  however  video footage broadcast in standard definition on either feed is not pillarboxed  resulting in black bars on the top and bottom of the screen as well as the left and right  World Business Today and World One  which both began to be simulcast from CNN International on January 17  2011  are however both broadcast in the 4 3 picture format on the CNN SD feed  Former

site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world  The widespread growth of blogs  social media and user generated content have influenced the site  and blogs in particular have focused CNN s previously scattershot online offerings  most noticeably in the development and launch of CNN Pipeline in late 2005  In April 2009  CNN com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U S  according to Nielsen NetRatings  with an increase of 11  over the previous year  34  CNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service  its corresponding website  and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources  or  pipes    on demand access to CNN stories and reports  and optional pop up  news alerts  to computer users  The installable client was available to users of PCs running Microsoft Windows  There was also a browser based  web client  that did not require installation  In July 2007 the service was discontinued and replaced with a free streaming service  The now defunct topical news program Judy Woodruff s Inside Politics was the first CNN program to feature a round up of blogs in 2005  35  Blog coverage was expanded when Inside Politics was folded into The Situation Room  In 2006 CNN launched CNN Exchange and CNN iReport  initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from blogging to citizen journalism within the CNN brand  CNN iReport which features user submitted photos and video  has achieved considerable traction  with increasingly professional looking reports filed by amateur journalists  many still in high school or college  The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the

Awards for development and implementation of an integrated and portable IP based live  edit and store and forward digital news gathering  DNG  system  40  The first use of what would later win CNN

Hainan Island incident  The technology consisted of a videophone produced by 7E Communications Ltd of London  UK  43  This DNG workflow is used today by the network to receive material world wide

Brazil Santiago of Chile  Chile S o Paulo  Brazil Seoul  South Korea Sydney  Australia Tokyo  Japan In parts of the world without a CNN bureau  the network will use local affiliate station reports will be used to file a story  Controversy Main article  CNN controversies In a joint study by the Joan Shorenstein Center on Press  Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University and the Project for Excellence in Journalism  the authors found disparate treatment by the three major cable channels of Republican and Democratic candidates during the earliest five months of presidential primaries in 2007   The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates by a margin of three to one  Four in ten stories  41   were clearly negative while just 14  were positive and 46  were neutral  The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst  63  negative  and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral  It s not that Democrats  other than Obama  fared well on CNN either  Nearly half of the Illinois Senator s stories were positive  46    vs  just 8  that were negative  But both Clinton and Edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall  So while coverage for Democrats overall was a bit more positive than negative  that was almost all due to extremely favorable coverage for Obama   51  CNN has been accused of perpetrating media bias for allegedly promoting both a conservative and a liberal agenda based on previous incidents  Accuracy in Media and the Media Research Center have claimed that CNN s reporting contains liberal editorializing within news stories  52  53  CNN is one of the world s largest news organizations  and its international channel  CNN International is the leading international news channel in terms of viewer reach  54  55  Unlike the BBC and its network of reporters and bureaus  CNN International makes extensive use of affiliated reporters that are local to  and often directly affected by  the events they are reporting  The effect is a more immediate  less detached style of on the ground coverage  This has done little to stem criticism  largely from Middle Eastern nations  that CNN International reports news from a pro American perspective  This is a marked contrast to domestic criticisms that often portray CNN as having a  liberal  or  anti American  bias  In 2002  Honest Reporting spearheaded a campaign to expose CNN for pro Palestinian bias  citing public remarks in which Ted Turner equated Palestinian suicide bombing with Israeli military strikes  56  Chicago Sun Times  June 5  2007  As said by Ted Turner  founder of CNN   There really isn t much of a point getting some Tom  Dick or Harry off the streets to report on when we can snag a big name whom everyone identifies with  After all  it s all part of the business   However  in April 2008  Turner criticized the direction CNN has taken  57  Others have echoed that criticism  especially in light of CNN s drop in the ratings  A Chinese website  anti cnn com  58  has accused CNN and western media in general of biased reporting against China  with the catch phrase  Don t be so CNN  catching on in the Chinese mainstream as jokingly meaning  Don t be so biased   Pictures used by CNN are allegedly edited to have completely different meanings from the original ones  In addition  the channel was accused of largely ignoring pro China voices during the Olympic Torch Relay in San Francisco  On April 24  2008 beautician Liang Shubing and teacher Li Lilan sued commentator Jack Cafferty and CNN  1 3 billion damages   1 per person in China   in New York  for  violating the dignity and reputation of the Chinese people   This was in response to an incident during CNN s  The Situation Room  on April 9  where Cafferty stated his opinion that   the USA  continue to import their junk with the lead paint on them and the poisoned pet food  despite his view that   the Chinese leaders were  basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they ve been for the last 50 years   Further  amid China s Foreign Ministry demand for an apology  14 lawyers filed a similar suit in Beijing  59  60  In June 2009  musician M I A  stated she did an hour long interview with CNN condemning the mass bombing and Tamil civilian fatalities at the hands of Government forces in Sri Lanka in 16 weeks the same year   and they cut it down to one minute and made it about my single  Paper Planes   When I went to the Grammys  I saw the same reporter from CNN  and I was like   Why did you do that   And she said   Because you used the G word    Genocide  I guess you re not allowed to say that on CNN   raising questions concerning CNN s coverage and commitment to free speech  61  62  On November 11  2009  longtime CNN anchor Lou Dobbs resigned on air  He didn t explain why in his exit speech but it has been reported that he was bothered by a memo that ordered anchors to stop allowing Obama birthers airtime  63  On July 7  2010  Octavia Nasr  senior Middle East editor and a CNN journalist for 20 years  was fired after she expressed on her Twitter account admiration for a liberal minded Muslim cleric who had recently died  casting doubts on the company s commitment to freedom of speech  64  On October 1  2010  CNN anchor Rick Sanchez was fired after remarks he made during an interview with comedian Pete Dominick at a radio show the previous day about prejudices he faced during his television career  at CNN and jokes about him by comedian Jon Stewart  Calling him a  bigot  before retracting this and describing him instead as  prejudiced  and  uninformed   the interviewer invoked Stewart s faith as an example of how Stewart was  a minority as much as you are   Sanchez stated his view that Jewish people were not an oppressed minority in America  and his view that  everybody that runs CNN is a lot like Stewart  before stating  And a lot of people who run all the other networks are a lot like Stewart   65  See also Journalism portal Companies portal Atlanta portal Georgia  U S  state  portal
