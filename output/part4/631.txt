Abortion in the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Abortion in the United States has been legal in every state since the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v  Wade  Prior to  Roe   the legality of abortion was decided by the states  it was illegal in 30 states and legal under certain cases in 20 states  Roe established that  the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision  but that this right is not unqualified  and must be considered against important state interests in regulation    1  Roe established a  trimester  system of increasing state interest in the life of the fetus corresponding to the fetus s increasing  viability   likelihood of survival outside the uterus  over the course of a pregnancy  such that states were prohibited from banning abortion early in pregnancy but allowed to impose increasing restrictions or outright bans later in pregnancy  That decision was modified by the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v  Casey  which upheld the  central holding  in Roe that there is a fundamental right to privacy encompassing the decision about abortion  but replacing the trimester system with the point of fetal viability  whenever it may occur  as defining a state s right to override the woman s autonomy  Casey also lowered the legal standard to which states would be held in justifying restrictions imposed on a woman s rights  Roe had held this to be  strict scrutiny    the traditional Supreme Court test for impositions upon fundamental Constitutional rights   whereas Casey created a new standard referring to  undue burden   specifically to balance the state s and the woman s interests in the case of abortion  Before Roe v  Wade  abortion was legal in several areas of the country  but that decision imposed a uniform framework for state legislation on the subject  and established a minimal period during which abortion must be legal  under greater or lesser degrees of restriction throughout the pregnancy   That basic framework  modified in Casey  remains nominally in place  although the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state  Abortion remains one of the most controversial topics in United States culture and politics  Contents 1 Terminology 2 History 2 1 Abortion before Roe 2 2 Roe v  Wade 2 2 1 Jane Roe and Mary Doe 2 3 Later judicial decisions 3 Current

refer to a miscarriage or a premature birth that does not result in a live infant  Such events are often called spontaneous abortions if they occur before 20 weeks of gestation  In common parlance  however  abortion is used to mean  induced abortion  of an embryo or fetus at any point in pregnancy  and this is also how the term is used in a legal sense  2   edit  History  edit  Abortion before

likely damaged fetus  13    Legal on request  4  There were few laws on abortion in the United States at the time of independence  except the English common law adopted into United States law by Acts of Reception  which held abortion to be legally acceptable if occurring before quickening  James Wilson  a framer of the U S  Constitution  explained as follows    With consistency  beautiful and undeviating  human life  from its commencement to its close  is protected by the common law  In the contemplation of law  life begins when the infant is first able to stir in the womb  By the law  life is protected not only from immediate destruction  but from every degree of actual violence  and  in some cases  from every degree of danger  3    Various statutes against abortion began to appear in the 1820s  In 1821  Connecticut passed a statute targeting apothecaries who sold poisons to women for purposes of abortion  and New York made post quickening abortions a felony and pre quickening abortions a misdemeanor eight years later  It is sometimes argued that the early American abortion statutes were motivated not by ethical concerns about abortion but by worry about the safety of the procedure  however  some legal theorists believe that this theory is inconsistent with the fact that abortion was punishable regardless of whether any harm befell the pregnant woman and the fact that many of the early statutes punished not only the doctors or abortionists  but also punished the women who hired them  4  The criminalization movement accelerated during the 1860s  and by 1900 abortion was largely illegal in every state  Some states did include provisions allowing for abortion in limited circumstances  generally to protect the woman s life or pregnancies due to rape or incest  Abortions continued to occur  however  and increasingly became readily available  In the 1930s  licensed physicians performed an estimate 800 000 abortions a year  5  Illegal abortions were often unsafe  sometimes resulting in death  as in the case of Gerri Santoro of Connecticut in 1964  Some activist groups developed their own skills to provide abortions to women who could not obtain them elsewhere  As an example  in Chicago  a group known as  Jane  operated a floating abortion clinic throughout much of the 1960s  Women seeking the procedure would call a designated number and be given instructions on how to find  Jane   6  In 1965  following the Supreme Court s decision in Griswold v  Connecticut declaring a constitutional right to contraceptives  the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  ACOG  issued a medical bulletin accepting a recommendation from 6 years earlier which clarified that conception is implantation  not fertilization  This had the consequence of categorizing birth control methods that prevented implantation as contraceptives  not abortifacients  In 1967  Colorado became the first state to legalize abortion in cases of rape  incest  or in which pregnancy would lead to permanent physical disability of the woman  Similar laws were passed in California  Oregon  and North Carolina  In 1970  New York repealed its 1830 law and allowed abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy  Similar laws were soon passed in Alaska  Hawaii  and Washington  A law in Washington  DC  which allowed abortion to protect the life or health of the woman  was challenged in the Supreme Court in 1971 in United States v  Vuitch  The court upheld the law  deeming that  health  meant  psychological and physical well being   essentially allowing abortion in Washington  DC  By the end of 1972  13 states had a law similar to that of Colorado  while Mississippi allowed abortion in cases of rape or incest only and Alabama and Massachusetts allowed abortions only in cases where the womans s physical health was endangered  In order to obtain abortions during this period  women would often travel from a state where abortion was illegal to states where it was legal   edit  Roe v  Wade Main article  Roe v  Wade The United States Supreme Court membership in 1973  In deciding Roe v  Wade  the Supreme Court ruled that a Texas statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional  The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the right to privacy  In its opinion it listed several landmark cases where the court had previously found a right to privacy implied by the Constitution  The Court did not recognize a right to abortion in all cases  State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications  If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability  it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period  except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother  7  The Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion  The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability  a point to be determined by the abortion doctor  After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons  which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well being  A central issue in the Roe case  and in the wider abortion debate in general  is whether human life or personhood begins at conception  birth  or at some point in between  The Court declined to make an attempt at resolving this issue  noting   We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins  When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine  philosophy  and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus  the judiciary  at this point in the development of man s knowledge  is not in a position to speculate as to the answer   Instead  it chose to point out that historically  under English and American common law and statutes   the unborn have never been recognized    as persons in the whole sense  and thus the fetuses are not legally entitled to the protection afforded by the right to life specifically enumerated in the Fourteenth Amendment  So rather than asserting that human life begins at any specific point  the court simply declared that the State has a  compelling interest  in protecting  potential life  at the point of viability   edit  Jane Roe and Mary Doe  Jane Roe  of the landmark Roe v  Wade lawsuit  whose real name is Norma McCorvey  is now a pro life advocate  McCorvey writes that she never had the abortion and became the  pawn  of two young and ambitious lawyers who were looking for a plaintiff who they could use to challenge the Texas state law prohibiting abortion  However  attorney Linda Coffee says she doesn t remember McCorvey having any hesitancy about wanting an abortion  8   Mary Doe  of the companion Doe v  Bolton lawsuit  the mother of three whose real name is Sandra Cano  maintains that she never wanted or had an abortion and that she is  ninety nine percent certain that  she  did not sign  the affidavit to initiate the suit  9   edit  Later judicial decisions In the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v  Casey  the Court abandoned Roe s strict trimester framework  10  Instead adopting the standard of undue burden for evaluating state abortion restrictions  11  but reemphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of liberty and privacy protected under the constitution   Constitutional protection of the woman s decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  It declares that no State shall  deprive any person of life  liberty  or property  without due process of law   The controlling word in the cases before us is  liberty   12  The Supreme Court continues to grapple with cases on the subject  On April 18  2007 it issued a ruling in the case of Gonzales v  Carhart  involving a federal law entitled the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 which President George W  Bush had signed into law  The law banned intact dilation and extraction  which opponents of abortion rights referred to as  partial birth abortion   and stipulated that anyone breaking the law would get a prison sentence up to 2 5 years  The United States Supreme Court upheld the 2003 ban by a narrow majority of 5 4  marking the first time the Court has allowed a ban on any type of abortion since 1973  The swing vote  which came from moderate justice Anthony Kennedy  was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia  Clarence Thomas  and the two recent appointees  Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts   edit  Current legal situation  edit  Nationwide Since 1995  led by Congressional Republicans  the U S  House of Representatives and U S  Senate have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure of intact dilation and extraction  also commonly known as partial birth abortion  After several long and emotional debates on the issue  such measures passed twice by wide margins  but President Bill Clinton vetoed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions  Congressional supporters of the bill argue that a health exception would render the bill unenforceable  since the Doe v  Bolton decision defined  health  in vague terms  justifying any motive for obtaining an abortion  Subsequent Congressional attempts at overriding the veto were unsuccessful  On October 2  2003  with a vote of 281 142  the House again approved a measure banning the procedure  called the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act  Through this legislation  a doctor could face up to two years in prison and face civil lawsuits for performing such an abortion  A woman who undergoes the procedure cannot be prosecuted under the measure  The measure contains an exemption to allow the procedure if the woman s life is threatened  On October 21  2003  the United States Senate passed the same bill by a vote of 64 34  with a number of Democrats joining in support  The bill was signed by President George W  Bush on November 5  2003  but a federal judge blocked its enforcement in several states just a few hours after it became public law  The Supreme Court upheld the nationwide ban on the procedure in the case Gonzales v  Carhart on April 18  2007  signaling a substantial change in the Court s approach to abortion law  13  The 5 4 ruling said the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act does not conflict with previous Court decisions regarding abortion  The current judicial interpretation of the U S  Constitution regarding abortion in the United States  following the Supreme Court of the United States s 1973 landmark decision in Roe v  Wade  and subsequent companion decisions  is that abortion is legal but may be restricted by the states to varying degrees  States have passed laws to restrict late term abortions  require parental notification for minors  and mandate the disclosure of abortion risk information to patients prior to the procedure  14  The key  deliberated article of the U S  Constitution is the Fourteenth Amendment  which states that   All persons born or naturalized in the United States  and subject to the jurisdiction thereof  are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside  No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States  nor shall any State deprive any person of life  liberty  or property  without due process of law  nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws  15    The official report of the U S  Senate Judiciary Committee  issued in 1983 after extensive hearings on the Human Life Amendment  proposed by Senators Orrin Hatch and Thomas Eagleton   stated what substantially remains true today    Thus  the  Judiciary  Committee observes that no significant legal barriers of any kind whatsoever exist today in the United States for a mother to obtain an abortion for any reason during any stage of her pregnancy  16    One aspect of the legal abortion regime now in place has been determining when the fetus is  viable  outside the womb as a measure of when the  life  of the fetus is its own  and therefore subject to being protected by the state   In the majority opinion delivered by the court in Roe v  Wade  viability was defined as  potentially able to live outside the mother s womb  albeit with artificial aid  Viability is usually placed at about seven months  28 weeks  but may occur earlier  even at 24 weeks   When the court ruled in 1973  the then current medical technology suggested that viability could occur as early as 24 weeks  Advances over the past three decades have allowed fetuses that are a few weeks less than 24 weeks old to survive outside the mother s womb  These scientific achievements  while life saving for premature babies  have made the determination of being  viable  somewhat more complicated  As of 2006  the youngest child to survive a premature birth in the United States was a girl born at the Baptist Hospital of Miami at 21 weeks and 6 days  gestational age  17  Because of the split between federal and state law  legal access to abortion continues to vary somewhat by state  Geographic availability  however  varies dramatically  with 87 percent of U S  counties having no abortion provider  18  Moreover  due to the Hyde Amendment  many state health programs do not cover abortions  currently 17 states  including California  Illinois and New York  offer or require such coverage  19  The legality of abortion in the United States is frequently a major issue in nomination battles for the U S  Supreme Court  However  nominees typically remain silent on the issue during their hearings  because it is an issue that may come before them as judges  The Unborn Victims of Violence Act  commonly known as  Laci and Conner s Law  was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush on April 1  2004  allowing two charges to be filed against someone who kills a pregnant mother  one for the mother and one for the fetus   It specifically bans charges against the mother and or doctor relating to abortion procedures  Nevertheless  it has generated much controversy among pro choice advocates  They view it as a potential step in the direction of banning abortion   edit  State by state legal status Main article  Abortion in the United States by state Various states have passed legislation on the subject of feticide  On March 6  2006  South Dakota Governor Mike Rounds signed into law a pro life statute which made performing abortions a felony  and that law was subsequently repealed in a November 7  2006 referendum  20  On February 27  2006  Mississippi s House Public Health Committee voted to approve a ban on abortion  and that bill died after the House and Senate failed to agree on compromise legislation  21  Several states have enacted  trigger laws  which  would take effect if Roe v  Wade is overturned   22 North Dakota HB 1572 or the Personhood of Children Act  which passed the North Dakota House of Representatives on February 18  2009  but was later defeated in the North Dakota Senate  aimed to allocate rights to  the pre born  partially born   and if passed  would likely have been used to challenge Roe v  Wade  23  On February 15  2012  the Virginia House of Delegates passed House Bill 1 in a vote of 66 32  that effectively outlaws all Virginia abortions by declaring that the rights of persons apply from the moment sperm and egg unite  It also passed a second bill in a 63 36 vote  that requires women to have a transvaginal ultrasound before undergoing abortions  24  In addition  some states have been seeking to ban abortion by means of an amendment to the state constitution  Three such amendments have already reached the ballot for a vote  Colorado citizens voted on Amendment 48 on November 4  2008  and it failed to pass  with 73 21  voting against it and 26 79  voting for it  25  A similar initiative  Amendment 62  made the Colorado ballot on November 2  2010  where it failed against  this time 70 53  to 29 47   26  On November 8  2011 Initiative 26 appeared on the ballot  where it was defeated 57 87  to 42 13   27  All three of these amendments made it to the ballot through a citizen initiative process  as opposed to being referred to the ballot by their state legislatures  These amendments  dubbed  personhood amendments   have so far contained far reaching language that beyond simply banning abortion  They define personhood as beginning from the moment of conception and or fertilization  which would potentially outlaw forms of birth control that involve destroying the fetus  in addition to potentially banning in vitro fertilization  The umbrella organization Personhood USA  based in Colorado and founded by Keith Mason  was responsible for getting Amendments 48 and 62 onto the ballot in Colorado  28  They plan to get another amendment onto the ballot in 2012  this time with slightly revised wording composed by legal analyst Gualberto Garcia Jones  Personhood USA also plans on pushing for such amendments in Montana and Oregon  29  Voter opposition to these ballot initiatives has proven to be far stronger than the support  despite the fact that American citizens poll as being much more evenly divided on the issue of abortion  Other states are considering personhood amendments banning abortion  some through legislative methods and others through citizen initiative campaigns  Among these states are Florida  Ohio  Georgia  Texas  and Arkansas  30  31  32   edit  Statistics Main article  Abortion statistics in the United States Because reporting of abortions is not mandatory  statistics are of varying reliability  The Centers For Disease Control  CDC  33  regularly compiles these statistics   edit  Number of abortions in United States According to the Centers for Disease Control  CDC   since 1973  roughly 50 million legal induced abortions have been performed in the United States  34  Histogram of the reported abortion rate per 1 000 live births in 2005 for residents in each of the United States except California  Florida  New Hampshire  and Louisiana 35   edit  Mifepristone RU 486 The use of the abortifacient Mifepristone is reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a  medical  nonsurgical  procedures  in the abortion surveillance reports  Medical nonsurgical abortions

Institute survey of abortion providers estimated that medical nonsurgical abortions accounted for 13  of total abortions in the United States in 2005  37   edit  Abortions and ethnicity Abortion rates are much more common among minority women in the U S  In 2000 2001  the rates among black and Hispanic women were 49 per 1 000 and 33 per 1 000  respectively  vs  13 per 1 000 among non Hispanic white women  Note that this figure includes all women of reproductive age  including women that are not pregnant  In other words  these abortion rates reflect the rate at which U S  women of reproductive age have an abortion each year  38  In 2004  the rates of abortion by ethnicity in the U S  were 50 abortions per 1 000 black women  28 abortions per 1 000 Hispanic women  and 11 abortions per 1 000 white women  39   edit  Reasons for abortions Another study  in 1998  revealed that in 1987 1988 women reported the following as their primary reasons for choosing an abortion  40  25 9  Want to postpone childbearing 21 3  Cannot afford a baby 14 1  Has relationship problem or partner does not want pregnancy 12 2  Too young  parent s  or other s  object to pregnancy 10 8  Having a child will disrupt education or job 7 9  Want no  more  children 3 3  Risk to fetal health 2 8  Risk to maternal health 2 1  Other According to a 1987 study that included specific data about late abortions  i e  abortions  at 16 or more weeks  gestation    41  women reported that various reasons contributed to their having a late abortion  71  Woman didn t recognize she was pregnant or misjudged gestation 48  Woman found it hard to make arrangements for abortion 33  Woman was afraid to tell her partner or parents 24  Woman took time to decide to have an abortion 8  Woman waited for her relationship to change 8  Someone pressured woman not to have abortion 6  Something changed after woman became pregnant 6  Woman didn t know timing is important 5  Woman didn t know she could get an abortion 2  A fetal problem was diagnosed late in pregnancy 11  Other  In 2000  cases of rape or incest accounted for 1  of abortions  42  A 2004 study by the Guttmacher Institute reported that women listed the following amongst their reasons for choosing to have an abortion   43  74  Having a baby would dramatically change my life 73  Can t afford a baby now 48  Don t want to be a single mother or having relationship problems 38  Have completed my childbearing 32  Not ready for a nother  child 25  Don t want people to know I had sex or got pregnant 22  Don t feel mature enough to raise a nother  child

Societal attitudes towards abortion Generally speaking  in the United States induced abortions become more controversial the later they are performed into the pregnancy  Gallup notes that abortion attitudes are shifting  Gallup declared in May 2010 that more Americans identifying as  pro life  is  the new normal   while also noting that there had been no increase in opposition to abortion  It suggested that political polarization may have prompted more Republicans to call themselves  pro life   46  The terms  pro choice  and  pro life  do not always reflect a political view or fall along a

Further  the survey found that 85  of Americans polled supported abortion in cases of risk to a woman s physical health  54  if the woman s mental health was at risk  and 66  if a congenital abnormality was detected in the fetus  53  A July 2002 Public Agenda poll found that 44  of men and 42  of women thought that  abortion should be generally available to those who want it   34  of men and 35  of women thought that  abortion should be available  but under stricter than limits it is now   and 21  of men and 22  of women thought that  abortion should not be permitted   54  A January 2003 ABC News Washington Post poll also examined attitudes towards abortion by gender  In answer to the question   On the subject of abortion  do you think abortion should be legal in all cases  legal in most cases  illegal in most cases or illegal in all cases    25  of women responded that it should be legal in  all cases   33  that it should be legal in  most cases   23  that it should be illegal in  most cases   and 17  that it should be illegal in  all cases   20  of men thought it should be legal in  all cases   34  legal in  most cases   27  illegal in  most cases   and 17  illegal in  all cases   54  Most Fox News viewers favor both parental notification as well as parental consent  when a minor seeks an abortion  A Fox News poll in 2005 found that 78  of people favor a notification requirement  and 72  favor a consent requirement  55  An April 2006 Harris poll on Roe v  Wade  asked   In 1973  the U S  Supreme Court decided that states  laws which made it illegal for a woman to have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy were unconstitutional  and that the decision on whether a woman should have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy should be left to the woman and her doctor to decide  In general  do you favor or oppose this part of the U S  Supreme Court decision making abortions up to three months of pregnancy legal    to which 49  of respondents indicated favor while 47  indicated opposition  The Harris organization has concluded from this poll that  49 percent now support Roe vs  Wade   56  Two polls were released in May 2007 asking Americans  With respect to the abortion issue  would you consider yourself to be pro choice or pro life   May 4 through 6th  a CNN poll found 45  said pro choice and 50  said pro life  57  Within the following week  a Gallup poll found 50  responding pro choice and 44  pro life  58   edit  Partial birth abortion See also  Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act  Partial Birth  abortion is a non medical term for a procedure called intact dilation and extraction used by those who oppose the procedure due to the opinion that the fetus has developed  A Rasmussen Reports poll four days after the Supreme Court s opinion in Gonzales v  Carhart found that 40  of respondents  knew the ruling allowed states to place some restrictions on specific abortion procedures   Of those who knew of the decision  56  agreed with the decision and 32  were opposed  59  An ABC poll from 2003 found that 62  of respondents thought  partial birth abortion  should be illegal  a similar number of respondents wanted an exception  if it would prevent a serious threat to the woman s health   Additional polls from 2003 found between 47 70  in favor of banning this type of abortion and between 25 40  opposed  60  Gallup has repeatedly queried the American public on this issue  as seen on its  Abortion  page 50   Legislation 2003 2000 2000 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 A law which would make it illegal to perform a specific abortion procedure conducted in the last six months  or second and or third trimester  of pregnancy known by some opponents as a  partial birth abortion   except in cases necessary to save the life of the mother 70  63  66  64  61  61  55  57   edit  Abortion financing The cost of an abortion varies depending on factors such as location  facility  timing  and type of procedure  In 2005  a nonhospital abortion at 10 weeks  gestation ranged from  90 to  1 800  average   430   whereas an abortion at 20 weeks  gestation ranged from  350 to  4 520  average   1 260   Costs are higher for a medical abortion than a first trimester surgical abortion   edit  Medicaid Federal law requires that states cover abortions under Medicaid in the event of rape  incest  and life endangerment  but bans the use of federal Medicaid funds for any other abortions  Based on these restrictions  32 states and DC fund abortions through Medicaid only in the cases of rape  incest  or life endangerment  SD covers abortions only in the cases of life endangerment  which does not comply with federal requirements under the Hyde Amendment  IN  UT and WI have expanded coverage to women whose physical health is jeopardized  and IA  MS  UT and VA also include fetal abnormality cases  Seventeen states  AK  AZ  CA  CT  HI  IL  MD  MA  MN  MT  NJ  NM  NY  OR  VT  WA  WV  use their own funds to cover all or most  medically necessary  abortions sought by low income women under Medicaid   edit  Private insurance Five states  ID  KY  MO  ND  OK  restrict insurance coverage of abortion services in private plans  OK limits coverage to life endangerment  rape or incest circumstances  and the other four states limit coverage to cases of life endangerment  Twelve states  CO  IL  KY  MA  MS  NE  ND  OH  PA  RI  SC  VA  restrict abortion coverage in insurance plans for public employees  with CO and KY restricting insurance coverage of abortion under any circumstances  U S  laws also ban federal funding of abortions for Federal employees and their dependents  Native Americans covered by the Indian Health Service  military personnel and their dependents  and women with disabilities covered by Medicare  61   edit  Positions of U S  political parties Though members of both major political parties come down on either side of the issue  the Republican Party is often seen as being pro life  since the official party platform opposes abortion and considers unborn children to have an inherent right to life  Republicans for Choice represents the minority of that party  In 2006 pollsters found that 9  of Republicans favor the availability of abortion in most circumstances  62  Of Republican National Convention delegates in 2004  13  believed that abortion should be generally available  and 38  believed that it should not be permitted  The same poll showed that 17  of all Republican voters believed that abortion should be generally available to those who want it  while 38  believed that it should not be permitted  63  The Democratic Party platform considers abortion to be a woman s right  Democrats for Life of America represents the minority of that party  In 2006 pollsters found that 74  of Democrats favor the availability of abortion in most circumstances  62  However  a Zogby International poll in 2004 found that 43  of all Democrats believed that abortion  destroys a human life and is manslaughter   64  Of Democratic National Convention delegates in 2004  75  believed that abortion should be generally available  and 2  believed that abortion should not be permitted  The same poll showed that 49  of all Democratic voters believed that abortion should be generally available to those who want it  while 13  believed that it should not be permitted  65  The U S  Green Party supports abortion as a woman s right  The U S  Libertarian Party takes no position on abortion  but the Party opposes any government funding of abortion  In the United States the abortion issue has become deeply politicized  in 2002  84  of state Democratic platforms supported the right to having an abortion while 88  of state Republican platforms opposed it  This divergence also led to Christian Right organizations like Christian Voice  Christian Coalition and Moral Majority having an increasingly strong role in the Republican Party  This opposition has been extended under the Foreign Assistance Act  in 1973 Jesse Helms introduced an amendment banning the use of aid money to promote abortion overseas  and in 1984 the Mexico City Policy prohibited financial support to any overseas organization that performed or promoted abortions  The  Mexico City Policy  was revoked by President Bill Clinton and subsequently reinstated by President George W  Bush  President Barack Obama immediately overruled this policy by Executive Order on January 23  2009  66  The official platforms of the major political parties in the US are as follows   edit  The U S  Republican Party 2008   Faithful to the first guarantee of the Declaration of Independence  we assert the inherent dignity and sanctity of all human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed  We support a human life amendment to the Constitution  and we endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment s protections apply to unborn children  We oppose using public revenues to promote or perform abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it  We support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity and dignity of innocent human life     67  2004   As a country  we must keep our pledge to the first guarantee of the Declaration of Independence  That is why we say the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed  We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make it clear that the Fourteenth Amendment s protections apply to unborn children  Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions  We oppose using public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it  We support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life    68  2000   Ban abortion with Constitutional amendment  We say the unborn child has a fundamental right to life  We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation that the 14th Amendment s protections apply to unborn children  Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions  We oppose using public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it  We support the appointment of judges who respect the sanctity of innocent human life    69  2000   Alternatives like adoption  instead of punitive action  Our goal is to ensure that women with problem pregnancies have the kind of support  material and otherwise  they need for themselves and for their babies  not to be punitive towards those for whose difficult situation we have only compassion  We oppose abortion  but our pro life agenda does not include punitive action against women who have an abortion  We salute those who provide alternatives to abortion and offer adoption services    69   edit  The U S  Democratic Party 2008   The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v  Wade and a woman s right to choose a safe and legal abortion  regardless of ability to pay  and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right The Democratic Party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives  We also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions  The Democratic Party also strongly supports a woman s decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care  parenting skills  income support  and caring adoption programs    70  2004   Support right to choose even if mother cannot pay  Because we believe in the privacy and equality of women  we stand proudly for a woman s right to choose  consistent with Roe v  Wade  and regardless of her ability to pay  We stand firmly against Republican efforts to undermine that right  At the same time  we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives  Abortion should be safe  legal  and rare    71  2000   Choice is a fundamental  constitutional right  Democrats stand behind the right of every woman to choose  We believe it is a constitutional liberty  This year s Supreme Court ruling show us that eliminating a woman s right to choose is only one justice away  Our goal is to make abortion more rare  not more dangerous  We support contraceptive research  family planning  comprehensive family life education  and policies that support healthy childbearing    72   edit  Effects of legalization The risk of death due to legal abortion has fallen considerably since legalization in 1973  due to increased physician skills  improved medical technology  and earlier termination of pregnancy  73  From 1940 through 1970  deaths of pregnant women during abortion fell from nearly 1 500 to a little over 100  73  According to the Centers for Disease Control  the number of women who died in 1972 from illegal abortion was thirty nine  39   74  In 1960  Dr  Mary Calderone  a former director of Planned Parenthood  said    Abortion is no longer a dangerous procedure  This applies not just to therapeutic abortions as performed in hospitals but also to so called illegal abortions as done by physician  In 1957 there were only 260 deaths in the whole country attributed to abortions of any kind    90 percent of all illegal abortions are presently being done by physicians    Whatever trouble arises usually arises from self induced abortions  which comprise approximately 8 percent  or with the very small percentage that go to some kind of non medical abortionist    75    The Roe effect is an hypothesis which suggests that since supporters of abortion rights cause the erosion of their own political base by having fewer children  the practice of abortion will eventually lead to the restriction or illegalization of abortion  The legalized abortion and crime effect is another controversial theory that posits legal abortion reduces crime  because unwanted children are more likely to become criminals  Since Roe v Wade  there have been numerous attempts to reverse the decision  In the 2011 election season  Mississippi placed an amendment on the ballot that redefine how the state viewed abortion  The personhood amendment defined personhood as  every human being from the moment of fertilization  cloning or the functional equivalent thereof   If passed  it would have been impossible to get an abortion in the state   76   edit  See also Abortion by country Abortion and religion Catholic Church and abortion in the United States  edit  Notes and references   Roe v  Wade  410 U S  113  154  1973   We  therefore  conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision  but that this right is not unqualified  and must be considered against important state interests in regulation     According to the Supreme Court s decision in Roe v  Wade    a  For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester  the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman s attending physician    b  For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester  the State  in promoting its interest in the health of the mother  may  if it chooses  regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health    c  For the stage subsequent to viability  the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may  if it chooses  regulate  and even proscribe  abortion except where it is necessary  in appropriate medical judgment  for the preservation of the life or health of the mother   Likewise  Black s Law Dictionary defines abortion as  knowing destruction  or  intentional expulsion or removal     James Wilson   Of the Natural Rights of Individuals   1790
