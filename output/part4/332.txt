Bucky  Barnes   Sam Wilson  and Clint Barton  to stop Doctor Doom from detonating stolen nuclear weapons planted on the Millennium Wheel in London   edit  Ultimate Marvel Main article  Ultimate Iron Man James Rhodes first appears as a prep school student and the victim of frequent bullying at the school due to his ethnicity  that he comes from a poorer family and the fact that he s there because of the school s racial quota  81  He finds an unlikely friend in a young Tony Stark who defends him against the bullies   much to his dismay because it only serves to attract more attention to himself and  thus  increase his torment  Stark is keen on Rhodes being his friend  while Rhodes  initially  is uneasy about Stark and his burgeoning friendship  Later  after Stark is severely attacked at school and is aided by Rhodes  which turns out to be a peripheral attack on Stark s father   both leave the school and with Stark s father s help  are accepted into the Baxter Building s School for Exceptional Children along with Rhodes s sister  one  because they are all strikingly intelligent  but also for their own protection  Both begin work on different projects and eventually  Stark takes Rhodes into his confidence and allows Rhodes a chance to wear and help design some of the armor he and his father have innovated  Rhodes and Stark s friendship strengthens and Rhodes is later seen making another armor version named  War Machine  which he is going to trade with Stark s  Iron Man  armor when both are fully developed  A couple of years later  Stark and Rhodes  in their respective armor  team up as fake  Robots  to take out a terrorist group for the government  82  This origin  however  was retconned as being a fictionalized history of Tony Stark s early years  Years later  Rhodes  now a Colonel  is seen sporting a new War Machine armor created by Tony Stark s older brother Gregory Stark of which both are  for some reason  now estranged  which he uses to save two abducted U S  army officers from the hands of the Taliban  Once the officers had been secured  Rhodes decides to kill the unarmed civils and the enemy after they surrendered  giving the first glimpse into a more ruthless  apathetic and even sadistic War Machine  a far cry from earlier views of Rhodes  Later  in France  he attempts to capture a seemingly rogue Captain America as part of the reactivated  Project Avengers  with new armor that is quite larger  is bloated with numerous ballistic weapons  far more than Tony Stark s Iron Man armor   and can also  evidently  even transform into a German sports car  Rhodes is almost able to capture Captain America  but their last confrontation involves Cap being in a room full of school children  Rhodes  ruthlessness is shown ever further as he contemplates continuing his attack  until Cap reminds him that any  Collateral Damage  involving school children would be a Public Relations and Political nightmare prompting War Machine to back off  but for all the wrong reasons  At this point  Rhodes  new mental  emotional or combat attitude has not been addressed or explained  83   edit  In other media Main article  War Machine in other
