www westchestergov com Westchester County is a county located in the U S  state of New York  Westchester covers an area of 450 square miles  1 200 km2  and has a population of 949 113 according to the 2010 Census  residing in 45 municipalities  It was named after the city of Chester in England  and the county seat is White Plains  The county s location puts New York City and Long Island Sound to its south  Putnam County on the north  Connecticut on the east  Rockland County on the west  Westchester became the first large scale suburban area in the world to develop  Its significance as a suburb derived mostly from the upper middle class development of entire communities in the late 19th century  and the rapid population growth that occurred as a result  1  According to 2006 HUD data  the median income for a household of one person in the county was  75 427 and the median income for a family of four was  96 500  2  3  Westchester County ranks number two  number one being New York County  for wealthiest counties in New York State and the seventh wealthiest county nationally  Westchester County has long been associated with  old money  and some of the country s wealthiest

material may be challenged and removed   January 2010   edit  Original inhabitants At the time of European contact in the 16th and 17th centuries  the Native American inhabitants of what would become Westchester County were part of one of the Algonquian peoples whose name for themselves was Lenape   the people    The region inhabited by the Lenape called by them Lenapehoking consisted of the area around and between the Delaware and lower to middle Hudson Rivers  Throughout the region were spoken two related languages  part of the Algonquian language family and related to Mahican  collectively known as the Delaware languages  Unami and Munsee  Munsee was spoken by the inhabitants of what is today known as Westchester County as well as those from Manhattan island  Some ethnographers of the past  lacking valid contemporary sources  simply referred to the various tribes of the area as Munsee speakers  or  even more generally  as Lenni Lenape  the  true people    Fortunately title deeds given to European settlers have turned out to be able to supply considerable information about the sub tribes in the region and their locations  The  Manhattans  occupied the island upon which New York City was built  as well as land in southern Westchester now covered by the city of Yonkers  The Weckquaesgeek occupied land along the Hudson River and the central portion of the county where the modern settlements of Dobbs Ferry  Tarrytown and White Plains can be found  The Siwanoy lived along the coast of Long Island Sound where Pelham  New Rochelle  Larchmont  Mamaroneck and Rye now stand  The northern portions of the county were occupied by smaller tribes such as the Tankiteke  Kitchawank and Saint Sik  In the Lenape worldview  however  since they all spoke more or less the same mother tongue  they all were the very opposite of  foreigners  to each other  although that did not prevent in fighting any more than it does among other related but competitive tribes such as the Scandinavians or the various speakers of Romance languages    edit  Colonial Westchester Van Cortlandt Manor Philipsburg Manor House The first Europeans to explore Westchester were Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524 and Henry Hudson in 1609  The first European settlers were sponsored by the Dutch West India Company in the 1620s and 1630s  English settlers arrived from New England in the 1640s By 1664  the Dutch lost control of the County to the English and large tracts of Westchester land were established as manors or patents  Manors were held by a single proprietor  while patents were held by groups of associates  The lords of the manors and patents leased land to tenant farmers and provided many essential services to the tenants  Westchester County was an original county of the Province of New York  one of twelve created by an act of the New York General Assembly in 1683  At the time  it also included the present Bronx County  which constituted the original Town of Westchester  whose center was around the area today known as Westchester Square  in the Bronx  and portions of three other towns  Yonkers  Eastchester  and Pelham  During the colonial period  life in Westchester was quite primitive  Roads were few and in poor condition  Transportation was heavily dependent on water routes  Nearly everything settlers consumed was raised or made on their farms  They bartered wood  cattle and food for items that they could not produce themselves  Colonial churches not only served as religious centers but also played an important social and political role  Although the economy was still primarily agricultural  farmers began to supplement income through cottage industries   shoe making and furniture crafting  These industries led to heavier use of local roads  heavier use necessitated road improvements which encouraged increased travel  Taverns providing accommodations for travelers were established and ferries were launched  By 1775  Westchester was the richest and most populous County in the colony of New York   edit  Revolutionary transition During the American Revolutionary War  Westchester County saw more fighting and suffering than any other area in the country  The Revolution was in some ways a civil war  as families were often divided between patriot and loyalist sympathies  After the battles of Pelham and White Plains in 1776  the main American headquarters was at Continental Village  north of Peekskill in Putnam County  The British were headquartered in New York City  Westchester was the  Neutral Ground  between the two camps and the countryside was pillaged by both sides  Although the Revolution devastated the County  recovery after the war was rapid  The large landowners in Westchester were mostly Loyalists  and after the war their lands were confiscated by the state and sold  Many local farmers were able to buy the lands they had previously farmed as tenants  In 1788  five years after the end of the Revolutionary War  the County was officially divided into 20 towns  In 1798  the first federal census recorded a population of 24 000 centered in northern Westchester   edit  Early infrastructure improvements 1867 map of Westchester In 1800  the first commercial toll road  the Westchester Turnpike  which ran through Pelham and New Rochelle  was chartered  Other toll roads including the Croton  Somerstown  Turnpike were later established  During this same period  steamboats began to appear on the Hudson River  Expansion of transportation options encouraged economic expansion  Larger industries were gradually established such as iron foundries in Peekskill and Port Chester  brickyards in Verplank and Croton  marble quarries in Ossining and Tuckahoe  Two developments in the first half of the 19th century   the construction of the first Croton Dam and Aqueduct and the coming of the railroad   had enormous impact on the growth of both Westchester and New York City  Construction of the Croton Dam and Aqueduct began in 1837 and was completed in 1842  The aqueduct carried water 41 miles  66 km  from Croton to two reservoirs in Manhattan to be distributed to the city  Now a National Historic Landmark  the Croton Aqueduct is considered one of the great engineering achievements of the 19th century  In the 1840s  the railroads came to Westchester  In 1844  the New York and Harlem Railroad reached White Plains  The Hudson River Railroad line was completed to Peekskill in 1849  That same year  the New York and New Haven Railroad opened its route through eastern Westchester  The railroads often determined whether a town grew or declined  and they contributed to a population shift from northern to southern Westchester  By 1860  the total County population was 99 000 and the largest city was Yonkers  Many small downtowns  centered around a railroad station  flourished   edit  Post Civil War Yonkers Civil War monument The period following the American Civil War brought vast fortunes to a new class of entrepreneurs in the New York area  and many built large estates in Westchester  Several magnificent mansions of this era are preserved and open to the public  Among them are Lyndhurst in Tarrytown  Kykuit in Pocantico Hills  the Jay Heritage Center in Rye  Caramoor in Katonah and Glenview in Yonkers  Expansion of the New York City water supply system also impacted local development  creating new dams  bridges and roads  The flooding of thousands of acres for reservoirs created considerable dislocations in many towns north of White Plains  The building of the New Croton Dam and its reservoir  for instance  resulted in the relocation of the hamlet of Katonah to higher ground  In North Salem the hamlet of Purdys was moved when five percent of the town was inundated  including hundreds of prime acres of dairy land  During the last half of the 19th century  Westchester s transportation system and labor force attracted a manufacturing base  particularly along the Hudson River and Nepperhan Creek  Pills and patent medicines were manufactured in Ossining  greenhouses in Irvington  beer in Dobbs Ferry  sugar  paving material and conduit in Hastings  and in Yonkers  elevators and carpets  In 1874  the western portion of the present Bronx County  consisting of the then towns of Kingsbridge  West Farms  and Morrisania  was transferred to New York County  and in 1895 the remainder of the present Bronx County  consisting of the Town of Westchester and portions of the towns of Eastchester and Pelham  was transferred to New York County  By that time  the portion of the town of Eastchester immediately north of the transferred portion had seceded from the town of Eastchester  1892  to become the City of Mount Vernon so that the Town of Eastchester had no border with New York City  In January 1914  those parts of the then New York County which had been annexed from Westchester County were constituted as Bronx County  4   edit  Twentieth century During the 20th century  the primarily rural character of Westchester would yield to the suburban county known today  Between the County s railroad network and the proliferation of the automobile in the early 20th century  working in New York City and living in the country became possible for the middle class  In 1907 the Bronx River Commission was established to acquire the necessary lands to eliminate nuisance conditions along the river s banks and improve its water quality through a joint undertaking between New York City and Westchester County  The Commission s efforts led to the creation of the Bronx River Parkway Reservation  completed in 1925  and the first modern  multi lane limited access roadway in North America  The success of the Bronx River Parkway Reservation encouraged the County government to develop its outstanding parks system  preserving great tracts of open space  Playland in Rye  a National Historic Landmark  opened to the public in 1928  was the first totally planned amusement park in the country  It continues to be operated by Westchester County  The development of Westchester s parks and parkway systems supported existing residential communities and encouraged the establishment of new ones  New homes were constructed on former estates and farms  The parkways were a boon for commuters and transformed the development pattern of Westchester  New businesses appeared in response to expanded markets  White Plains  with branches of many New York City stores  became the County s central shopping center  With the need for new homes for new families following World War II  multistory apartment houses appeared in the urbanized areas of the County  while the market for single family houses continued to expand  By 1950 the total County population was 625 816  Major interstate highways were constructed in Westchester during the 1950s and 60s  The establishment of these roadways  along with the construction of the Tappan Zee Bridge  encouraged many major corporations  such as PepsiCo  General Foods  Ciba Geigy and IBM to establish headquarters in Westchester  They accomplishe this by assembling large tracts of property to construct office facilities  which were often designed by world famous architects and enhanced by extensive landscape  Today it is one of the most affluent counties in the country  home to many of New York City s most desirable suburban communities  It is a haven for commuters  whether traveling by car or by the Metro North Commuter Railroad   edit  National Historic Sites St  Paul s Church in Mt  Vernon was designated a National Historic Site in 1942  The original church  a wooden structure known as Church of Eastchester  was built in 1695  The present day stone church was completed in 1764  and its name was changed to St  Paul s in 1795  The church property  which is operated by the National Park Service  includes a cemetery with burial stones dating to 1704 and the remnants of a village green that was the site of what came to be known as the  Great Election  of 1733  5  The publisher of the New York Journal  John Peter Zenger  wrote an account of the election and was arrested and tried for seditious libel  His acquittal established the legal precedent for  freedom of the press   which was later incorporated as a basic freedom in the U S  Bill of Rights  Horace Greeley s house stands in Chappaqua  Horace Greeley was most famous for his newspaper  The New York Tribune   which ran late into the 19th century  Greeley got a mere sixty votes in the electoral college when he ran for president against Ulysses S  Grant and died shortly thereafter from severe illnesses and broken spirits  His home and the grounds which have not been subdivided are run by the Town of New Castle Historical Society and is open for guided and self guided tours  One of the Founding Fathers native to New York State  John Jay  grew up in Rye  New York and returned there to rest among his many descendants  America s first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court served in every branch of US government and his boyhood home is now a National Historic Landmark  open to the public  It is managed by the Jay Heritage Center  The buildings on this historic site  including the 1838 Peter Augustus Jay House built by Jay s eldest son  are being restored for educational programs in American History  Architecture and Environmental Stewardship  The Thomas Paine Cottage in New Rochelle  New York  was the home from 1802 to 1806 of Thomas Paine  author of Common Sense and Revolutionary War hero  It was declared a National Historic Landmark on November 28  1972   edit  Geography Davids  Island Westchester County is located at the southeastern tip of New York State  According to the U S  Census Bureau  the county has a total area of 500 square miles  1 300 km2   of which 433 square miles  1 100 km2  is land and 67 square miles  170 km2   13 45    water  The County shares its northern boundary with Putnam County and its southern boundary with New York City  It is bordered on the west side by the Hudson River and on the east side by Long Island Sound and Fairfield County  Connecticut  The closest point on the southern border of Westchester is just under 11 miles  18 km  from Columbus Circle in Manhattan  the customary point for measuring distances from New York City   where Pelham Manor meets Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx  At over 2 700 acres  11 km2   Pelham Bay Park is the largest of New York City s parks  forming a substantial  buffer  between suburban Westchester and urban Bronx County  Southern Westchester s Long Island Sound shore is generally rocky  Tidal mud flats  marshes and wetlands  as well as several natural and artificially maintained sand beaches are interspersed on the coast  Public waterfront access is limited by residential and other development  although municipal and County owned parks provide access to beaches  nature preserves and passive and active waterfront recreational facilities  Several large harbors lie along the shore including Milton Harbor in Rye  Mamaroneck Harbor  Larchmont Harbor and Echo Bay  and the Upper and Lower harbors in New Rochelle  A number of islands can be found offshore from New Rochelle  The uses of these islands vary  Davids  Island  the former location of the U S  Army s Fort Slocum  is currently unoccupied but is slated for use as passive parkland  Glen Island is a County park for passive and active recreation  Huckleberry Island is largely undeveloped and has one of the largest rookeries for some shore bird species in western Long Island Sound  Columbia Island was the former site of CBS television broadcast antennas and is currently unoccupied  Echo Island is used by a private yacht club  Execution Rocks is the site of a 19th century lighthouse listed on the National Register of Historic Places  Pea Island is owned by Huguenot Yacht Club but remains undeveloped  Goose Island is undeveloped  Clifford  Harrison and Tank Islands are part of a nature preserve and city park and Oak and Pine Islands are used as private residences  The widest section across the Hudson River  at 3 6 miles  6 km   is found between the Westchester and Rockland County shorelines immediately north of Croton Point in Croton on Hudson  In Colonial times  this area was called the Tappan Zee or Sea  The Hudson River is tidal and brackish through Westchester and contains a small number of estuarine marshes  Two bridges span the Hudson in Westchester  the Bear Mountain Bridge crosses at Cortlandt and the Tappan Zee Bridge at Tarrytown  Municipal  County and state owned parks provide access to waterfront landmarks and sites  including Croton Point in Croton  Kingsland Point in Sleepy Hollow and JFK Memorial Marina in Yonkers  The Hudson River waterfront in Westchester is in the midst of a renaissance  converting from primarily industrial uses to mixed residential  commercial  retail  and recreational uses  This transformation is most notable in Yonkers  Hastings on Hudson  Dobbs Ferry  Irvington  Tarrytown  Sleepy Hollow  Ossining  and Peekskill  where redevelopment projects are in various stages of design and construction  In 2004  Westchester County embarked on a project to create a Hudson RiverWalk of 50 miles  80 km  which will provide public access between New York City and Putnam County along or close to the river  RiverWalk will weave through the Hudson River communities and provide access and linkages to recreational  cultural  and historic resources as well as community business centers  New Croton Reservoir Kensico Dam The County s interior generally is more hilly north of Interstate 287  which bisects the County  The highest elevation in the county is a U S  Coast and Geodetic Survey benchmark known as  Bailey  at 980 feet  300 m  above sea level in Mountain Lakes Park near the Connecticut state line  The lowest elevation is sea level  along both the Hudson and Long Island Sound  The County is divided into six primary drainage basins or watersheds  which are the Lower Long Island Sound  Upper Long Island Sound  Bronx River  Upper Hudson River  Lower Hudson River and Croton River basins  Within these primary drainage basins are approximately 60 smaller basins  or subwatersheds  The principal streams draining the southern part of the County include Beaver Swamp

Hallocks Mill Brook  Hunter Brook  Muscoot River  Peekskill Hollow Brook  and Titicus River  The County contains several major reservoirs for public drinking water supply  The Croton system and the Kensico Reservoir are important components of the New York City water supply system  The system is a series of interconnected reservoirs and lakes in northern Westchester and Putnam Counties that provides 10  of New York City s water under normal conditions and up to 30  of the in City consumption in times of drought  The components of the system include the New Croton Reservoir in Cortlandt  Yorktown  Somers and Bedford  the Cross River Reservoir contained largely in Bedford  Titicus Reservoir in North Salem  Amawalk Reservoir in Somers  and the Muscoot Reservoir in Somers  Lewisboro and Bedford  The Kensico Reservoir is located in Mount Pleasant  Harrison and North Castle  and Byram Lake Reservoir in North Castle and Bedford  A number of other smaller reservoirs exist throughout the

county historically leaned Republican  it swung Democratic in the early 1990s   much like other New York City suburbs  In the most recent national elections  Westchester voters tended to be far more Democratic than national average  In fact  Westchester  after New York City and Albany County  has produced the biggest margins for statewide Democrats in recent years  Democratic voters are mainly concentrated in the southern and central parts of the county  More than 63  of Westchester County voters voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race  the seventh highest percentage of any New York county  behind four New York City boroughs and Albany and Tompkins counties  Currently  two of the three U S  congressional representatives from Westchester County are Democrats  However  Westchester County is less Democratic in state and local elections  For instance  it voted for George Pataki by a margin of 23 07  against African American candidate  Carl McCall in the gubernatorial race of 2002  and by 26 22  in 1998  Pataki hails from Westchester  where he previously served as mayor of Peekskill prior to being elected governor  Nita Lowey and Eliot Engel  both of whom are Democrats  represent most of the rest of the county  Engel s district also includes parts of the Bronx and Rockland County  and Lowey s also reaches into Rockland County  in Congress  Westchester s third representative is Republican Nan Hayworth  who was elected in 2010  defeating Democratic incumbent John Hall  Hayworth s district includes most of northern Westchester County  Former County Executive Andrew Spano is just the second Democrat to hold the post in at least a half century  In 2006  county legislator Andrea Stewart Cousins defeated 20 year incumbent Nicholas Spano  unrelated to Andrew  for a seat in the New York State Senate in a rematch of the 2004 race  which she lost by only 18 votes  Assembly Member Mike Spano  brother of Nicholas  switched parties in July 2007 to become a Democrat  Current district attorney Janet DiFiore also switched parties from Republican to Democratic in August 2007  In 2009  Republican Rob Astorino ousted three term county executive Andy Spano  who had the endorsement of the New York Conservative Party  winning in a landslide  Astorino became the first Republican county executive since Andrew O Rourke  who left the post after the 1997 election  Westchester County was the home of former vice president Nelson Rockefeller  who occupied the Kykuit mansion of the Rockefeller family 3 400 acre  14 km2  estate after the death of John D  Rockefeller  Jr   it is situated near the town of Pocantico Hills  The county is also home to the former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton  who live in Chappaqua  Former First Lady Barbara Bush grew up in Rye   edit  Emergency services Westchester County has a wide array of emergency services and is the home to 58 fire departments  42 ambulance services  two

Mill River Parkway  the Sprain Brook Parkway and the Taconic State Parkway  The Tappan Zee Bridge connects Tarrytown to Rockland County across the Hudson River  The Bear Mountain Bridge crosses the Hudson from Cortlandt to Orange County  The combination of these numerous highways  proximity to New York City  and the county s large population all lead to substantial traffic enforcement and very busy local courts  The development corridors in the county have defined sections and follow transportation corridors  The main north south corridors are  from west to east  the U S  Route 9 Albany Post Rd Broadway Corridor along the Hudson River from Yonkers in the South to Peekskill Cortlandt in the North  The Saw Mill River Parkway Corridor traverses the county in a north eastern path  beginning in Yonkers  and terminating at I 684 in Bedford  mostly following the path of the Putnam Branch of the New York Central Railroad  which was abandoned in March 1970  and which has largely been replaced by a paved path known as the South County and North County Trailways   The Sprain Brook Parkway traverses the county s midsection from a point in Yonkers where it breaks off from the Bronx River Parkway until Hawthorne about 15 miles  24 km  north where it merges with the Taconic State Parkway and continues until I 90 near Albany  The Hutchinson River Parkway lines the eastern county  from the Bronx  terminating at the Long Island crossing the Whitestone Bridge  until the Connecticut state line in Greenwich  where it becomes the Merritt Parkway  I 684 begins at a junction with the Hutchinson River Parkway and I 287 in Harrison  and continues north into Putnam County  with a brief stretch in Greenwich  Connecticut  through Bedford and North Salem  The eastern most corridor is the I 95 New England Thruway which traverses the county on the Long Island Sound  from the Pelhams through the Town of Rye and into Connecticut  The East West corridors are the Cross County Parkway  which traverses the southern county from Yonkers in the west through New Rochelle in the east  terminating at the Hutchinson River Parkway  The Cross Westchester Expressway I 287 is the mid county corridor spanning from the Tappan Zee Bridge in Tarrytown to the west to I 95 New England Thruway in the east  The northern most corridor is that approximating the US 202 route from Cortlandt  and the Bear Mountain Bridge  to Lewisboro and the Connecticut border  But unlike the more southerly corridors  US 202 is for the most part not a limited access highway and has frequent traffic lights  Robert Moses and others once proposed a bridge connecting Westchester with Nassau County  most likely using I 287 to do so  Public opposition was fierce  and the New York state government abandoned the plan  Commuter train service in Westchester is provided by Metro North Railroad  operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority   Metro North operates three lines in the county  west to east  they are the Hudson  the Harlem and the New Haven lines  each of which stops in the Bronx between Westchester and Manhattan  Amtrak serves Croton Harmon  New Rochelle and
