Germania  ca  98 AD   10  On the other hand  ancient Scandinavian sagas refer to a land called Eistland  close to the Danish  German  Dutch  Swedish and Norwegian term Estland for the country  Early Latin and other ancient versions of the name are Estia and Hestia  citation needed  Esthonia was a common alternate English spelling prior to independence  11  12   edit  History Main article  History of Estonia  edit  Prehistory Main article  Ancient Estonia Human settlement in Estonia became possible 11 000 to 13 000 years ago  when the ice from the last glacial era melted  The oldest known settlement in Estonia is the Pulli settlement  which was on the banks of the river P rnu  near the town of Sindi  in south western Estonia  According to radiocarbon dating it was settled around 11 000 years ago at the beginning of the 9th millennium BC  Tools made by Kunda culture  the Estonian History Museum Iron Age artefacts of a hoard from Kumna  13  Evidence has been found of hunting and fishing communities existing around 6500 BC near the town of Kunda in northern Estonia  Bone and stone artefacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia  as well as in Latvia  northern Lithuania and in southern Finland  The Kunda culture belongs to the middle stone age  or Mesolithic period  The end of the Bronze Age and the early Iron Age were marked by great cultural changes  The most significant was the transition to farming  which has remained at the core of the economy and culture  Between the 1st to 5th centuries AD resident farming was widely established  the population grew  and settlement expanded  Cultural influences from the Roman Empire reached Estonia  The first mention of the people inhabiting present day Estonia is by the Roman historian Tacitus  who in his book Germania  ca  AD 98  describes the Aesti tribe  Tacitus mentions their term for amber in an apparently Latinised form  glesum  cf  Latvian gl sas   This is the only word of their language recorded from antiquity  In spite of this point  the Aestii are generally considered the ancestors of the later Baltic peoples  14  15  16  A more troubled and war ridden middle Iron Age followed with external dangers coming both from the Baltic tribes  who attacked across the southern land border  and from overseas  Several Scandinavian sagas refer to retaliatory campaigns against Estonia  Estonian pirates conducted similar raids against the Vikings  The  pagan raiders  who sacked the Swedish town of Sigtuna during the early Middle Ages  in 1187  were Estonians  17  In the 1st centuries AD  political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia  Two larger subdivisions appeared  the province  Estonian  kihelkond  and the land  Estonian  maakond   The province comprised several elderships or villages  Nearly all provinces had at least one fortress  The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official  the king or elder  By the 13th century the following major lands had developed in Estonia  Revala  Harjumaa  Saaremaa  Hiiumaa  L  nemaa  Alempois  Sakala  Ugandi  Jogentagana  Soopoolitse  Vaiga  M hu  Nurmekund  J rvamaa and Virumaa  18  Estonia retained a pagan religion centred around a deity called Tharapita  The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia mentions Tharapita as the superior god of Oeselians  inhabitants of Saaremaa

At the beginning of the 13th century  Lembitu of Lehola  a chieftain of Sakala sought to unify the Estonian people and thwart Danish and Germanic conquest during the Livonian Crusade  He managed to assemble an army of 6 000 Estonian men from different counties  but he was killed during the Battle of St  Matthew s Day in September 1217  19  In 1228  in the aftermath of the Livonian Crusade  to the 1560s  Estonia became part of Terra Mariana  established on 2 February 1207 20  as a principality of the Holy Roman Empire 21  and proclaimed by pope Innocent III in 1215 as a subject to the Holy See  22  The southern parts of the country were conquered by Livonian Brothers of the Sword who joined the Teutonic Order in 1237 and became its branch known as Livonian Order  The Duchy of Estonia was formed in the northern parts of the country 23  as a direct dominion of the King of Denmark from 1219 until 1346 when it was sold to the Teutonic order and became part of the Ordenstaat  24  In 1343  the people of northern Estonia and Saaremaa rebelled against the German rule in the St  George s Night Uprising  which was put down by 1345  Reval  known as Tallinn since 1918  gained L beck Rights in 1248 and joined an alliance of trading guilds called the Hanseatic League at the end of the 13th century  After the Teutonic Order fell into decline following its defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410  and the defeat of the Livonian Order in the Battle of Swienta on 1 September 1435  the Livonian Confederation agreement was signed on 4 December 1435  25  The Grand Duchy of Moscow and Tsardom of Russia attempted unsuccessful invasions in 1481 and 1558  The Livonian Confederation ceased to exist during the Livonian War  1558 82   The wars had reduced the Estonian population from about 250 300 000 people before the Livonian War to 120 140 000 in the 1620s  26   edit  Reformation and Swedish Estonia Main articles  Swedish Estonia  Duchy of Livonia  Dorpat Voivodeship  and

Theses  The Reformation resulted in great change in the Baltic region  Ideas entered the Livonian Confederation very quickly and by the 1520s they were well known  Language  education  religion  and politics were greatly transformed  The Church services were now given in the local vernacular  instead of Latin  as was previously used  27  During the Livonian War in 1561  northern Estonia submitted

voivodeships of present day Estonia  Dorpat Voivodeship  Tartu region  and Parnawa Voivodeship  P rnu region   In 1629  mainland Estonia came entirely under Swedish rule  Estonia was administratively divided between the provinces of Estonia in the north and Livonia in southern Estonia and northern Latvia  a division which persisted until the early 20th century  In 1631  the Swedish king Gustaf II Adolf forced the nobility to grant the peasantry greater rights  although serfdom was retained  King Charles XI withdrew large noble estates to the Swedish Crown effectively turning serfs to taxpaying farmers  In 1632  a printing press and university were established in the city of Dorpat  known as Tartu since 1918   This period is known in Estonian history as  the Good Old Swedish Time   The steady growth of the population continued until the outbreak of the plague in 1657  The Great Famine of 1695 97 killed some 70 000 people   almost 20  of the population  26   edit  Russian Empire Main

Although the rights of peasants were initially weakened  serfdom was abolished in 1816 in the province of Estonia and in 1819 in Livonia  After the Russian revolution of 1917  Tallinn remained under

Estonian War of Independence  and Vaps Movement Estonian Declaration of Independence As a result of the abolition of serfdom and the availability of education to the native Estonian speaking population  an active Estonian nationalist movement developed in the 19th century  It began on a cultural level  resulting in the establishment of Estonian language literature  theatre and professional music and led on to the formation of the Estonian national identity and the Age of Awakening  Among the leaders of the movement were Johann Voldemar Jannsen  Jakob Hurt and Carl Robert Jakobson  Declaration of independence in P rnu on 23 February in 1918  One of the first images of the Republic  Significant accomplishments were the publication of the national epic  Kalevipoeg  in 1862  and the organization of the first national song festival in 1869  In response to a period of Russification initiated by the Russian empire in the 1890s  Estonian nationalism took on more political tones  with intellectuals first calling for greater autonomy  and later  complete independence from the Russian Empire  Following the Bolshevik takeover of power in Russia after the October Revolution of 1917 and German victories against the Russian army  between the Russian Red Army s retreat and the arrival of advancing German troops  the Committee of Elders of the Maap ev issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence 28  in P rnu on 23 February and in Tallinn on 24 February 1918  After winning the Estonian War of Independence against both Soviet Russia and the German Freikorps and Baltische Landeswehr volunteers   the Tartu Peace Treaty was signed on 2 February 1920   The Republic of Estonia was recognised  de jure  by Finland on 7 July 1920  Poland on 31 December 1920  Argentina on 12 January 1921 and by the Western Allies on 26 January 1921  Estonia maintained its independence for twenty two years  Initially a parliamentary democracy  the parliament  Riigikogu  was

fate of the Republic of Estonia before World War II was decided by the German Soviet Nonaggression Pact of August 1939 after Joseph Stalin gained Adolf Hitler s agreement to divide Eastern Europe into  spheres of special interest  according to the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact and its Secret Additional Protocol  30  31  On 24 September 1939  warships of the Red Navy appeared off Estonian ports and Soviet bombers began a patrol over Tallinn and the nearby countryside  32  The Estonian government was forced to give their assent to an agreement which allowed the USSR to establish military bases and station 25 000 troops on Estonian soil for  mutual defence   33  On 12 June 1940  the order for a total military blockade on Estonia was given to the Soviet Baltic Fleet  34  On 14 June 1940  while world s attention was focused on the fall of Paris to Nazi Germany a day earlier  the Soviet military blockade on Estonia went into effect  two Soviet bombers downed the Finnish passenger airplane  Kaleva  flying from Tallinn to Helsinki carrying three diplomatic pouches from the U S  legations in Tallinn  Riga and Helsinki  35  On 16 June 1940  the Soviet Union invaded Estonia  36  The Red Army exited from their military bases in Estonia on 17 June  37  The following day  some 90 000 additional troops entered the country  In the face of overwhelming Soviet force  the Estonian government capitulated on 17 June 1940 to avoid bloodshed  38  The military occupation of Estonia was complete by 21 June 1940  39  Most of the Estonian Defence Forces surrendered according to the orders of the Estonian Government believing that resistance was useless and were disarmed by the Red Army  40  41  Only the Estonian Independent Signal Battalion stationed in Tallinn at Raua Street showed resistance to Red Army and Communist Militia called  People s Self Defence  42  on 21 June 1940  43  As the Red Army brought in additional reinforcements supported by six armoured fighting vehicles  the battle lasted several hours until sundown  Finally the military resistance was ended with negotiations and the Independent Signal Battalion surrendered and was disarmed  44  There were 2 dead Estonian servicemen  Aleksei M nnikus and Johannes Mandre  and several wounded on the Estonian side and about 10 killed and more wounded on the Soviet side  45  46  The Soviet militia that participated in the battle was led by Nikolai Stepulov  47  In 6 August 1940  Estonia was illegally annexed by the Soviet Union as the Estonian SSR  48  The provisions in the Estonian constitution requiring a popular referendum to decide on joining a supra national body were ignored  Instead the vote to join the Soviet Union was taken by those elected in the sham elections held in the previous month  Additionally those who had failed to do their  political duty  of voting Estonia into the USSR  specifically those who had failed to have their passports stamped for voting  were condemned to death by Soviet tribunals  49  The repressions followed with the mass deportations carried out by the Soviets in Estonia on 14 June 1941  Many of the country s political and intellectual leaders were killed or deported to remote areas of the USSR by the Soviet authorities in 1940 1941  Repressive actions were also taken against thousands of ordinary people  When the German Operation Barbarossa started against the Soviet Union  about 34 000 young Estonian men were forcibly drafted into the Red Army  Fewer than 30  of them survived the war  Political prisoners who could not be evacuated were executed by the NKVD  50  Many countries  including the US  did not recognise the annexation of Estonia by the USSR  Such countries recognised Estonian diplomats and consuls who still functioned in many countries in the name of their former governments  These diplomats persisted in this anomalous situation until the ultimate restoration of Baltic independence  51  Contemporary Russian politicians deny that the Republic of Estonia was illegally annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940  They state that the Soviet troops had entered Estonia in 1940 following the agreements and with the consent of the government of the Republic of Estonia  regardless of how their actions can be interpreted today  They maintain that the USSR was not in a state of war and was not waging any combat activities on the territory of Estonia  therefore there could be no occupation  The official Soviet and current Russian version claims that Estonians voluntarily gave up their statehood  Freedom fighters of 1944 1976 are labeled  bandits  or  nazis   The Russian position is not recognised internationally  52   edit  German occupation Main articles  Occupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany

The German Army crossed the Estonian southern border on 7 July  The Red Army retreated behind the P rnu River   Emaj gi line on 12 July  At the end of July the Germans resumed their advance in Estonia working in tandem with the Estonian Forest Brothers  Both German troops and Estonian partisans took Narva on 17 August and the Estonian capital Tallinn on 28 August  After the Soviets were driven out from Estonia German troops disarmed all the partisan groups  53  Although initially the Germans were perceived by most Estonians as liberators from the USSR and its repressions  and hopes were raised for the restoration of the country s independence  it was soon realised that they were but another occupying power  The Germans used Estonia s resources for the war effort  for the duration of the occupation Estonia and was incorporated into the German province of Ostland  This led many Estonians  unwilling to side with the Nazis  to join the Finnish Army to fight against the Soviet Union  The Finnish Infantry Regiment 200  Estonian  soomepoisid  was formed out of Estonian volunteers in Finland  Although many Estonians were recruited into the German armed forces  including Estonian Waffen SS   the majority did so only in 1944 when the threat of a new invasion of Estonia by the Red Army had become imminent and it was clear that Nazi Germany could not win the war  54  By January 1944  the front was pushed back by the Red Army almost all the way to the former Estonian border  Narva was evacuated  J ri Uluots  the last legitimate prime minister of the Republic of Estonia  according to the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia  prior to its fall to the Soviet Union in 1940  delivered a radio address that appealed to all able bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service  Before this  J ri Uluots had opposed Estonian mobilization   The call drew support from all across the country  38 000 volunteers jammed registration centres  55  Several thousand Estonians who had joined the Finnish Army came back across the Gulf of Finland to join the newly formed Territorial Defense Force  assigned to defend Estonia against the Soviet advance  It was hoped that by engaging in such a war Estonia would be able to attract Western support for the cause of Estonia s independence from the USSR and thus ultimately succeed in achieving independence  56   edit  Soviet Estonia Main articles  Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic  Occupation of the Baltic states  and Estonian Government in Exile The Soviet forces reconquered Estonia in the autumn of 1944 after fierce battles in the northeast of the country on the Narva river  on the Tannenberg Line  Sinim ed   in Southeast Estonia  on the Emaj gi river  and in the West Estonian Archipelago  In the face of the country being re occupied by the Red Army  tens of thousands of Estonians  including a majority of the education  culture  science  political and social specialists   estimates as many as 80 000  chose to either retreat with the Germans or flee to Finland or Sweden  On 12 January 1949  the Soviet Council of Ministers issued a decree  on the expulsion and deportation  from Baltic states of  all kulaks and their families  the families of bandits and nationalists   and others  57  More than 200 000 people are estimated to have been deported from the Baltic in 1940 1953  In addition  at least 75 000 were sent to Gulag  More than 10  of the entire adult Baltic population was deported or sent to Soviet labor camps  57  In response to the continuing insurgency against Soviet rule  58  more than 20 000 Estonians were forcibly deported either to labor camps or Siberia  see Gulag   59  Within the few weeks that followed  almost all of the remaining rural households were collectivized  After World War II  as part of the goal to more fully integrate Baltic countries into the Soviet Union  mass deportations were concluded in the Baltic countries and the policy of encouraging Soviet immigration to the Baltic states continued  60  In addition to the human and material losses suffered due to war  thousands of civilians were killed and tens of thousands of people deported from Estonia by the Soviet authorities until Joseph Stalin s death in 1953  Half of the deported perished  the other half were not allowed to return until the early 1960s  years after Stalin s death   citation needed  The various repressive activities of Soviet forces in 1940 1941 and after reoccupation sparked a guerrilla war against the Soviet authorities in Estonia which was waged into the early 1950s by  forest brothers   metsavennad  consisting mostly of Estonian veterans of both the German and Finnish armies as well as some civilians  61  Material damage caused by the world war and the following Soviet era significantly slowed Estonia s economic growth  resulting in a wide wealth gap in comparison with neighboring Finland and Sweden  62  Militarization was another aspect of the Soviet regime  Large parts of the country  especially the coastal areas were closed to all but the Soviet military  Most of the sea shore and all sea islands  including Saaremaa and Hiiumaa  were declared  border zones   People not actually resident there were restricted from traveling to them without a permit  A notable closed military installation was the city of Paldiski which was entirely closed to all public access  The city had a support base for the Soviet Baltic Fleet s submarines and several large military bases  including a nuclear submarine training centre complete with a full scale model of a nuclear submarine with working nuclear reactors  The Paldiski reactors building passed into Estonian control in 1994 after the last Soviet troops left the country  63  64 Immigration was another effect of Soviet occupation  Hundreds of thousands of migrants were relocated to Estonia from other parts of Soviet Union to assist industrialization and militarization  contributing an increase of about half a million people within 45 years  65   edit  Post independence Main articles  Singing Revolution and Baltic Way The US  UK  France  Italy and the majority of other Western democracies considered the annexation of Estonia by the USSR illegal  They retained diplomatic relations with the representatives of the independent Republic of Estonia  never de jure recognised the existence of the Estonian SSR  and never recognised Estonia as a legal constituent part of the Soviet Union  66  Estonia s return to independence became possible as the Soviet Union faced internal regime challenges  loosening its hold on the outer empire  As the 1980s progressed  a movement for Estonian autonomy started  In the initial period of 1987 1989  this was partially for more economic independence  but as the Soviet Union weakened and it became increasingly obvious that nothing short of full independence would do  the country began a course towards self determination  Estonia joined the European Union in 2004 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007  In 1989  during the  Singing Revolution   in a landmark demonstration for more independence  called the Baltic Way  a human chain of more than two million people was formed  stretching through Lithuania  Latvia and Estonia  All three nations had similar experiences of occupation and similar aspirations for regaining independence  The Estonian Sovereignty Declaration was issued on 16 November 1988 67  and formal independence declared on 20 August 1991  reconstituting the pre 1940 state  during the Soviet military coup attempt in Moscow  The Soviet Union recognised the independence of Estonia on 6 September 1991  The first country to diplomatically recognize Estonia s reclaimed independence was Iceland  The

of Valga County  from parts of V ru  Tartu and Viljandi counties  and Petseri County  area acquired from Russia with the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty   During the Soviet rule  Petseri County was annexed and ceded to the Russian SFSR in 1945 where it became one the Pskovs districts  Counties were again re established on 1 January 1990 in the borders of the Soviet era regions  Because of the numerous differences between the current and historical  pre 1940  and sometimes pre 1918  layouts  the historical borders are still used in ethnology  representing cultural and linguistic differences better  Estonia is divided into 15 counties  maakond   Each county is further divided into municipalities  omavalitsus   which is also the smallest administrative subdivision of Estonia  There are two types of municipalities  an urban municipality   linn  town   and a rural municipality   vald  parish   There is no other status distinction between them  Each municipality is a unit of self government with

been accession into NATO and the European Union  achieved in March and May 2004 respectively  Estonia s international realignment toward the West has been accompanied by a general deterioration in relations with Russia  most recently demonstrated by the controversy surrounding the relocation of the Bronze Soldier WWII memorial in Tallinn  82  Estonia is a member of the European parliament since 2004  An important element in Estonia s post independence reorientation has been closer ties with the Nordic countries  especially Finland and Sweden  Indeed  Estonians consider themselves a Nordic people rather than Balts  83  84  based on their historical ties with Sweden  Denmark and particularly Finland  In December 1999  then Estonian foreign minister  and since 2006  president of Estonia  Toomas Hendrik Ilves delivered a speech entitled  Estonia as a Nordic Country  to the Swedish Institute for International Affairs  85  In 2003  the foreign ministry also hosted an exhibit called

Germany and the United Kingdom  Only 3  of all commerce was with the USSR  Before the Second World War Estonia was mainly an agricultural country whose products such as butter  milk and cheese were widely known on the western European markets  The USSR s forcible annexation of Estonia in 1940 and the ensuing Nazi and Soviet occupation during World War II crippled the Estonian economy  Post war Sovietization of life continued with the integration of Estonia s economy and industry into the USSR s centrally planned structure  Since re establishing independence  Estonia has styled itself as the gateway between East and West and aggressively pursued economic reform and integration with the West  Estonia s market reforms put it among the economic leaders in the former COMECON area  In 1994  based on the economic theories of Milton Friedman  Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a flat tax  with a uniform rate of 26  regardless of personal income  In January 2005  the

reserves of phosphorite  pitchblende and granite which are not mined or mined extensively at the moment  117  Significant quantities of rare earth oxides are found in tailings accumulated from 50 years of uranium ore  shale and loparite mining at Sillam e  118  Because of the rising prices of rare earths  extraction of these oxides has become economically viable  The country currently exports around 3000 tonnes per annum  representing around 2 percent of world production  119  In recent years when   a public debate has been raised in the terms of whether Estonia should build a nuclear power plant in order to secure the energy production after the closure of old units in the Narva Power Plants if they are not reconstructed by the year 2016  120   edit  Industry and environment See

Another important industrial sector is the machinery and chemical industry which is mainly located in Ida Viru County and around Tallinn  The oil shale based mining industry  which is also concentrated in East Estonia  produces around 90  of the entire country s electricity  The extensive oil shale usage however has also caused severe damage to the environment  Although the amount of pollutants emitted to the air have been falling since the 1980s  122  the air is still polluted with sulfur dioxide from the mining industry which was rapidly developed by the Soviet Union in early 1950s  In some areas the coastal seawater is polluted  mainly around the Sillam e industrial complex  123  Estonia is a dependent country in the terms of energy and energy production  In recent years many local and foreign companies have been investing in renewable energy sources  The importance of wind power has been increasing steadily in Estonia and currently the total amount of energy production from wind is nearly 60 MW while at the same time roughly 399 MW worth of projects are currently being developed and more than 2800 MW worth of projects are being proposed in the Lake Peipus area and the coastal areas of Hiiumaa  124  125  126  Currently when    there are plans to renovate some older units of the Narva Power Plants  establish new power stations  and provide higher

transport dominates the cargo sector  carrying 70  of all goods  both domestic and international  Since 2007  the importance of the transport sector to the economy as a whole has been reduced  mainly due to the confrontation between Estonia and Russia  138  The road transport sector dominates passenger transport  almost 90  of all passengers travel by road  The reconstruction of the Tallinn Tartu motorway has gained national attention as it connects two of the largest cities in the country  The motorway reconstruction  2 2 route  is part of the current Government Coalition programme  139  Also the proposed permanent connection to Saaremaa Island is in the national infrastructure building programme  The costs of the projects have been estimated in billions of Euros  which have also gained a

from 5 3    46 700  in 1881 to 1 3   16 346  in 1934  141  142  Between 1945 and 1989  the share of ethnic Estonians in the population resident within currently defined boundaries of Estonia dropped to 61   caused primarily by the Soviet programme promoting mass immigration of urban industrial workers from Russia  Ukraine  and Belarus  as well as by wartime emigration and Joseph Stalin s mass deportations and executions  By 1989  minorities constituted more than one third of the population  as the number of non Estonians had grown almost fivefold  At the end of the 1980s  Estonians perceived their demographic change as a national catastrophe  This was a result of the migration policies essential to the Soviet Nationalisation Programme aiming to russify Estonia   forceful administrative and military immigration of non Estonians from the USSR coupled with the mass deportations of Estonians to the USSR  During the purges up to 110 000 Estonians were killed or deported  In the decade following the reconstitution of independence  large scale emigration by ethnic Russians and the removal of the Russian military bases in 1994 caused the proportion of ethnic Estonians in Estonia to increase from 61  to 69  in 2006  Modern Estonia is a fairly ethnically heterogeneous country  but this heterogeneity is not a feature of much of the country as the non Estonian population is concentrated in two of Estonia s counties  Thirteen of Estonia s 15 counties are over 80 percent ethnic Estonian  the most homogeneous being Hiiumaa  where Estonians account for 98 4  of the population  In the counties of Harju  including the capital city  Tallinn  and Ida Viru  however  ethnic Estonians make up 60  and 20  of the population  respectively  Russians make up 25 6  of the total population  but account for 36  of the population in Harju county  and 70  of the population in Ida Viru county  The law on the Cultural Autonomy for National Minorities was passed in 1925  which was the first in Europe at the time  citation needed  Cultural autonomies could be granted to minorities numbering more than 3 000 people with longstanding ties to the Republic of Estonia  Prior to the Soviet occupation  the Germans and Jewish minorities managed to elect a cultural council  The Law on Cultural Autonomy for National Minorities was reinstated in 1993  Historically  large parts of Estonia s north western coast and islands have been populated by indigenous ethnically Rannarootslased  Coastal Swedes   The majority of Estonia s Swedish population of 3 800 fled to Sweden or were deported in 1944  escaping the advancing Red Army  In the recent years the numbers of Coastal Swedes has risen again  numbering in 2008 almost 500 people  owing to the property reforms in the beginning of 1990s  In 2005  the Ingrian Finnish minority in Estonia elected a cultural council and was granted cultural autonomy  The Estonian Swedish minority similarly received cultural autonomy in

Finnish are not related to their nearest geographical neighbours  Swedish  Latvian and Russian  which are all Indo European languages  Russian is still spoken as a secondary language by forty  to

Traditionally  Estonia has been seen as an area of rivalry between western and eastern Europe on many levels  An example of this geopolitical legacy is an exceptional combination of nationally recognised Christian traditions  a western Protestant and an eastern Orthodox Church  Like the mainstream culture in the other Nordic countries  Estonian culture can be seen to build upon the ascetic environmental realities and traditional livelihoods  a heritage of comparatively widespread egalitarianism out of practical reasons  see  Everyman s right and universal suffrage   and the ideals of closeness to nature and self sufficiency  see  summer cottage   172  The Estonian Academy of Arts  Estonian  Eesti Kunstiakadeemia  EKA  is providing higher education in art  design  architecture

field is the national epic Kalevipoeg  At a professional level  traditional folk song reached its new heyday during the last quarter of the 20th century  primarily thanks to the work of composer Veljo
