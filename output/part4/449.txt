also usually oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries  In contrast to a commercial bank  a central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the nation s monetary base  and usually also prints the national currency  which usually serves as the nation s legal tender  1  2  Examples include the European Central Bank  ECB   the Federal Reserve of the United States  and the People s Bank of China  3  The primary function of a central bank is to manage the nation s money supply  monetary policy   through active duties such as managing interest rates  setting the reserve requirement  and acting as a lender of last resort to the banking sector during times of bank insolvency or financial crisis  Central banks usually also have supervisory powers  intended to prevent commercial banks and other financial institutions from reckless or fraudulent behavior  Central banks in most developed nations are institutionally designed to be independent from political interference  Contents 1 History 1 1 Naming of central banks 2 Activities and responsibilities 2 1 Monetary policy 3 Goals of monetary policy 3 1 Currency issuance 3 2 Interest rate interventions 3 3

1694  Prior to the 17th century most money was commodity money  typically gold or silver  However  promises to pay were widely circulated and accepted as value at least five hundred years earlier in both Europe and Asia  The Song Dynasty was the first to issue generally circulating paper currency  while the Yuan Dynasty was the first to use notes as the predominant circulating medium  In 1455  in an effort to control inflation  the succeeding Ming Dynasty ended the use of paper money and closed much of Chinese trade  The medieval European Knights Templar ran an early prototype of a central banking system  as their promises to pay were widely respected  and many regard their activities as having laid the basis for the modern banking system  As the first public bank to  offer accounts not directly convertible to coin   the Bank of Amsterdam established in 1609 is considered to be the precursor to modern central banks  4  The central bank of Sweden   Sveriges Riksbank  or simply  Riksbanken   was founded in Stockholm from the remains of the failed bank Stockholms Banco in 1664 and answered to the parliament   Riksdag of the Estates   thus making it the oldest central bank still operating today  5  One role of the Swedish central bank was lending to the government  6  which was likewise true of the Bank of England  created in 1694 by Scottish businessman William Paterson in the City of London at the request of the English government to help pay for a war  The War of the Second Coalition led to the creation of the Banque de France in 1800  Although central banks today are generally associated with fiat money  the 19th and early 20th centuries central banks in most of Europe and Japan developed under the international gold standard  elsewhere free banking or currency boards were more usual at this time  Problems with collapses of banks during downturns  however  was leading to wider support for central banks in those nations which did not as yet possess them  most notably in Australia  The US Federal Reserve was created by the U S  Congress through the passing of The Federal Reserve Act in the Senate and its signing by President Woodrow Wilson on the same day  December 23  1913  Australia established its first central bank in 1920  Colombia in 1923  Mexico and Chile in 1925 and Canada and New Zealand in the aftermath of the Great Depression in 1934  By 1935  the only significant independent nation that did not possess a central bank was Brazil  which subsequently developed a precursor thereto in 1945 and the present central bank twenty years later  Having gained independence  African and Asian countries also established central banks or monetary unions  The People s Bank of China evolved its role as a central bank starting in about 1979 with the introduction of market reforms  which accelerated in 1989 when the country adopted a generally capitalist approach to its export economy  Evolving further partly in response to the European Central Bank  the People s Bank of China has by 2000 become a modern central bank  The most recent bank model  was introduced together with the euro  involves coordination of the European national banks  which continue to manage their respective economies separately in all respects other than currency exchange and base interest rates   edit  Naming of central banks There is no standard terminology for the name of a central bank  but many countries use the  Bank of Country  form  for example  Bank of England  Bank of Canada  Bank of Mexico   Some are styled  national  banks  such as the National Bank of Ukraine  but the term  national bank  is more often used by privately owned commercial banks  especially in the United States  In other cases  central banks may incorporate the word  Central   for example  European Central Bank  Central Bank of Ireland   but the Central Bank of India is a  government owned  commercial bank and not a central bank  The word  Reserve  is also often included  such as the Reserve Bank of India  Reserve Bank of Australia  Reserve Bank of New Zealand  the South African Reserve Bank  and U S  Federal Reserve System  Many countries have state owned banks or other quasi government entities that have entirely separate functions  such as financing imports and exports  In some countries  particularly in some Communist countries  the term national bank may be used to indicate both the monetary authority and the leading banking entity  such as the Soviet Union s Gosbank  state bank   In other countries  the term national bank may be used to indicate that the central bank s goals are broader than monetary stability  such as full employment  industrial development  or other goals   edit  Activities and responsibilities United States Federal Reserve Functions of a central bank may include  implementing monetary policies  determining Interest rates controlling the nation s entire money supply the Government s banker and the bankers  bank   lender of last resort   managing the country s foreign exchange and gold reserves and the Government s stock register regulating and supervising the banking industry setting the official interest rate   used to manage both inflation and the country s exchange rate   and ensuring that this rate takes effect via a variety of policy mechanisms  edit  Monetary policy Central banks implement a country s chosen monetary policy  At the most basic level  this involves establishing what form of currency the country may have  whether a fiat currency  gold backed currency  disallowed for countries with membership of the International Monetary Fund   currency board or a currency union  When a country has its own national currency  this involves the issue of some form of standardized currency  which is essentially a form of promissory note  a promise to exchange the note for  money  under certain circumstances  Historically  this was often a promise to exchange the money for precious metals in some fixed amount  Now  when many currencies are fiat money  the  promise to pay  consists of the promise to accept that currency to pay for taxes  A central bank may use another country s currency either directly  in a currency union   or indirectly  a currency board   In the latter case  exemplified by Bulgaria  Hong Kong and Latvia  the local currency is backed at a fixed rate by the central bank s holdings of a foreign currency  In countries with fiat money  the expression  monetary policy  may refer more narrowly to the interest rate targets and other active measures undertaken by the monetary authority   edit  Goals of monetary policy The European Central Bank building in Frankfurt High employment Frictional unemployment is the time period between jobs when a worker is searching for  or transitioning from one job to another  Unemployment beyond frictional unemployment is classified as unintended unemployment  For example  structural unemployment is a form of unemployment resulting from a mismatch between demand in the labour market and the skills and locations of the workers seeking employment  Macroeconomic policy generally aims to reduce unintended unemployment  Keynes labeled any jobs that would be created by a rise in wage goods  i e   a decrease in real wages  as involuntary unemployment  Men are involuntarily unemployed if  in the event of a small rise in the price of wage goods relatively to the money wage  both the aggregate supply of labour willing to work for the current money wage and the aggregate demand for it at that wage would be greater than the existing volume of employment   John Maynard Keynes  The General Theory of Employment  Interest and Money p11 Price stability  Inflation is defined either as the devaluation of a currency or equivalently the rise of prices relative to a currency  Since inflation lowers real wages  Keynesians view inflation as the solution to involuntary unemployment  However   unanticipated  inflation leads to lender losses as the real interest rate will be lower than expected  Thus  Keynesian monetary policy aims for a steady rate of inflation  In opposition to Keynes  the Austrian School of economics views inflation simply as a transfer of wealth from currency holders to those who inflate the currency  Economic growth Economic growth can be enhanced by investment in capital  such as more or better machinery  A low interest rate implies that firms can loan money to invest in their capital stock and pay less interest for it  Lowering the interest is therefore considered to encourage economic growth and is often used to alleviate times of low economic growth  On the other hand  raising the interest rate is often used in times of high economic growth as a contra cyclical device to keep the economy from overheating and avoid market bubbles  Interest rate stability Financial market stability Foreign exchange market stability Conflicts among goals Goals frequently cannot be separated from each other and often conflict  Costs must therefore be carefully weighed before policy implementation   edit  Currency issuance Similar to commercial banks  central banks hold assets  government bonds  foreign exchange  gold  and other financial assets  and incur liabilities  currency outstanding   Central banks create money by issuing interest free currency notes and selling them to the public in exchange for interest bearing assets such as government bonds  When a central bank wishes to purchase more bonds than their respective national governments make available  they may purchase private bonds or assets denominated in foreign currencies  The European Central Bank remits its interest income to the central banks of the member countries of the European Union  The US Federal Reserve remits all its profits to the U S  Treasury  This income  derived from the power to issue currency  is referred to as seigniorage  and usually belongs to the national government  The state sanctioned power to create currency is called the Right of Issuance  Throughout history there have been disagreements over this power  since whoever controls the creation of currency controls the seigniorage income   edit  Interest rate interventions Typically a central bank controls certain types of short term interest rates  These influence the stock  and bond markets as well as mortgage and other interest rates  The European Central Bank for example announces its interest rate at the meeting of its Governing Council  in the case of the U S  Federal Reserve  the Board of Governors  Both the Federal Reserve and the ECB are composed of one or more central bodies that are responsible for the main decisions about interest rates and the size and type of open market operations  and several branches to execute its policies  In the case of the Federal Reserve  they are the local Federal Reserve Banks  for the ECB they are the national central banks   edit  Limits on policy effects Although the perception by the public may be that the  central bank  controls some or all interest rates and currency rates  economic theory  and substantial empirical evidence  shows that it is impossible to do both at once in an open economy  Robert Mundell s  impossible trinity  is the most famous formulation of these limited powers  and postulates that it is impossible to target monetary policy  broadly  interest rates   the exchange rate  through a fixed rate  and maintain free capital movement  Since most Western economies are now considered  open  with free capital movement  this essentially means that central banks may target interest rates or exchange rates with credibility  but not both at once  Even when targeting interest rates  most central banks have limited ability to influence the rates actually paid by private individuals and companies  In the most famous case of policy failure  Black Wednesday  George Soros arbitraged the pound sterling s relationship to the ECU and  after making  2 billion himself and forcing the UK to spend over  8bn defending the pound  forced it to abandon its policy  Since then he has been a harsh critic of clumsy bank policies and argued that no one should be able to do what he did   The most complex relationships are those between the yuan and the US dollar  and between the euro and its neighbours  The situation in Cuba is so exceptional as to require the Cuban peso to be dealt with simply as an exception  since the United States forbids direct trade with Cuba  US dollars were ubiquitous in Cuba s economy after its legalization in 1991  but were officially removed from circulation in 2004 and replaced by the convertible peso   edit  Policy instruments Bank of Japan The main monetary policy instruments available to central banks are open market operation  bank reserve requirement  interest rate policy  re lending and re discount  including using the term repurchase market   and credit policy  often coordinated with trade policy   While capital adequacy is important  it is defined and regulated by the Bank for International Settlements  and central banks in practice generally do not apply stricter rules  To enable open market operations  a central bank must hold foreign exchange reserves  usually in the form of government bonds  and official gold reserves  It will often have some influence over any official or mandated exchange rates  Some exchange rates are managed  some are market based  free float  and many are somewhere in between   managed float  or  dirty float     edit  Interest rates By far the most visible and obvious power of many modern central banks is to influence market interest rates  contrary to popular belief  they rarely  set  rates to a fixed number  Although the mechanism differs from country to country  most use a similar mechanism based on a central bank s ability to create as much fiat money as required  The mechanism to move the market towards a  target rate   whichever specific rate is used  is generally to lend money or borrow money in theoretically unlimited quantities  until the targeted market rate is sufficiently close to the target  Central banks may do so by lending money to and borrowing money from  taking deposits from  a limited number of qualified banks  or by purchasing and selling bonds  As an example of how this functions  the Bank of Canada sets a target overnight rate  and a band of plus or minus 0 25   Qualified banks borrow from each other within this band  but never above or below  because the central bank will always lend to them at the top of the band  and take deposits at the bottom of the band  in principle  the capacity to borrow and lend at the extremes of the band are unlimited  7  Other central banks use similar mechanisms  It is also notable that the target rates are generally short term rates  The actual rate that borrowers and lenders receive on the market will depend on  perceived  credit risk  maturity and other factors  For example  a central bank might set a target rate for overnight lending of 4 5   but rates for  equivalent risk  five year bonds might be 5   4 75   or  in cases of inverted yield curves  even below the short term rate  Many central banks have one primary  headline  rate that is quoted as the  central bank rate   In practice  they will have other tools and rates that are used  but only one that is rigorously targeted and enforced   The rate at which the central bank lends money can indeed be chosen at will by the central bank  this is the rate that makes the financial headlines     Henry C K  Liu  8  Liu explains further that  the U S  central bank lending rate is known as the Fed funds rate  The Fed sets a target for the Fed funds rate  which its Open Market Committee tries to match by lending or borrowing in the money market     a fiat money system set by command of the central bank  The Fed is the head of the central bank because the U S  dollar is the key reserve currency for international trade  The global money market is a USA dollar market  All other currencies markets revolve around the U S  dollar market   Accordingly the U S  situation is not typical of central banks in general  A typical central bank has several interest rates or monetary policy tools it can set to influence markets  Marginal lending rate  currently 2 00  in the Eurozone    a fixed rate for institutions to borrow money from the central bank   In the USA this is called the discount rate   Main refinancing rate  1 25  in the Eurozone    the publicly visible interest rate the central bank announces  It is also known as minimum bid rate and serves as a bidding floor for refinancing loans   In the USA this is called the federal funds rate   Deposit rate  0 50  in the Eurozone    the rate parties receive for deposits at the central bank  These rates directly affect the rates in the money market  the market for short term loans   edit  Open market operations Through open market operations  a central bank influences the money supply in an economy directly  Each time it buys securities  exchanging money for the security  it raises the money supply  Conversely  selling of securities lowers the money supply  Buying of securities thus amounts to printing new money while lowering supply of the specific security  The main open market operations are  Temporary lending of money for collateral securities   Reverse Operations  or  repurchase operations   otherwise known as the  repo  market   These operations are carried out on a regular basis  where fixed maturity loans  of one week and one month for the ECB  are auctioned off  Buying or selling securities   direct operations   on ad hoc basis  Foreign exchange operations such as forex swaps  All of these interventions can also influence the foreign exchange market and thus the exchange rate  For example the People s Bank of China and the Bank of Japan have on occasion bought several hundred billions of U S  Treasuries  presumably in order to stop the decline of the U S  dollar versus the renminbi and the yen   edit  Capital requirements All banks are required to hold a certain percentage of their assets as capital  a rate which may be established by the central bank or the banking supervisor  For international banks  including the 55 member central banks of the Bank for International Settlements  the threshold is 8   see the Basel Capital Accords  of risk adjusted assets  whereby certain assets  such as government bonds  are considered to have lower risk and are either partially or fully excluded from total assets for the purposes of calculating capital adequacy  Partly due to concerns about asset inflation and repurchase agreements  capital requirements may be considered more effective than reserve requirements in preventing indefinite lending  when at the threshold  a bank cannot extend another loan without acquiring further capital on its balance sheet   edit  Reserve requirements Historically  bank reserves have formed only a small fraction of deposits  a system called fractional reserve banking  Banks would hold only a small percentage of their assets in the form of cash reserves as insurance against bank runs  Over time this process has been regulated and insured by central banks  Such legal reserve requirements were introduced in the 19th century as an attempt to reduce the risk of banks overextending themselves and suffering from bank runs  as this could lead to knock on effects on other overextended banks  See also money multiplier  As the early 20th century gold standard was undermined by inflation and the late 20th century fiat dollar hegemony evolved  and as banks proliferated and engaged in more complex transactions and were able to profit from dealings globally on a moment s notice  these practices became mandatory  if only to ensure that there was some limit on the ballooning of money supply  Such limits have become harder to enforce  The People s Bank of China retains  and uses  more powers over reserves because the yuan that it manages is a non convertible currency  Loan activity by banks plays a fundamental role in determining the money supply  The central bank money after aggregate settlement    final money    can take only one of two forms  physical cash  which is rarely used in wholesale financial markets  central bank money which is rarely used by the people The currency component of the money supply is far smaller than the deposit component  Currency  bank reserves and institutional loan agreements together make up the monetary base  called M1  M2 and M3  The Federal Reserve Bank stopped publishing M3 and counting it as part of the money supply in 2006  9   edit  Exchange requirements To influence the money supply  some central banks may require that some or all foreign exchange receipts  generally from exports  be exchanged for the local currency  The rate that is used to purchase local currency may be market based or arbitrarily set by the bank  This tool is generally used in countries with non convertible currencies or partially convertible currencies  The recipient of the local currency may be allowed to freely dispose of the funds  required to hold the funds with the central bank for some period of time  or allowed to use the funds subject to certain restrictions  In other cases  the ability to hold or use the foreign exchange may be otherwise limited  In this method  money supply is increased by the central bank when it purchases the foreign currency by issuing  selling  the local currency  The central bank may subsequently reduce the money supply by various means  including selling bonds or foreign exchange interventions   edit  Margin requirements and other tools In some countries  central banks may have other tools that work indirectly to limit lending practices and otherwise restrict or regulate capital markets  For example  a central bank may regulate margin lending  whereby individuals or companies may borrow against pledged securities  The margin requirement establishes a minimum ratio of the value of the securities to the amount borrowed  Central banks often have requirements for the quality of assets that may be held by financial institutions  these requirements may act as a limit on the amount of risk and leverage created by the financial system  These requirements may be direct  such as requiring certain assets to bear certain minimum credit ratings  or indirect  by the central bank lending to counterparties only when security of a certain quality is pledged as collateral   edit  Examples of use The People s Bank of China has been forced into particularly aggressive and differentiating tactics by the extreme complexity and rapid expansion of the economy it manages  It imposed some absolute restrictions on lending to specific industries in 2003  and continues to require between 1  and 3  more reserves 10  from large urban banks  typically focusing on export  than rural ones  This is not by any means an unusual situation  The USA historically had very wide ranges of reserve requirements between its dozen branches  Domestic development is thought to be optimized mostly by reserve requirements rather than by capital adequacy methods  since they can be more finely tuned and regionally varied   edit  Banking supervision and other activities Finance Financial markets Bond market

bank through its subsidiaries controls and monitors the banking sector  In other countries banking supervision is carried out by a government department such as the UK Treasury  or an independent government agency  for example  UK s Financial Services Authority   It examines the banks  balance sheets and behaviour and policies toward consumers  Apart from refinancing  it also provides banks with services such as transfer of funds  bank notes and coins or foreign currency  Thus it is often described as the  bank of banks   Many countries such as the United States will monitor and control the banking sector through different agencies and for different purposes  although there is usually significant cooperation between the agencies  For example  money center banks  deposit taking institutions  and other types of financial institutions may be subject to different  and occasionally overlapping  regulation  Some types of banking regulation may be delegated to other levels of government  such as state or provincial governments  Any cartel of banks is particularly closely watched and controlled  Most countries control bank mergers and are wary of concentration in this industry due to the danger of groupthink and runaway lending bubbles based on a single point of failure  the credit culture of the few large banks   edit  Independence This section needs additional

towards certain viewpoints  Please improve the article by adding information on neglected viewpoints  or discuss the issue on the talk page   February 2009  Over the past decade  there has been a trend towards increasing the independence of central banks as a way of improving long term economic performance  However  while a large volume of economic research has been done to define the relationship between central bank independence and economic performance  the results are ambiguous  Advocates of central bank independence argue that a central bank which is too susceptible to political direction or pressure may encourage economic cycles   boom and bust    as politicians may be tempted to boost economic activity in advance of an election  to the detriment of the long term health of the economy and the country  In this context  independence is usually defined as the central bank s operational and management independence from the government  The literature on central bank independence has defined a number of types of independence  Legal independence The independence of the central bank is enshrined in law  This type of independence is limited in a democratic state  in almost all cases the central bank is accountable at some level to government officials  either through a government minister or directly to a legislature  Even defining degrees of legal independence has proven to be a challenge since legislation typically provides only a framework within which the government and the central bank work out their relationship  Goal independence The central bank has the right to set its own policy goals  whether inflation targeting  control of the money supply  or maintaining a fixed exchange rate  While this type of independence is more common  many central banks prefer to announce their policy goals in partnership with the appropriate government departments  This increases the transparency of the policy setting process and thereby increases the credibility of the goals chosen by providing assurance that they will not be changed without notice  In addition  the setting of common goals by the central bank and the government helps to avoid situations where monetary and fiscal policy are in conflict  a policy combination that is clearly sub optimal  Operational independence The central bank has the independence to determine the best way of achieving its policy goals  including the types of instruments used and the timing of their use  This is the most common form of central bank independence  The granting of independence to the Bank of England in 1997 was  in fact  the granting of operational independence  the inflation target continued to be announced in the Chancellor s annual budget speech to Parliament  Management independence The central bank has the authority to run its own operations  appointing staff  setting budgets  and so on   without excessive involvement of the government  The other forms of independence are not possible unless the central bank has a significant degree of management independence  One of the most common statistical indicators used in the literature as a proxy for central bank independence is the  turn over rate  of central bank governors  If a government is in the habit of appointing and replacing the governor frequently  it clearly has the capacity to micro manage the central bank through its choice of governors  It is argued that an independent central bank can run a more credible monetary policy  making market expectations more responsive to signals from the central bank  Recently  both the Bank of England  1997  and the European Central Bank have been made independent and follow a set of published inflation targets so that markets know what to expect  Even the People s Bank of China has been accorded great latitude due to the difficulty of problems it faces  though in the People s Republic of China the official role of the bank remains that of a national bank rather than a central bank  underlined by the official refusal to  unpeg  the yuan or to revalue it  under pressure   The People s Bank of China s independence can thus be read more as independence from the USA which rules the financial markets  than from the Communist Party of China which rules the country  The fact that the Communist Party is not elected also relieves the pressure to please people  increasing its independence  Governments generally have some degree of influence over even  independent  central banks  the aim of independence is primarily to prevent short term interference  For example  the chairman of the U S  Federal Reserve Bank is appointed by the President of the U S   all nominees for this post are recommended by the owners of the Federal Reserve  as are all the board members   and his choice must be confirmed by the Congress  International organizations such as the World Bank  the Bank for International Settlements  BIS  and the International Monetary Fund  IMF  are strong supporters of central bank independence  This results  in part  from a belief in the intrinsic merits of increased independence  The support for independence from the international organizations also derives partly from the connection between increased independence for the central bank and increased transparency in the policy making process  The IMF s Financial Services Action Plan  FSAP  review self assessment  for example  includes a number of questions about central bank independence in the transparency section  An independent central bank will score higher in the review than one that is not independent   edit  Criticism Main article  Criticism of fractional reserve banking According to the Austrian School of economics  central banking tends to wreak havoc on an economy by systematically devaluing a currency by over creating this currency against nothing of intrinsic value  such as gold   resulting in never ending inflation  The main opponents to fractional reserve banking are the proponents of the Austrian business cycle theory  including Ludwig von Mises  Friedrich Hayek and Murray Rothbard  11   edit  See also Fractional
