become producer of the film via his company Seed Productions  and earned  25 million for the film  2  Jackman underwent a high intensity weight training regimen to improve his physique for the role  He altered the program to shock his body into change and also performed cardiovascular workouts  Jackman noted no digital touches were applied to his physique in a shot of him rising from the tank within which Wolverine has his bones infused with adamantium  3  Troye Sivan as young James  Casting directors cast Sivan as the young Wolverine after seeing him sing at the Channel Seven Perth Telethon  and he was accepted after sending in an audition tape  4 Kodi Smit McPhee was originally cast in the role  when filming was originally beginning in December 2007  5  but he opted out to film The Road  6  Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed  Logan s half brother and fellow soldier  Jackman and Hood compared Wolverine and Sabretooth s relationship to the Borg McEnroe rivalry in the world of tennis  Victor hates him because he loved and needed his brother  but is too proud to admit he needs him back  7 Tyler Mane  who played him in X Men  had hoped to reprise the role  8  Jackman worked with Schreiber before  in the 2001 romantic comedy Kate  amp  Leopold and described him as having a competitive streak necessary to portray Sabretooth  They  egged  each other on set to perform more and more stunts  Schreiber put on 40 lb  18 kg  of muscle for the part  7  and described Sabretooth as the most monstrous role he ever played  As a child  he loved the Wolverine comics because of their unique  urban sensibility   Schreiber had studied to be a fight choreographer and wanted to be a dancer like Jackman  so he enjoyed working out their fight scenes  9  Michael James Olsen as young Victor Danny Huston as William Stryker  Huston was originally in negotiations for the part  10  while Brian Cox  who played the character in X2  wanted to reprise the role  He believed computer generated imagery  similar to the program applied to Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in the opening flashback of X Men  The Last Stand  would allow him to appear as the younger Stryker  11  Huston liked the complex Stryker  who  both loves and hates mutants because his son was a mutant and drove his wife to suicide  So he understands what they re going through  but despises their destructive force   He compared the character to a racehorse breeder  who rears his mutant experiments like children but abandons them when something goes wrong  His son is shown to be frozen at the Weapon X facility and the reason Stryker starts the Weapon XI program  7  Will i am as John Wraith  A teleporting mutant  It is Will i am s major live action film debut  Although he initially did not get on

scarred his knuckles after accidentally punching and breaking the camera  13  Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox  Wolverine s native American  Blackfoot Niits tapi  love interest and pawn of Stryker  She has the powers of tactile telepathy hypnosis  7  However  Victor is resistant immune to telepathy  Describing her role  Collins said  I had to play off all the guys and their testosterone heavy abilities  But I learned that the female powers of persuasion easily trump fangs and knives and guns   14  Collins being a  Texas native  played into her casting as a native American  15 Michelle Monaghan turned down the role because of scheduling conflicts  despite her enthusiasm to work with Jackman  16  Kevin Durand as Fred J  Dukes   The Blob  A mutant with a nearly indestructible layer of skin and the ability to create his own gravitational field  In the film s early sequences  he is a formidable fighting man  but years later  due to a poor diet  has gained an enormous amount of weight that gives him an invulnerability  7  A fan of the X Men movies  Durand contacted the producers for a role as soon as news of a new film came out  17  The suit went through six months of modifications  and had a tubing system inside to cool Durand down with ice water  18  Dominic Monaghan as Chris Bradley  A mutant who can manipulate electricity and a technopath  19  It was originally reported that Monaghan was going to play Barnell Bohusk   Beak  20  Taylor Kitsch as Remy LeBeau   Gambit  A Cajun thief who has the ability to charge any object he touches with kinetic energy  forcing it to explode  The size of the object determines the magnitude of the resulting explosion  7  He is also skilled in the use of a staff  and happens to be very agile  Due to the nature of his power  he displays supernatural durability  being able to take Wolverine s elbow to his face and return to fight moments later  When asked about his thoughts on the character  Kitsch had said   I knew of him  but I didn t know the following he had  I m sure I m still going to be exposed to that  I love the character  I love the powers  and I love what they did with him  I didn t know that much  but in my experience  it was a blessing to go in and create my take on him  I m excited for it  to say the least   21  Daniel Henney as Agent Zero  A member of the Weapon X program and an expert tracker with lethal sniper skills  7  An X Men fan  Henney liked the role of a villain because  there are no restrictions playing it  allowing you freely to express it  so you can act how you want to   22  He described the film as more realistic and cruder than the X Men trilogy  23  Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson  A wisecracking mercenary with lethal swordsmanship skill and athleticism  who later becomes Deadpool  Reynolds had been interested in playing the character in his own film since 2003  24  Originally  Reynolds was only going to cameo as Wilson but the role grew after he was cast  25  Reynolds did sword training for the character  and also worked out to get his physique comparable to Jackman s  26  Scott Adkins as Weapon XI   Deadpool  Weapon XI is the final antagonist of the film  having been genetically altered to be the ultimate mutant killer  He has powers taken from other mutants killed or kidnapped in the film  as well as retractable blades in his arms  Ryan Reynolds portrays Weapon XI for close ups  standing shots  and simple stunts while Scott Adkins is used for the more complicated and dangerous stunt work  27  Tim Pocock as Scott Summers  A mutant capable of emitting powerful beams of energy from his eyes  who will later become Cyclops  leader of the X Men  He is shown as a Weapon X captive as he is caught by Victor Creed  Pocock is a debuting screen actor who previously worked with Opera Australia  who decided to play the character as  his own  instead of following James Marsden s performance in the X Men trilogy  feeling that  he s a very different human being at that point in time  He s a teenager  What teenager is the same when they re 30 years old   Pocock also described Wolverine as being Cyclops   big transition moment   with the character going from a troubled teenager to a leader throughout the course of the film  28  Max Cullen and Julia Blake as Travis Hudson and Heather Hudson  An elderly couple who take care of Wolverine after his

A mutant with the power to turn her skin into diamond  who in the film is Silverfox s sister  29 X2 writer Dan Harris said that Sigourney Weaver would have played Emma Frost in X Men  The Last Stand if Bryan Singer had stayed on to direct  30  The film depiction of Emma does not exhibit the character s traditional telepathic abilities  The film includes numerous cameo appearances of younger versions of characters from the previous films  including Jason Stryker  William Stryker s lobotomized telepathic son whom he keeps in cryogenic suspension   31  There was a cameo for a young Storm  which can be seen in the trailer  but it was removed from the released film  32  A digitally rejuvenated Patrick Stewart also makes an uncredited cameo as a younger Charles Xavier who had not yet lost the use of his legs  33  Asher Keddie played Dr  Carol Frost  34  Poker player Daniel Negreanu has a cameo  Phil Hellmuth wanted to join him but was unable because he committed to an event in Toronto  35 X Men co creator Stan Lee said he would cameo  but ended up not appearing in the film  36   edit  Production  edit  Development David Benioff  a comic book fan  pursued the project for almost three years before he was hired to write the script in October 2004  37  38  In preparing to write the script  he reread Barry Windsor Smith s  Weapon X  story  as well as Chris Claremont and Frank Miller s 1982 limited series on the character  his favorite storyline   37  39  Also serving as inspiration was the 2001 limited series Origin  which reveals Wolverine s life before Weapon X  40  Jackman collaborated on the script  which he wanted to be more of a character piece compared with the previous X Men films  41 Skip Woods  who had written Hitman for Fox  was later hired to revise and rewrite Benioff s script  42  Benioff aimed for a  darker and a bit more brutal  story  writing it with an R rating in mind  although he acknowledged the film s final tone would rest with the producers and director  37  Jackman did not see the need for an R rating  43  The film s final rating was PG 13  44  Deadpool had been developed for his own film by Reynolds and David S  Goyer at New Line Cinema in 2003  but the project fell apart as they focused on Blade  Trinity and an aborted spin off  24  Benioff wrote the character into the script in a manner Jackman described as fun  but would also deviate from some of his traits  Similarly  Gambit was a character who the filmmakers had tried to put in the previous X Men films  Jackman liked Gambit because he is a  loose cannon  like Wolverine  stating their relationship echoes that of Wolverine and Pyro in the original trilogy  3 David Ayer contributed to the script  45  Benioff finished his draft in October 2006  and Jackman stated there would be a year before shooting  46  as he was scheduled to start filming Australia during 2007  47  Before the 2007 2008 Writers Guild of America strike began  James Vanderbilt and Scott Silver were hired for a last minute rewrite  48  Gavin Hood was announced as director of the project in July 2007 for a 2008 release  49  Previously  X Men and X2 director Bryan Singer and X Men  The Last Stand director Brett Ratner were interested in returning to the franchise  50  51  while Alexandre Aja and Len Wiseman also wanted the job  52  53 Zack Snyder  who was approached for The Last Stand  turned down this film because he was directing Watchmen  54  Jackman saw parallels between Logan and the main character in Hood s previous film Tsotsi  7  Hood explained that while he was not a comic book fan  he  realized that the character of Wolverine  I think his great appeal lies in the fact that he s someone who in some ways  is filled with a great deal of self loathing by his own nature and he s constantly at war with his own nature   55  The director described the film s themes as focusing on Wolverine s inner struggle between his animalistic savagery and noble human qualities  Hood enjoyed the previous films  but set out to give the spin off a different feel  56  In October  Fox announced a May 1  2009  release date and the X Men Origins prefix  10   edit  Filming Preliminary shooting took place at the Fox Studios Australia in Sydney  during late 2007  57 Principal photography began on January 18  2008 58  in New Zealand  One of the filming locations that was selected was Dunedin  59  Controversy arose as the Queenstown Lakes District Council disputed the Department of Labour s decision to allow Fox to store explosives in the local ice skating rink  Fox moved some of the explosives to another area  60  The explosives were used for a shot of the exploding Hudson Farm  a scene which required four cameras  61  Jackman and Palermo s Woz Productions reached an agreement with the council to allow recycling specialists on set to advise the production on being environmentally friendly  62  Filming continued at Fox  where most of the shooting was done  and New Orleans  Louisiana  10 Cockatoo Island was used for Stryker s facility  the enormous buildings there saved money on digitally expanding a set  7  Production of the film was predicted to generate A 60 million for Sydney s economy  63  Principal photography ended by May 23  The second unit continued filming in New Zealand until March 23  and were scheduled to continue filming for two weeks following the first unit s wrap  64  This included a flashback to Logan during the Normandy Landings  which was shot at Blacksmiths  New South Wales  65  Hood and Fox were in dispute on the film s direction  One of the disputes involved the depiction of Wolverine as an Army veteran with post traumatic stress disorder  with the executives arguing that audiences would not be interested in such heavy themes  66  The studio had two replacements lined up before Richard Donner  husband of producer Lauren Shuler Donner  flew to Australia to ease on set tensions  67  Hood remarked   Out of healthy and sometimes very rigorous debate  things get better        I hope the film s better because of the debates  If nobody were talking about us  we d be in trouble   7  Hood added he and Thomas Rothman were both  forceful  personalities in creative meetings but they had never had a  stand up  argument  68  In January 2009  after delays due to weather and scheduling conflicts  such as Hugh Jackman s publicity commitments for Australia  production moved to Vancouver  mostly at Lord Byng Secondary School and in University of British Columbia  69  70  Work there included finishing scenes with Ryan Reynolds  who had been working on two other films during principal photography  71  Gavin Hood has announced that multiple  secret endings  exist for the film and that the endings will differ from print to print of the film  72  One version shows Wolverine drinking in a Japanese bar  The bartender asked if he is drinking to forget  Logan replies that he is drinking to remember  73  The other shows Weapon XI on the rubble of the destroyed tower  trying to touch his severed head  74   edit  Effects More than 1 000 shots of Wolverine have visual effects in them  which required three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies to work on the film  75  The most prominent was Hydraulx  who had also worked in the X Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit s powers  Many elements were totally generated through computer generated imagery  such as the adamantium injection machine  the scene with Gambit s plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws  75  CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close ups  76  Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made  with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes  75  76   edit  Music X Men Origins  Wolverine Film score by Harry Gregson Williams Released April 28  2009  2009 04 28  77  Genre Film score Length 45 32

Christopher Coleman of Tracksounds com  Gregson Williams said that Gavin Hood attracted him to the project  adding   I happened to meet him at the Golden Globes dinner about three years ago  That night we were both nominees  but both losers  He had been nominated for Tsotsi and during the dinner I had spoken to him and he seemed like a really smart and creative guy   and into music  So I was really delighted when I got a call to meet him and discuss the possibilities for Wolverine   79  In late March 2009  Jon Burlingame of Variety was at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th century Fox to listen and report on the recording of the score  80  Gregson Williams conducted  a 78 piece orchestra and a 40 voice choir  20 male  20 female   to achieve the sound  80  At the time of his visit  Burlingame noted that the choir was singing  stanzas from an ancient Norse poem in Old Icelandic  to underscore what would be first track   Logan Through Time   80  Director Gavin Hood commented on Gregson Williams  style  saying   Harry s challenge is to give us operatic scale  but also keep it intimate and human  Harry s music has a kind of muscular confidence and strength that is very useful for the action  but he also has tremendous soul   80  Hood also called the recording performance  frigging brilliant   80   edit  Release  edit  Leaked workprint On March 31  2009  a full length DVD quality workprint of the film without a timecode or watermark  with some unfinished effects shots  a different typeface for titles and casting  and alternate sound effects was leaked online  81  82  83  The studio said it would be able to determine the source of the leak using forensic marks in the workprint  The FBI and MPAA began investigating the illegal posting  82  Fox estimated the workprint was downloaded roughly 4 5 million times by the time Wolverine was released in theaters  84  The print contained a reference to Rising Sun Pictures  an Australian visual effects company working on the film  81  The company denied that they ever had a full copy of the film  85  Executive producer Thomas Rothman noted the leaked version lacked the ten minutes added during pick ups in January 2009  83  85  However  the theatrical version of the film has no extra scenes that were not included in the leaked workprint  86  Both versions run exactly 107 minutes  but director Gavin Hood said  another ending exists that features the film s villain   83  Roger Friedman  a gossip reporter for Fox News a channel also owned by Fox s parent company News Corporation was fired for writing a review of the film using the leaked copy he downloaded from the Internet  87  He described how easy it was to find and download the film even if the original source of the leak was no longer available on the web  The article he wrote for his column on the Fox News website was immediately removed  88   edit  Marketing Among the companies which provided tie in merchandising were 7 Eleven  89 Papa

people who would get interested in Wolverine comics after watching the film  94  Raven Software developed a video game based on the film with the same name  which Activision Blizzard published  95 Marc Guggenheim wrote the script  96  while Hugh Jackman  Liev Schreiber  97  and will i am voiced their characters from the film  98  The storyline goes beyond the one from the film  including other villains from the comics such as the Sentinels and the Wendigo  99  as well as the appearance of Mystique  who was in the other three X Men films  100  In December 2009  Hot Toys released the 12 inch

Republic  and May 1  2009 in the United States and Canada  A contest was held on the official website to determine the location of the world premiere on April 27  In the end  the Harkins at the Tempe Marketplace in Tempe  Arizona won the premiere  101  The release in Mexico was delayed until the end of May due to an outbreak of H1N1 flu in the country  102  On April 22  nine days before the release of the film  it was reported that X Men Origins  Wolverine was outselling Iron Man  3 to 1 at the same point in the sales cycle  nine days prior to the film s release    103  Hugh Jackman at the Tempe Premiere  During its first day of wide release  Wolverine took in an estimated  35 million  104  with almost  5 million of that from midnight showings  105  The earnings placed the film as

Stand  as well as X2  but higher than X Men  the first film in the series  107  The worldwide opening was over  158 1 million  but Fox stated that some markets underperformed  mostly due to the leaked workprint in countries with illegal downloading problems  84  However  in an article for the  piracy issue  of Screen International magazine  film critic John Hazelton was doubtful of this explanation  writing that the film s initial performance was  uncertain  as the outbreak of swine flu in territories with the worst piracy problems means that other territories did not compare at all  108  While

the film with a 37  approval rating based on 249 reviews  with an average rating of 5 1 10  The site s consensus is  Though Hugh Jackman gives his all  he can t help X Men Origins  Wolverine overcome a cliche ridden script and familiar narrative   115  Comparatively  Yahoo  Movies currently reports a grade of  C   averaged from 13 critic reviews  116  Richard Corliss of TIME commented on the film s standing among other Marvel films  saying that it is  an O K   not great  Marvel movie that tells the early story of the prime X Man  and attempts to make it climax in a perfect coupling with the start of the known trilogy   He also said that  superhero mythologies can be so complicated  only a lonely comic book reading kid could make sense of it all   117  James Mullinger of GQ also commented on the structure of the story in saying that the  film clumsily tries to explain the origins of James  Howlett   AKA Wolverine  which had wisely only ever been briefly referred to in the original X Men saga  In doing so  it creates a fairly bland plot which is full of holes   118  Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was generally more favorable towards Origins  stating  Fortunately  Jackman is well matched with Schreiber  who can sneer with the best of them and wears fangs well  The two have three spectacular battles together before squaring off against a formidable enemy atop a nuclear reactor   119  Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor also praised Jackman s performance  saying that  Hugh Jackman demonstrates that you can segue effortlessly from a tuxedoed song and dance man at the Oscars to a feral gent with adamantium claws and berserker rage   120  Claudia Puig of USA Today considered the movie  well acted  with spectacular action and witty one liners   121  Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and expressed his views on the title character   Why should I care about this guy  He feels no pain and nothing can kill him  so therefore he s essentially a story device for action sequences   44 James Berardinelli gave Wolverine two and a half stars out of four  calling the action scenes competently executed but not memorable  and considering that when dealing with Wolverine s past  there s little creativity evident in the way those blanks are filled in   and that the revelations made Wolverine  less compelling   122  Comparatively  Bill Gibron of AMC s Filmcritic com website gave the film a positive  4 0 out of 5 stars   saying that although Hugh Jackman is  capable of carrying even the most mediocre effort  he singlehandedly makes X Men Origins  Wolverine an excellent start to the summer 2009 season   He did however predict that  there will be purists who balk at how Hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate the mythology   and further said that  any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for can t really seal the full entertainment deal   123  Regarding Wolverine within the context of the X Men film series  Tom Charity of CNN commented   Serviceable but inescapably redundant  this Wolverine movie does just enough to keep the X Men franchise on life support  but the filmmakers will have to come up with some evolutionary changes soon if it s going to escape X tinction   124  Similarly  A  O  Scott of The New York Times expressed that  X Men Origins  Wolverine will most likely manage to cash in on the popularity of the earlier episodes  but it is the latest evidence that the superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue   125  On a more negative note  Philip French of The Observer said that the film s  dull  bone crushing  special effects stuff  is  of interest only to hardcore fans who ve probably read it all in Marvel comics   126  Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph stated that  Wolverine is an artificial stimulus package of the most unsatisfying kind  Aggressively advertised and hyped to the hills  it will no doubt attract full houses at first  after that though  when word of mouth buzz kill goes into overdrive  there s bound to be widespread deflation and a palpable feeling of being conned   127  Similarly  Orlando Parfitt of IGN  UK  praised the performances of the actors and the action scenes  but stated that the film felt underdeveloped   There s an enjoyable time to be had with Wolverine  but it s also somewhat unsatisfying   128  Furthermore  Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post gave the film a grade of  D   noting that  Wolverine was the lead character of  the X Men  films  and we ve already learned everything we need to know from the films in said franchise   adding that  the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan Wolverine less interesting   129  Trevan McGee of Ink also commented on the supporting cast  saying  the movie bends over backward trying to inject as many cameos and secondary characters into the movie as possible  The mutants invented for the movie are uninspired and boring     130   edit  Sequel Main article  X Men  film series  The Wolverine  edit  References   a b c  X Men Origins  Wolverine  2009    Box Office Mojo  http   boxofficemojo com
