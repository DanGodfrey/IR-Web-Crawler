Culture of the United States From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia Jump to  navigation  search Edward Hopper s 1942 painting Nighthawks depicts a typical American diner and is an example of increased self confidence in the unique elements in American culture The culture of the United States is a Western culture originally influenced by European cultures  It has been developing since long before the United States became a country with its own unique social and cultural characteristics such as dialect  music  arts  social habits  cuisine  and folklore  Today  the United States of America is an ethnically and racially diverse country as a result of large scale immigration from many different countries throughout its history  1  Its chief early influences came from English  Scottish and Irish settlers of colonial America  British culture  due to colonial ties with Britain that spread the English language  legal system and other cultural inheritances  had a formative influence  Other important influences came from other parts of western Europe  especially Germany  2 France  and Italy  citation needed  Original elements also play a strong role  such as the invention of Jeffersonian Democracy  3  Thomas Jefferson s Notes on the State of Virginia was perhaps the first influential domestic cultural critique by an American and a reactionary piece to the prevailing European consensus that America s domestic originality was degenerate  3  Prevalent ideas and ideals which evolved domestically such as national holidays  uniquely American sports  military tradition  and innovations in the arts and entertainment give a strong sense of national pride among the population as a whole  citation needed  American culture includes both conservative and liberal elements  military and scientific competitiveness  political structures  risk taking and free expression  materialist and moral elements  Despite certain consistent ideological principles  e g  individualism  egalitarianism  and faith in freedom and democracy   American culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic diversity  The flexibility of U S  culture and its highly symbolic nature lead some researchers to categorize American culture as a mythic identity  4  others see it as American exceptionalism  It also includes elements which evolved from Native Americans  and other ethnic subcultures  most prominently the culture of African Americans and different cultures from Latin America  Many cultural elements  especially popular culture  have been exported across the globe through modern mass media  The United States has often been thought of as a melting pot  but recent developments tend towards cultural diversity  pluralism and the image of a salad bowl rather than a melting pot  5  6  Due to the extent of American culture there are many integrated but unique social subcultures within the United States  The cultural affiliations an individual in the United States may have commonly depend on social class  political orientation and a multitude of demographic characteristics such as religious background  occupation and ethnic group membership  1  Part of a series

States Although the United States has no official language at the federal level  30 states have passed legislation making English the official language and it is considered to be the de facto national language  According to the 2000 U S  Census  more than 97  of Americans can speak English well  and for 81  it is the only language spoken at home  There are more than 300 languages besides English which can claim native speakers in the United States some of which are spoken by the indigenous peoples  about 150 living languages  and others which were imported by immigrants  Spanish has official status in the commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the state of New Mexico  Spanish is the primary spoken language in Puerto Rico and various smaller linguistic enclaves  7  According to the 2000 census  there are nearly 30 million native speakers of Spanish in the United States  Bilingual speakers may use both English and Spanish reasonably well but code switch according to their dialog partner or context  Some refer to this phenomenon as Spanglish  Indigenous languages of the United States include the Native American languages  which are spoken on the country s numerous Indian reservations and Native American cultural events such as pow wows  Hawaiian  which has official status in the state of Hawaii  Chamorro  which has official status in the commonwealths of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands  Carolinian  which has official status in the commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands  and Samoan  which has official status in the commonwealth of American Samoa  American Sign Language  used mainly by the deaf  is also native to the country  The national dialect is known as American English  There are four major regional dialects in the United States  northeastern  south  inland north  and midwestern  The Midwestern accent  considered the  standard accent  in the United States  and analogous in some respects to the received pronunciation elsewhere in the English speaking world  extends from what were once the  Middle Colonies  across the Midwest to the Pacific states  citation needed   edit  Native language statistics for the United States The following information is

Nuestra Se ora de la Pur sima Concepci n de Acu a is one of numerous surviving colonial Spanish missions in the United States  These were primarily used to convert the Native Americans to Roman Catholicism  Brick Presbyterian Church in suburban East Orange  New Jersey Among developed countries  the U S  is one of the most religious  primarily Christian  in terms of its demographics  According to a 2002 study by the Pew Global Attitudes Project  the U S  was the only developed nation in the survey where a majority of citizens reported that religion played a  very important  role in their lives  an attitude similar to that found in its neighbors in Latin America  9  Today  governments at the national  state  and local levels are secular institution  with what is often called the  separation of church and state  prevailing  But like federal politics  the topic of religion in the United States can cause an emotionally heated debate over moral  ethical and legal issues affecting Americans of all faiths in everyday life  such as polarizing issues of abortion  gay marriage and what is considered obscenity  citation needed  Several of the original Thirteen Colonies were established by English and Irish settlers who wished to practice their own religion without discrimination or persecution  Pennsylvania was established by Quakers  Maryland by Roman Catholics and the Massachusetts Bay Colony by Puritans  The first bible printed in a European language in the Colonies was by German immigrant Christopher Sauer  10  Nine of the thirteen colonies had official public religions  Yet by the time of the Philadelphia Convention of 1787  the United States became one of the first countries in the world to codify freedom of religion into law  although this originally applied only to the federal government  and not to state governments or their political subdivisions  citation needed  Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom  the framers of the United States Constitution rejected any religious test for office  and the First Amendment specifically denied the central government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion  or prohibiting its free exercise  In following decades  the animating spirit behind the constitution s Establishment Clause led to the disestablishment of the official religions within the member states  The framers were mainly influenced by secular  Enlightenment ideals  but they also considered the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups who did not want to be under the power or influence of a state religion that did not represent them  11 Thomas Jefferson  author of the Declaration of Independence said  The priest has been hostile to liberty  He is always in alliance with the despot   12   edit  Religious statistics for the United States It should be noted the following information is an estimation as actual statistics constantly vary  According to the CIA  13  the following is the percentage of followers of different religions in the United States  Christian   80 2   Protestant  51 3   Roman Catholic  23

States and Educational attainment in the United States Higher education in the US by race Education in the United States is provided mainly by government  with control and funding coming from three levels  federal  state  and local  School attendance is mandatory and nearly universal at the elementary and high school levels  often known outside the United States as the primary and secondary levels   citation needed  Students have the options of having their education held in public schools  private schools  or home school  In most public and private schools  education is divided into three levels  elementary school  junior high school  also often called middle school   and high school  In almost all schools at these levels  children are divided by age groups into grades  Post secondary education  better known as  college  or  university  in the United States  is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system  In the year 2000  there were 76 6 million students enrolled in schools from kindergarten through graduate schools  Of these  72 percent aged 12 to 17 were judged academically  on track  for their age  enrolled in school at or above grade level   Of those enrolled in compulsory education  5 2 million  10 4 percent  were attending private schools  Among the country s adult population  over 85 percent have completed high school and 27 percent have received a bachelor s degree or higher  citation needed   edit  Race and ancestry Main article  Race in the United States Median Household income along ethnic lines in the United States  Race in the United States is based on physical characteristics and skin color and has played an essential part in shaping American society even before the nation s conception  1  Until the civil rights movement of the 1960s  racial minorities in the United States faced discrimination and social as well as economic marginalization  14  Today the U S  Department of Commerce s Bureau of the Census recognizes four races  Native American or American Indian  African American  Asian and White  European American   According to the U S  government  Hispanic Americans do not constitute a race  but rather an ethnic group  During the 2000 U S  Census Whites made up 75 1  of the population with those being Hispanic or Latino constituting the nation s prevalent minority with 12 5  of the population  African Americans made up 12 3  of the total population  3 6  were Asian American and 0 7  were Native American  15  The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified on December 6  1865 which abolished slavery in the United States  The northern states had outlawed slavery in their territory in the late 18th and early 19th century although their industrial economies relied on the raw materials produced by slaves  Following the Reconstruction period in the 1870s  an apartheid regulation emerged in the Southern states named the Jim Crow laws that provided for legal segregation  Lynching was practiced throughout the U S   including in the Northern states  until the 1930s  while continuing well into the civil rights movement in the South  14  Chinese Americans were earlier marginalized as well during a significant proportion of U S  history  Between 1882 and 1943 the United States instituted the Chinese Exclusion Act barring Chinese immigrants from entering the U S  During the second world war roughly 120 000 Japanese Americans  62  of whom were U S  citizens  16  were imprisoned in Japanese internment camps by the U S  government following the attacks on Pearl Harbor  an American Military Base  by Japanese troops  Hispanic Americans also used to face segregation and other forms of discrimination  Although not proscribed by the law  they were regularly subject to second class citizen status  Due to exclusion from or marginalization by earlier mainstream society  there emerged a unique sub culture among the racial minorities in the United States  During the 1920s  Harlem  New York became home to the Harlem Renaissance  Music styles such as Jazz  Blues  Rap  Rock and roll as well as numerous folk songs such as Blue Tail Fly  Jimmy Crack Corn  originated within the realms of African American culture  and was later on adopted by the mainstream  14  Chinatowns can be found in many cities across the country and Asian cuisine has become a common staple in mainstream America  The Hispanic community has also had a dramatic impact on American culture  Today  Catholics are the largest religious denomination in the United States and out number Protestants in the South west and California  17  Mariachi music and Mexican cuisine are commonly found throughout the Southwest  with some Latin dishes  such as burritos and tacos  found anywhere in the nation  Economic variance and substantive segregation  is commonplace in the United States  Asian Americans have median household income and educational attainment exceeding that of other races  African Americans  Hispanics and Native Americans have considerably lower income and education than do White Americans or Asian Americans  18  19  In 2005 the median household income of Whites was 62 5  higher than that of African American  nearly one quarter of whom live below the poverty line  18  46 9  of homicide victims in the United States are African American  14  20  The concept that blackness was ugly degraded African Americans  manifesting itself as internalized racism  citation needed  21 In the 1960s  the Black is Beautiful cultural movement sought to dispel this notion  22  After the attacks by Muslim terrorists  on September 11  discrimination against Arabs and Muslims in the U S  had risen significantly  The American Arab Anti Discrimination Committee  ADC  reported an increase in hate speech  cases of airline discrimination  hate crimes  police misconduct as well as racial profiling  23  The USA PATRIOT Act  signed into effect by President Bush on October 26  2001  has also raised concerns for violating civil liberties  Section 412 of the act provides the government with  sweeping new powers to detain foreign nationals and immigrants indefinitely with little or no due process at the discretion of the Attorney General   23  Other sections also allow the government to conduct secret searches  seizures  and surveillance  and to freely interpret the definition of  terrorist activities   citation needed   edit  Literature Mark Twain is regarded as among the greatest writers in American history  Main article  Literature of the United States The right to freedom of expression in the American constitution can be traced to German immigrant John Peter Zenger and his legal fight to make truthful publications in the Colonies a protected legal right  ultimately paving the way for the protected rights of American authors  24  25  In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries  American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe  During its early history  America was a series of British colonies on the eastern coast of the present day United States  Therefore  its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature  However  unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition  citation needed  America s first internationally popular writers were James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving in the early nineteenth century  They painted an American literary landscape full of humor and adventure  These were followed by Nathaniel Hawthorne  Edgar Allan Poe  Herman Melville  Ralph Waldo Emerson  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Henry David Thoreau who established a distinctive American literary voice in the middle of the nineteenth century  Mark Twain  Henry James  and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century s second half  Emily Dickinson  virtually unknown during her lifetime  would be recognized as America s other essential poet  Eleven U S  citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature  including John Steinbeck  William Faulkner  Eugene O Neil  Pearl S  Buck  T S  Eliot and Sinclair Lewis  Ernest Hemingway  the 1954 Nobel laureate  is often named as one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century  26  A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character such as Herman Melville s Moby Dick  1851   Twain s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  1885   and F  Scott Fitzgerald s The Great Gatsby  1925  may be dubbed the  Great American Novel   Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction were developed in the United States   edit  National Holidays Fireworks light up the sky over the Washington Monument  Americans traditionally shoot fireworks throughout the night on the Fourth of July  Martin Luther King Day memorializes the

albeit celebrated in a secular manner by many Americans today  Independence Day  colloquially known as the Fourth of July  celebrates the anniversary of the country s Declaration of Independence from Great Britain  It is generally observed by parades throughout the day and the shooting of fireworks at night  Halloween is thought to have evolved from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain which was

date of the commemoration of Washington s Birthday from February 22 to the third Monday in February  Many people now refer to this holiday as  Presidents  Day  and consider it a day honoring all American presidents  However  neither the Uniform Holidays Act nor any subsequent law changed the name of the holiday from Washington s Birthday to Presidents  Day  27  Last Monday in May Memorial Day

Federal Holidays Calendars from the federal Office of Personnel Management   edit  Cuisine Main article  Cuisine of the United States The cuisine of the United States is extremely diverse  owing to the vastness of the continent  the relatively large population  1 3 of a billion people  and the number of native and immigrant influences  Mainstream American culinary arts are similar to those in other Western countries  Wheat is the primary cereal grain  Traditional American cuisine uses ingredients such as turkey  white tailed deer venison  potatoes  sweet potatoes  corn  squash  and maple syrup  indigenous foods employed by American Indians and early European settlers  Slow cooked pork and beef barbecue  crab cakes  potato chips  cotton candy and chocolate chip cookies are distinctively American styles  citation needed  The types of food served at home vary greatly and depend upon the region of the country and the family s own cultural heritage  Recent immigrants tend to eat food similar to that of their country of origin  and Americanized versions of these cultural foods  such as American Chinese cuisine or Italian American cuisine often eventually appear  an example is Vietnamese cuisine  Korean cuisine and Thai cuisine  German cuisine has a profound impact on American cuisine  especially mid western cuisine  with potatoes  noodles  roasts  stews and cakes pastries being the most iconic ingredients in both cuisines  6  Dishes such as the hamburger  pot roast  baked ham and hot dogs are examples of American dishes derived from German cuisine  31  32  Different regions of the United States have their own cuisine and styles of cooking  The state of Louisiana  for example  is known for its Cajun and Creole cooking  Cajun and Creole cooking are influenced by French  Acadian  and Haitian cooking  although the dishes themselves are original and unique  Examples include Crawfish Etouffee  Red Beans and Rice  Seafood or Chicken Gumbo  Jambalaya  and Boudin  Italian  German  Hungarian and Chinese influences  traditional Native American  Caribbean  Mexican and Greek dishes have also diffused into the general American repertoire  It is not uncommon for a  middle class  family from  middle America  to eat  for example  restaurant pizza  home made pizza  enchiladas con carne  chicken paprikas  beef stroganof and bratwurst with sauerkraut for dinner throughout a single week  Soul food  developed by African slaves  is popular around the South and among many African Americans elsewhere  Syncretic cuisines such as Louisiana creole  Cajun  Pennsylvania Dutch  and Tex Mex are regionally important  Iconic American dishes such as apple pie  fried chicken  pizza  hamburgers  and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants and domestic innovations  So called French fries  Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos  and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are consumed  33  Americans generally prefer coffee to tea  with more than half the adult population drinking at least one cup a day  34  Marketing by U S  industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk  now often fat reduced  ubiquitous breakfast beverages  35  During the 1980s and 1990s  Americans  caloric intake rose 24   33  frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what health officials call the American  obesity

themselves as middle class  American society and its culture are considerably fragmented  1  37  38  Social class  generally described as a combination of educational attainment  income and occupational prestige  is one of the greatest cultural influences in America  1  Nearly all cultural aspects of mundane interactions and consumer behavior in the U S  are guided by a person s location within the country s social structure  Distinct lifestyles  consumption patterns and values are associated with different classes  Early sociologist economist Thorstein Veblen  for example  noted that those at the very top of the social ladder engage in conspicuous leisure as well as conspicuous consumption  Upper middle class persons commonly identify education and being cultured as prime values  Persons in this particular social class tend to speak in a more direct manner that projects authority  knowledge and thus credibility  They often tend to engage in the consumption of so called mass luxuries  such as designer label clothing  A strong preference for natural materials and organic foods as well as a strong health consciousness tend to be prominent features of the upper middle class  Middle class individuals in general value expanding one s horizon  partially because they are more educated and can afford greater leisure and travels  Working class individuals take great pride in doing what they consider to be  real work   and keep very close knit kin networks that serve as a safeguard against frequent economic instability  1  38  39  Working class Americans as well as many of those in the middle class may also face occupation alienation  In contrast to upper middle class professionals who are mostly hired to conceptualize  supervise and share their thoughts  many Americans have little autonomy or creative latitude in the workplace  40  As a result white collar professionals tend to be significantly more satisfied with their work  1  40  More recently those in the center of the income strata  who may still identify as middle class  have faced increasing economic insecurity  41  supporting the idea of a working class majority  39  Political behavior is affected by class  more affluent individuals are more likely to vote  and education and income affect whether individuals tend to vote for the Democratic or Republican party  Income also had a significant impact on health as those with higher incomes had better access to health care facilities  higher life expectancy  lower infant mortality rate and increased health consciousness  citation needed  This is particularly noticeable with black voters who are often socially conservative  yet overwhelmingly vote Democratic  42  43  44  Hours worked in different countries according to UN data in a CNN report  45  In the United States occupation is one of the prime factors of social class and is closely linked to an individual s identity  The average work week in the U S  for those employed full time was 42 9 hours long with 30  of the population working more than 40 hours a week  46  The Average American worker earned  16 64 an hour in the first two quarters of 2006  47  Overall Americans worked more than their counterparts in other developed post industrial nations  While the average worker in Denmark enjoyed 30 days of vacation annually  the average American had 16 annual vacation days  48  In 2000 the average American worked 1 978 hours per year  500 hours more than the average German  yet 100 hours less than the average Czech  Overall the U S  labor force was the most productive in the world  overall  not by hour worked   largely due to its workers working more than those in any other post industrial country  excluding South Korea   45  Americans generally hold working and being productive in high regard  being busy as and working extensively may also serve as the means to obtain esteem  39   edit  Housing Immediately after World War II  Americans began living in increasing numbers in the suburbs  belts around major cities with higher density than rural areas  but much lower than urban areas  This move has been attributed to many factors such as the automobile  the availability of large tracts of land  the convenience of more and longer paved roads  the increasing violence in urban centers  see white flight   and the cheapness of housing  These new single family houses were usually one or two stories tall  and often were part of large contracts of homes built by a single developer  The resulting low density development has been given the pejorative label  urban sprawl   This is changing  however   White flight  is reversing  with many Yuppies and upper middle class  empty nest Baby Boomers returning to urban living  usually in condominiums  such as in New York City s Lower East Side  and Chicago s South Loop  The result has been the displacement of many poorer  inner city residents   see gentrification   American cities with housing prices near the national median have also been losing the middle income neighborhoods  those with median income between 80  and 120  of the metropolitan area s median household income  Here  the more affluent members of the middle class  who are also often referred to as being professional or upper middle class  have left in search of larger homes in more exclusive suburbs  This trend is largely attributed to the so called  Middle class squeeze   which has caused a starker distinction between the statistical middle class and the more privileged members of the middle class  49  In more expensive areas such as California  however  another trend has been taking place where an influx of more affluent middle class households has displaced those in the actual middle of society and converted former middle middle class neighborhoods into upper middle class neighborhoods  49  The population of rural areas has been declining over time as more and more people migrate to cities for work and entertainment  The great exodus from the farms came in the 1940s  in recent years fewer than 2  of the population lives on farms  though others live in the countryside and commute to work   Electricity and telephone  and sometimes cable and Internet services are available to all but the most remote regions  As in the cities  children attend school up to and including high school and only help with farming during the summer months or after school  citation needed  Tract housing in Kentucky near Cincinnati  Ohio About half of Americans now live in what is known as the suburbs  The suburban nuclear family has been identified as part of the  American dream   a married couple with children owning a house in the suburbs  This archetype is reinforced by mass media  religious practices  and government policies and is based on traditions from Anglo Saxon cultures  One of the biggest differences in suburban living as compared to urban living is the housing occupied by the families  The suburbs are filled with single family homes separated from retail districts  industrial areas  and sometimes even public schools  However  many American suburbs are incorporating these districts on smaller scales  attracting more people to these communities  Housing in urban areas may include more apartments and semi attached homes than in the suburbs or small towns  Aside from housing  the major difference from suburban living is the density and diversity of many different subcultures  as well as retail and manufacturing buildings mixed with housing in urban areas   edit  Technology  gadgets  and automobiles Further information  United States technological and industrial history and Passenger vehicles in the United States Americans  by and large  are often fascinated by new technology and new gadgets  Many of the new technological innovations in the modern world were either first invented in the United States and or first widely adopted by Americans  Examples include  the lightbulb  the airplane  the transistor  nuclear power  the personal computer  video games and online shopping  as well as the development of the Internet  The rise of suburbs and the need for workers to commute to cities brought about the popularization of automobiles  In 2001  90  of Americans drove to work in cars  50  Lower energy and land costs favor the production of relatively large  powerful cars  The culture in the 1950s and 1960s often catered to the automobile with motels and drive in restaurants  Americans tend to view obtaining a driver s license as a rite of passage  Outside of relatively few urban areas  it is considered a necessity for most Americans to own and drive cars  New York City is the only locality in the United States where more than half of all households do not own a car  50   edit  Race relations Main Articles  Racism  Race relations in the United States and Race in the United States  The origins of racism and inequality dates back to slavery citation needed   as African Americans are mostly descendants of African slaves imported to the United States  Slavery was partially abolished by the Emancipation Proclamation issued by president Abraham Lincoln in 1862 for slaves in the Southeastern United States during the Civil War and the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America  Slavery was rendered illegal by the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United

Divorce is the province of state governments  so divorce law varies from state to state  Prior to the 1970s  divorcing spouses had to allege that the other spouse was guilty of a crime or sin like abandonment or adultery  when spouses simply could not get along  lawyers were forced to manufacture  uncontested  divorces  The no fault divorce revolution began in 1969 in California  South Dakota was the last state to allow no fault divorce  in 1985  No fault divorce on the grounds of  irreconcilable differences  is now available in all states  However  many states have recently required separation periods prior to a formal divorce decree  State law provides for child support where children are involved  and sometimes for alimony   Married adults now divorce two and a half times as

funeral home within a couple days of the death of a loved one  The body of the deceased may be embalmed and dressed in fine clothing if there will be an open casket viewing  Traditional Jewish and Muslim practice include a ritual bath and no embalming  Friends  relatives and acquaintances gather  often from distant parts of the country  to  pay their last respects  to the deceased  Flowers are brought to the coffin and sometimes eulogies  elegies  personal anecdotes or group prayers are recited  Otherwise  the attendees sit  stand or kneel in quiet contemplation or prayer  Kissing the corpse on the forehead is typical among Italian Americans 62  and others  Condolences are also offered to the widow or widower and other close relatives  A funeral may be held immediately afterwards or the next day  The funeral ceremony varies according to religion and culture  American Catholics typically hold a funeral mass in a church  which sometimes takes the form of a Requiem mass  Jewish Americans may hold a service in a synagogue or temple  Pallbearers carry the coffin of the deceased to the hearse  which then proceeds in a procession to the place of final repose  usually a cemetery  The unique Jazz funeral of New Orleans features joyous and raucous music and dancing during the procession  Mount Auburn Cemetery  founded in 1831  is known as  America s first garden cemetery   63  American cemeteries created since are distinctive for their park like setting  Rows of graves are covered by lawns and are interspersed with trees and flowers  Headstones  mausoleums  statuary or simple plaques typically mark off the individual graves  Cremation is another common practice in the United States  though it is frowned upon by various religions  The ashes of the deceased are usually placed in an urn  which may be kept in a private house  or they are interred  Sometimes the ashes are released into the atmosphere  The  sprinkling  or  scattering  of the ashes may be part of an informal ceremony  often taking place at a scenic natural feature  a cliff  lake or mountain  that was favored by the deceased  A so called death industry has developed in the United States that has replaced earlier  more informal traditions  Before the popularity of funeral homes  people usually held wakes in private houses  citation needed   edit  Household arrangements Further information

married adults with a biological child   single parent families  childless childfree couples  and fused families now constitute the majority of families  citation needed  Most Americans will marry and

American family arrangements include dual income earner households and delayed independence among American youths  Whereas most families in the 1950s and 1960s relied on one income earner  most commonly the husband  the vast majority of family households now have two income earners  citation needed  Another change is the increasing age at which young Americans leave their parental home  Traditionally  a person past  college age  who lived with their parent s  was viewed negatively  but today it is not uncommon for children to live with their parents until their mid twenties  This trend can be mostly attributed to rising living costs that far exceed those in decades past  Thus  many young adults now remain with their parents well past their mid 20s  This topic was a cover article of TIME magazine in 2005  citation needed  Exceptions to the custom of leaving home in one s mid 20s can occur especially among Italian and Hispanic Americans  and in expensive urban real

the Southern United States  the Midwestern United States and the Western United States an area that can be further subdivided  on the basis of the local culture into the Pacific States and the Mountain States  The western coast of the continental U S  consisting of California  Oregon  and the state of Washington is also sometimes referred to as the Left Coast  indicating its left leaning political orientation and tendency towards liberal norms  folkways and values  Southern United States are informally called  the Bible Belt  due to socially conservative evangelical Protestantism which is a significant part of the region s culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher there than the nation s average  This region is usually contrasted with the mainline Protestantism and Catholicism of the northeastern United States  the religiously diverse Midwest and Great Lakes  the Mormon Corridor in Utah and southern Idaho  and the relatively secular western United States  The percentage of non religious people is the highest in the northeastern state of Vermont at 34   compared to the Bible Belt state of Alabama  where it is 6   68  Strong cultural differences have a long history in the U S  with the southern slave society in the antebellum period serving as a prime example  Not only social  but also economic tensions between the Northern and Southern states were so severe that they eventually caused the South to declare itself an independent nation  the Confederate States of America  thus provoking the American civil war  14  One example of regional variations is the attitude towards the discussion of sex  often sexual discussions would have less restrictions in the Northeastern United States  but yet is seen as taboo in the Southern United States  In his 1989 book   Albion s Seed   ISBN 0195069056   David Hackett Fischer makes a strong case for the theory that the United States is made up today of four distinct regional cultures  The book s focus is on the folkways of four groups of settlers from the British Isles that emigrated from distinct regions of Britain and Ireland to the British American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries  Fischer s thesis is that the culture and folkways of each of these groups persisted  albeit with some modification over time  providing the basis for the four modern regional cultures of the United States  According to Fischer  the foundation of American culture was formed from four mass migrations from four different regions of the British Isles by four distinct socio religious groups  New England s earliest settlement period occurred between 1629 and 1640 when Puritans  mostly from East Anglia in England  settled there  forming the New England regional culture  The next mass migration was of southern English cavaliers and their Irish and Scottish domestic servants to the Chesapeake Bay region between 1640 and 1675  This facilitated the development of the Southern American culture  Then  between 1675 and 1725  thousands of Irish  English and German Quakers  led by William Penn  settled in the Delaware Valley  This settlement resulted in the formation of what is today considered the  General American  culture  although  according to Fischer  it is really just a regional American culture  even if it does today encompass most of the U S  from the mid Atlantic states to the Pacific Coast  Finally  Irish  Scottish and English settlers from the borderlands of Britain and Ireland migrated to Appalachia between 1717 and 1775  They formed the regional culture of the Upland South  which has since spread west to such areas as West Texas and parts of the U S  Southwest  Fischer suggests that the U S  today is not a country with one General American culture and three or more regional sub cultures  He asserts that the country is composed of just regional cultures  and that understanding that helps one to understand many things about modern American life  Fischer also makes the point that the development of these regional cultures derived not only from where exactly the settlers first came  but when they came  Fischer asserts that during different periods to time  a population of people will have very distinct beliefs  fears  hopes and prejudices  and that various groups of settlers brought these feelings to the New World where they more or less froze in time in America  even if they eventually changed in their place of origin   edit  Drugs and Alcohol  Just Say No  paraphernalia at the Reagan Library display This unreferenced section requires citations to ensure verifiability  Further information  History of United States drug prohibition American attitudes towards drugs and alcoholic beverages have evolved considerably throughout the country s history  In the 19th century  alcohol was readily available and consumed  and no laws restricted the use of other drugs  Attitudes on drug addiction started to change  resulting in the Harrison Act which eventually became proscriptive  A movement to ban alcoholic beverages  called the Temperance movement  emerged in the late 19th century  Several American Protestant religious groups  as well as women s groups such as the Women s Christian Temperance Union  supported the movement  In 1919  Prohibitionists succeeded in amending the Constitution to prohibit the sale of alcohol  Although the Prohibition period did result in lowering alcohol consumption overall  banning alcohol outright proved to be unworkable  as the previously legitimate distillery industry was replaced by criminal gangs which trafficked in alcohol  Prohibition was repealed in 1931  States and localities retained the right to remain  dry   and to this day  a handful still do  During the Vietnam War era  attitudes swung well away from prohibition  Commentators noted that an 18 year old could be drafted to war but could not buy a beer  Since 1980  the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use  The focus this time  however  has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol  rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright  New York was the first state to enact tough drunk driving laws in 1980  since then all other states have followed suit  A  Just Say No to Drugs  movement replaced the more libertine ethos of the 1960s  As a result  since the late half of the 1980s to about the year 2000  all states made the legal drinking age  to purchase alcoholic beverages  at 21  citation needed  Since the 1990s  Marijuana use

Bowling Alone indicate that Americans affiliate with these sorts of groups less often than they did in the 1950s and 1960s  Today  Americans derive a great deal of their identity through their work and professional affiliation  especially among individuals higher on the economic ladder  Recently professional identification has led to many clerical and low level employees giving their occupations new  more respectable titles  such as  Sanitation service engineer  instead of  Janitor   1  Additionally many Americans belong to non profit organizations and religious establishments and may volunteer their services to such organizations  Rotary International  the Knights of Columbus or even the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals are examples of such non profit and mostly volunteer run organizations  Ethnicity plays another important role in providing some Americans with group identity  14  especially among those who recently immigrated  6  Many American cities are home to ethnic enclaves such as a Chinatown and Little Italies remain in some cities  Local patriotism may be also provide group identity  For example  a person may be particularly proud to be from
