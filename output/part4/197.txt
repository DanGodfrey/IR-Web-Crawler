of the entire country  8  With Chicago in the northeast  small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois  and natural resources like coal  timber  and petroleum in the south  Illinois has a broad economic base  Illinois is a major transportation hub  The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes  via the St  Lawrence Seaway  to the Atlantic Ocean  as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River  via the Illinois River  For decades  O Hare International Airport has ranked as one of the world s busiest airports  Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms 8  and politics  In the 1810s  settlers began arriving from Kentucky  In 1818  Illinois achieved statehood  The state s population originally grew from south to north  Chicago was founded in the 1830s on the banks of the Chicago River  one of the few natural harbors on southern Lake Michigan  9  Railroads and John Deere s invention of the self scouring steel plow turned Illinois  rich prairie into some of the world s most productive and valuable farmlands  attracting immigrant farmers from Germany and Sweden  By 1900  the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and coal mining in the central and southern areas attracted immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe  Illinois was an important manufacturing center during both world wars  The Great Migration established a large community of African Americans in Chicago that created the city s famous jazz and blues cultures  10  11  Three U S  Presidents have been elected while living in Illinois Abraham Lincoln  Ulysses S  Grant  and Barack Obama  Additionally  President Ronald Reagan  whose political career was based in California  was the only US President actually born and raised in Illinois  Today  Illinois honors Lincoln with its official state slogan  Land of Lincoln  which has been displayed on its license

modern spelling for the early French missionaries and explorers  name for the Illinois people  a name that was spelled in many different ways in the early records  14  The name  Illinois  has traditionally been said to mean  man  or  men  in the Miami Illinois language  with the original iliniwek transformed via French into Illinois  15  16  However  this etymology is not supported by the Illinois language itself  in which the word for  man  is ireniwa and plural  men  is ireniwaki  The name Illiniwek has also been said to mean  tribe of superior men   17  though this is nothing more than a false etymology  In fact the name  Illinois  derives from the Miami Illinois verb irenwe wa  he speaks the regular way   This was then taken into the Ojibwe language  perhaps in the Ottawa dialect  and modified into ilinwe   pluralized as ilinwe k   These forms were then borrowed into French  where the  we  ending acquired the spelling  ois  The current form  Illinois  began to appear in the early 1670s  The Illinois s name for themselves  as attested in all three of the French missionary period dictionaries of Illinois  was Inoka  of unknown meaning and unrelated to the other terms  18  19  20   edit  History Main article  History of Illinois  edit  Pre European Copper plates found at Pre Columbian burial sites in Illinois  Native Americans lived along the waterways of the Illinois area for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans  The Koster Site has been excavated and demonstrates 7 000 years of continuous habitation  Cahokia  the largest regional chiefdom and urban center of the Pre Columbian Mississippian culture  was located near present day Collinsville  Illinois  They built more than 100 mounds and a woodhenge in a planned design expressing the culture s cosmology  The civilization vanished in the 15th century for unknown reasons  but historians and archeologists have speculated that the people depleted the area of resources  Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare  According to Suzanne Austin Alchon   At one site in the central Illinois River valley  one third of all adults died as a result of violent injuries   21  The next major power in the region was the Illinois Confederation or Illini  a political alliance among several tribes  There were about 25 000 Illinois Indians in 1700  but systematic attacks and warfare by the Iroquois reduced their numbers by 90   22  Gradually  members of the Potawatomi  Miami  Sauk  and other tribes came in from the east and north  23  In the American Revolution  the Illinois and Potawatomi supported the American colonists  cause   edit  European exploration Illinois in 1718  approximate modern state area highlighted  from Carte de la Louisiane et du cours du Mississipi by Guillaume de L Isle  24  French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Illinois River in 1673  In 1680  other French explorers constructed a fort at the site of present day Peoria  and in 1682  a fort atop Starved Rock in today s Starved Rock State Park  As a result of this French exploration  Illinois was part of the French empire until 1763  when it passed to the British with their conquest of New France  The small French settlements continued  a few British soldiers were posted in Illinois  but there were no British or American settlers  In 1778  George Rogers Clark claimed the Illinois Country for Virginia  The area was ceded by Virginia to the new United States in 1783 and became part of the Northwest Territory  25   edit  19th century See also  History of

much of Illinois  The Illinois Territory was created on February 3  1809  with its capital at Kaskaskia  During the discussions leading up to Illinois  admission to the Union  the proposed northern boundary of the state was moved twice  27  The original provisions of the Northwest Ordinance had specified a boundary that would have been tangent to the southern tip of Lake Michigan  Such a boundary would have actually left Illinois with no shoreline on Lake Michigan at all  However  as Indiana had successfully been granted a 10 mile northern extension of its boundary to provide it with a usable lakefront  the original bill for Illinois statehood  submitted to Congress on January 23  1818  stipulated a northern border at the same latitude as Indiana s which is defined as 10 miles  16 km  north of the southernmost extremity of Lake Michigan  But the Illinois delegate  Nathaniel Pope  wanted more  Pope lobbied to have the boundary moved further north  and the final bill passed by Congress did just such  it included an amendment to shift the border to 42  30  north  which is approximately 51 miles  82 km  north of the Indiana northern border  This shift added 8 500 square miles  22 000 km2  to the state  including the lead mining region near Galena  More importantly  it added nearly 50 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline and the Chicago River  Pope and others envisioned a canal which would connect the Chicago and Illinois rivers  and thusly  connect the Great Lakes to the Mississippi  In 1818  Illinois became the 21st U S  state  The capital remained at Kaskaskia  headquartered in a small building rented by the state  In 1819  Vandalia became the capital  and over the next 18 years  three separate buildings were built to serve successively as the capitol building  In 1837  the state legislators representing Sangamon County  under the leadership of state representative Abraham Lincoln  succeeded in having the capital moved to Springfield  28  where a fifth capitol building was constructed  A sixth capitol building was erected in 1867  which continues to serve as the Illinois capitol today  Though ostensibly a  free state   Illinois had slavery  The French owned black slaves as late as the 1820s  Slavery was nominally banned by the Northwest Ordinance  but that was not enforced  When Illinois became a sovereign state in 1818  the Ordinance no longer applied  and there were about 900 slaves there  As the southern part of the state  known as  Egypt   was largely settled by migrants from the South  the section was hostile to free blacks and allowed settlers to bring slaves with them for labor  Most citizens were opposed to allowing blacks as permanent residents  and efforts to make slavery official failed in 1822  Nevertheless  some slaves were brought in seasonally or as house servants  29  The Illinois Constitution of 1848 was written with a provision for exclusionary laws to be passed  In 1853  John A  Logan helped pass a law to prohibit all African Americans  including freedmen  from settling in the state  30  In 1832  the Black Hawk War was fought in Illinois and current day Wisconsin between the United States and the Sauk  Fox  Meskwaki  and Kickapoo Indian tribes  The Indians withdrew to Iowa  when they attempted to return  they were defeated by U S  militia and forced back to Iowa  The winter of 1830 1831 is called the  Winter of the Deep Snow   a sudden  deep snowfall blanketed the state  making travel impossible for the rest of the winter  and many travelers perished  Several severe winters followed  including the  Winter of the Sudden Freeze   On December 20  1836  a fast moving cold front passed through  freezing puddles in minutes and killing many travelers who could not reach shelter  The adverse weather resulted in crop failures in the northern part of the state  The southern part of the state shipped food north and this may have contributed to its name   Little Egypt   after the Biblical story of Joseph in Egypt supplying grain to his brothers  31  By 1839  the Mormons had founded a utopian city called Nauvoo  Located in Hancock County  along the Mississippi River  Nauvoo flourished and soon rivaled Chicago for the position of the state s largest city  But in 1844  the Mormon leader Joseph Smith was murdered in the Carthage Jail  about 30 miles away from Nauvoo  Soon afterward  after close to six years of rapid development  Nauvoo saw a rapid decline after the Mormons  new leadership led them out of Illinois in a mass exodus to present day Utah  Chicago gained prominence as a Great Lakes port and then as an Illinois and Michigan Canal port after 1848  and as a rail hub soon afterward  By 1857  Chicago was Illinois  largest city  25  With the tremendous growth of mines and factories in the state in the 19th century  Illinois played an important role in the formation of labor unions in the United States  The Pullman Strike and Haymarket Riot in particular greatly influenced the development of the American labor movement  From Sunday  October 8  1871  until Tuesday  October 10  1871  the Great Chicago Fire burned in downtown Chicago  destroying 4 square miles  10 km2   32  In 1847  after lobbying by Dorothea L  Dix  Illinois became one of the first states to establish a system of state supported treatment of mental illness and disabilities  replacing local almshouses   edit  Civil War Main article  Illinois in the Civil War Embarkation of Union troops from Cairo on January 10  1862 During the American Civil War  over 250 000 Illinois men served in the Union Army  a figure surpassed by only New York  Pennsylvania  and Ohio  Beginning with President Abraham Lincoln s first call for troops and continuing throughout the war  Illinois mustered 150 infantry regiments  which were numbered from the 7th to the 156th regiments  Seventeen cavalry regiments were also gathered  as well as two light artillery regiments  33  The town of Cairo at the southern tip of the state served as a strategically important supply base and training center for the Union army  For several months  both General Grant and Admiral Foote had headquarters in Cairo   edit  20th century At the turn of the 20th century  Illinois had a population of nearly 5 million  Bolstered by continued immigration from southern and eastern Europe  and by the African American Great Migration  Illinois grew and emerged as one of the most important states in the union  By the end of the century  the population had reached 12 4 million  The Century of Progress World s Fair was held at Chicago in 1933  Oil strikes in Marion County and Crawford County lead to a boom in 1937  and  by 1939  Illinois ranked fourth in U S  oil production  Chicago became an ocean port with the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959  The seaway and the Illinois Waterway connected Chicago to both the Mississippi River and the Atlantic Ocean  In 1960  Ray Kroc opened the first McDonald s franchise in Des Plaines  which still exists today as a museum  with a working McDonald s across the street   No state has had a more prominent role than Illinois in the emergence of the nuclear age  As part of the Manhattan Project  the first sustained nuclear chain reaction took place at the University of Chicago in 1942  In 1957  Argonne National Laboratory  near Chicago  activated the first experimental nuclear power generating system in the United States  By 1960  the first privately financed nuclear plant in United States  Dresden 1  was dedicated near Morris  In 1967  Fermilab  a national nuclear research facility near Batavia  opened a particle accelerator  which was the world s largest for over 40 years  And  with eleven plants currently operating  Illinois leads all states in the amount of electricity generated from nuclear power  34  In 1961  Illinois became the first state in the nation to adopt the recommendation of the American Law Institute and pass a comprehensive criminal code revision that repealed the law against sodomy  The code also abrogated common law crimes and established an age of consent of 18  35  The state s fourth constitution was adopted in 1970  replacing the 1870 document  The first Farm Aid concert was held in Champaign to benefit American farmers  in 1985  The worst upper Mississippi River flood of the century  the Great Flood of 1993  inundated many towns and thousands of acres of farmland  25   edit  Geography Main article  Geography of Illinois Illinois  showing major cities and roads

Illinois  eastern border with Indiana consists of a north south line at 87  31  30  west longitude from Lake Michigan to the Wabash River above Post Vincennes  The Wabash River continues as the eastern southeastern border with Indiana until the Wabash enters the Ohio River  This marks the beginning of Illinois  southern border with Kentucky  which runs along the northern shoreline of the Ohio River  36  Its western border with Missouri and Iowa is the Mississippi River  Its northern border with Wisconsin is fixed at 42  30  north latitude  The northeastern border of Illinois actually lies within Lake Michigan  within which Illinois shares a water boundary with the state of Michigan  23   edit  Topography Though Illinois lies entirely in the Interior Plains  it does have some minor variation in its elevation  In extreme northwestern Illinois  the Driftless Area  a region of unglaciated and therefore higher and more rugged topography  occupies a small part of the state  Charles Mound  located in this region  has the state s highest elevation above sea level at 1 235 feet  376 m   The floodplain on the Mississippi River from Alton to the Kaskaskia River is known as the American Bottom   edit  Divisions Illinois has three major geographical divisions  Northern Illinois is dominated by the Chicago metropolitan area  the city of Chicago  its suburbs  and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding  As defined by the federal government  the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois  Indiana  and Wisconsin  Chicago is a cosmopolitan city  densely populated  industrialized  the transportation hub of the nation  and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups with a population of 9 8 million people  The city of Rockford  the fourth largest metropolitan area  and the state s third largest city  sits along Interstates 39 and 90 some 75 miles  121 km  northwest of Chicago  The Quad Cities region  located along the Mississippi River in northern Illinois  had a population of 379 066 in 2009  Southward and westward  the second major division is Central Illinois  an area of mostly prairie  Known as the Heart of Illinois  it is characterized by small towns and mid sized cities  The western section  west of the Illinois River  was originally part of the Military Tract of 1812 and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state  Agriculture  particularly corn and soybeans  as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers  figure prominently  Cities include Peoria  the third largest metropolitan area in Illinois at 370 000  Springfield  the state capital  Quincy  Decatur  Bloomington Normal  and Champaign Urbana  23  The third division is Southern Illinois  comprising the area south of U S  Route 50  including Little Egypt  near the juncture of the Mississippi River and Ohio River  Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of Cahokia  as well as the site of the first state capital at Kaskaskia  which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River  23  37  This region can be distinguished from the other two by its warmer climate  different variety of crops  including some cotton farming in the past   more rugged topography  due to the area remaining unglaciated during the Illinoian Stage  unlike most of the rest of the state   as well as small scale oil deposits and coal mining  The Illinois suburbs of St  Louis comprise the second most populous metropolitan area in Illinois with over 700 000 inhabitants  and are known collectively as the Metro East  The other significant concentration of population in Southern Illinois is the Carbondale Marion Herrin  Illinois Combined Statistical Area centered on Carbondale and Marion  a two county area that is home to 123 272 residents  23  A portion of southeastern Illinois is part of the extended Evansville  Indiana Metro Area  locally referred to as the Tri State with Indiana and Kentucky  Seven Illinois counties are in the area  In addition to these three  largely latitudinally defined divisions  all of the region outside of the Chicago Metropolitan area is often called  downstate  Illinois  This term is flexible  but is generally meant to mean everything outside the Chicago area  Thus  some cities in Northern Illinois  such as DeKalb  which is west of Chicago  and Rockford which is actually north of Chicago are considered to be  downstate    edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Illinois Because of its nearly 400 mile distance between its northernmost and southernmost extremes  as well as its mid continental situation  Illinois has a widely varying climate  Most of Illinois has a humid continental climate  K ppen climate classification Dfa   with hot  humid summers and cold winters  The southernmost part of the state  from about Carbondale southward  borders on a humid subtropical climate  Koppen Cfa   with more moderate winters  Average yearly precipitation for Illinois varies from just over 48 inches  1 219 mm  at the southern tip to around 35 inches  889 mm  in the northern portion of the state  Normal annual snowfall exceeds 38 inches  965 mm  in the Chicago area  while the southern portion of the state normally receives less than 14 inches  356 mm   38  The all time high temperature was 117  F  47  C   recorded on July 14  1954  at East St  Louis  while the all time low temperature was  36  F   38  C   recorded on January 5  1999  at Congerville  39  Illinois averages around 51 days of thunderstorm activity a year  which ranks somewhat above average in the number of thunderstorm days for the United States  Illinois is vulnerable to tornadoes with an average of 35 occurring annually  which puts much of the state at around five tornadoes per 10 000 square miles  30 000 km2  annually  40  While tornadoes are no more powerful in Illinois than other states  the nation s deadliest tornadoes on record have occurred largely in Illinois because it is the most populous state in Tornado Alley  The Tri State Tornado of 1925 killed 695 people in three states  613 of the victims died in Illinois  41  Modern developments in storm tracking have caused death tolls from tornadoes to dramatically decline since the 1960s  with no major losses of life in the state since the 1967 tornado storm in northern Illinois  City Jan Feb

1 billion   67   edit  Services By the early 2000s  Illinois  economy had moved toward a dependence on high value added services  such as financial trading  higher education  law  logistics  and medicine  In some cases  these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois  earlier economies  For example  the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  a trading exchange for global derivatives  had begun its life as an agricultural futures market  Other important non manufacturing industries include publishing  tourism  and energy production and distribution   edit  Energy Illinois is a net importer of fuels for energy  despite large coal resources and some minor oil production  Illinois exports electricity  ranking fifth among states in electricity production and seventh in electricity consumption  68   edit  Coal The coal industry of Illinois has its origins in the middle 19th century  when entrepreneurs such as Jacob Loose discovered coal in locations suc style br  h as Sangamon County  Jacob Bunn contributed to the development of the Illinois coal industry  and was a founder and owner of the Western Coal  amp  Mining Company of Illinois  About 68  of Illinois has coal bearing strata of the Pennsylvanian geologic period  According to the Illinois State Geological Survey  211 billion tons of bituminous coal are estimated to lie under the surface  having a total heating value greater than the estimated oil deposits in the Arabian Peninsula  69  However  this coal has a high sulfur content  which causes acid rain unless special equipment is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions  23  25  37  Many Illinois power plants are not equipped to burn high sulfur coal  In 1999  Illinois produced 40 4 million tons of coal  but only 17 million tons  42   of Illinois coal was consumed in Illinois  Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states  while much of the coal burned for power in Illinois  21 million tons in 1998  is mined

interest in the use of wind power for electrical generation  72  Most of Illinois was rated in 2009 as  marginal or fair  for wind energy production by the U S  Department of Energy  with some western sections rated  good  and parts of the south rated  poor   73  These ratings are for wind turbines with 50 metre  160 ft  hub heights  newer wind turbines are taller  enabling them to reach stronger winds farther from the ground  As a result  more areas of Illinois have become prospective wind farm sites  As of September 2009  Illinois had 1116 06 MW of installed wind power nameplate capacity with another 741 9 MW under construction  74  Illinois ranked ninth among U S  states in installed wind power capacity  and sixteenth by potential capacity  74  Large wind farms in Illinois include Twin Groves  Rail Splitter  EcoGrove  and Mendota Hills  74  As of 2007  wind energy represented only 1 7  of Illinois  energy production  and it was estimated that wind power could provide 5 10  of the state s energy needs  75  76  Also  the Illinois General Assembly mandated in 2007 that by 2025  25  of all electricity generated in Illinois is to come from renewable resources  77   edit

Government of Illinois The dome on the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield is taller than the dome on the United States Capitol  While the organization of the central government of Illinois is largely the same as every other state  having three branches of government  executive  legislative and judicial   below this top level  the substructure of Illinois  government is extremely complex  arguably the most complex of all fifty states   edit  State government structure Legislative functions are granted to the Illinois General Assembly  composed of the 118 member Illinois House of Representatives and the 59 member Illinois Senate  The executive branch is led by the Governor of Illinois  but four other executive officials are separately elected by the people  The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court of Illinois and the lower appellate and circuit courts  36   edit  Illinois  uniquely complex local government structure Illinois has more units of local government than any other state over 8 000 in all  85  The basic subdivision of Illinois is like almost every other state  the county  and Illinois has 102 of these  About half of these counties  in turn  are divided into townships  which is much the same as many other Midwestern states  And finally  Illinois has a number of cities  villages  and towns commensurate with a state of its size  But the counties  townships  and municipal governments in Illinois make up only about 1 4 of all of the governmental units in the state  The reason Illinois has so many units of government is because so many single purpose governmental entities have been created  The following is just a partial list of the types of single purpose governmental units in Illinois  Illinois has school districts which do not share boundaries with either counties nor townships  While this is not unique to Illinois  what would strike observers from many other states as odd  is that there are many places where a given piece of land sits within two school districts one high school district  and another elementary district each of which has its own school board and its own taxing authority  Another common political unit is the library district  86  Library districts are run by library boards  such boards are elected bodies and have the power to levy taxes in their district  87  Library boards in some districts are elected at the general election  but in other districts may be held in conjunction with local elections  or even  as stand alone elections  88  The boundaries of these library districts occasionally coincide with those of another governmental entity  such as a township  but more often  they are set independently  Another unit of government with taxation authority is the sanitary district  89  a euphemism for  sewage district    Many Illinoisians first learned of the existence of these entities when  in 1978  a sanitary district board member named Alex Seith captured the Democratic nomination for U S  Senate against the veteran senator Charles Percy and nearly upset him in the general election   The largest of the sanitary districts in the state is the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago  n  Sanitary District of Chicago   which oversaw the reversal of the course of the Chicago River  There are additional units of government that oversee watersheds  land use  and many other functions that in another state would be handled by the county or city governments   edit  Homerule The Constitution of 1970 created  for the first time in Illinois  a type of  home rule   which allows cities of certain sizes to opt out of certain types of state laws   edit  Law enforcement For a more comprehensive list  see List of law enforcement agencies in Illinois  The complexity and overlapping jurisdictions of Illinois  law enforcement agencies is not unlike that of the overlapping taxing authorities noted above  At the state level  there are at least eleven law enforcement agencies  At the county level  there are sheriffs  forest preserve police and other specialized police forces  At the local level  most cities and many villages have municipal police forces  park district police forces  and even local specialized police forces  Many colleges also have their own campus police that are often sworn police officers  In 2000  Illinois was ranked 4th in the U S  in the number of full time sworn officers with 321 per 100 000 persons  behind Louisiana  415   New York  384   and New Jersey  345   90  In this ranking  only New York had a higher total population than Illinois  Illinois is also near the top of most law enforcement numbers lists  such as number of agencies per state  number of agencies with special jurisdictions  and number of local police agencies  90  Even taking into account that Illinois is the fifth most populous state  many of the ratios are higher than more populated states  There is much overlap in jurisdiction amongst the different law enforcement agencies   edit  Politics See also  Political party strength in Illinois  edit  Party balance Historically  Illinois was long a major swing state  with near parity existing between the Republican and the Democratic parties  However  in recent elections  the Democratic Party has slowly gained ground  and Illinois has come to be seen as more of a  blue  state  91  92  Chicago and most of Cook County votes have long been strongly Democratic  However  the  collar counties   the suburbs surrounding Chicago s Cook County  Illinois   are a Republican stronghold  93  94  Republicans continue to prevail in the Chicago suburban  collar counties  surrounding Cook County  as well as rural northern and central Illinois  Republican support is strong in southern Illinois outside of the East St  Louis metropolitan area  Illinois has voted for Democratic presidential candidates in the last five elections  State resident Barack Obama easily won the state s 21 electoral votes in 2008  by a margin of 25 percentage points with 61 9  of the vote  However  the 2010 midterm elections witnessed a stronger electoral performance by Republicans  including the pick up of several House seats as well as the Senate seat formerly occupied by President Obama   edit  History of corruption Politics in the state  particularly those of the Chicago machine  have been famous for highly visible corruption cases  as well as for crusading reformers  such as governors Adlai Stevenson  D  and James R  Thompson  R   In 2006  former Governor George Ryan  R  was convicted of racketeering and bribery  leading to a 6 and a half year prison sentence  In 2008  then Governor Rod Blagojevich  D  was served with a criminal complaint on corruption charges  stemming from allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President Barack Obama  D  to the highest bidder  Subsequently  on December 7  2011  Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison for those charges  as well as perjury while testifying during the case  totaling 18 convictions  In the late 20th century  Congressman Dan Rostenkowski  D  was imprisoned for mail fraud  former governor and federal judge Otto Kerner  Jr   D  was imprisoned for bribery  and State Auditor of Public Accounts  Comptroller  Orville Hodge  R  was imprisoned for embezzlement  In 1912  William Lorimer  the GOP boss of Chicago  was expelled from the U S  Senate for bribery and in 1921  Governor Len Small  R  was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars  25  37  95   edit  US Presidents from Illinois Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base  Lincoln  Grant  and Obama  Lincoln was born in Kentucky  but moved to Illinois at the age of 21  he served in the General Assembly and represented the 7th congressional district in the US House of Representatives before his election as President  Ulysses S  Grant was born in Ohio and had a military career that precluded settling down  but on the eve of the Civil War  and approaching middle age  Grant moved to Illinois and thus claimed it as his home when running for President  Barack Obama was born and raised in Hawaii  other than a four year period of his childhood spent in Indonesia  and made Illinois his home and base after completing law school  Only one person elected President of the United States was actually born in Illinois  Ronald Reagan was born in Tampico  raised in Dixon and educated at Eureka College  Reagan moved to Los Angeles as a young adult and later became Governor of California before being elected President   edit  Black senators Since the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1789  only six African Americans have served as members of the United States
