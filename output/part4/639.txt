summary of reform achievements at the national level in the United States  For failed efforts  State based efforts  native tribes services and more details generally  see the main article History of health care reform in the United States  1965 President Lyndon Johnson enacted legislation that introduced Medicare  covering both hospital and general medical insurance for senior citizens paid for by a Federal employment tax over the working life of the retiree  and Medicaid permitted the Federal government to partially fund a program for the poor  with the program managed and co financed by the individual states  5  6  1985 The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985  COBRA  amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  ERISA  to give some employees the ability to continue health insurance coverage after leaving employment  7  1997 The State Children s Health Insurance Program  or SCHIP  was established by the federal government in 1997 to provide health insurance to children in families at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty line  8  2010 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is enacted by President Barack Obama  providing for the phased introduction over four years of a comprehensive system of mandated health insurance with reforms designed to eliminate  some of the worst practices of the insurance companies    pre condition screening and premium loadings  policy rescinds on technicalities when illness seems imminent  lifetime and annual coverage caps  It also sets a minimum ratio of direct health care spending to premium income  and creates price competition bolstered by the creation of three standard insurance coverage levels to enable like for like comparisons by consumers  and a web based health insurance exchange where consumers can compare prices and purchase plans  The system preserves private insurance and private health care providers and provides more subsidies to enable the poor to buy insurance   edit  The 2010 Federal Reform Legislation In March 2010  President Obama gave a speech at a rally in Pennsylvania explaining the necessity of health insurance reform and calling on Congress to hold a final up or down vote on reform  9  As of 2011 update   the legislation remains controversial  10  11  12  13  14  with some states challenging it in federal court and opposition from some voters  15  16  17  Uninsured Americans  with the numbers shown here from 1987 to 2008  are a major driver for reform efforts  edit  Expanding Medicaid and subsidizing insurance The law includes health related provisions that take effect over several years  including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133  of the federal poverty level  FPL   18  subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400  of the FPL   88 000 for family of 4 in 2010  so their maximum  out of pocket  payment for annual premiums will be on sliding scale from 2  to 9 5  of income  19  20  21  22  23  providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits  prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre existing conditions  establishing health insurance exchanges  prohibiting insurers from establishing annual coverage caps  and support for medical research   edit  Guaranteed issue  community rating  individual mandate Starting in 2014  the law will prohibit insurers from denying coverage  see guaranteed issue  to sicker applicants  or imposing special conditions such as higher premiums or payments  see community rating   Health care expenditures are highly concentrated with the most expensive 5  of the population accounting for half of aggregate health care spending  whereas the bottom 50  of spenders account for only 3   which means that insurers  gains to be had from avoiding the sick greatly outweigh any possible gains from managing their care  24  As a consequence  insurers devoted resources to such avoidance at a direct cost to effective care management which is against the interests of the insured  24  Instead of providing health security  the health insurance industry had  since the 1970s begun to compete by becoming risk differentiators  seeking to insure only those with good or normal health profiles and excluding those considered to be or likely to become unhealthy and therefore less profitable  According to a study from Cambridge Hospital  Harvard Law School and Ohio University  62  of all 2007 personal bankruptcies in the United States  were driven by medical incidents  with  75  having had  health insurance   25  Also starting in 2014  the law will generally require uninsured individuals to buy government approved health insurance   the individual mandate  Government run exchanges may present information to facilitate comparison among competing plans  if available  but previous attempts at creating similar exchanges  produced only mixed results   26  This requirement is expected to reduce the number of the uninsured from 19  of all residents in 2010 to 8  by 2016  27  Some analysts believe that the 8  figure of uninsured are expected to be mostly illegal immigrants  5    with the rest paying the fine unless exempted  27  28  Whether or not this is true remains unclear based on presently available data  Some analysts have argued that the insurance premium structure may shift more costs onto younger and healthier people  29  Approximately  43 billion was spent in 2008 providing unreimbursed emergency services for the uninsured 24  and the Act s supporters argued that increased the average family s insurance premiums  30  Other studies claim the opposite   The argument for reduced ER visits has been shown to be largely a canard   insuring the uninsured will lead to  very approximately  a doubling of health expenditures for the currently uninsured   31  The studies suggest that making insurance mandatory rather than voluntary will tend to bring younger  healthier people into the insurance pool  shifting the cost of the Act s increased spending onto them  32   edit  Efficacy of health insurance The 2010 Acts require insurers to cover more costs  requiring that at least 80  of premiums must be spent on medical care or  quality improvement  33   see loss ratio  and requiring full coverage for screenings and immunizations  and by prohibiting lifetime and annual caps  Some insurance schemes had been considered inadequate  34  Some argue that expanding insurance coverage may lead to better health  while other studies claim the opposite  A 2009 Harvard study published in the American Journal of Public Health found more than 44 800 excess deaths annually in the United States associated with lack of insurance  35  36  Other studies found less correlation  37   see also  38  More broadly  a 1997 analysis estimated the number of people in the United States insured and uninsured who die per year because of lack of medical care was nearly 100 000  39  Recent when   reports have found that expanding coverage for psychiatric drugs has worsened the health of many children  who incur costly and lifelong side effects such as diabetes  40  41  42  However  many of these studies fail to disclose that such examples of  expanded coverage  focus on narrow  non representative subpopulations and do not  for example  reflect the likely large net benefit for the much larger subpopulations that have diabetes  hypertension  and resulting chronic kidney disease  all of whom would likely benefit from expanded coverage  Some opponents to the Act have claimed that  80 000 people a year are killed just by  nosocomial infections  infections that arise as a result of medical treatment   These claims however are tenuous at best since the incidence of nosocomical infections is not causally linked to expanded insurance coverage  especially when preventative measures are a key component of the new proposed regime  includiing numerous measures aimed to reduce the rate of hospitalization and re hospitalization and improve primary prevention efforts in the outpatient setting  Opponents to the Act also point to a randomized study of almost 4 000 subjects done by Rand and concluded in 1982  which purportedly found that increasing the generosity of people s health insurance caused them to use more health care  but made almost no difference in their health status   38  The actual summary of the Rand study by Rand itself is quite different   The poorest and sickest 6 percent of the sample at the start of the experiment had better outcomes under the free plan for 4 of the 30 conditions measured  Specifically   Free care improved the control of hypertension  The poorest patients in the free care group who entered the experiment with hypertension saw greater reductions in blood pressure than did their counterparts with cost sharing  The projected effect was about a 10 percent reduction in mortality for those with hypertension   Free care marginally improved vision for the poorest patients   Free care also increased the likelihood among the poorest patients of receiving needed dental care  Serious symptoms were less prevalent for poorer people on the free plan   Cost sharing also had some beneficial effects  Participants in cost sharing plans worried less about their health and had fewer restricted activity days  including time spent in seeking medical care    43   edit  Reduce the deficit Reducing the deficit was another driver in health care reform  The reform legislation that passed was estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to reduce the deficit by  138 billion over 10 years  44  However  the CBO numbers are the subject of some debate  45   edit  Eliminate overpayment in Medicare Advantage Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private insurers and provide benefits over and above coverage in Medicare Parts A and B and receive funding from the Medicare fund for taking on Part A and B coverage  However  under a revised contract made during the previous Bush presidency  Medicare was overpaying the private insurers  MedPAC estimated the overpayment as being approximately  12 billion a year  46  This meant that the average person in traditional Medicare was paying  90 a year as a subsidy to private insurers for which they received zero benefit and eliminating this overpayment would save  177 billion over ten years  47   edit  Political positions of the main parties The Democratic Party supports the amended 2010 legislation  The Act aims to ensure health insurance is available to all citizens  to make more employers responsible for their workers  health insurance  to extend subsidies to middle income persons who have no employer insurance  and extend Medicaid to more people than had been the case previously  The Act directs federal spending to community health centers and to computerize health care records to encourage accurate sharing of data between health providers and reduce errors  The Act taxes expensive insurance plans and adjusts the split of Medicare funding between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans  The Act reforms payment systems and Medicare  which may reduce the perverse incentive system that pays hospitals with poor recovery records more than hospitals with better recovery records  The Act increases Medicare prescription drug coverage  President Obama said he had heard from Americans with pre existing conditions whose lives depend on getting insurance coverage  stories of patients being denied coverage  and of families with insurance who are just one illness away from financial ruin  He said that the Act would protect people from the worst practices of the insurance industry  He said it would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market  He claimed that if they did nothing  millions of Americans would lose their health care and the deficit would grow  He said that premiums would increase and patients would be denied the care they need  and that small business owners would continue to drop coverage altogether  He said he would not walk away from those Americans  and he urged others in Congress not to do so either  He highlighted that the American Medical Association considers the Act an improvement over the status quo  He challenged anyone  from either party  with a better plan that would bring down premiums  bring down the deficit  cover the uninsured  strengthen Medicare for seniors  and stop insurance company abuses  to let him know  48  The GOP s official current position as represented by the House majority is that the Affordable Care Act should simply be repealed  leaving the law as it was previously  The House of Representatives voted for this in January 2011  though it is unlikely that the Senate would pass it and some expect that the President would veto any attempt at repeal  The Republicans  previous proposal for health care reform in 2009 would have placed people with pre existing conditions who are unable to get affordable coverage into high risk insurance pools and would have continued the previous practice of allowing insurers to discriminate against them in terms of coverage and premiums  Republicans opposed the Affordable Care Act during passage  Not a single representative in the House or Senate voted in favor of the bill  49  50  This opposition was broadly based on objections to rises in taxation  especially of the so called  Cadillac insurance plans  and the corollary increase in government spending on affordability subsidies  The GOP also objected to a new Health Insurance Rate Authority that would determine whether rate increases were  unreasonable  and to enforced rebates or premium reductions  and to any proposal that might have allowed government funds to subsidize abortion  51  The opposition declared the law to be a  government takeover of health care   One version of an original draft prepared in the House of Representatives did call for a  public option   a public insurer as one extra choice for consumers  competing against private insurers   Some Republicans have contested the constitutionality of the individual health insurance mandate  a requirement to have medical insurance or else pay a fine   Both the government and the insurance industry have argued that this is a necessary prerequisite to achieve universality and equity for other insurance payers and to prevent people buying insurance only in time of need  The government argues that its constitutionality is covered under the Commerce Clause  whereas detractors argue that this is wrong  As of 2010 update   this matter is still before the courts and so far when   three out of five federal court decisions have ruled in favor of it being constitutional and two against  Mitt Romney has said that the new law does not resemble the Massachusetts health care plan and did not support it  Some Republicans  for example Charles Grassley 52   as well as the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation previously supported an individual mandate  but no longer do  53  The same is true of the concept of the insurance exchanges which the bill sets up  which some Republicans and the Heritage Foundation once supported  54  Betsy McCaughey  a health care analyst who came to political prominence after she helped defeat the Clinton health care plan of 1993  55   got the ball rolling  in July and August 2009 when she called the bill  a vicious assault on elderly people  that will  cut your life short   McCaughey was joined in spreading the idea by other pundits and conservative media that had had helped defeat the Clinton era legislation  including The Washington Times and The American Spectator  56  57  According to The New York Times  McCaughey also falsely claimed that presidential advisor Dr  Ezekiel Emanuel thought that the disabled should not be entitled to medical care  which helped inspire Palin s warnings about  death panels   58  Both McCaughey and Palin s remarks about what Palin called an alleged  death panel  were based on opinions about Ezekiel Emanuel 59  60  61  62  63  and previous page 425 legislation  61  62  64  65  Emanuel is an opponent of legalization of doctor assisted suicide or euthanasia  FactCheck org said   We agree that Emanuel s meaning is being twisted  In one article  he was talking about a philosophical trend  and in another  he was writing about how to make the most ethical choices when forced to choose which patients get organ transplants or vaccines when supplies are limited   58  An article on Time com said that Emanuel  was only addressing extreme cases like organ donation  where there is an absolute scarcity of resources      My quotes were just being taken out of context    66  Regarding page 425 of a health care bill  Congressman Earl Blumenauer  who sponsored the legislation  said the measure would block funds for counseling that presents suicide or assisted suicide as an option  and called references to death panels or euthanasia  mind numbing   citation needed  Page 425 of this legislation is similar to end of life counseling that became law when George W  Bush was president  67  A lot of the political debate centered on the prevention of the Federal funding of abortion with some groups claiming that abortion would become easier or would be financed by the government  In the legislation that was finally passed the existing law preserved the principle of no federal funding for abortion  except in cases of rape  incest  or to preserve the life of the mother   68  The law requires people to pay for that element of coverage with a separate check to create a specific fund which is not subsidized and which is used to fund these services  State insurance commissioners are charged with policing this  segregation of funds   Whether insurers in the exchanges can offer abortion coverage at all was left as a matter for individual States to decide  The default is that insurers will be allowed to offer abortion coverage as they do now unless a State passes legislation to the contrary   edit  Lobbying According to Obama  America s health insurance industry has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to block the introduction of public medical insurance and stall other proposed legislation  69  There are six registered health care lobbyists for every member of Congress  70  The campaign against health care reform has been waged in part through substantial donations to key politicians  The single largest recipient of health industry political donations and chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance that drafted Senate health care legislation is Senator Max Baucus  D MT   71  A single health insurance company  Aetna  has contributed more than  110 000 to one legislator  Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT   in 2009  72  America s Health Insurance Plans  a lobby group funded by American private health insurance companies published its plans for health care reform in December 2008  73  The key elements called for co ordinated national strategy for health care with insurance regulation set in a national framework but enforced by the states  73  It also called for a personal health care mandate requiring every American to have health insurance or face penalties  This  it said  was a necessary pre requisite for guaranteed issue policies to prevent insurers from having to pre screen applicants and set limits on coverage for pre existing conditions  otherwise healthy people would put off buying insurance until they get sick  73  It also called for the establishment of body to reform the payment system  including a shift from fee for service to fee for quality outcomes   and a body to undertake Comparative effectiveness research because it admitted that the current system was not effective at providing value for money or even best practice and computerization and standardization of health care records and claims processing  73  Most of the issues which AHIP called for in its plans have been implemented by the Obama administration and Congress in the reform process with the exception of a completely national framework for health care insurance regulation  Though the bill does place certain national rules for insurance to qualify as being  coverage  acceptable within the meaning of the individual mandate  states have retained the power under the reforms to regulate the industry and this was not put in a national framework   edit  Possible future reforms The Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act 2010 contained provisions which allows the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  to undertake pilot projects which  if they are successful could be implemented in future   edit  Universal health care An analysis of the United States National Health Care Act by Physicians for a National Health Program who estimated the savings at  350 billion per year  See also  Universal health care United States The universal health care proposal pending when   in Congress is called the United States National Health Care Act  H R  676  formerly the  Medicare for All Act    The Congressional Budget Office and related government agencies scored the cost of a universal health care system several times since 1991  and have uniformly predicted cost savings  74  probably because of the 40  cost savings associated with universal preventative care 75  and elimination of insurance company overhead costs  76   edit  Balancing doctor supply and demand The Medicare Graduate Medical Education program regulates the supply of medical doctors in the U S  By adjusting the reimbursement rates to establish more income equality among the medical professions  the effective cost of medical care can be lowered   edit  Bundled payments A key project is one that could radically change the way the medical profession is paid for services under Medicare and Medicaid  The current system  which is also the prime system used by medical insurers is known as fee for service because the medical practitioner is paid only for the performance of medical procedures which  it is argued means that doctors have a financial incentive to do more tests  which generates more income  which may not be in the patients  best long term interest  The current system encourages medical interventions such as surgeries and prescribed medicines  all of which carry some risk for the patient but increase revenues for the medical care industry  and does not reward other activities such as encouraging behavioral changes such as modifying dietary habits and quitting smoking  or follow ups regarding prescribed regimes which could have better outcomes for the patient at a lower cost  The current fee for service system also rewards bad hospitals for bad service  Some who   have noted that the best hospitals have fewer re admission rates than others  which benefits patients  but some of the worst hospitals have high re admission rates which is bad for patients but is perversely rewarded under the fee for service system  Projects at CMS are examining the possibility of rewarding health care providers through a process known as  bundled payments  77  by which local doctors and hospitals in an area would be paid not on a fee for service basis but on a capitation system linked to outcomes  The areas with the best outcomes would get more  This system  it is argued  makes medical practitioners much more concerned to focus on activities that deliver real health benefits at a lower cost to the system by removing the perversities inherent in the fee for service system  Though aimed as a model for health care funded by CMS  if the project is successful it is thought that the model could be followed by the commercial health insurance industry also   edit  2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act details Main articles  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 Key provisions of the health care

Bureau of Old Age and Survivors Insurance in the Social Security Administration had defined the major obstacle to financing health insurance for the elderly several years earlier  the high cost of care for the aged and the generally low incomes of retired people  Because retired older people use much more medical care than younger  employed people  an insurance premium related to the risk for older people needed to be high  but if the high premium had to be paid after retirement  when incomes are low  it was an almost impossible burden for the average person  The only feasible approach  he said  was to finance health insurance in the same way as cash benefits for retirement  by contributions paid while at work  when the payments are least burdensome  with the protection furnished in retirement without further payment     An employee s guide to health benefits under COBRA   The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986   Washington  D C   Employee Benefits Security
