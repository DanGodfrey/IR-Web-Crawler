Colombia  officially the Republic of Colombia  Spanish  Rep blica de Colombia   is a unitary constitutional republic comprising thirty two departments  The country is located in northwestern South America  bordered to the northwest by Panama  to the north by the Caribbean Sea  to the east by Venezuela 8  and Brazil  9  to the south by Ecuador and Peru  10  and to the west by the Pacific Ocean  Colombia has maritime borders with Ecuador  Panama  Venezuela  Jamaica  Haiti  the Dominican Republic  Honduras  Nicaragua and Costa Rica  11  12  Colombia is the 26th largest country by area and the fourth largest in South America after Brazil  Argentina and Peru  With over 46 million people  Colombia is the 27th largest country in the world by population and has the second largest population of any Spanish speaking country in the world  after Mexico  It is also the only country in South America having coasts in the Pacific Ocean and in the Atlantic Ocean  Colombia is a middle power  with the fourth largest economy in Latin America  and the third largest in South America  Colombia is famous for the production of coffee  flowers  emeralds  coal and oil  all of these part of the primary sector of economy  The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples including the Muisca  Quimbaya  and Tairona  The Spanish arrived in 1499 and initiated a period of conquest and colonization ultimately creating the Viceroyalty of New Granada  comprising modern day Colombia  Venezuela  Ecuador  north western Brazil and Panama   with its capital at Bogot   13  Independence from Spain was won in 1819  but by 1830  Gran Colombia  had collapsed with the secession of Venezuela and Ecuador  What is now Colombia and Panama emerged as the Republic of New Granada  The new nation experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation  1858   and then the United States of Colombia  1863   before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886  2 Panama seceded in 1903  Colombia was the first constitutional government in South America  and an important promoter of the Pan American organizations  initially through the Congress of Panama and later  during the 20th Century as founder of the Organization of American States  The Liberal and Conservative parties  founded in 1848 and 1849  are two of the oldest surviving political parties in the Americas  Colombia is very ethnically diverse  and the interaction between descendants of the original native inhabitants  Spanish colonists  Africans brought as slaves and twentieth century immigrants from Europe and the Middle East has produced a rich cultural heritage  14  This has also been influenced by Colombia s varied geography  The majority of the urban centres are located in the highlands of the Andes mountains  but Colombian territory also encompasses Amazon rainforest  tropical grassland and both Caribbean and Pacific coastlines  Ecologically  Colombia is one of the world s 17 megadiverse countries  and is considered the most megadiverse per square kilometer  15  16  Tensions between political parties have frequently erupted into violence  most notably in the Thousand Days War  1899 1902  and La Violencia  beginning in 1948  Since the 1960s  government forces  left wing insurgents and right wing paramilitaries have been engaged in the continent s longest running armed conflict  17  Fueled by the cocaine trade  this escalated dramatically in the 1980s  Since 2000 the violence has decreased significantly  with many paramilitary groups demobilising as part of a controversial peace process and the guerrillas losing control of much of the territory they once dominated  2  Meanwhile Colombia s homicide rate almost halved between 2002 and 2006  18  As of 2011 Colombia remains the world s largest producer of cocaine  19  although production has been falling  20  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2 1 Prehistory 2 2 Pre Columbian 2 3 Spanish discovery  1499

Italian is  Cristoforo Colombo   Spanish   Crist bal Col n    It was conceived by the Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda as a reference to all the New World  but especially to those under the Spanish and Portuguese rule  The name was later adopted by the Republic of Colombia of 1819  formed out of the territories of the old Viceroyalty of New Granada  modern day Colombia  Panama  Venezuela and Ecuador   21  In 1835  when Venezuela and Ecuador broke away  the Cundinamarca region that remained became a new country   the Republic of New Granada  In 1858 New Granada officially changed its name to the Granadine Confederation  then in 1863 the United States of Colombia  before finally adopting its present name   the Republic of Colombia   in 1886  21  To refer to the country  the Colombian government uses the terms Colombia and Rep blica de Colombia   edit  History Main articles  History of Colombia and Timeline of Colombian history Poporo from Quimbaya peoples in the Gold Museum  Bogot   edit  Prehistory Due to its geographical location the present territory of Colombia was a corridor of populations between Mesoamerica  the Caribbean  the Andes and the Amazon  The oldest archaeological finds were found at sites of Mons  and Pubenza and dating from about 20 000 years B  C  Other vestiges realize that there were also early occupation in regions like El Abra between Tocancip   Zipaquir  and Tequendama in Cundinamarca  These sites correspond to the Paleoindian period  In Puerto Hormiga has been found traces of the archaic period  including the oldest pottery found in America  dating from about 3 000 BC   edit  Pre Columbian Approximately 10 000 BC  the territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous people including the Muisca  Quimbaya  and Tairona  Hunter gatherer societies existed near present day Bogot   at  El Abra  and  Tequendama   which traded with one another and with cultures living in the Magdalena River Valley  22  Beginning in the first millennium BC  groups of Amerindians developed the political system of  cacicazgos  with a pyramidal structure of power headed by caciques  The Muiscas inhabited the area of what is now the Departments of Boyac  and Cundinamarca high plateau mainly  Altiplano Cundiboyacense   They farmed maize  potato  quinoa and cotton  among others  Skilled in goldsmiths  bartered emeralds  blankets  ceramic handicrafts  coca and salt actively trading these with neighboring nations  The Taironas inhabited in northern Colombia in the Andes isolated mountain range of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta  23   edit  Spanish discovery  1499   1525  Attack on Cartagena de Indias Spanish explorers made the first exploration of the Caribbean littoral in 1499 led by Rodrigo de Bastidas  Christopher Columbus navigated near the Caribbean in 1502  In 1508  Vasco N  ez de Balboa started the conquest of the territory through the region of Urab   In 1513  he was the first European to discover the Pacific Ocean  which he called Mar del Sur  or  Sea of the South   and which in fact would bring the Spaniards to Peru and Chile  Alonso de Lugo  who had sailed with Columbus  reached the Guajira Peninsula in 1500  Santa Marta was founded in 1525  and Cartagena in 1533  Gonzalo Jim nez de Quesada led an expedition to the interior in 1535  and founded the  New City of Granada   the name soon changed to  Santa F    Two other notable journeys by Spaniards to the interior took place in the same period  Sebastian de Belalcazar  conqueror of Quito  traveled north and founded Cali in 1536 and Popay n in 1537  Nicolas Federman crossed the Llanos Orientales and went over the Eastern Cordillera  24  The Caribbean people  indigenous to Colombia  suffered a reduction in population due to conquest and ethnic cleansing by the Spanish as well as diseases such as smallpox  of which they had no immunity to  25  In the 16th century  Europeans began to bring slaves from Africa   edit  Colonial times  1525   1808  The Spanish settled along the north coast of today s Colombia as early as the 1500s  but their first permanent settlement  at Santa Marta  was not established until 1525  In 1549  the institution of the Audiencia in Santa Fe de Bogot  gave that city the status of capital of New Granada  which comprised in large part what is now territory of Colombia  With the risk that the land was deserted  the Spanish Crown sold properties to the governors  conquerors and their descendants creating large farms and possession of mines  Black slaves were introduced as labor  Also to protect the indigenous population decimated  and Indian reservations were created  The repopulation was achieved by allowing colonization by farmers and their families who came from Spain  With this began the colonial period  New Granada was ruled by the Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogota  but important decisions were taken to the colony from Spain by the Council of the Indies  A royal decree of 1713 approved the legality of Palenque de San Basilio founded by runaway slaves from the fifteenth century  slaves had fled and sought refuge in the jungles of the Caribbean coast  The Spanish forces could not tolerate them and ended up submitting  thereby giving rise to the first free place in the Americas  It was their principal leader Benkos Bioh   born in the region Bioho  Guinea Bissau  West Africa  Palenque de San Basilio was declared in 2005 as a  Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity  by UNESCO  26  In 1717 the Viceroyalty of New Granada was originally created  and then it was temporarily removed  to finally be reestablished in 1739  The Viceroyalty had Santa F  de Bogot  as its capital  This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America which had previously been under the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalties of New Spain or Peru and correspond mainly to today s Venezuela  Ecuador and Panama  So  Bogot  became one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World  along with Lima and Mexico City  though it remained somewhat backward compared to those two cities in several economic and logistical ways  During the eighteenth century noted the figure of the priest  botanist and mathematician Jos  Celestino Mutis  1732 1808   delegated by the viceroy Antonio Caballero y G ngora to conduct an inventory of the nature of the New Granada  which became known as the Botanical Expedition which classified plants  wildlife and founded the first astronomical observatory in the city of Santa Fe de Bogot   On August 15  1801 the Prussian scientist Alexander von Humboldt reaches Fontib n where he joins Mutis in New Granada expedition to Quito   edit  Independence from Spain  1808   1824  Main article  Colombian Declaration of Independence Francisco de Paula Santander  Sim n Bolivar and other heroes of the Independence of Colombia in the Congress of C cuta  Since the beginning of the periods of conquest and colonization  there were several rebel movements under Spanish rule  most of them were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation  The last one which sought outright independence from Spain sprang up around 1810  following the independence of St  Domingue  present day Haiti  in 1804  which provided a non negligible degree of support to the eventual leaders of this rebellion  Sim n Bol var and Francisco de Paula Santander  A movement initiated by Antonio Nari o  who opposed Spanish centralism and led the opposition against the viceroyalty  led to the independence of Cartagena in November 1811  and the formation of two independent governments which fought a civil war   a period known as La Patria Boba  The following year Nari o proclaimed the United Provinces of New Granada  headed by Camilo Torres Tenorio  Despite the successes of the rebellion  the emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the liberators  federalism and centralism  gave rise to an internal clash which contributed to the reconquest of territory by the Spanish  The viceroyalty was restored under the command of Juan de Samano  whose regime punished those who participated in the uprisings  The retribution stoked renewed rebellion  which  combined with a weakened Spain  made possible a successful rebellion led by the Venezuelan born Sim n Bol var  who finally proclaimed independence in 1819  The pro Spanish resistance was finally defeated in 1822 in the present territory of Colombia and in 1823 in Venezuela  The Gran Colombia The territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada became the Republic of Colombia organized as a union of Ecuador  Colombia and Venezuela  Panama was then an integral part of Colombia   The Congress of Cucuta in 1821 adopted a constitution for the new Republic  Sim n Bol var became the first President of Colombia  and Francisco de Paula Santander was made Vice President  However  the new republic was very unstable and ended with the rupture of Venezuela in 1829  followed by Ecuador in 1830   edit  Post independence and republicanism  1824   1930  Colombia was the first constitutional government in South America  and the Liberal and Conservative parties  founded in 1848 and 1849 respectively  are two of the oldest surviving political parties in the Americas  Internal political and territorial divisions led to the secession of Venezuela and Quito  today s Ecuador  in 1830  The so called  Department of Cundinamarca  adopted the name  Nueva Granada   which it kept until 1856 when it became the  Confederaci n Granadina   Granadine Confederation   After a two year civil war in 1863  the  United States of Colombia  was created  lasting until 1886  when the country finally became known as the Republic of Colombia  Internal divisions remained between the bipartisan political forces  occasionally igniting very bloody civil wars  the most significant being the Thousand Days  War  1899 1902   This  together with the United States of America s intentions to influence the area  especially the Panama Canal construction and control  led to the separation of the Department of Panama in 1903 and the establishment of it as a nation  The United States paid Colombia  25 000 000 in 1921  seven years after completion of the canal  for redress of President Roosevelt s role in the creation of Panama  and Colombia recognized Panama under the terms of the Thomson Urrutia Treaty  Colombia was engulfed in the Year Long War with Peru over a territorial dispute involving the Amazonas Department and its capital Leticia   edit  The Violence and the National Front  1930   1974  Soon after  Colombia achieved a relative degree of political stability  which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late 1940s and the early 1950s  a period known as La Violencia   The Violence    Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties  which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the Liberal presidential candidate Jorge Eli cer Gait n on 9 April 1948  The ensuing riots in Bogot   known as El Bogotazo  spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least 180 000 Colombians  27  From 1953 to 1964 the violence between the two political parties decreased first when Gustavo Rojas deposed the President of Colombia in a coup d  tat and negotiated with the Guerrillas  and then under the military junta of General Gabriel Par s Gordillo  After Rojas  deposition  the Colombian Conservative Party and Colombian Liberal Party agreed to the create the  National Front   a coalition which would jointly govern the country  Under the deal  the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years  the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices  The National Front ended  La Violencia   and National Front administrations attempted to institute far reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress  In the end  the contradictions between each successive Liberal and Conservative administration made the results decidedly mixed  Despite the progress in certain sectors  many social and political problems continued  and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the FARC  ELN and M 19 to fight the government and political apparatus   edit  The Medell n and Cali cartels Emerging in the late 1970s  powerful and violent drug cartels further developed during the 1980s and 1990s  The Medell n Cartel under Pablo Escobar and the Cali Cartel  in particular  exerted political  economic and social influence in Colombia during this period  These cartels also financed and influenced different illegal armed groups throughout the political spectrum  Some enemies of these allied with the guerrillas and created or influenced paramilitary groups   edit  Constitution of 1991 The new Colombian Constitution of 1991  ratified after being drafted by the Constituent Assembly of Colombia  included key provisions on political  ethnic  human and gender rights  The new constitution initially prohibited the extradition of Colombian nationals  causing accusations that drug cartels had successfully lobbied for the provision  extradition resumed in 1996 after the provision was repealed  The cartels had previously promoted a violent campaign against extradition  leading to many terrorist attacks and mafia style executions  They also tried to influence the government and political structure of Colombia through corruption  as in the case of the 8000 Process scandal  Since the promulgation of the Constitution of 1991 and the reforms made  the country has continued to be plagued by the effects of the drug trade  guerrilla insurgencies like FARC  and paramilitary groups such as the AUC  which along with other minor factions have engaged in a bloody internal armed conflict  President Andr s Pastrana and the FARC attempted to negotiate a solution to the conflict between 1999 and 2002  The government set up a  demilitarized  zone  but repeated tensions and crises led the Pastrana administration to conclude that the negotiations were ineffectual  Pastrana also began to implement the Plan Colombia initiative  with the dual goal of ending the armed conflict and promoting a strong anti narcotic strategy   edit  Colombian armed conflict  2002   present Main article  Colombian armed conflict During the presidency of  lvaro Uribe  the government applied more military pressure on the FARC and other outlawed groups  After the offensive  supported by aid from the United States  many security indicators improved  Reported kidnappings showed a steep decrease  from 3 700 in 2000 to 172 in 2009  Jan  Oct    as did intentional homicides  from 28 837 in 2002 to 15 817 in 2009  according to police  while the health system reported a decline from 28 534 to 17 717 during the same period   The rate of abductions declined steadily for almost a decade until 2010  when 280 cases were reported between January and October  most concentrated in the Medell n area  28  29  30  31  While rural areas and jungles remained dangerous  the overall reduction of violence led to the growth of internal travel and tourism  32  According to official statistics from the Colombian Army the FARC EP had a total of 18 000 members as of December 2010  with 9 000 of them being regular guerrillas and the rest armed militia members operating in civilian clothing in cities and villages  33  Independent researchers speaking to Time Magazine claimed that the FARC EP have 30 000 such militia members in 2011  indicating a shift in rebel strategy  34  The FARC s commander in chief Alfonso Cano was killed by security forces in November 2011  35  He was replaced by Timole n Jim nez  who assumed the duty of first commander just days after Cano s death  Jim nez is thought to move in the mountain corridor covering the Cesar Department  Norte de Santander and the Bol var Department  36  The smaller rebel group Ej rcito de Liberaci n Nacional is estimated to have between 2900 and 5000 members as of 2010  37  After the demobilization of the right wing paramilitary group Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia the country has seen the rise of a number of neo paramilitary groups such as Los Rastrojos and Los Urabe os  who have been accused of widespread murder  drug trafficking and Land grabbing  38  See also  List of attacks attributed to FARC  edit  Inequity problems Colombia has the fourth largest economy in Latin America  but income and wealth are unevenly distributed  39  40  Only 13 8  of total income is allocated to the poorest half of the population  while the wealthiest 10  of the population benefit from 46 5   Colombia bears the most uneven distribution of wealth in all of Latin America and such a wide income gap between the rich and poor compounds the country s poverty issues  41  Inequity regarding land ownership has also been a long existing problem in Colombia  prompting the formation of left wing guerrilla groups during the 1950s and 1960s  As counteraction  adversaries backed by powerful landowners established rightwing paramilitary organizations  Internal contention intensified by civil war in the 1980s  which was chiefly provoked by the cocaine trade  Although the state of conflict has calmed tremendously in recent years  Colombia still has over 3 2 million internally displaced individuals a figure so high that it falls only second to that of Sudan  42  Inadequacies in land allocation have failed to diminish in recent years  further contributing to Colombia s health  income and societal inequity struggles  41  Inadequacies in land allocation have failed to diminish in recent years  further contributing to Colombia s health  income and societal inequity struggles  SW   Inequitable land ownership is more problematic in rural areas of the country  Statistics indicate that less than one percent of landowners own 61  of rural territory  The lack of fair land availability prevents local farmers from cultivating useable terrain for agricultural purposes  hindering income distribution and further exacerbating the poverty gap  Poverty inflicts rural areas in greater magnitude than that of urban areas  While 39  percent of the urban population is considered poor  62  of the rural population is considered poor with an additional 22  considered extremely poor  43  The National Administrative Department of Statistics  DANE   classifies poverty by those earning a monthly income of less than 281 384 Col pesos  143 USD  and extreme poverty those earning less than 120 588 Col Pesos  61 USD   44  In 1990  the income ratio between the richest and poorest 10  was 40 to one  climbing to 80 to one in 2000  45  In 2009  Colombia had a Gini coefficient of 0 587  one of the highest in Latin America  46  with 46  of Colombians living below the poverty line and 17  in  extreme poverty   47  48  49  The Colombian government has since claimed to establish a state funded program aiming to bring at least one million families out from extreme poverty status  44   edit  Recent developments Colombia shows modest progress in the struggle to defend human rights  as expressed by HRW  50  Between 2008 and 2011 a total of 175 worker s union members were murdered in Colombia  according to HRW  51  In terms of international relations  Colombia has moved from a period of tense animosity with Venezuela  towards a prosperous outlook to further enhance integration  Colombia has also won a seat on the Security Council of the UN  52  The world s second biggest bank HSBC has created a perspective on the economic outlook in 2050 where Colombia is seen playing a decisive role in the global economy  especially in the Americas as the number 25 in the world

Colombia Chicamocha canyon in the Department of Santander  The geography of Colombia is characterized by containing five main natural regions that present their own unique characteristics  from the Andes mountain range region shared with Ecuador and Venezuela  the Pacific Ocean coastal region shared with Panama and Ecuador  the Caribbean Sea coastal region shared with Venezuela and Panama  the Llanos  plains  shared with Venezuela  to the Amazon Rainforest region shared with Venezuela  Brazil  Peru and Ecuador  Colombia is the only South American country which borders both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans  Colombia is bordered to the east by Venezuela and Brazil  to the south by Ecuador and Peru  to the north by Panama and the Caribbean Sea  and to the west by Ecuador and the Pacific Ocean  Including its Caribbean islands  it lies between latitudes 14 N and 5 S  and longitudes 66  and 82 W Part of the Ring of Fire  a region of the world subject to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions  Colombia is dominated by the Andes mountains  which contain the majority of the country s urban centres   Beyond the Colombian Massif  in the south western departments of Cauca and Nari o  these are divided into three branches known as cordilleras  mountain ranges   the Cordillera Occidental  running adjacent to the Pacific coast and including the city of Cali  the Cordillera Central  running between the Cauca and Magdalena river valleys  to the west and east respectively  and including the cities of Medell n  Manizales  Pereira and Armenia  and the Cordillera Oriental  extending north east to the Guajira Peninsula and including Bogot   Bucaramanga and C cuta  Peaks in the Cordillera Occidental exceed 13 000 ft  3 962 m   and in the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Oriental they reach 18 000 ft  5 486 m   54  At 8 500 ft  2 591 m   Bogot  is the highest city of its size in the world  East of the Andes lies the savanna of the Llanos  part of the Orinoco River basin  and  in the far south east  the jungle of the Amazon rainforest  Together these lowlands comprise over half Colombia s territory  but they contain less than 3  of the population  To the north the Caribbean coast  home to 20  of the population and the location of the major port cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena  generally consists of low lying plains  but it also contains the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range  which includes the country s tallest peaks  Pico Crist bal Col n and Pico Sim n Bol var   and the Guajira Desert  By contrast the narrow and discontinuous Pacific coastal lowlands  backed by the Serran a de Baud  mountains  are sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation  The principal Pacific port is Buenaventura  Colombian territory also includes a number of Caribbean and Pacific islands  This is considered by some as a sixth region  comprising those areas outside continental Colombia  including the department of San Andr s y Providencia in the Caribbean Sea and the islands of Malpelo and Gorgona in the Pacific Ocean  However  cultural ties are with the respective coastlines  In this region Colombia has a lot of stable sand banks of considerable size  considered suitable for the development of artificial islands   edit  Climate Main article  Climate of Colombia The Atrato River  The striking variety in temperature and precipitation results principally from differences in elevation  Temperatures range from very hot at sea level to relatively cold at higher elevations but vary little with the season  At Bogot   for example  the average annual temperature is 15  C  59  F   and the difference between the average of the coldest and the warmest months is less than 1 C  1 8 F   More significant  however  is the daily variation in temperature  from 5  C  41  F  at night to 17  C  62 6  F  during the day  Colombians customarily describe their country in terms of the climatic zones  the area under 900 meters  2 953 ft  in elevation is called the hot zone  tierra caliente   elevations between 900 and 1 980 meters  2 953 and 6 496 ft  are the temperate zone  tierra templada   and elevations from 1 980 meters  6 496 ft  to about 3 500 meters  11 483 ft  constitute the cold zone  tierra fr a   The upper limit of the cold zone marks the tree line and the approximate limit of human habitation  The treeless regions adjacent to the cold zone and extending to approximately 4 500 meters  14 764 ft  are high  bleak areas  usually referred to as the p ramos   above which begins the area of permanent snow  nevado   A cumulonimbus cloud settles over Colombia in November 2010  Image taken from the International Space Station About 86  of the country s total area lies in the hot zone  Included in the hot zone and interrupting the temperate area of the Andean highlands are the long and narrow extension of the Magdalena Valley and a small extension in the Cauca Valley  Temperatures  depending on elevation  vary between 24 and 38  C  75 2 and 100 4  F   and there are alternating dry and wet seasons corresponding to summer and winter  respectively  Breezes on the Caribbean coast  however  reduce both heat and precipitation  The cold or cool zone constitutes about 6  of the total area  including some of the most densely populated plateaus and terraces of the Colombian Andes  this zone supports about onefourth of the country s total population  The mean temperature ranges between 10 and 19  C  50 and 66 2  F   and the wet seasons occur in April and May and from September to December  as in the

challenges faced by Colombians are caused by both natural and human factors  Many natural hazards result from the geological instability related to Colombia s position along the Pacific Ring of Fire  Colombia has 15 major volcanoes  the eruptions of which have on occasion resulted in substantial loss of life  such as at Armero in 1985  Geological faults that have caused numerous devastating earthquakes  such as the 1999 Armenia earthquake  Heavy floods both in mountainous areas and in low lying watersheds and coastal regions regularly cause deaths and considerable damage to property during the rainy seasons  Rainfall intensities vary with the El Ni o Southern Oscillation which occurs in unpredictable cycles  at times causing especially severe flooding  Human induced deforestation has started to creep into the rainforests of Amazonia and the Pacific coast and has substantially changed the Andean landscape  Deforestation is also linked to the conversion of lowland tropical forests to oil palm plantations  However  compared to neighbouring countries rates of deforestation in Colombia are still relatively low  57  In urban areas  contamination of the local environment has been caused by human produced waste  and the use of fossil fuels  Participants in the country s armed conflict have also contributed to the pollution of the environment  Illegal armed groups have deforested large areas of land to plant illegal crops  with an estimated 99 000 hectares used for the cultivation of coca in 2007  58  while in response the government has fumigated these crops using hazardous chemicals  Insurgents have also destroyed oil pipelines creating major ecological disasters citation needed   Demand from rapidly expanding cities has placed increasing stress on the water supply as watersheds are affected and ground water tables fall  Nonetheless  Colombia is the fourth country in the world by magnitude of total freshwater supply  and still has large reserves of

National Capitol  For over a century Colombian politics were monopolized by the Liberal Party  founded in 1848 on an anti clerical  broadly economically liberal and federalist platform   and the Conservative Party  founded in 1849 espousing Catholicism  protectionism  and centralism   This culminated in the formation of the National Front  1958 1974   which formalized arrangements for an alternation of power between the two parties and excluded non establishment alternatives  thereby fueling the nascent armed conflict   By the time of the dissolution of the National Front  traditional political alignments had begun to fragment  This process has continued since  and the consequences of this are exemplified by the results of the 2006 presidential election which was won with 62  of

elections held earlier that year the two traditional parties secured only 93 out of 268 seats available  Despite a number of controversies  most notably the ongoing parapolitics scandal  dramatic improvements in security and continued strong economic performance have ensured that former President Uribe remained popular among Colombian people  with his approval rating peaking at 85   according

health plans to which employers also contribute  Although this new system has widened population coverage by the social and health security system from 21 percent  pre 1993  to 56 percent in 2004 and 66 percent in 2005  health disparities persist  with the poor continuing to suffer relatively high mortality rates  In 2002 Colombia had 58 761 physicians  23 950 nurses  and 33 951 dentists  these numbers equated to 1 35 physicians  0 55 nurses  and 0 78 dentists per 1 000 population  respectively  In 2005 Colombia was reported to have only 1 1 physicians per 1 000 population  as compared with a Latin American average of 1 5  The health sector reportedly is plagued by rampant corruption  including misallocation of funds and evasion of health fund contributions  102   edit  Education Main article  Education in Colombia National University of Colombia in Bogot   The educational experience of many Colombian children begins with attendance at a preschool academy until age 5  Educaci n preescolar   Basic education  Educaci n b sica  is compulsory by law  103  It has two stages  Primary basic education  Educaci n b sica primaria  which goes from first to fifth grade   children from 6 to 10 years old  and Secondary basic education  Educaci n b sica secundaria   which goes from sixth to ninth grade  Basic education is followed by Middle vocational education  Educaci n media vocacional  that comprises the tenth and eleventh grades  It may have different vocational training modalities or specialties  academic  technical  business  and so on   according to the curriculum adopted by each school  However  in many rural areas  teachers are poorly qualified  and only the five years  of primary schooling are offered  The school year can extend from February to November or from August to June  in many public schools attendance is split into morning and afternoon sessions to accommodate the large numbers of children  104  After the successful completion of all the basic and middle education years  a high school diploma is awarded  The high school graduate is known as a bachiller  because secondary basic school and middle education are traditionally considered together as a unit called bachillerato  6th to 11th grade   Students in their final year of middle education take the ICFES test in order to gain access to higher education  Educaci n superior   This higher education includes undergraduate professional studies  technical  technological and intermediate professional education  and post graduate studies  Bachilleres  high school graduates  may enter into a professional undergraduate career program offered by a university  these programs last up to 5 years  or less for technical  technological and intermediate professional education  and post graduate studies   even up to 6 7 years for some careers  such as medicine  In Colombia  there is not an institution such as college  students go directly into a career program at a university or any other educational institution to obtain a professional  technical or technological title  Once graduated from the university  people are granted a  professional  technical or technological  diploma and licensed  if required  to practice the career they have chosen  For some professional career programs  students are required to take the SABER PRO test  also known as ECAES  in their final year of undergraduate academic education  105  Public spending on education as a proportion of gross domestic product in 2006 was 4 7    one of the highest rates in Latin America   as compared with 2 4  in 1991  This represented 14 2  of total government expenditure  66  106  In 2006  the primary and secondary net enrollment rates stood at 88  and 65  respectively  slightly below the regional average  School life expectancy was 12 4 years  106  A total of 92 3  of the population aged 15 and older were recorded as literate  including 97 9  of those aged 15 24  both figures slightly higher than the regional average  106  However  literacy levels are considerably lower in rural areas  107  The University of the Nation  is the most relevant High Education and Research institution of the country  which has served as the alma mater of most of its citizens since 1867   edit  Culture Main article  Culture of Colombia See also  Festivals in Colombia and Music of Colombia Colombia lies at the crossroads of Latin America and the broader American continent  and as such has been hit by a wide range of cultural influences  Native American  Spanish and other European  African  American  Caribbean  and Middle Eastern influences  as well as other Latin American cultural influences  are all present in Colombia s modern culture  Urban migration  industrialization  globalization  and other political  social and economic changes have also left an impression  Historically  the country s imposing landscape left its various regions largely isolated from one another  resulting in the development of very strong regional identities  in many cases stronger than the national  Modern transport links and means of communication have mitigated this and done much to foster a sense of nationhood  but social and political instability  and in particular fear of armed groups and bandits on intercity highways  have contributed to the maintenance of very clear regional differences

traditions and aim to represent what Colombia  and the Colombian people  have in common  Cultural expressions in Colombia are promoted by the government through the Ministry of Culture   edit  Popular culture Main article  Colombia in popular culture The depiction of Colombia in popular culture  especially the portrayal of Colombian people in film and fiction  has been asserted by Colombian organizations 108  109  110  and government to be largely negative and has raised concerns that it reinforces  or even engenders  stereotypes  societal prejudice and discrimination due to association
